40|$|Les peuplements d'Ephémèroptères, de Plécoptères et de Trichoptères de quatorze cours d'eau du massif vosgien granitique, ont été échantillonnés de mars 1988 à mars 1990. Les stations, au nombre de seize, ont été choisies {{en amont}} de toute agglomération et en dehors de zones d'activité agricole. Les mesures de pH, conductivité et {{aluminium}} total, ont établi que sept ruisseaux sont acides (pH moyens : 4, 67 - 5, 62), très faiblement minéralisés (conductivités moyennes : 17 - 21, 5 µS/cm) et présentent des concentrations moyennes <b>en</b> <b>aluminium</b> total, comprises entre 221 et 387 µg/l. Les sept autres cours d'eau sont faiblement acides à neutres (pH moyens : 6, 80 - 6, 98), peu minéralisés (conductivité moyenne : 36 - 90 µS/cm) et montrent des concentrations moyennes eut aluminium variant de 41 à 78 µg/l. Seules 29 espèces ont été récoltées dans les ruisseaux acides alors que 93 l'ont été dans les cours d'eau non acides. Les Ephémèroptères se révèlent les plus sensibles aux conditions acides et disparaissent totalement. Parmi les Trichoptères, seuls les Polycentropodidae, les Rhyacophilidae et les Limnephilidae sont encore présents dans les ruisseaux acides. Alors que les Plécoptères Filipalpes sont bien représentés, certaines espèces étant même très abondantes, les Plécoptères Sétipalpes ne sont plus récoltés dans les cours d'eau acidifiés, à l'exception de Siphonoperla torrentium. Acidification of freshwaters {{has become a}} serious problem {{in certain parts of}} the Vosges Mountains (Northeastern France). Aquatic organisms at all major levels are affected by decreased pH. As the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoplera are a significant par of the macrobenthos in mountain streams, the objective of this preliminary study was to determine how the physico-chemical environment in acidified running waters affects the qualitative composition of mayflies, stoneflies and caddis-flies communities compared with non acidified streams and to evaluate the reliability and possible use of the taxonomic groups as indicators of the extent of acidification. A biological survey of fourteen streams was conducted in the Vosges mountains from March 1988 to March 1990. The areas investigated lie on granitic bed-rock and soils in the process of podzolisation. The sampling sites (sixteen), at altitudes of 600 to 1020 meters a. s. l. were located above built-in and agricultural areas thus avoiding organic pollution. The streams drain forested catchments regarded as sensitive to acid inputs and affected by forest decline. Silver fir (Abies alba), Norway spruce (Pecea abies) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) are dominant. Larvae and pupae of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera were collected by band picking and Surber sampler (mesh aperture 350 µm). Adults were collected with an insert net by beating bushes and trees or sweeping low herbage near streams. A long-handled net was required for high-flying Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera. Organisms were preserved in 5 % formalin or 70 % ethanol. The pH was measured in the field using a specific glass electrode for low ionic solutions, compensated for temperature. Water samples were acidified for total aluminium analysis. Determination of aluminium was performed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with a graphite furnace. Conductivity was measured in the laboratory al 20 °C. Determination of pH revealed that acidification occurred et seven sites (sampling sites n° 8 to 16). Six were strongly acidic (mean pH : 4. 7 - 5. 2) and one moderately acidic (mean pH : 5, 6). In such streams mean total aluminium ranged from 221 µg/ 1 to 387 µg/ 1 and mean conductivity from 17, 0 µS/cm to 21. 5 µS/cm. Minimum pH and maximum aluminium values were recorded during snowmelt or rein event. In all these streams the fish population (Salmo trutta fario) has completely disappeared. Others streams (sampling sites n° 1 to 7) went from slightly acidic to neutral with a range pH between 6. 8 - 7. 0 and were characterized by average total aluminium varying from 41 µg/ 1 to 78 µg/l and average conductivity from 36 µS/cm to 90 µS/cm. These streams have been considered as reference for non acidified running waters. The number of species occurring in acidified streams contrasted markedly with those of the non acidified streams. Specific richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera are reduced in acidic waters. Only twenty-nine species were found in acidic streams, whereas a total of ninety-three species were collected in non acidic streams. EphemeropteraIn the reference streams, the Ephemeroptera fauna was rich and diverse with twenty taxa. Some species, for example Epeorus sylvicola, Baetis alpinus and B. rhodani were very common and widespread. In contrast, in acidic water only one species, Baetis vernus, was actually present (3 larvae). TrichopteraThirty-eight species of caddis flies were found in non acidic streams. Hydropsychidae (hydropsyche sp) Philopotamidae (Philopotamus ludificatus, P. montanus, Wormaldia sp) and Glossosomatidae (Glossosoma conformis, Agapetus sp) were the organisms most commonly present. In acidic streams, eleven species were food. Rhyacopyhilidae (Rhyacophlla obliterata, R. potamoides, R. praemorsa), Polycentropodidae (Plectrocnemia sp, P. conspersa) and Limnephilidae (Drusus annulatus, D. discolor, Caetopterygopsis maclachlani, Chaelopteryx villosa, Anitella sp) were among the most abundant taxa. PlecopteraIn acidic streams, taxonomic richness (17 species) was about 50 % lower than those obtained in the non acidic streams. The common species Perla marginata, Perlodes microcephala and Isoperla oxylepis were not listed when pH was below 5. 6. At the opposit, some species were dominant and very abundant. For example, Brachyptera seticornis, was dominant in April, Leuctra nigra in May, Siphonoperla torrentium in June and Leuctra cingulala in July. The sensitivity of organisms towards to acidification appeared to be different among these groupe of aquatic insects. Three types of responses can be distinguished in relation with pH and/or associated factors :- High sensitivity of Ephemeroptera, which have completely disappeared- High sensitivity of most Trichoptera families except the following : Polycentropodidae, Rhyacophilidae and Limnephilidae. - Tolerance of Plecoptera filipalpia which were sometimes very abundant, but disappearance of Plecoptera Setipalpia except for Siphonoperla torrentium. This analysis showed that many species of mayflies, stoneflies and caddis flies do not tolerate low pH (and/or) associated with low conductivity and elevated aluminium concentrations. Because the biological response is the result of present and post environmental situations, we suggest the use of these taxa as indicators of acidification in running waters, particularly when a restricted number of physico-chemical measurements is insufficient to appreciate the acidification level, as during low flow periods or during periodes of no acid stress. Nevertheless, to be considered as a useful indicator of pollution in general and acidification in particular, a taxa (species, genera or family) should be widespread, relatively abundant, present all the year round, very sensitive to the studied factor and easy or relatively easy to identity. For example, in unpolluted streams in the Vosges Mountains, Epeorus sylvicola, Perlodes microcephala, Hydropsyche sp, Philopotamus sp seem to fit these criteria. However, in evaluating aquatic organisms as indicators of pollutional conditions, great caution is necessary because knowledge of the ecological requirements of the species is essential, several ecologic conditions other than the presence of a pollutant may limit the distribution of certain species. For this reason, the benthic macrofauna of a more significant number of sites of different chemical and physical characteristics should be collected...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} weathering of primary rocks and minerals in natural systems {{has a major}} impact on soil development and its composition. Chemical weathering is driven to a large extent by mineral dissolution. Through mineral dissolution, elements are released into groundwater and can readily react to precipitate secondary minerals such as clays, zeolites, and carbonates. Carbonates form from divalent cations (e. g. Ca, Fe and Mg) and CO 2, and kaolin clay and gibbsite formation is attributed to the weathering of aluminium-rich minerals, most notably the feldspars. The CarbFix Project in Hellisheiði SW-Iceland aims to use natural weathering processes to form carbonate minerals by the re-injection of CO 2 from a geothermal power plant back into surrounding basaltic rocks. This process is driven by the dissolution of basaltic rocks, rich in divalent cations, which can combine with injected CO 2 to form and precipitate carbonates. This thesis focuses on the dissolution behaviour of Stapafell crystalline basalt, which consists of three major phases (plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine) and is rich in divalent cations. Steady-state element release rates from crystalline basalt at far-from-equilibrium conditions were measured at pH from 2 to 11 and temperatures from 5 ° to 75 ° C in mixed-flow reactors. Steady-state Si and Ca release rates exhibit a U-shaped variation with pH, where rates decrease with increasing pH at acid condition but increase with increasing pH at alkaline conditions. Silicon release rates from crystalline basalt are comparable to Si release rates from basaltic glass of the same chemical composition at low pH and temperatures ≥ 25 °C but slower at alkaline pH and temperatures ≥ 50 °C. In contrast, Mg and Fe release rates decrease continuously with increasing pH at all temperatures. This behaviour is interpreted to stem from the contrasting dissolution behaviours of the three major minerals comprising the basalt: plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine. Element release rates estimated from the sum of the volume fraction normalized dissolution rates of plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine are within one order of magnitude of those measured in this study. In addition, these experimental results show that during injection of CO 2 -charged waters with pH close to 3. 6, crystalline basalt preferentially releases Mg and Fe relative to Ca to the fluid phase. The injection of acidic CO 2 -charged fluids into crystalline basaltic rocks may therefore favour the formation of Mg and Fe carbonates rather than calcite at acidic to neutral conditions. Plagioclase is the most abundant phase in crystalline basalts and thus influences strongly its reactivity. Plagioclase dissolution rates based on Si release show a common U-shaped behaviour as a function of pH where rates decrease with increasing pH at acid condition but increase with increasing pH at alkaline conditions. Constant pH plagioclase dissolution rates increase with increasing anorthite content at acid conditions, in agreement with literature findings. Interpretation and data fitting suggests that plagioclase dissolution rates are consistent with their control by the detachment of Si-rich activated complexes formed by the removal of Al from the mineral framework. Most notably, compared with previous assumptions, plagioclase dissolution rates are independent of plagioclase composition at alkaline conditions, e. g. anorthite-rich plagioclase dissolution rates increase with increasing pH at alkaline conditions. At such conditions rapid plagioclase dissolution rates likely dominate divalent metal release from crystalline basalts to the fluids phase due to its high Ca content. Gibbsite is commonly the first mineral formed during low temperature dissolution of plagioclase. Gibbsite is an aluminium-hydroxide that is found in various soils as well as the dominant phase in many bauxite ores. Gibbsite precipitation rates were measured in closed system reactors at alkaline condition, both at 25 °C and 80 °C as a function of fluid saturation state. Analyses of the solids demonstrate that gibbsite precipitation occurred in all experiments. The comparison of gibbsite precipitation to the dissolution rates of plagioclase at pH 11 shows that the rates are close to equal. The precipitation rates of gibbsite, however, decrease faster with decreasing pH than plagioclase dissolution rates. As such it seem likely that plagioclase dissolution is faster than gibbsite precipitation at near to neutral pH, and the relatively slow rate of gibbsite precipitation influences plagioclase weathering in many Earth surface systems. Kaolinite is commonly the second secondary mineral formed during low temperature dissolution of plagioclase. Kaolinite precipitation rates were measured in mixed flow reactors as a function of fluid saturation state at pH= 4 and 25 °C. In total eight long-term precipitation experiments were performed in fluids mildly supersaturated with respect to kaolinite, together with a known quantity of cleaned low defect Georgia Kaolinite as seeds. Measured kaolinite precipitation rates are relatively slow compared with plagioclase dissolution rates. This observation suggests that kaolinite formation during weathering is limited by its precipitation rates rather than by the availability of aqueous species sourced from plagioclase dissolution. Taken together {{the results of this study}} provide some of the fundamental scientific basic for predicting the rates and consequences of crystalline basalt and plagioclase dissolution at both the Earth's surface and during the near surface injection of CO 2 as part of carbon storage efforts. Results indicate that although gibbsite precipitation rates are relatively rapid, the relatively slow precipitation rates of kaolinite may be the process controlling the formation of this mineral at the Earth's surface. This observation highlights the need to further quantify this secondary mineral precipitation rates at conditions typical at the Earth's surface. Moreover, as the composition of divalent metals released from crystalline basalts varies significantly with pH, CO 2 carbonation in basalt should yield a systematic variation in the identity of carbonate and zeolite minerals precipitated with distance from the injection site. This latter conclusion can be tested directly as part of the currently on-going CarbFix project in Hellisheiði, Iceland. L'altération chimique des roches primaires et des minéraux dans les systèmes naturels a un impact majeur sur la formation des sols et leur composition. L'altération chimique est largement pilotée par la dissolution des minéraux. Les éléments chimiques libérés dans les eaux souterraines par la dissolution des minéraux réagissent facilement pour former des minéraux secondaires comme les argiles, zéolites et carbonates. Les carbonates se forment par réaction des cations divalents (Ca, Fe et Mg) avec CO 2 dissous tandis que la formation des kaolins et de la gibbsite est attribuée à l'altération des minéraux riches <b>en</b> <b>aluminium,</b> le plus souvent les feldspaths. Le projet Carbfix à Hellisheiði (sud-ouest de l'Islande) a pour but d'utiliser les processus d'altération naturelle pour former des minéraux carbonatés par réinjection dans les roches basaltiques environnantes de CO 2 provenant d'une centrale géothermique. Ce processus trouve son origine dans la dissolution des roches basaltiques riches en cations divalents (Ca, Fe et Mg) qui se combinent au CO 2 injecté pour former des minéraux carbonatés. Cette thèse est centrée sur la dissolution du basalte cristallin de Stapafell qui est composé essentiellement de trois phases minérales (plagioclase, pyroxène et olivine) et qui est riche en cations divalents. La vitesse de libération des éléments du basalte à l'état stationnaire et loin de l'équilibre a été mesurée dans des réacteurs à circulation à des pH de 2 à 12 et des températures de 5 à 75 °C. Les vitesses de libération de Si et Ca à l'état stationnaire présentent une variation en fonction du pH en forme de U avec une diminution des vitesses lorsque le pH augmente en conditions acides et une augmentation avec le pH en conditions alcalines. Les vitesses de libération du silicium par le basalte cristallin sont comparables à celles par le verre basaltique de même composition chimique aux faibles pH et aux températures ≥ 25 °C mais elles sont plus lentes aux pH alcalins et aux températures ≥ 50 °C. Par contre, les vitesses de libération de Mg et Fe diminuent de manière monotone avec l'accroissement du pH à toutes les températures. Ce comportement a pour cause les variations contrastées, en fonction du pH, des vitesses de dissolution des trois minéraux constitutifs du basalte: plagioclase, olivine et pyroxène. Les vitesses de libération des éléments déduites de la somme des vitesses de dissolution du plagioclase, pyroxène et olivine normalisées à la fraction volumique de ces minéraux sont, à un ordre de grandeur près, les mêmes que celles mesurées dans cette étude. En outre, les résultats expérimentaux montrent que, durant l'injection d'eaux chargées en CO 2 de pH proche de 3. 6, le basalte cristallin libère préférentiellement Mg et Fe en solution par rapport à Ca. L'injection de fluides acides chargés en CO 2 dans des roches cristallines basaltiques peut donc favoriser la formation de carbonates de Mg et Fe aux dépends de la calcite aux conditions de pH acides à neutres. Le plagioclase, qui est la phase la plus abondante du basalte, influence fortement la réactivité de ce dernier. La vitesse de dissolution du plagioclase, basée sur la libération de la silice, présente une variation en forme de U en fonction du pH, diminuant lorsque le pH augmente aux conditions acides mais augmentant avec le pH aux conditions alcalines. En accord avec les données de la littérature, la vitesse de dissolution du plagioclase à pH constant, en conditions acides, augmente avec sa teneur en anorthite. L'interprétation et le fit des données obtenues suggèrent que la vitesse de dissolution du plagioclase est contrôlée par la décomposition d'un complexe activé riche en silice, formé par le départ de Al de la structure du minéral. Le plus remarquable, par comparaison aux hypothèses antérieures, est que la vitesse de dissolution du plagioclase en conditions alcalines est indépendante de sa teneur en anorthite - e. g. les vitesses de dissolution des plagioclases riches en anorthite augmentent avec le pH aux conditions alcalines. A ces conditions, il est probable que la vitesse de dissolution rapide du plagioclase domine, en raison de sa forte teneur en Ca, la libération vers la phase fluide des cations divalents du basalte cristallin. La gibbsite est généralement le premier minéral qui précipite lors de la dissolution du plagioclase. C'est un hydroxyde d'aluminium que l'on trouve dans divers sols et qui est aussi la phase principale des minerais de bauxite. Les vitesses de précipitation de la gibbsite ont été mesurées dans des réacteurs fermés, en conditions alcalines à 25 et 80 °C, en fonction de l'état de saturation du fluide. Les analyses des solides après réaction ont démontré que la précipitation de gibbsite s'est produite dans toutes les expériences. L'interprétation de l'évolution dans le temps de la chimie du fluide réactif fournit des vitesses de précipitation de la gibbsite qui sont près des vitesses de dissolution du plagioclase. En plus, des vitesses de précipitation de la gibbsite diminuent plus rapidement que des vitesses de dissolution du plagioclase quand le pH descende. Ceci suggère que l'étape limitant de l'altération du plagioclase sur la surface de la terre est plutôt la consommation d'Al par formation de la gibbsite que la dissolution même du plagioclase. La kaolinite est en général le second minéral formé après la gibbsite lors de la dissolution du plagioclase à basse température. Les vitesses de précipitation de la kaolinite ont été mesurées dans des réacteurs à circulation à pH = 4 et t = 25 °C, en fonction de l'état de saturation du fluide. Au total, 8 expériences de précipitation de longues durées ont été réalisées dans des fluides légèrement supersaturés par rapport à la kaolinite, en utilisant comme germes pour la précipitation une quantité connue de de kaolinite de Géorgie (KGa- 1 b) contenant peu de défauts et préalablement nettoyée. Les vitesses de précipitation de kaolinite mesurées sont relativement lentes comparées aux vitesses de dissolution du plagioclase. Cette observation suggère que la formation de kaolinite lors de l'altération est limitée par sa vitesse de précipitation plutôt que par que la disponibilité en Al et Si issus de la dissolution du plagioclase. L'ensemble des résultats de cette étude fournit un certain nombre de principes scientifiques de base nécessaires à la prédiction des vitesses et des conséquences de la dissolution du basalte cristallin et du plagioclase à la surface de la Terre et lors de l'injection du CO 2 à proximité de la surface dans le cadre des efforts de stockage du carbone. Les résultats obtenus indiquent, bien que les vitesses de précipitation de la gibbsite soient relativement rapides, que la vitesse de précipitation relativement lente de la kaolinite peut être le processus contrôlant la formation de ce minéral à la surface de la Terre. Cette observation souligne la nécessité de poursuivre la quantification de la précipitation de ce minéral secondaire aux conditions typiques de la surface de la Terre. En outre, comme les proportions des différents métaux divalents libérés par les basaltes cristallins varient sensiblement avec le pH, la carbonatation des basaltes doit produire un changement systématique de l'identité des minéraux carbonatés et des zéolites précipités en fonction de la distance au puits d'injection. Cette dernière conclusion pourra être directement testée dans le cadre du projet CarbFix actuellement conduit à Hellisheiði en Islande...|$|E

The constitutive model used to compare the three different optimization schemes uses the Barlat' 91 yield criterion, an isotropic Voce type law and a kinematic Lemaitre and Chaboche law, which is suitable for the case of aluminium alloys.

In addition it became apparent that the best results, in terms of revealing both the grain and sub-grain boundaries and the precipitates in the non-reinforced alloy were obtained using the Weck etching procedure.

40|$|Longitudinal {{weld seams}} are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. As these joins occur {{along the entire}} extruded length, it is desirable that these weld seams have a minimal impact on the structural integrity of the extrudate. In particular, defects associated with weld seam formation should be avoided. In this research, the occurrence of defects related to material flow inside the extrusion tooling is studied. In lab-scale experiments, EN AW- 6060 and <b>EN</b> AW- 6082 <b>aluminium</b> alloy billets are formed into strips {{by means of the}} direct hot extrusion process. By utilising model dies with an internal obstruction similar to the supports present in porthole dies, a strip with a central longitudinal weld seam is formed. The effects of different geometries of the weld-chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} weld seam are investigated. Characterisation is performed through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the weld seam area to accommodate plastic deformation, and microstructural analysis provides insight into the defects related to unsound metal flow. Through computer simulations, conditions related to weld seam formation are modelled and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results demonstrate that metal flow controlled by the die geometry causes defects leading to inferior mechanical performance of the extrudate. It is further argued that current weld seam formation criteria utilised in finite element modelling need enhancement to incorporate these flow related defects. cop. 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: The composite materials were manufactured by squeeze casting of porous ceramic preforms characterized by the open porosities of 90 %, 80 %, 70 % and 60 % with the liquid EN AC- 44200 aluminum alloy. The composite materials containing 10 vol. %, 20 vol. %, 30 vol. % and 40 vol. % were manufactured and characterized by the homogeneous distribution of alumina particles in the matrix. On the base of microscopic investigations there was ascertained good bonding at the interface matrix/strengthening particles. Findings: Manufacturing of porous ceramic preforms from alumina powders characterized by the desired open porosity was elaborated. After squeeze casting with liquid EN AC- 44200 alloy there was noticed considerable increase of physical and mechanical properties: hardness HB increased from 82 HB for unreinforced alloy to 150 HB for material containing 40 vol. % of particles. There was noticed increase of tensile strength, bending strength and compression strength, although what is typical for composite materials, decrease of impact strength. Research limitations/implications: There was noticed small rest porosity with decreasing porosity of the ceramic preforms. Further investigations on porosity removal basing on modification of production parameters are forseen. Practical implications: Reinforcing of EN AC- 44200 aluminum alloy with ceramic particles is effective taking into account increase of hardness and strength (tensile, bending, compression), although the relatively low impact strength can be restriction for the applications of these materials as the elements subjected to dynamic loads.

40|$|The medium-based {{manufacturing}} of {{sheet metal}} parts based on compressed gases is well suited {{to the production of}} complex construction parts and also for difficult-to-form materials. On the basis of fundamental investigations for medium-based forming the work ranged from cup-size up to medium sized {{sheet metal parts}}. For this two different tools were designed. The compressed gas used as a medium was produced by a gas producer; the obtained pressures lay within the range from under 10 MPa up to 40 MPa. Times of pressure build-up lay within the range from 30 to 100 ms. In {{the first phase of the}} project section suitable gas producers were selected. The criteria for this included: high value of produced gas, fast pressure build-up, moderate combustion behaviour as well as small formation of residues. With two selected gas producer mixtures, cup forming tests with sheet metals made of <b>aluminium</b> (<b>EN</b> AW- 5754), steel (DC 04) and high-grade steel (X 5 CrNi 18 - 10) were done to determine the significant forming parameters.

The end-forming of the cup could be determined by an instrumented base plate in the tool. These results served as parameters for a simulation of the forming process.

An existing tool was modified so that two gas producer units and pressure sensors could be integrated.

40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This study {{focussed}} on {{the comparison}} of accessory mineral chemistry and paragenesis in the S-, I- and A-type granites of the Cape Granite Suite. The objective {{of the study was}} to use differences in accessory mineral chemistry and petrography to give insight in the evolution, recycling and formation of continental crust as affected by the Cape Granite Suite. Because of the high partition coefficients of the REE and trace elements into accessory minerals these minerals play an important role to explain granite evolution. The accessory mineral features are used as discriminators between barren and mineralized S-, I- and A-type granites in the suite. The petrography of the suite reflects the allanite-monazite dichtonomy with allanite and titanite occurring in the I -type granites while monazite occurs in S-type granites. Monazite becomes unstable in high Ca melts such as I-type granites. Apatite occurs in all the plutons which reflects its stability over a wide range of geological conditions. Rounded crystal habits of apatite and monazite in S-type granites indicate they are relics of sedimentary source rocks. Concentric growth- and sectoral zoning, as observed with CL and SEM, are common features in minerals that crystallized in barren plutons. The overprinting of magmatic textures reflects secondary processes, such as those that occurred in mineralized plutons, by "patchy" zoning and irregular alteration rims (coronas) in the mineralized plutons' accessory minerals. CL and SEM observations revealed that REE are redistributed into these coronas. Mineral chemistry of the accessory minerals reflects mostly the whole rock chemistry and physical conditions of the magmas. (Al~ Fe) substitution in titanite is controlled by P-T conditions, together with Ca, Mn and Mg substitution which is controlled by whole-rock chemistry, are good discriminators in S- and I-type granites. LREE and Sr content in allanite discriminate between the plutons and reflect the whole-rock chemistry. Apatite, because it occurs in all the plutons, is the most useful accessory mineral for discriminating between the plutons. From previous studies it is known that ASI controls the two main substitutions in apatite: Ca+P~Si+REE and Na+REE~ 2 Ca, Fe and Mn content in apatite (0, 1 pfu Mn and 0, 05 pfu Fe contents are the cut-off between S-and Itype granites) are controlled by oxidation state of the magma and Sr, REE and Mg reflect whole-rock chemistry. The content of these elements in apatite can be used as discriminators between the plutons as their ASI, oxidation states and whole-rock chemistry differ. REE patterns of monazite and allanite are LREE enriched without exception, while apatite and titanite REE patterns are mostly birdwing profiles with occurrences of LREE or HREE enrichment. These patterns are influenced by crystallization of coexisting REE-bearing phases, fractionation history of the pluton and by crystallization sequence of the accessory minerals. Phase relationships were investigated experimentally for monazite and allanite under magmatic conditions (870 °C, 1, 8 kbar) in peraluminous to metaluminous granitic melts. Monazite became unstable when aqueous CaCh solutions of 0. 7 - 7 g CaCh/ 10 cc H 20 where added to peraluminous melts (ASI> 1). Monazite broke down to Cl-apatite and corona textures were observed. Allanite was tested in peraluminous (ASI> 1) and metaluminous (ASI= 1) melts with different P 20 5 (0. 08 - 0. 25 wt%) concentrations. Allanite became unstable at high phosphorus and peraluminous melt conditions and broke down to LREE-P± Al, Ca, K phases. Corona (kelyphitic) textures were observed. It is also clear that phosphorus played an important role, with Al, in the melt structure as can be seen from the absence or presence of crystals in the glasses of the different melts. This is possible because adding of phosphorus to the melt results in a depression of the T of the granitic melts' liquidus. Because of an interaction of phosphorus with Si networks and formation of complexes it also depolymerize aluminosilicate melts. The solubility of monazite was also tested in aqueous solutions under atmospheric conditions and low T (100 - 350 °C) to investigate low TIP alteration. Solutions ofCaCb +NaCl (1 : 1) chlorides were very reactive and dissolved the monazite completely, while solutions of CaCb were less reactive and only partly dissolved the monazite. These experiments demonstrate the concentrations required in hydrothermal solutions to destabilize monazite and explain textures found in natural rocks. Accessory minerals are useful discriminators between S-, I- and A-type granites and also their mineralized counterparts. Discrimination does depend on what accessory minerals are present and therefore apatite is the best mineral because it occurs in all the plutons. Petrography of these minerals is an indicator of primary or secondary processes. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die fokus van hierdie studie was om die mineraalchemie en paragenese van bykomstige minerale in S-, 1 - en A-tipe graniete van die Kaapse Graniet Suite te vergelyk. Die doelwit van hierdie studie was om die verskille in chemie en petrografie van bykomstige minerale te gebruik as insig in die evolusie, herwinning en ontstaan van kontinentale kors soos geaffekteer deur die Kaapse Graniet Suite. Omdat SAE en spoorelemente hoe partisiekoeffisiente het vir bykomstige minerale speel hierdie minerale 'n belangrike rol om graniet evolusie te verklaar. Genoemde kenmerke van bykomstige minerale is ook gebruik om te onderskei tussen ongemineraliseerde en gemineraliseerde S-, 1 - en A-tipe graniete in die suite. Die petrografie van die Kaapse Graniet Suite weerspieel die tweeledigheid van allanietmonasiet deurdat allaniet en titaniet in 1 -tipe graniete en monasiet in S-tipe graniete voorkom. Monasiet word dus onstabiel in hoe Ca, 1 -tipe, graniete. Apatiet kom in al drie tipes voor wat die mineraal se stabiliteit in verskeie geologiese omgewings weerspieel. Geronde kristalvorme, of reliekteksture, van apatiet en monasiet in S-tipe graniete weerspieel die sedimentere oorsprong van hierdie graniete. Konsentriese groei - en sektorale sonering kom algemeen voor in bykomstige minerale in ongemineraliseerde plutone. Sekondere veranderings rande (koronas) en onreelmatige sonering in gemineraliseerde plutone se bykomstige minerale is 'n aanduiding dat primere teksture gedeeltelik vemietig is deur sekondere prosesse. Katodeluminisensie en skandeerelektron mikroskopie ondersoeke het bewys dat SAE gehermobiliseer word na die koronas. Heelrotschemie en fisiese toestande van die magma word weerspieel in die mineraalchemie van bykomstige minerale. (Al~Fe) substitusie in titaniet word beheer deur P-T toestande en is, saam met Ca, Mn en Mg inhoud wat heelrotschemie weerspieel, goeie diskriminators in S- en 1 -tipe graniete. LSAE en Sr inhoud in allaniet onderskei goed tussen plutone omdat hierdie elemente die heelrotschemie weerspieel. Omdat apatiet in al die plutone voorkom is dit die bruikbaarste mineraal om as diskriminant te gebruik. V anuit vorige werk is dit bekend dat die aluminium versadigings indeks die twee hoofsubstitusies: Ca+P~Si+SAE en Na+SAE~ 2 Ca beheer, Fe en Mn inhoud in apatiet (0, 1 pfu Mn en 0, 05 pfu Fe is die afsnypunt tussen S- en 1 -tipe graniete) weerspieel die oksidasietoestand van die magma en Sr, SAE en Mg weerspieel heelrotschemie. Saam kan hierdie elemente dus gebruik word as diskriminatore tussen die verskillende plutone. SAE patrone van allaniet en monasiet is sonder uitsondering verryk in die LSAE, terwyl apatiet en titaniet meestal "birdwing" profiele wys, maar kan ook verryk wees in LSAE of SSAE. Hierdie patrone word beinvloed deur kristallisasie van ander SAE-draende minerale, fraksionering van minerale uit die magma en die kristallisasie volgorde van die mineral e. Faseverwantskappe is eksperimenteel getoets tussen monasiet en allaniet in magmatiese toestande (780 °C en 1, 8 kbar). Monasiet word onstabiel in 'n peralumineuse smelt (Aluminium versadigingsindeks > 1) as waterig oplossings met konsentrasies van 0. 7 - 7 g CaCh/ 1 0 cc H 20 bygevoeg word. Cl-apatiet vorm as veranderingsproduk om die rande (koronas). Allaniet is getoets in peralumineuse (Aluminium versadigingsindeks > 1) <b>en</b> metalumineuse smelte (<b>Aluminium</b> versadigingsindeks = 1) met wisselende konsentrasies P 20 s (0. 08 - 0. 25 wt%). Allaniet het onstabiel geraak in peralumineuse smelte en hoe fosfor konsentrasies en het afgebreek na fases van LSAE+P± Ca, Al, K. Korona (kelifitiese) teksture is waargeneem. Hierdie eksperimente bewys dat fosfor, saam met Al, 'n belangrike rol speel in smeltstruktuur. Dit kan gesien word in die teenwoordig- of afwesigheid van kristalle in die glas. Dit is moontlik deurdat die byvoeging van fosfor 'n verlaging in die graniet likwidus temperatuur veroorsaak. Fosfor depolimeriseer ook aluminiumsilikaat smelte deur interaksie en kompleksvorming tussen fosfor en silika netwerke. Die oplosbaarheid van monasiet is ook getoets in waterige oplossings onder atmosferiese toestande en lae T (100 - 350 °C) om lae PIT veranderinge te ondersoek. 'n Versadigde oplossing van CaCh en NaCl (1 : 1) chloried het monasiet heeltemal opgelos terwyl 'n versadigde oplossing van CaCh monasiet net gedeeltelik opgelos het. Hierdie eksperimente dui op die konsentrasies nodig vir hidrotermale vloeistowwe waar bykomstige minerale onstabiel raak en verklaar teksture in natuurlike rotse. Bykomstige minerale kan dus gebruik word as diskriminators tussen ongemineraliseerde en gemineraliseerde plutone en ook tussen S-, I- en A-tipe graniete. Hulle kan egter net gebruik word as hulle teenwoordig is en daarom is apatiet die beste omdat dit in al die plutone aanwesig is. Petrografie is 'n aanduiding van magmatiese of sekondere prosesse...|$|R
