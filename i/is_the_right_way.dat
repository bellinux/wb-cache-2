2500|$|After {{winning the}} 2015 Champion Hurdle, Willie Mullins said: [...] "There's {{no reason to}} go novice chasing {{when you have a}} hurdler as good as this" [...] and later {{confirmed}} that Faugheen [...] "won’t jump a fence for a long time, perhaps ever". In mid-October 2015 in an exclusive interview on At the Races owner Rich Ricci revealed that [...] "Faugheen looks like a chaser, we all know that, but he has a sensitive back and was hard to keep fit as a younger horse, hurdling probably <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> for him".|$|E
2500|$|Eden himself {{paid tribute}} to his wife's {{adaptation}} of their domestic arrangements to meet the [...] "unsteady requirements" [...] of this period, noting that his digestion took less kindly to them. There is some evidence also that, when he was Foreign Secretary, Lady Avon had influenced (or, at any rate endorsed) his patterns of work. A later Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, has observed that, though he worked hard, Eden did not keep office hours and often spent mornings working in bed. For example, on 29 December 1952, Eden wrote: [...] "Raining and cold. Clarissa says that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> to run the F.O. Lie in bed, direct office by telephone and read Delacroix".|$|E
2500|$|Muslim cleric Abdul Raouf, {{a member}} of Afghanistan's main Islamic organization, the Afghan Ulama Council, stated [...] "Rejecting Islam is {{insulting}} God. We will not allow God to be humiliated. This man must die." [...] Raouf, who is described by the AP as [...] "moderate", is quoted as saying: [...] "Cut off his head!" [...] and [...] "We will call on the people to pull him into pieces so there's nothing left." [...] Raouf said Abdul Rahman will only survive if he goes into exile. During his sermon at Herati Mosque on March 24, 2006, Raouf told around 150 worshippers that Abdul Rahman deserved death since he had [...] "committed the greatest sin. God's way <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way,</b> and this man whose name is Abdul Rahman is an apostate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The American Spectator, Jeremy Lott commented {{positively}} {{about the}} protest movement: [...] "While the suits at Comedy Central and Yale University Press have been cowed, {{people across the}} country have decided to speak up and thereby magnify the offense a thousandfold." [...] Helge Rønning, a professor at the Institute of Media and Communication at the University of Oslo, said the offense to Muslims was outweighed by freedom-of-speech concerns. [...] "Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion {{is as important as the}} indignation that comes from the Muslim side," [...] he told the [...] NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). [...] "I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [...] Vebjørn Selbekk, a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted Danish cartoons of Mohammed in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. [...] "I think maybe this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," [...] he said. In an analysis of the protest movement and surrounding controversy, staff writer Liliana Segura of AlterNet noted, [...] "In a democratic society where free speech is vigilantly protected, it is perfectly reasonable to call out censorship, particularly when it springs from some form of tyrannical religious extremism." ...|$|E

"I am not {{altogether}} {{sure that that}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> to look at it," [...] said Mrs. Tolbridge; and then she went on with her sewing, not caring to expatiate on the subject. Her husband appreciated only the advantages of La Fleur, but she knew something of her disadvantages. The work on which she was engaged at that moment would have been done by the maid, had not that young woman's services been so frequently required of late by the autocrat of the kitchen.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. How men are {{to reckon}} it theirs; and that is, upon {{the same terms}} which God doth offer it, which is freely, as they are {{worthless}} and undeserving creatures, as they are without all good, and also unable to do any good. This, I say, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> of applying the merits of Christ to thy soul, for they are freely given to thee, a poor sinner, not for anything that is in thee, or done by thee, but freely as thou art a sinner, and so standest in absolute need thereof.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "and that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> to {{consider}} it; {{but let us}} make the calculation {{in the same way}} that we made the calculation about the gold chain that you were going to buy in London. If we suppose that the church was half done when they left off the work, and that it will now cost four millions of dollars to finish it, that will make eight millions of dollars in all. Now, what is the interest of eight millions of dollars, say at three per cent.?" ...|$|E

Then, when I draw it in with a bug on the end of it, I just turn it over so that the end that was out goes way back in my throat and takes the bug with it to just the right place to swallow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Evangelist proceeded, saying, [...] "Give more earnest heed to {{the things}} that I shall tell thee of. I will now show thee who it was that led thee astray, and who it was also to whom he sent thee. That man that met thee is one Worldly Wiseman; and rightly is he so called; partly because he seeks only for the things of this world ({{therefore}} he always goes to the town of Morality to church), and partly because he loveth that way best, for it saveth him from the Cross; and because he is of this evil temper, therefore he seeketh to turn you from my way though it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Only, by the way, let me bid thee have a care of two things, and so I shall pass to {{the next}} thing. 1. Have a care of relying on the outward {{obedience}} to any of God's commands, or thinking thyself ever the better {{in the sight of}} God for that. 2. Take heed of fetching peace for thy soul from any inherent righteousness. But, if thou canst, believe that as thou art a sinner, so thou art justified freely by the love of God, through the redemption that is in Christ; and that God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven thee, not because he saw any thing done, or to be done, in or by thee, to move him thereunto to do it. Because this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way.</b> The Lord put thee into it, and keep thee in it! ...|$|E
50|$|In the song, {{the narrator}} says to remain optimistic {{although}} pursued by misfortune, {{and that this}} proves to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> in <b>the</b> end.

30|$|For these participants, {{the weight}} of {{responsibility}} did not lift after they returned to their home countries.

6000|$|... 'That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> {{for her to}} take it,' said Anne; 'but I {{still think}} Mrs. Staunton must be an {{excessively}} silly person.

6000|$|... "Why {{should you}} say it is {{impossible}} you should marry?" [...] he continued. [...] "The {{only thing that could}} make it really impossible would be your being already married. Is it because you have been unhappy in marriage? That is all the more reason! Is it because your family exert a pressure upon you, interfere with you, annoy you? That is still another reason; you ought to be perfectly free, and marriage will make you so. I don't say anything against your family--understand that!" [...] added Newman, with an eagerness which might have made a perspicacious observer smile. [...] "Whatever way you feel toward them <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way,</b> and anything that you should wish me to do to make myself agreeable to them I will do as well as I know how.

Venus receiving Psyche into the abode of the gods!.... Ah! you have found out all about Psyche's wings by this time.... How do I know that? And yet, why am I, in spite of my common sense--if I have any--talking to you as you, and liking you, and pitying you, if you are nothing now, and probably never were anything? Bran! What right had you to pity him without giving your reasons in due form, as Hypatia would have done? Forgive me, sir, however--whether you exist or not, I cannot leave that collar round your neck for these camp-wolves to convert into strong liquor.' ...|$|E
60|$|But when, {{after only}} a month's travelling, I did come back to England, I was startled to find that I had told the exact truth. England did break on me at once beautifully new and beautifully old. To land at Dover <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> to {{approach}} England (most things that are hackneyed are right), for then you see first the full, soft gardens of Kent, which are, perhaps, an exaggeration, but still a typical exaggeration, of the rich rusticity of England. As it happened, also, a fellow-traveller with whom I had fallen into conversation felt the same freshness, though for another cause. She was an American lady who had seen Europe, and had never yet seen England, and she expressed her enthusiasm in that simple and splendid way which is natural to Americans, {{who are the most}} idealistic people in the whole world. Their only danger is that the idealist can easily become the idolator. And the American has become so idealistic that he even idealises money. But (to quote a very able writer of American short stories) that is another story.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 March, Kurt Volker, the US acting {{assistant}} secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: [...] "We don't believe that a further crackdown, further arrests, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> to go."
