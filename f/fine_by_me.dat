6000|$|... "Looking out of window, I saw {{a brutal}} carter, {{on the road}} before the house, beating an over-loaded horse. A year since I should have {{interfered}} to protect the horse, without a moment's hesitation. If the wretch had been insolent, I should have seized his whip, and applied the heavy handle of it to his own shoulders. In past days, I {{have been more than}} once <b>fined</b> <b>by</b> a magistrate (privately in sympathy with my offence) for assaults committed <b>by</b> <b>me</b> in the interests of helpless animals. What did I feel now? Nothing but a selfish sense of uneasiness, at having been accidentally witness of an act which disturbed my composure. I turned away, regretting that I had gone to the window and looked out.|$|R

Each year, GLBT Aggies was able to fundraise enough money to give away 1,000 T-shirts bearing the phrase [...] "gay? fine by me." [...] In 2012 GLBT Aggies were the first group to expand the <b>Fine</b> <b>By</b> <b>Me</b> project to include T-shirts bearing the phrases: [...] "lesbian? fine by me." [...] "bisexual? fine by me." [...] and [...] "transgender? fine by me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding Fox News, Goldberg said, [...] "Look, I think {{liberals have}} {{reasonable}} gripes with Fox News. It does lean to the right, primarily in its opinion programming {{but also in}} its story selection (which is <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> <b>me)</b> and elsewhere. But it's worth remembering that Fox is less a bastion of ideological conservatism and more a populist, tabloidy network." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{organization}} {{began at}} Duke University in spring 2003. The idea behind <b>Fine</b> <b>By</b> <b>Me</b> started from a dinner conversation between ten friends, both gay and straight. The group {{came up with}} the idea to distribute free T-shirts with an anti-homophobic message. In less than two weeks, the group distributed nearly 2,000 T-shirts to students, faculty and staff. Even then university president, Nannerl Nan Overholser Keohane, wore a T-shirt.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Republican and {{conservative}} columnist Jonah Goldberg indicated {{his belief that}} Fox News was rightward-leaning: [...] "Look, I think liberals have reasonable gripes with Fox News.

But it's worth remembering that Fox is less a bastion of ideological conservatism and more a populist, tabloid-like network." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fine</b> <b>By</b> <b>Me</b> was an {{organization}} in the United States, and now a project of Atticus Circle, with a mission to give voice to friends and supporters of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. The organization developed a project to print T-shirts bearing the phrase [...] "gay? fine by me" [...] and then worked with communities to distribute and wear the T-shirts to show acceptance and support for LGBT people and publicly demonstrate against homophobia.|$|E

5000|$|The way Paul {{works is}} to try {{and come up with a}} phrase that suits a {{particular}} voice ... That's the grain of sand around which the pearl of a character forms. Once he's found that voice, he's volcanic - it all comes out of him in a stream of consciousness which I can't type fast enough to keep up with. Then my rather less glamorous and exciting job would be to take that stuff and shape it, which was <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> <b>me,</b> as I'm kind of obsessed with structure.|$|E
5000|$|The album {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics whom criticized the album {{for having the}} same theme as their previous outing and accused both artists of a cheap cash-in to promote their tour. Jon Caramanica of the Rolling Stone criticized Jay-Z's raps as boring. Rapreviews.com's Steve Juon judged the album as a tolerable release, saying [...] "this time R. Kelly's peanut butter R&B is actually de-emphasized a little in favor of Jay-Z's hip-hop chocolate. That's <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> <b>me,</b> because it tastes better that way. Not as good as an unrestrained and unfettered Jay-Z does by himself mind you, but it's an improvement." ...|$|E
5000|$|The tales {{are told}} with an irreverent voice and comic nonsense. At {{one point the}} stars are heard to sing, [...] "Boodle-dum dee, boodle-dum dar, isn't it fun, being a star?" [...] To which the moon answers, [...] "I'm just the moon, but that's <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> <b>me,</b> so long as I hear that boodle-dum dee!" [...] Some of the {{dialogue}} is surprisingly adult ("That is {{one hell of a}} beautiful butterfly," [...] says an admiring frog) and some of the tales end on a rather sad note, but they also feature the old-fashioned lessons and fearsome monsters one would expect of fairy tales.|$|E

50|$|In Spring 2012, The Whispers {{reached the}} final-four in a {{competition}} {{to sing with}} Andy Grammer. The competition, which was 12 days long, consisted of submitting three performance videos, including two Andy Grammer songs. The Whispers arranged and learned the song <b>Fine</b> <b>By</b> <b>Me</b> in 8 hours for their final video submission. While they won the popular vote (consisting of Facebook Likes, Tweets, and user account votes) in their final round, they ultimately lost to the professional a cappella group Six Appeal, who garnered the votes of both TopBlip and Grammer. To gain votes, the Whispers got support of both the newspaper Studlife, and the St. Louis Metro social media staff.|$|E
5000|$|In late 1998 Larkin was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer, but he continued his musical work despite being told {{to take it easy}} from his substantial workload. In June 1999, Larkin released his fourth and ultimately final album as Scatman John, Take Your Time. Shortly afterwards, he was sent into intensive treatment. Even while suffering, Larkin remained positive, saying “Whatever God wants is <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> <b>me</b> ... I've had the very best life. I have tasted beauty.” Larkin died at his home in Los Angeles on 3 December, 1999 at the age of 57. He was cremated and his ashes were [...] "scattered" [...] at sea near Malibu, California.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 November 2004, {{he became}} one of the main targets of racist chants from {{sections}} of the Spanish crowd at an international friendly between England and Spain in Madrid. However, he brushed that aside with his performance in his next Manchester City appearance at Portsmouth, saying to reporters after the match, [...] "I just let the football do the talking." [...] He also has a similar response regarding his father, saying in an interview with manchesteronline.co.uk: [...] "The press brought up my adopted father's name. They relate to his name and that is <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> <b>me</b> - it comes with the name, but I will be my own man. I have made my own path and started to take my own steps." ...|$|E

[...] "I love the city, {{the fans are}} great, it's just fun playing hockey here."It's a great group of guys, we all just come {{together}} and gel so well, we all work hard {{for each other and}} stand up for each other. Almost every night we're hanging out even if it's away from the rink and they're just fun to be around."Blunden played with Cholet in France, but said Australian ice hockey could stand its ground."I think it's a lot rougher here than it is over in Europe. The refs let a lot more go, which is <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> <b>me.</b> I like it, it's a lot more fun, it gets the fans behind the game." ...|$|E
50|$|Wood {{reflected}} on the label's given to the band over time in 2013, stating: When we started the band...We’d play with like tech metal bands or pop punk bands and be stuck {{on all of these}} different bills and we just never seemed to find a group of bands that we sonically worked with...So, people were always putting labels on us and we were kind of surprised by all of this, because as far as we’re concerned, we’re just a rock band. We’re just a five piece rock band. We write melodic rock songs, it’s not like we are re-inventing the wheel. People have always struggled to kind of pigeon hole us I think. That seems to still be continuing. We’ve had a degree of connection at Active Rock radio and that’s amazing, but I don’t consider us an Active Rock band. I just consider us a rock band. I’m happy to be {{at the forefront of the}} New Wave of British Heavy Metal if that’s what people say, but I don’t consider us a metal band. I don’t really even want us to be limited to being a British band. I just want us to be a band, but whatever anyone else wants to call us is <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tony Stewart of The Mirror said of Gary that David Platt has met his {{match in}} the {{character}} {{and the two of}} them have enough criminal convictions, Asbos and restraining orders to wallpaper over their living room and comparing Gary and his family's criminal record to that of the Battersbys', saying the latter compared to them it's like a day out with the Von Trapp family. Grace Dent of The Guardian stated her love for the Windass family and of the character Gary, and she went on to describe him stating: [...] "Gary Windass loves thieving cars, stealing tools from vans, spitting globs of phlegm between his front teeth and, at the mere hint of sunshine, strutting about with his top off wearing trakkie-beeees that cry out for a good boil wash. But that's <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> <b>me</b> as he's TWOC'd all of David Platt's thunder.." [...] MSN branded Gary and his family as chavs (Gary being the prime example) and being perfect guests for the Jeremy Kyle show, and going onto to calling the a million miles away from lower class yobbish families 'The Mortons' and 'The Battersbys'. Whereas Simon Swift of Soaplife magazine commented on the fact that on first looks he couldn't help feeling that Gary and the rest of the clan are a bit too much like original neighbours-from-hell the Battersbys. The character was also noted for the big impression he made within the soap in such a short space of time by Rick Fulton of The Daily Record So much so that he has been nominated for Villain Of The Year in The British Soap Awards 2009, which he did not go on to win. Kris Green of media website Digital Spy praised and commented on the fact that Gary and her family had 'settled in so well, in such a short space of time', with actor Mikey North stating that their success is down to the good writing and many plotlines the family received in the short time period. Mikey North also said that even though his character is a bad boy he has gained the public support after beating David Platt up, branding him as a legend for being the first one to do it. (The public loathe the character of David's antics) Ben Ashford of The Sun newspaper compared the real life fraud crimes of The Peters family, who came up with a range of illnesses including agoraphobia and alcoholism to swindle state handouts, as that mirroring Gary and the rest of his family, branding both units as 'scroungers'.|$|E
