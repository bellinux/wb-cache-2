However, it is also understood that classical logic is ineffective for handling partiality and uncertainty in IR. Applying non-classical logics such as the AGM belief revision logic and the possibilistic logic to adaptive information retrieval is appealing since they provide a powerful and rigorous framework to model partiality and uncertainty inherent in any IR processes. The maxi-adjustment method, which is an effective computational apparatus of the AGM paradigm, is applied to develop the learning components of the adaptive <b>information</b> <b>agents.</b> Essentially, maxi-adjustment allows the partial representation K of a user 2 ̆ 7 s information needs N to be refined gradually based on the user 2 ̆ 7 s relevance feedback t.
