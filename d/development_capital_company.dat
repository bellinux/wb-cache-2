40|$|The Urban Industry Initiative (UII) is a 3 -year {{pilot project}} whose {{mission is to}} retain neighborhoodbased {{manufacturing}} jobs, which remain {{an essential part of}} neighborhood economies in Philadelphia. The overall strategy of the UII is to retain and increase jobs both by helping manufacturers become more competitive and by strengthening the connections manufacturers have with their neighborhood. The UII has sought to achieve this objective by developing social and economic relationships—social capital—among neighborhood manufacturers. By linking companies together to share expenses, pool scarce resources, form strategic alliances, buy and sell from one another and exchange information as well as ideas, firms can grow their business in ways that were not previously available to them. And as participants in a thriving industrial community—a place with strong social capital—firms gain economic value from their location in an urban neighborhood. This means a stronger bottom line, and a company whose location is an asset rather than a liability. A key conclusion of this project is that in order to strengthen regional and community economies, traditional economic-development services must be supplemented with a strategy of social <b>capital</b> <b>development</b> among <b>companies.</b> The Urban Industr...|$|R
