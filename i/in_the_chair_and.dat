25|$|The {{series was}} devised and written by Mark Tavener, and logically follows the series In the Red, In the Balance, <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chair,</b> <b>and</b> In the End {{which he wrote}} with Peter Baynham. In some of these, Prentiss and McCabe (again played by Fry and Bird) are {{elevated}} members of the BBC, before getting kicked out. Indeed, there is a scene on the last page of the novel In the Red, in which the newly appointed {{director general of the}} BBC gives them the sack.|$|E
25|$|The Tuvalu Trust Fund was {{established}} with a management structure {{that was designed}} to avoid the mismanagement and corruption that has plagued many other Pacific trust funds. One important element of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is that it is structured to avoid overdrawing to fund unauthorised projects. This is achieved through the separation of fund capital from fund proceeds available for distribution. The success of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is attributed by Brian Bell to the following factors: Accountability through a Board of four directors with Tuvalu <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> the other original parties providing members; the use of Professional funds management to provide investment advice; the monitoring of the performance of the fund by actuarial consultants (the Fund Monitor); the auditing of the fund by international auditors; and an advisory committee to monitor Tuvalu's economic performance and provide advice to the Government and the Board.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was the Final Four {{match for the}} vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship between The Undertaker, Bret Hart, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Vader. In order to be {{eliminated}} from the contest, a wrestler had to be physically thrown over the top rope by an opponent. Hart and Austin, who had a well-known rivalry, started brawling with each other while Undertaker attacked Vader and hit him with a crossbody over the top rope. Undertaker attacked both Hart and Vader. Vader recovered and then hit Undertaker with a steel chair to the outside. Undertaker blocked the chair and drove Vader <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> then the steel steps opening his right eye. Austin bumped Hart and then began working on Undertaker while Hart and Vader punched each other. All the four men began wrestling on outside as Undertaker crotched Austin. Vader attacked Hart with a steel chair. Undertaker began working on Hart, who eye raked Undertaker and was powerslammed by Undertaker. Vader and Austin attacked each other by hitting steel chairs, steps, bell and even a camera man. Vader applied Hart's own maneuver Sharpshooter on him, but Austin hit Vader with a Lou Thesz Press to break the hold. Vader tried to hit Undertaker a Vaderbomb, but instead went a Vadersault which missed. Hart then put Austin in a fireman's carry and threw him over the top rope, which eliminated him from the match. Hart and Undertaker brawled with each other while Vader recovered in the corner. Paul Bearer interfered and attacked Undertaker while Vader was superplexed by Hart. Despite being eliminated, Austin interfered in the match and attacked Hart. Vader went for a Vaderbomb from the top rope, but Undertaker low blowed Vader and threw him over the top rope. Undertaker and Hart remained the final two participants. He tried to hit a Tombstone on Hart until Austin distracted Undertaker while Hart clotheslined Undertaker over the top rope to win his fourth WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
60|$|His heart thumped violently {{against his}} ribs. He {{looked for the}} {{revolver}} everywhere. He hunted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drawers. He looked desperately, {{and all the time}} he knew he would not find it. Suddenly he heard Walker's gruff, hearty voice.|$|R
60|$|He {{threw himself}} back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> chuckled, <b>and</b> was silent.|$|R

500|$|Two of {{the most}} complex special effects in the film were the corpses of Barrymore's and Walls' characters, Casey Becker and Steve Orth. Their deaths {{involved}} the character being gutted from ribcage to pelvis, essentially hollowing out the torso of internal organs, with the guts [...] "rolling" [...] from the wound. To allow Walls to continue to move and feign death while displaying the wound, KNB designed a chair with no back. The actor would kneel behind it while his upper body, head, and arms were positioned within the chair's seating area. An anatomical model representing the character's torso and legs was positioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> disguised so that the actor's upper body and the model appeared to be one piece. The fake abdomen was filled with rubber, latex, and gelatin pieces smeared in fake blood—the [...] "internal organs" [...] — which could then fall free. The other effect involved Barrymore's character being gutted and hung by the neck from a tree. The team utilized a similar approach, but replicated Barrymore's entire body, as {{it would be impossible to}} conceal her real body and display the special effect of her character having been gutted.|$|E
2500|$|..... I {{looked over}} ... and Martin was very quietly sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> a tear {{ran down his}} cheek. [...] It was a victory like none other. It was an {{affirmation}} of the movement.|$|E
2500|$|Touche was {{reported}} to be considering resignation but was urged to stay by Conservatives, and decided to stick at it. However Labour MPs resented his presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chair</b> <b>and</b> cheered whenever he was succeeded by another Deputy. In October 1961 he announced he would stand down at the next election. When, in December 1961, Touche mistakenly announced an opposition victory in a House of Commons division, a long succession of points of order forced him to adjourn the House for [...] "grave disorder". The Speaker again backed his deputy.|$|E
60|$|Torwood saw {{my father}} lying back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> trembling, <b>and</b> he dreaded a fit every moment.|$|R

2500|$|One {{example of}} this is [...] "Hit and Rock", a variant of {{accuracy}} landing devised to let people of varying skill levels compete for fun. [...] "Hit and Rock" [...] is originally from POPS (Parachutists Over Phorty Society). The object is to land {{as close as possible to}} the chair, remove the parachute harness, sprint to the chair, sit fully <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> rock back and forth at least one time. The contestant is timed from the moment that feet touch the ground until that first rock is completed. [...] This event is considered a race.|$|E
2500|$|Avoid {{using the}} {{pectoral}} muscles, such as by pushing {{on the chair}} arms to assist one's self out of a chair, or by using the arms to assist in sitting down. Proper standing technique is to rock three times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> then stand to provide momentum for moving {{the center of gravity}} from the sitting to the standing position. Proper sitting technique is to slowly lower the bottom toward the chair seat using gluteus and quadriceps muscles ("legs only") without grabbing the chair arms. Second, patients should avoid lifting objects utilizing the pectoral muscles: carrying light objects with arms extended [...] down at sides, and lifting light objects with the elbows pressed to the chest and using the biceps, are acceptable. Also, avoid using the arms overhead.|$|E

50|$|At first, {{the rail}} section was almost {{symmetrical}} top-to-bottom, and {{was described as}} a double-headed rail. The intention was to invert the rail after the top surface had become worn, but rails tend to develop chair gall, an attrition of the rail where it is supported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs,</b> <b>and</b> this would have made running on the former bottom surface impossibly noisy and irregular. It was better to provide the extra metal on the top surface and gain extra wear there without the need to invert the rail at its half life.|$|R
