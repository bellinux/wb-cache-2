5|$|The <b>Fundamental</b> Rights are not {{absolute}} and {{are subject to}} reasonable restrictions as necessary {{for the protection of}} public interest. In the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case in 1973, the Supreme Court, overruling a previous decision of 1967, held that the <b>Fundamental</b> Rights could be amended, subject to judicial review in case such an amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The <b>Fundamental</b> Rights can be enhanced, removed or otherwise altered through a constitutional amendment, passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of Parliament. The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension any of the <b>Fundamental</b> Rights, excluding Articles 20 and 21, by order of the President. The President may, by order, suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well, thereby barring citizens from approaching the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the <b>Fundamental</b> Rights, except Articles 20 and 21, during the period of the emergency. Parliament may also restrict the application of the <b>Fundamental</b> Rights to members of the Indian Armed Forces and the police, in order to ensure proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline, by a law made under Article 33.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Constitutional Remedies {{empowers}} {{citizens to}} approach the Supreme Court of India to seek enforcement, or protection against infringement, of their <b>Fundamental</b> Rights. Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy, {{in the form of}} a <b>Fundamental</b> Right itself, for enforcement of all the other <b>Fundamental</b> Rights, and the Supreme Court is designated as the protector of these rights by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has been empowered to issue writs, namely habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto, for the enforcement of the <b>Fundamental</b> Rights, while the High Courts have been empowered under Article 226 – which is not a <b>Fundamental</b> Right in itself – to issue these prerogative writs even in cases not involving the violation of <b>Fundamental</b> Rights. The Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to enforce the <b>Fundamental</b> Rights even against private bodies, and in case of any violation, award compensation as well to the affected individual. Exercise of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court can also be suo motu or on the basis of a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} stages of the British raj, the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India {{proposed}} a Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for India as {{part of the process of}} transfer of power. The Constituent Assembly of India, composed of indirectly elected representatives from the British provinces and Princely states, commenced its proceedings in December 1946, and completed drafting the Constitution of India by November 1949. According to the Cabinet Mission plan, the Assembly was to have an Advisory Committee to advise it on the nature and extent of <b>fundamental</b> rights, protection of minorities and administration of tribal areas. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was constituted in January 1947 with 64 members, and from among these a twelve-member sub-committee on <b>Fundamental</b> Rights was appointed under the chairmanship of J.B. Kripalani in February 1947. The sub-committee drafted the <b>Fundamental</b> Rights and submitted its report to the Committee by April 1947, and later that month the Committee placed it before the Assembly, which debated and discussed the rights over the course of the following year, adopting the drafts of most of them by, December 1948. The drafting of the <b>Fundamental</b> Rights was influenced by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N. General Assembly and the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in interpreting the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution. The Directive Principles, which were also drafted by the sub-committee on <b>Fundamental</b> Rights, expounded the socialist precepts of the Indian independence movement, and were inspired by similar principles contained in the Irish Constitution. The <b>Fundamental</b> Duties were later added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fundamental</b> {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other.

The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fundamental</b> rights {{primarily}} protect {{individuals from}} any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals. For instance, the Constitution abolishes untouchability and also prohibits begar. These provisions {{act as a}} check both on state action {{as well as the}} action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled that all provisions of the Constitution, including <b>fundamental</b> rights can be amended. However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Since the <b>fundamental</b> rights can be altered only by a constitutional amendment, their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{are also}} applied {{in many other}} {{mathematical}} areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying {{the properties of the}} corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the <b>fundamental</b> group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of the <b>fundamental</b> group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The <b>fundamental</b> group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the <b>fundamental</b> group detects the hole.|$|E

40|$|Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003) {{document}} that excess returns {{on the stock}} market are puzzlingly higher under Democratic presidential administrations. We examine whether differences in economic <b>fundamentals</b> can account for this presidential puzzle. We find that the role for <b>fundamentals</b> crucially depends on how they are defined. When <b>fundamentals</b> are identified with per capita consumption growth, differences in consumption growth account for at most 2 % of the difference in excess returns across the presidential cycle. When <b>fundamentals</b> are identified with the consumption growth of luxury goods, as much as 45 % of the difference in excess returns can be accounted for by differences in <b>fundamentals.</b> Other measures of macroeconomic economic performance indicate large differences in business cycle experience over the presidential cycle. Hence, large differences in excess returns coincide with large differences in economic <b>fundamentals</b> across the presidential cycle. We also investigate whether the observed difference in <b>fundamentals</b> and stock returns over the presidential cycle were anticipated over the period we study. We do this in two ways.
