5000|$|With the {{widespread}} use of the 1892 Army field trumpet, which was actually a [...] "straight" [...] (valveless) bugle in the key of G, American drum & bugle corps evolved in that key. However, some members in some corps wished to add more notes to their brass repertoire. Some corps in the 1920s added D crooks on some horns in order to play more complicated songs in two lines, similar to a handbell ensemble. Ludwig added the first valve to a bugle to make the G-D horn-in-one, wisely making the valve horizontal rather than vertical in order to preserve the look and handling of the straight bugle (and to {{make it more difficult to}} spot by unobservant judges in circuits which had not yet legalized the valve). The single <b>horizontal</b> <b>valve</b> allowed the diatonic scale to be played by each bugle.|$|E
5000|$|The soprano bugle was {{the first}} {{instrument}} in the drum corps bugle family. A direct descendant of the M1892 US Army field trumpet, this instrument has undergone every design change {{since the start of}} the activity. In early corps, the soprano was pitched either in G or F (F being attained by a long tuning slide) to allow a split ensemble to play simple melodies across the group. The first design change was to add an additional loop of tubing to lower the soprano to the key of D via a locking piston valve tucked horizontally under the handhold. This allowed four possible keys: G and F with the valve open, and D and C with the valve closed. In the 1930s, the competitive circuits allowed the valve to be unlocked, which allowed for more complex melodies to be played by each musician, instead of the melodies being split among 3 or 4 parts. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>valve</b> was still tucked under the handhold, operated by the right thumb. Through the 1940s and 1950s, corps experimented with sanding down the tuning slide to be as quick and smooth in operation as a trombone slide, to allow quick changes in tuning to reach notes within overtone series of the keys of F# and F. Combined with the piston valve, this allowed for notes within the overtone series of D and C. Many bugles were modified with a ring to allow the left hand to actuate the slip-slide tuning slide. Eventually this slip-slide setup became so popular that it became a factory option. By the early 1960s, the competitive circuits approved the use of a rotary valve tuning slide in place of the standard tuning slide on the soprano. The rotary valve was actuated by the left hand, and featured a length of tubing that lowered the pitch by either a half-step (F#) or a whole-step (F). Corps featured sopranos with both slides to allow for the greatest choice of available notes, however these instruments were still non-chromatic. Around 1967, the rules congress standardized an F piston valve and an F# rotary valve. This allowed the equivalent of the first and second valves on a typical brass instrument, with the piston equating the first valve, and the rotor equating the second valve. Older equipment was grandfathered in, however most corps chose to sell their older D piston sopranos or purchase a kit which allowed local band instrument repairmen to remove the D tubing and solder on an F tubing section. In the late 1970s, DCI's rules congress allowed for the soprano to be designed similarly to a trumpet, with two vertical piston valves. The European drum corps circuits skipped the two valve rule and allowed three vertical valves at this time. American bugle manufacturers then designed both two and three valve instruments at the same time, often using the same parts for both. By 1990, DCI approved the use of three valve sopranos in the North American circuit, thus ending the era of non-chromatic bugles. Sopranos are still manufactured by two companies, one of which also still produces a two valve custom version for The Commandant's Own United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the concept of}} 'quasi-dynamic' {{pressure}} measurements is introduced and used {{in order to obtain}} compressor spectral maps describing the process of surge onset in a centrifugal blower. In the experimental rig pressure signals were recorded at several throttling valve positions and subjected to Fourier analysis. The results are shown in the form of contour maps with frequency on the <b>horizontal</b> and control <b>valve</b> opening on the vertical axis. The maps allow the frequencies dominating at consecutive stages of entering surge to be distinguished. Moreover, comparison of the maps, obtained at different pressure tappings allowed the point of instability onset to be determined. Research confirmed that the first disturbances appeared in the inlet recirculation zone much before the surge. The scale of the disturbances was considerable, amplitude increased about 10 times together with an immediate rise of its mean value. On the other hand, flow structure was not regular as no dominating frequency was detected. When the flow rate continued to decrease the instabilities propagated throughout the impeller towards the diffuser and certain frequency peaks appeared suggesting the formation of regular flow structures. At deep surge spectrum is dominated by one peak that is in good agreement with frequency of the corresponding Helmholtz resonator. Moreover, due to the high accuracy of the 'quasi-dynamic' method it was possible to recognise the damped forms of non-stable phenomena were present in stable working conditions...|$|R
40|$|Cyclic-to-cycle variability, CCV, of intake-jet flow in {{an optical}} engine was {{measured}} using particle image velocimetry (PIV), revealing the possibility of two different flow patterns. A phase-dependent proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis showed that {{one or the other}} flow pattern would appear in the average flow, sampled from test to test or sub-sampled within a single test; each data set contained individual cycles showing one flow pattern or the other. Three-dimensional velocity data from a large-eddy simulation (LES) of the engine showed that the PIV plane was cutting through a region of high shear between the intake jet and another large flow structure. Rotating the measurement plane 10 revealed one or the other flow structure observed in the PIV measurements. Thus, it was hypothesized that cycle-to-cycle variations in the swirl ratio result in the two different flow patterns in the PIV plane. Having an unambiguous metric to reveal large-scale flow CCV, causes for this variability were examined within the possible sources present in the available testing. In particular, variations in intake-port and cylinder pressure, lateral valve oscillations, and engine RPM were examined as potential causes for the cycle-to-cycle flow ariations using the phase-dependent POD coefficients. No direct correlation was seen between the intake port pressure, or the pressure drop across the intake valve, and the in-cylinder flow pattern. A correlation was observed between dominant flow pattern and cycle-to-cycle variations in intake <b>valve</b> <b>horizontal</b> position. RPM values and in-cylinder flow patterns did not correlate directly.

40|$|The {{coming years}} {{there is a}} need to {{increase}} production from petroleum reservoirs, and there is an enormous potential to do so by increasing the recovery factor. This is possible by making better use of recent technological developments, such as <b>horizontal</b> wells, downhole <b>valves</b> and sensors. However, actually making better use of these improved capabilities is difficult because of many open problems in reservoir management and production operations processes. Consequently, there is significant scope to increase the recovery factor of oil and gas fields by tailoring tools from the systems and control community to efficiently perform dynamic optimization of wells (e. g. number, locations) and their production settings (e. g. bottom-hole pressures, flow rates, valve settings) based on uncertain reservoir models, in the sense that they lead to good decisions while requiring limited time from the user. This thesis aims at developing these tools, and the main contributions are as follows. Many production setting optimization problems can be written as optimal control problems that are linear in the control. If the only constraints are upper and lower bounds on the control, these problems can be expected to have pure bang-bang optimal solutions. The adjoint method to derive gradients of a cost function with respect to production settings can be combined with robust optimization to efficiently compute settings that are robust against uncertainty in reservoir models. The gradients used in production setting optimization can be used to efficiently compute directions in which to iteratively improve upon an initial well configuration by surrounding the to-be-placed wells by pseudo wells (i. e. wells that operate at a negligible rate). The controllability and observability properties of single-phase flow reservoir model are analyzed. It is shown that pressures near wells in which we can control the flow rate or bottom-hole pressure are controllable, whereas pressures near wells in which we can measure the flow rate or bottom-hole pressure are observable. Finally, a new method of regularization in history matching is presented, based on this controllability and observability analysis. Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Lithiotis problematica is a Lower Jurassic {{aberrant}} bivalve {{characterized by}} a strongly inequivalve shell consisting of a long stick-like umbonal part and a short spoon-shaped body cavity. It was a gregarious semi-infaunal bivalve, which inhabited muddy substrates {{characterized by a}} relatively high sedimentation rate. The species thrived in tropical shallow marine environments, throughout the Tethys and Panthalassa carbonate platforms, where it had a relevant role as mound builder. The term Lithiotis has been often used in literature also to indicate other more frequent Lower Jurassic gregarious bivalves, such as Lithioperna and Cochlearites, but the identification {{in the field of}} these three genera is not easy and they are generally indicated with the generic term “lithiotids”. For these reasons the paleoecology of the Lithiotis problematica build-ups is scarcely known and detailed taphonomic analysis are not available in literature. The L. problematica mound studied here is located in the Rotzo Formation (Calcari Grigi Group) in the Tonezza del Cimone – Folgaria area (NE Italy). The bivalves make up a low lens-shaped accumulation, about 4 m wide and 20 cm high. The shells occur in a hard cemented limestone and are infilled by sparry calcite or greenish micrite. Lithology and preservation preclude the study of isolated specimens from the matrix. The reconstruction of the shells was, therefore, obtained through serial sectioning of some limestone blocks, originating from bed TO 41. The limestone blocks were sectioned in parallel slabs about 10 mm thick, which were then polished. The slab surfaces were scanned by an optical scanner at 1200 dpi. The most part of the Lithiotis shells are still articulated and characterized by an unusual short shells with a broad body chamber and a long umbonal notch. The biofabric of the biogenic concentration consists of almost parallel and inclined (60 ° in mean) shells with respect to the upper bedding surface. The orientation of commissure plane is related to the shell density. In densely packed aggregates the commissure are parallel, while they are randomly oriented in loosely packed aggregates. At the base of the mound, dispersed <b>horizontal</b> disarticulated <b>valves</b> of Lithiotis, preserved as casts, probably represented the hard surfaces for larval cementation and the colonization stage of the mound. The lower part of the mound is composed by marly limestone. Here, the shells were affected by a rapid dissolution, which destroyed both the apical regions of individuals in life position and the valves laying horizontally. In the middle-upper part of the mound, the shells are mostly infilled by calcitic cement or greenish mudstone coming from the overlain bed. The matrix of the mound ranges from mud-supported in the lower part, with sparsely distributed bioclasts, to grain- and bioclastic-supported in the upper part, where the bioclasts consist of abundant larger foraminifera (e. g., Orbitopsella), green algae, brachiopods (Lychnothyris) and gastropods. Rare sponges and solitary corals are also present. The shell fabric and fossil assemblages suggest the transition from relatively quite and muddy bottom conditions, favourable to the settlement and growth of Lithiotis, to a very shallow marine (euhaline) environment near the normal wave base. The occurrence, {{at the top of the}} mound, of abundant filter-feeding and sessile benthic forms suggests a drop in sedimentation and, probably, the emersion of the mound. The changes in the sedimentary rates controlled the shell shape (short and large) and the mound demise. On the basis of the growth increments of Lithiotis, the duration of the mound is discussed...|$|R

It has been shown that the proposed model performs much better than other scaling up techniques considered under the present study. Using dimensional analysis, a model has been formulated to scale up the pressure drop incurred at the entry section of a top discharge blow tank. The proposed model predicts the entry pressure losses within a maximum error margin of ± 15 % of experimental measurements. Since no other model was found in the open literature for such prediction, the proposed model could not be compared with any other. To determine the minimum conveying velocity, a scaling up model has been proposed using multivariate data analysis techniques and dimensional analysis. The proposed model gives resoably better predictions, especially in case of fine particles, than the other available models considered in this study. It also shows a good agreement with experimental measurements. Combining the models proposed in current study for pressure drop determination, entry loss calculation and minimum conveying velocity estimation, one can reliably design a complete pneumatic conveying system. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) principles have been used to determine the pressure drop across a standard 90 º bend and a straight pipe section.
