40|$|International audienceIn the high-intensity focused {{ultrasound}} (US), or HIFU, field, it {{is well-known}} that the cavitation {{effect can be}} used to induce lesions of larger volume. The principle is based on the increase in the <b>equivalent</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficient of the tissue {{in the presence of the}} bubbles created by cavitation. The elementary lesions produced by combination of cavitation and thermal effects, using focused transducers, were spherical and developed upstream of the focal point. This paper presents a method that combines cavitation with a thermal effect to obtain deeper lesions using a plane transducer, rather than a focused one. The cavitation effect was produced by delivering intensities of 60 W/cm 2 at the face of the transducer for 0. 5 s. The applicator was then rotated through 90 degrees at a constant speed of between 0. 5 and 1. 5 degrees /s. During this rotation, ex vivo tissues were exposed continuously to an acoustic intensity of 14 W/cm 2 to combine the cavitation effect with a thermal effect. The necroses were, on average, twice as deep when the cavitation effect was used as those obtained with a thermal effect alone. Observed macroscopically, the lesions have a very well-delimited geometry. Temperature measurements made at different angles of treatment have shown that they were coagulation necroses...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{numerical}} approach, we explore wave-induced fluid flow effects in partially saturated porous rocks {{in which the}} gas-water saturation patterns are governed by mesoscopic heterogeneities associated with the dry frame properties.

To determine the <b>equivalent</b> <b>attenuation</b> and phase velocity of the synthetic rock samples considered in this study, we apply {{a numerical}} upscaling procedure, which permits to take into account mesoscopic heterogeneities associated with the dry frame properties as well as spatially continuous variations of the pore fluid properties. The multiscale nature of the fluid saturation is taken into account by locally computing the physical properties of an effective fluid, which are then used for the larger-scale simulations. We consider two sets of numerical experiments to analyse such effects in heterogeneous partially saturated porous media, where the saturation field is determined by variations in porosity and clay content, respectively. In both cases we also evaluate the seismic responses of corresponding binary, patchy-type saturation patterns. Our results indicate that significant attenuation and modest velocity dispersion effects take place in this kind of media for both binary patchy-type and spatially continuous gas saturation patterns and in particular in the presence of relatively small amounts of gas. The numerical experiments also show that the nature of the gas distribution patterns is a critical parameter controlling the seismic responses of these environments, since attenuation and velocity dispersion effects are much more significant and occur over a broader saturation range for binary patchy-type gas-water distributions. This analysis therefore suggests that the physical mechanisms governing partial saturation should be accounted for when analysing seismic data in a poroelastic framework. In this context, heterogeneities associated with the dry frame properties, which do not play important roles in wave-induced fluid flow processes per se, should be taken into account since they may determine the kind of gas distribution pattern taking place in the porous roc...|$|E

40|$|We present {{observations}} of the 85. 69 GHz continuum emission and H 42 alpha line emission from the central 30 arcsec within NGC 4945. Both sources of emission originate from nearly identical structures that can be modelled as exponential discs with a scale length of ~ 2. 1 arcsec (or ~ 40 pc). An analysis of the spectral energy distribution based on combining these data with archival data imply that 84 % +/- 10 % of the 85. 69 GHz continuum emission originates from free-free emission. The electron temperature is 5400 +/- 600 K, which is comparable {{to what has been}} measured near the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. The star formation rate (SFR) based on the H 42 alpha and 85. 69 GHz free-free emission (and using a distance of 3. 8 Mpc) is 4. 35 +/- 0. 25 M/yr. This is consistent with the SFR from the total infrared flux and with previous measurements based on recombination line emission, and it is within a factor of ~ 2 of SFRs derived from radio data.

40|$|Purpose: To {{measure the}} {{attenuation}} effectiveness and minimize {{the weight of}} new non-Pb radiation shielding materials used for radiation protection by interventional radiology (IR) physicians, to compare {{the accuracy of the}} different standard measurement geometries of these materials, and to determine x-ray qualities that correspond to the scattered radiation that IR physicians typically encounter. Methods: Radiation attenuation capabilities of non-Pb materials were investigated. Typically, most studies of non-Pb materials have focused on the attenuating properties of metal powders. In this study, layers of materials incorporating non-Pb powdered compounds such as Bi 2 O 3, Gd 2 O 3, and BaSO 4 were measured individually, as bilayers, and as a Bi 2 O 3 -loaded hand cream. Attenuation measurements were performed in narrow-beam (fluorescence excluded) and broad beam (fluorescence included) geometries, demonstrating that these different geometries provided significantly different results. The Monte Carlo (MC) program EGSnrc was used to calculate the resulting spectra after attenuation by radiation shielding materials, and scattered x-ray spectra after 900 scattering of eight ASTM Standard primary x-ray beams. Surrogate x-ray qualities that corresponded to these scattered spectra were tabulated. Results: Radiation shielding materials incorporating Bi 2 O 3 were found to provide <b>equivalent</b> or superior <b>attenuation</b> compared with commercial Pb-based and non-Pb materials across the 60 - 130 kVp energy range. Measurements were made for single layers of the Bi 2 O 3 compound and for bilayers where the ordering was low atomic number (Z) layer closest to x-ray sourcehigh Z (Bi 2 O 3) layer farthest from the x-ray source. Narrow-beam Standard test methods which do not include the contribution from fluorescence overestimated the attenuating capabilities of Pb and non-Pb materials. Measurements of a newly developed, quick-drying, and easily removable Bi 2 O 3 -loaded hand cream demonstrated better attenuation capabilities than commercial Bi 2 O 3 -loaded gloves. Scattered radiation measurements and MC simulations illustrated that the spectra resulting from 900 scattering of primary x-ray beam qualities can be approximated by surrogate x-ray qualities which are more representative of the radiation actually encountered by IR physicians. A table of surrogate qualities of the eight ASTM F 2547 - 06 Standard qualities was compiled. Conclusions: New non-Pb compound materials, particularly single layers or bilayers incorporating Bi 2 O 3, can reduce the weight of radiation protection materials while providing equivalent or better protection compared to Pb-based materials. Attenuation measurements in geometries that exclude the contribution from fluorescence substantially underestimate the quantity of transmitted radiation. A new Bi 2 O 3 -loaded hand cream demonstrated a novel and effective approach for hand protection. Standard testing protocols for radiation protection materials used by IR physicians specify a wider kVp range than is necessary. A more realistic range would acknowledge the lower kVp resulting from scatter and allow IR physicians to confidently utilize lighter-weight materials while still receiving adequate protection. Standards protocols incorporating the adjustments described in this work would maintain the safety of IR personnel and lessen the physical repercussions of long hours wearing unnecessarily heavy radiation protection garments. 9 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.
