25|$|Between {{the source}} and compile level, {{directives}} and <b>build</b> <b>flags</b> {{can be used to}} tune performance options in the source code and compiler respectively, such as using preprocessor defines to disable unneeded software features, optimizing for specific processor models or hardware capabilities, or predicting branching, for instance. Source-based software distribution systems such as BSD's Ports and Gentoo's Portage can take advantage of this form of optimization.|$|R
50|$|The {{project was}} {{initiated}} by the Rainbow Casino Corporation (RCC), made up of John A. Barrett and Leigh Seippel. Hospitality Franchise Systems agreed to provide $7.5 million in financing, and to franchise a hotel at the property under its Days Inn brand. Six <b>Flags</b> agreed to <b>build</b> a 10-acre theme park named Pennants. United Gaming (later known as Alliance Gaming, and then Bally Technologies) signed on to manage the casino.|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. The 4 th Axis of the European Fisheries Funds {{presents}} {{a new approach}} {{in the way the}} European Union supports its fisheries sector. This Axis is devoted to the sustainable development of fisheries areas through a territorial approach. It dwells very much on the experience of the LEADER initiative which has successfully been used under the EARDF to support diversification of rural areas over the past 20 years. By shifting the focus of the support on the territory and the community away from the traditional sectoral approach, this method paves the way for the integration of the fisheries sector into the wider economic context and helps reducing the socio economic dependency of the area from a single activity. The specificity of the approach does not rely so much on the type of activities funded (even though they usually go beyond sectoral type of initiatives) but mostly by the way projects are developed. At the basis of the approach are local partnerships (Fisheries Local Action Groups or <b>FLAGs)</b> <b>build</b> by the communities themselves, which must be representative of the local social structure and that are in charge of developing a local development strategy. Call for tenders will then be opened by the local partnerships in order to select projects that fit within their strategy. Key to the success of this initiative is the bottom up approach where initiatives for the overall strategy and projects lie with the local actors. The first FLAGs have started their activities mid 2009 and due to the bottom up principle present a wide variety of organizational structures, strategies and projects. The first results of this initiative will be presented and the opportunities it represents {{in the context of the}} reform of the CFP will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a taxonomy for open hypermedia systems. The {{purpose of the}} Flag 1 taxonomy is manifold: (1) to provide a framework to classify and concisely describe individual systems, (2) to characterize what an open hypermedia system is, (3) to {{provide a framework for}} comparing different systems in a system independent way, and (4) to provide an overview of the design space of open hypermedia systems. The <b>Flag</b> taxonomy <b>builds</b> on the achievements of the Dexter model. It extends the terminology of the Dexter model to adequately cover issues that relate to open hypermedia systems such as integration and use of thirdparty applications to edit and display hypermedia components. Two of the most prominent open hypermedia systems, DeVise Hypermedia and Microcosm, are used as case studies. The Flag taxonomy is used to compare these systems on a carefully selected set of aspects that distinguish open hypermedia systems from other hypermedia systems. KEYWORDS: Open hypermedia systems, [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|For every tank {{destroyed}} or <b>flag</b> captured, players <b>build</b> up {{a number of}} Crystals and XP (rank experience points) which they are rewarded at a match's conclusion. Players' number of received Crystals is based on their fulfillment level of three criteria: XP gained in the match, the number of tanks they destroyed, and their K/D ratio (players' number of enemy kills in respect to their number of deaths at enemy hands). The amount of XP players gain has {{its own set of}} rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.|$|R
40|$|As {{computers}} {{become increasingly}} mobile, users demand more functionality, longer battery-life, and better perfor-mance from mobile devices. In response, chipset fabrica-tors {{are focusing on}} elegant architectures to provide solu-tions that are both low-power and high-performance. Since these architectures rely on unique x 86 extensions rather than fast clock speeds and large caches, careful thought must be placed into effective optimization strategies for not only user applications, but also the kernel itself, as the typical default optimizations used by modern compilers do not often {{take advantage of these}} specialized features. Focusing on the Intel Diamondville platform, this paper presents a genetic algorithm that evolves the compiler <b>flags</b> needed to <b>build</b> a Linux kernel that exhibits reduced response times...|$|R

5000|$|In 1848, {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in that area. Initially, one of Sutter’s most trusted employees, James W. Marshall, found gold at Sutter’s Mill. It started when Sutter hired Marshall, a New Jersey native who had served with John C. Frémont in the Bear <b>Flag</b> revolt, to <b>build</b> a water-driven sawmill in Coloma, along the American River. Sutter was intent on building a city on his property (not yet named [...] ), including housing and a wharf on the Sacramento River, and needed lumber for the construction. One morning, as Marshall inspected the tailrace for silt and debris, he noticed some gold nuggets and brought them to Sutter's attention. Together, they read an encyclopedia entry on gold and performed primitive tests to confirm whether it was precious metal. Sutter concluded that it was, in fact, gold, {{but he was very}} anxious that the discovery not disrupt his plans for construction and farming. At the same time, he set about gaining legitimate title to as much land near the discovery as possible.|$|R
30|$|Since its origin, the Lloyd’s Shipping Index {{reports on}} a daily or weekly basis the latest {{movement}} of each vessel between two or more ports, including dates of departure and arrival, tonnage capacity, operating company, <b>flag,</b> date of <b>build,</b> and additional comments {{in the case of}} damage, loss, or war event. The somewhat difficult readability of the older publications and the limitations of existing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software forced us to concentrate our efforts on the extraction of vessel calls by port and inter-port link. The choice was made to extract one entire publication every five years or so between 1890 and 2000, {{a couple of years before}} the paper version ceased to exist. From 2009 onwards, such data is only available in expensive digital format. We believe that this period is a relevant time frame to cover the most important transitions from sail to steam, combustion, containerization, and mega-carriers, with a good balance between the periods pre- and post-containerization. Nowadays, the Lloyd’s company insures about 80 % of the world fleet and therefore is historically a leader on the market with a monopoly power, centralizing most of the information on maritime transport flows.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Cricklade Town Council (with {{help from}} Cricklade Bloomers) built a town garden {{on an open}} space near Waylands called Saxons Rest which {{included}} two large flag poles. This however caused some controversy among {{the residents of the}} High Street, who considered that their view across the open space would be spoilt and that there would be noise from the halyards on the <b>flag</b> poles. The <b>build</b> went ahead despite a significant number of people signing a petition against it. The majority of the opinion was against the two flag poles, which many residents felt were a needless and pretentious feature. Once built the consensus was that it was an attractive feature in the town and enhanced the area. The overriding feeling was that the town's funds would be best directed elsewhere. One of the suggestions voiced was the prevention of crime and vandalism in the town, which was on the rise. The open space {{to the rear of the}} garden is a scheduled monument as this is the location of the Saxon town walls which although no longer visible, are considered historically important. Despite this Saxons Rest was built, which in turn put to rest the remains of the Saxons' walls.|$|R
