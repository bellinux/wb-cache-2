Cairistiona accused, probably falsely, her sister of stealing a large <b>hunk</b> <b>of</b> cheese, and tried to extract a confession from her, by lowering her off a cliff with a plaid tied round her neck. The plaid slipped, and ended up strangling her sister, which she had never intended to do. Wracked with remorse, she confessed to the accident, {{but this was not}} enough for the islanders, who decided to drown her, by throwing her in a sack and laying her on the rock, which still bears her name.|$|E

When Peter thought {{what he would do}} with all his money from the MacArthur Genius Grant, he thought of legally buying Cloris Leachman, forcing her to juggle.

Macfadyen at the time was known {{for his role in the}} British television spy series Spooks, but had no recognition internationally. A fan of the actor's television work, Wright called Macfadyen [...] "a proper manly man... I didn't want a pretty boy kind of actor. His properties were the ones I felt I needed [...] Matthew's a great big <b>hunk</b> <b>of</b> a guy." [...] Macfadyen did not read the novel before filming, preferring to rely solely on the script.|$|E
500|$|In October 1986, Slayer {{embarked}} on the Reign in Pain world tour, with Overkill in the US, and Malice in Europe. The band was added as the opening act on W.A.S.P.'s US tour, but just one month in, drummer Lombardo left the band: [...] "I wasn't making any money. I figured {{if we were}} gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid." [...] To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987. At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a cover version of Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] for the film Less Than Zero. Although the band was {{not happy with the}} final product, Hanneman deeming it [...] "a poor representation of Slayer" [...] and King labeling it [...] "a <b>hunk</b> <b>of</b> shit," [...] it was one of their first songs to garner radio airplay.|$|E

Throughout his exploits, Drummond is joined by several of his ex-army friends and colleagues, including Algy Longworth (who would appear {{in many of the}} films, as Drummond's sidekick), MC; Toby Sinclair, VC; Peter Darrell and Ted Jerningham. Dummond's ex-batman from his military days, James Denny, runs Drummond's flat on Half-Moon Street in Mayfair, London, along with Mrs Denny. (Denny appeared as Drummond's sidekick in the radio series, a version of the character named Tenny appeared in the films) Drummond is a gentleman with a private income; he is also construed as [...] "a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact [...] the war", although the character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis, author of rival gentleman detective Nigel Strangeways, as an [...] "unspeakable public school bully".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive reviews. Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} song a positive review, {{calling it a}} [...] "club banger". Thomas Gonlianpoulous of Spin commended Swizz Beatz' [...] "bombastic production", Wayne's [...] "energetic yet nonsensical rap", and Brown's [...] "joyful, brisk vocals." [...] Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song, serving as lead single, says [...] "Brown's promise {{for the future is}} to be an altogether more interesting kind of RB& artist." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly referred to the song as a [...] "swaggering" [...] lead single. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times referred to the song as a type that he has made his specialty, and called it an [...] "electric, brassy collaboration." [...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the song [...] "a brutal, tuneless <b>hunk</b> <b>of</b> industrial R - as musically ugly as something like 'With You' was pretty", he said [...] "for that matter, this track rocks", commenting [...] "Whatever you may think of him, you can't deny that Chris Brown lacks balls."

500|$|Among {{contemporary}} reviews, Time magazine declared [...] "Something" [...] to be {{the best}} track on Abbey Road, while John Mendelsohn wrote in Rolling Stone: [...] "George's vocal, containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before, is one of many highlights on his 'Something,' some of the others being more excellent drum work, a dead catchy guitar line, perfectly subdued strings, and an unusually nice melody. Both his and Joe Cocker's version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it." [...] Writing in Saturday Review magazine, Ellen Sander described [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "certainly {{one of the most beautiful}} songs George Harrison has ever written" [...] and added: [...] "He feels his way through the song, instinctively cutting through its body and into the core, emoting so clearly and so gracefully that at the moment he peals 'I don't know, I don't know,' it is shown that even what is not known can be understood." [...] In his review of the single, Derek Johnson of the NME lauded the track as [...] "a real quality <b>hunk</b> <b>of</b> pop" [...] with a [...] "strident lead guitar which exudes a mean and moody quality". Johnson stated his regret that Harrison [...] "isn't featured more regularly as a singer", and concluded of [...] "Something": [...] "It's a song that grows on you, and mark my words, it will – in a big way!" ...|$|E

500|$|In 1920 McNeile {{published}} Bull-Dog Drummond, whose eponymous hero—a {{member of}} [...] "the Breed"—became {{his most famous}} creation. He had first written Drummond as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine, but the character was not successful and was changed for the novel, which was a thriller. Captain Hugh [...] "Bulldog" [...] Drummond DSO, MC was described in the novel's sub-title as [...] "a demobilised officer who found peace dull" [...] after service during the First World War with the fictional Loamshire Regiment. Drummond went on to appear in ten full-length novels by McNeile and a further seven by his friend Gerard Fairlie. The character was an amalgam of Fairlie, himself, and his idea of an English gentleman. Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Drummond was characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an [...] "apparently brainless <b>hunk</b> <b>of</b> a man", {{who was also a}} gentleman with a private income; he could also be construed as [...] "a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact [...] the war". The character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis, author of rival gentleman detective Nigel Strangeways, as an [...] "unspeakable public school bully". Drummond's main adversary across four novels is Carl Peterson, a master criminal with no national allegiance, who is often accompanied by his wife, Irma. Irma is described by Jonathon Green as [...] "the slinky epitome of a twenties 'vamp, and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, [...] "a true femme fatale". After Carl Peterson's death in The Final Count, Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife—whom he had met in Bull-Dog Drummond—with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase. Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile's books, and in a further five by Fairlie.|$|E

[...] Dana Stevens of the Slate magazine is also among those who gave the film a positive review, she stated: [...] "Blood Diamond is a by-the-numbers message picture, to be sure... But the director, Edward Zwick, is craftsman enough that the pace never slackens, the chase scenes thrill, and the battle scenes sicken. And if it makes viewers think twice about buying their sweethearts that hard-won <b>hunk</b> <b>of</b> ice for Christmas, so much the better." [...] Ty Burr of the Boston Globe, after giving the film a positive review, stated: [...] "As an entry in the advocacy-entertainment genre, in which glamorous movie stars bring {{our attention to the}} plight of the less fortunate, Blood Diamond is superior to 2003's ridiculous Beyond Borders while looking strident and obvious next to last year's The Constant Gardener.|$|E
2500|$|This {{implies that}} a [...] "traditional combination" [...] of bread, beer, cheese, and pickle was popular before {{rationing}} in the United Kingdom (during and after World War II).

Only one year later, in June 1957, another edition of the Monthly Bulletin of the Brewers' Society, referred to a ploughman's lunch using exactly that name, and said that it consisted of [...] "cottage bread, cheese, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, cold sausages and, of course, beer". The Glasgow newspaper The Bulletin from 15 April 1958 and The Times from 29 April 1958 refer to a ploughman's lunch consisting of bread, cheese and pickle.|$|E
