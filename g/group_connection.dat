50|$|In September 1985, Apple {{established}} the Apple User <b>Group</b> <b>Connection</b> (AUGC) {{in response to}} input from users in community User Groups including Boston Computer Society and Berkeley Macintosh Users Group, along with user communities within educational, science, and business organizations.|$|E
50|$|Users' {{groups may}} be {{organized}} around a particular brand of current hardware (IBM, Macintosh) or current software and operating systems (Linux, Microsoft Windows, Clipper), or more rarely may {{be dedicated to}} obsolescent systems or historical computers, for example Apple II, PDP-11, Osborne. An example of an early user group is the Apple User <b>Group</b> <b>Connection.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Apple User <b>Group</b> <b>Connection</b> (AUGC) was {{established}} in 1985 by Apple and led by Apple employee Ellen Leanse. AUGC was formed in response to concerns from users in community user groups that, with release of the Macintosh, development for existing Apple II and Apple III computers was compromised. The idea was for Apple to share information with its user community directly, rather than through the more traditional support and distribution channels. The organization successfully encouraged Apple to pursue early internet technology such as bulletin board systems and ARPANET.|$|E

50|$|Macintosh User Groups (MUGs) are a {{group of}} people who use Macintosh {{computers}} made by Apple Inc. or other manufacturers and who use the Apple Macintosh operating system (OS). These groups are primarily locally situated and meet regularly to discuss Macintosh computers, the Mac OS, software and peripherals that work with these computers. Some groups focus on the older versions of Mac OS, up to Mac OS 9, but the majority now focus on the current version of Mac OS, Mac OS X. These user groups began with the formation of the Apple User <b>Group</b> <b>Connection.</b>|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to see the}} {{influence}} of open-ended and scientific approach to improving mathematical connection ability of elementary school students. This study is a quasi experimental research, with the design used is "pretest-posttest two treatman design". The population {{as well as the}} sample in this research is all the students of grade v of elementary school in SDN 016 Bangkinang Kota. The instrument used in data collection is a mathematical connection test of the description form. The result of the research shows that the learning of mathematics both open-ended and scientific approach have the same effect in improving mathematic connection ability of elementary school students. If reviewed under the category of student ability, high <b>group</b> <b>connection</b> capabilities with a scientific approach are as good as high-group connection capabilities in an open-ended approach. The ability of a moderate <b>group</b> <b>connection</b> with a scientific approach is better than <b>group</b> <b>connection</b> capability is in an open-ended approach. Also in low-group connection capabilities with a scientific approach as well as a low-group connection capability in an open-ended approach. Based on the results of this study, then the learning of mathematics with scientific and open-ended approach can be used as one of the learning that can be applied in an effort to improve the ability of students, especially the ability of mathematical connections of elementary school students.

40|$|Synapse {{crossbar}} is {{an elementary}} structure in Neuromorphic Computing Systems (NCS). However, the limited size of crossbars and heavy routing congestion impedes the NCS implementations of big neural networks. In this paper, we propose a two-step framework (namely, group scissor) to scale NCS designs to big neural networks. The {{first step is}} rank clipping, which integrates low-rank approximation into the training to reduce total crossbar area. The second step is <b>group</b> <b>connection</b> deletion, which structurally prunes connections to reduce routing congestion between crossbars. Tested on convolutional neural networks of LeNet on MNIST database and ConvNet on CIFAR- 10 database, our experiments show significant reduction of crossbar area and routing area in NCS designs. Without accuracy loss, rank clipping reduces total crossbar area to 13. 62 % and 51. 81 % in the NCS designs of LeNet and ConvNet, respectively. Following rank clipping, <b>group</b> <b>connection</b> deletion further reduces the routing area of LeNet and ConvNet to 8. 1 % and 52. 06 %, respectively. Comment: Accepted in DAC 201...|$|E

40|$|As deep nets are {{increasingly}} used in applications suited for mobile devices, a fundamental dilemma becomes apparent: {{the trend in}} deep learning is to grow models to absorb ever-increasing data set sizes; however mobile devices are designed with very little memory and cannot store such large models. We present a novel network architecture, HashedNets, that exploits inherent redundancy in neural networks to achieve drastic reductions in model sizes. HashedNets uses a low-cost hash function to randomly <b>group</b> <b>connection</b> weights into hash buckets, and all connections within the same hash bucket share a single parameter value. These parameters are tuned {{to adjust to the}} HashedNets weight sharing architecture with standard backprop during training. Our hashing procedure introduces no additional memory overhead, and we demonstrate on several benchmark data sets that HashedNets shrink the storage requirements of neural networks substantially while mostly preserving generalization performance...|$|E

40|$|Connection {{coefficients}} {{between different}} orthonormal bases satisfy two discrete orthogonal relations themselves. For classical orthogonal polynomials whose weights are invariant under {{the action of}} the symmetric <b>group,</b> <b>connection</b> coefficients between a basis consisting of products of hypergeometric functions and another basis obtained from the first one by applying a permutation are studied. For the Jacobi polynomials on the simplex, it is shown that the connection coefficients can be expressed in terms of Tratnik's multivariable Racah polynomials and their weights. This gives, in particular, a new interpretation of the hidden duality between the variables and the degree indices of the Racah polynomials, which {{lies at the heart of}} their bispectral properties. These techniques also lead to explicit formulas for connection coefficients of Hahn and Krawtchouk polynomials of several variables, as well as for orthogonal polynomials on balls and spheres...|$|E
40|$|We discuss various {{symmetry}} {{properties of}} the reparametrization invariant toy model of a free non-relativistic particle and show that its commutativity and noncommutativity (NC) properties are the artifact of the underlying symmetry transformations. For {{the case of the}} symmetry transformations corresponding to the noncommutative geometry, the mass parameter of the toy model turns out to be noncommutative in nature. By exploiting the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) symmetry transformations, we demonstrate the existence of the NC and show its cohomological equivalence with its commutative counterpart. A connection between the usual gauge symmetry transformations corresponding to the commutative geometry and the quantum groups, defined on the phase space, is also established for the present model at the level of Poisson bracket structure.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} meanings of the Mātauranga Māori concept of mana {{and its relationship to}} psychodynamic psychotherapy. Using a critical review of the literature located within a Kaupapa Māori research framework it undertakes an analysis of the meaning of mana. This meaning is recognised through the Māori concept of self interconnecting with spiritual power, authority, self image, and <b>group</b> <b>connection,</b> all of which involve merging the person with the environment. Associations between mana and the self in psychodynamic literature were critically reviewed, revealing similarities and divergences between these two world views. A psychodynamically informed mana enhancing psychotherapy is explored placing mana at the centre. The review contends that psychodynamic psychotherapy can become more culturally embracing through utilising mana enhancing values and extending relationships to a wider group context and the physical as well as interpersonal environment...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{developed}} to merge and disband groups in IP Multicast while retaining the original setup of their groups. It extends the semantic ofjoining or leaving a membershipfrom discrete members to group members in IP network. It has minimal impact on existing multicast trees {{and does not}} affect the operations of multicast routing protocols and the Internet Group Management (IGMP).

A prototype router and testbed have been implemented successfully to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution and for performance evaluation. The proposed <b>group</b> <b>connection</b> management fills the necessary gap in the existing IP Multicast architecture, where the lack of graceful merging and disbanding methods present an obstacle for more creative and complex usage of group applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{gauge theory}} of gravity {{based on a}} {{nonlinear}} realization (NLR) of the local Conform-Affine (CA) group of symmetry transformations is presented. The coframe fields and gauge connections of the theory are obtained. The tetrads and Lorentz group metric are used to induce a spacetime metric. The inhomogenously transforming (under the Lorentz <b>group)</b> <b>connection</b> coefficients serve as gravitational gauge potentials used to define covariant derivatives accommodating minimal coupling of matter and gauge fields. On the other hand, the tensor valued connection forms serve as auxillary dynamical fields associated with the dilation, special conformal and deformational (shear) degrees of freedom inherent in the bundle manifold. The bundle curvature of the theory is determined. Boundary topological invariants are constructed. They serve as a prototype (source free) gravitational Lagrangian. The Bianchi identities, covariant field equations and gauge currents are obtained. Comment: 24 pages. to appear in IJGMM...|$|E
