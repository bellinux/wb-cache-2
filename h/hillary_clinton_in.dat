5|$|Pritzker was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Obama's political career, helping to finance his 2004 Senate campaign. Early in the democratic presidential primary, Pritzker's financing helped Obama's candidacy survive when Obama was trailing <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>in</b> the polls. Pritzker remained a major fundraiser for Obama during the 2008 democratic primary and raised millions overall for his White House bid. She served as the national finance chair of Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. Under her direction, the campaign reached out to small donors. Pritzker also hosted more lavish fundraisers {{as part of her}} effort to raise money.|$|E

He then defeated John McCain, also a senator, in the general election to become President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of placing prayer {{notes in the}} Western Wall has also been adopted by Christian pilgrims and people of other faiths. Foreign dignitaries who have publicly placed a kvitel in the Western Wall include Pope John Paul II in 2000, U.S. Senator <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>in</b> 2005, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008, U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008, and U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann in 2012. Pope Francis inserted a handwritten Spanish language text of the Lord's Prayer in the Wall during his visit in 2014. On May 22, 2017, Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. President to visit the Wall; he also inserted a note.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{has been}} {{described}} as entertaining, controversial, and politically incorrect. He supported <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>in</b> the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and questioned Barack Obama's appeal to white voters. Ford later apologized for his comments, stating that any Democrat could win and that he had supported other African American candidates for president in the past. Ford's comments prompted a primary challenge in 2008 from Charleston lawyer Dwayne Green. In the beginning of his campaign, Green managed to raise double the amount of campaign funds Ford raised, and although Ford's fundraising improved he for the first time attended a candidate forum to receive free publicity, because his campaign had financial difficulty resulting from the contested primary and a fire in his home. Green was defeated in the primary election by a wide margin. Ford praised Obama's election in November 2008, but criticized South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn's family for allegedly attempting to profit off Obama's victory.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1999, President Bill Clinton offered {{conditional}} clemency to sixteen {{members of}} the FALN convicted for conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to bomb-making, and sedition, {{as well as for}} firearms and explosives violations. None of the sixteen were convicted of bombings or any crime which injured another person, and all of the sixteen had served nineteen years or longer in prison, which was a longer sentence than such crimes typically received, according to the White House. Clinton offered clemency, on condition that the prisoners renounce violence, at the appeal of 10 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, President Jimmy Carter, the Archbishop of New York, and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico. The commutation was opposed by U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and criticised by many including former victims of FALN terrorist activities, the Fraternal Order of Police, and members of Congress. <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>in</b> her campaign for Senator also criticised the commutation, although she had earlier been supportive.|$|E
