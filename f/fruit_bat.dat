5|$|The bat {{species that}} occur in the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico are: greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus), Antillean ghost-faced bat (Mormoops blainvillii), Parnell's mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii), sooty mustached bat (Pteronotus quadridens), Jamaican <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> (Artibeus jamaicensis), Antillean <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> (Brachyphylla cavernarum), buffy flower bat (Erophylla sezekorni bombifrons), Leach's single leaf bat (Monophyllus redmani), red <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> (Stenoderma rufum), big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), velvety free-tailed bat (Molossus molossus), and Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis).|$|E
5|$|Bats play an {{important}} role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations. Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; the area with the highest species richness is the Caribbean National Forest, where eleven species occur. The red fig-eating bat (red <b>fruit</b> <b>bat),</b> endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays {{an important}} role in the ecology of tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of bulletwood (Manilkara bidentata). Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces (guano) since many of the invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers, detritivores or predators of the former two.|$|E
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E

50|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>bats</b> are an {{extremely}} popular type of bat {{that can also}} be called megabats. The bats originate from tropical regions of the Old World. They don't hibernate and since they dislike the cold, tropical regions suit them best. <b>Fruit</b> <b>bats</b> diet includes <b>fruit</b> and nectar. During their Circadian flight, <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> gather 1.5 to 3 times their body weight in food. Certain types of <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> have short jaws and powerful teeth to pierce into fruit. Others have long tongues and snouts to reach pollen and nectar. They can search up to 30 mi to find food. Some types of <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> can have a 5 feet wing span, the largest of all <b>bats.</b> Other <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> only have a 6 centimeter long wing span. All but a few types of <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> are nocturnal. The ones occupying The Monfort Bat Sanctuary are nocturnal. These bats are quite rare because they are killed for food. Other predators include crows, rats, 10 ft-long pythons, and lizards. Usually <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> can survive these creature attacks. Their major predators are feral dogs and cats.|$|R

25|$|Wahlberg's epauletted <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> (Epomophorus wahlbergi) is {{a species}} of megabat in the family Pteropodidae. It is {{commonly}} found across southern Africa.|$|E
50|$|Megabats {{constitute}} the suborder Megachiroptera, and its only family Pteropodidae {{of the order}} Chiroptera (bats). They are also called <b>fruit</b> <b>bats,</b> Old World <b>fruit</b> <b>bats,</b> or, especially the genera Acerodon and Pteropus, flying foxes. Old World <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> are {{not found in the}} Americas, Western Europe, northwest Africa and southwest Australia. Compared to insectivorous <b>bats,</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> are relatively large and, with some exceptions, do not navigate by echolocation. They are herbivores and rely on their keen senses of sight and smell to locate food.|$|R
2500|$|Most <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> {{are larger}} than insectivorous bats or Microchiroptera, however {{there are a number}} of small <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> also. The {{smallest}} species is [...] long and thus smaller than some microbats, for example, the Mauritian tomb bat. The largest attain a wingspan of , and weigh as much as [...] Most <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> have large eyes, allowing them to orient themselves visually in twilight and inside caves and forests.|$|R
5000|$|Harpy <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> {{are found}} on the Philippine islands of Biliran, Maripipi, Camiguin, Leyte, Southern Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Negros, Cebu, Masbate, and Samar. They reside in primary (old growth), secondary, and lightly {{disturbed}} montane forests. Their range in elevation is between sea level and 1,800m, preferring to stay in habitats of [...] "mid-elevation (around 500m)". As with other <b>fruit</b> <b>bats,</b> harpy <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> are crepuscular and [...] "roost in trees" [...] instead of caves.|$|R
25|$|The greater short-nosed <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> {{is similar}} to the lesser short-nosed <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> but has {{generally}} longer forearms, longer ears and a much longer skull. P. lucasi has only one pair of lower incisors, a lack of white edges to the ears and a usually greyer color. C. horsfieldi is larger, with heavily cusped molars. M. ecaudatus usually has a more upturned nose, lacks a bright collar and tail, and has only one pair of lower incisors.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>bats</b> {{have been}} found to act as {{reservoirs}} for ebola virus, though the bats themselves sometimes have no signs of infection. Three species of bats have tested positive for ebola, but had no symptoms of the virus. [...] This indicates that the bats may be acting as a reservoir for the virus. Of the infected animals identified during these field collections, immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific for ebola virus was detected in hammer-headed <b>bats,</b> Franquet's epauletted <b>fruit</b> <b>bats,</b> and little collared <b>fruit</b> <b>bats.</b>|$|R
25|$|Other notable animals include: spotted deer, jackal, bonnet monkey, wild boar, monitor lizard, short-nosed <b>fruit</b> <b>bat,</b> small Indian civet, star tortoise, Indian grey mongoose, black-naped hare, {{jungle cat}} and feral pony.|$|E
25|$|Their {{sense of}} smell is excellent. In {{contrast}} to the microbats, the fruit bats do not use echolocation (with one exception, the Egyptian <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> Rousettus egyptiacus, which uses high-pitched tongue clicks to navigate in caves).|$|E

25|$|Although it is {{not entirely}} clear how Ebola {{initially}} spreads from animals to humans, the spread is believed to involve direct contact with an infected wild animal or <b>fruit</b> <b>bat.</b> Besides bats, other wild animals sometimes infected with EBOV include several monkey species, chimpanzees, gorillas, baboons and duikers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the greater}} short-nosed <b>fruit</b> <b>bat,</b> {{copulation}} by males is dorsoventral and the females lick the shaft or {{the base of}} the male's penis, but not the glans, which has already penetrated the vagina. While the females do this, the penis is not withdrawn and research has shown a positive relationship between length of the time that the penis is licked and the duration of copulation. Post copulation genital grooming has also been observed.|$|E
25|$|Oral sex {{has been}} {{observed}} in the animal kingdom among many species.

25|$|The hammer-headed bat is one {{of three}} species of African <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> that are thought to serve as {{reservoirs}} for the Ebola virus. Although antibodies against Ebola virus and fragments of viral RNA have been isolated from these bats, the virus itself has not been, so other species might be more important in its transmission.
