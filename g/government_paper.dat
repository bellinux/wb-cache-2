500|$|Despite its {{relatively}} high price, the comic {{was an immediate}} success; released on 14April 1950, and despite <b>government</b> <b>paper</b> quotas, the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. [...] Eight of its twenty pages were presented in four-colour rotogravure. [...] Eagle was designed to entertain and educate its readers; although a typical issue might contain such characters as Cavendish Brown, Harris Tweed, Jack O'Lantern, Storm Nelson and Luck of the Legion, it also included a special news section, a sports page, and school stories. [...] Each issue also featured a centre-spread full-colour cutaway illustration {{of a piece of}} machinery—the first detailed {{the inner workings of the}} British Rail 18000 locomotive. [...] Such high quality strips as Riders of the Range and P.C.49 helped ensure a weekly circulation of almost a million copies, but it was the adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, which most captivated readers. [...] Created by Hampson—now a full-time staff artist with his own team—Dan Dare was the UK's first science-fiction comic strip of any significance. [...] Readers were thrilled by the square-jawed British spaceman's weekly exploits, and his struggles with The Mekon.|$|E
500|$|Evans was {{promoted}} to group captain in January 1969 and appointed Director of Air Force Plans. In this position he proposed and organised the gift of 23 of the RAAF's old CAC Sabres to the Indonesian Air Force, following an earlier presentation of 10Sabres to the Royal Malaysian Air Force. He completed studies at the Royal College of Defence Studies, London, in 1972. [...] Returning to Australia, he {{was promoted}} to air commodore and appointed Director-General Plans and Policy, Air Force, in January 1973. He served as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Amberley from February 1975 until April 1977. In this role he qualified as a pilot on the recently delivered F-111C swing-wing bomber, as well as the UH-1 Iroquois helicopter. Following his tour as Amberley base commander, Evans {{was promoted to}} air vice marshal and became Chief of Air Force Operations (CAFOPS). He held this newly created position for the next two years, broken by a temporary posting as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff between January and August 1978. As CAFOPS, Evans played a major part in developing the RAAF's plans for the defence of Australia. Following America's announcement in the 1969 Guam Doctrine that its allies would have to assume greater self-reliance in their military affairs, Australia's strategic thought underwent a change from its earlier policy of [...] "forward defence" [...] to a more localised defensive posture. While the consensus among RAAF planning staff was to adopt a [...] "repulsion" [...] concept of attacking an enemy force along the air and sea approaches to northern Australia, Evans considered that this did not go far enough in exploiting the long-range offensive capabilities of such aircraft as the F-111. Convinced that Australia's numerically small forces would be hard-pressed to dislodge an invader that had gained a foothold on the continent, he refined the [...] "repulsion" [...] stance into what he termed an [...] "anti-lodgement" [...] strategy, focussing on defeating the enemy at its potential staging bases north of Australia and then, as a last resort, on the approaches closer to home. The Air Force's role in shaping an overall strategy that took advantage of the [...] "air-sea gap" [...] was later acknowledged in the Federal <b>government</b> <b>paper</b> The Defence of Australia 1987. Evans was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia on 26January 1981 for his achievements as CAFOPS.|$|E

2500|$|A UK <b>government</b> <b>paper</b> on {{security}} stated that Police Scotland would lose {{access to the}} intelligence apparatus of the UK, including MI5, SIS and GCHQ. The paper also said that an independent Scottish state would need to build its own security infrastructure. Theresa May commented that an independent Scotland would have access to less security capability, but would not necessarily face a reduced threat. In 2013, Allan Burnett, former head of intelligence with Strathclyde Police and Scotland's counter-terrorism co-ordinator until 2010, said that [...] "an independent Scotland would face less of a threat, intelligence institutions will be readily created, and allies will remain allies". Peter Jackson, professor of security at the University of Glasgow, agreed that Special Branch could form a [...] "suitable nucleus" [...] of a Scottish equivalent of MI5, and that Scotland could forego creating an equivalent of MI6, instead [...] "relying on pooled intelligence or diplomatic open sources" [...] like Canada or the Nordic countries. Baroness Ramsay, a Labour peer and former case officer with MI6, said that the Scottish government's standpoint on intelligence was [...] "extremely naïve" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "not going to be as simple as they think". Nicola Sturgeon stated that Scotland would create its own security service like MI5 to work alongside police and tackle terrorism, cyber attacks and serious organised crime. She also stated that creating an external intelligence agency would remain an option.|$|E

60|$|Such a power, in whomsoever vested, is an {{intolerable}} evil. All {{variations in}} the value of the circulating medium are mischievous: they disturb existing contracts and expectations, and the liability to such changes renders every pecuniary engagement of long date entirely precarious. The person who buys for himself, or gives to another, an annuity of one [hundred dollars], does not know whether it will be equivalent to [two hundred or to fifty dollars] a few years hence. Great as this evil would be if it depended only on accident, it is still greater when placed at the arbitrary disposal of an individual or a body of individuals, who may have any kind or degree of interest to be served by an artificial fluctuation in fortunes, and who have at any rate a strong interest in issuing as much as possible, each issue being in itself a source of profit—not to add, that the issuers may have, and, in the case of a <b>government</b> <b>paper,</b> always have, a direct interest in lowering the value of the currency, because it is the medium in which their own debts are computed.|$|E
6000|$|Governor Macquarie was an iron-handed man, {{who could}} not brook opposition, or endure any scheme that did not {{originate}} with himself. So when Mr. Marsden laid before him a project for diminishing the appalling misery and vice in which the utter neglect of Government left the female convicts, he acknowledged the letter, but did not act upon it. After waiting eighteen months {{for him to take}} some measure, the chaplain sent a statement of the condition of these poor creatures to the Colonial Office; it was laid before Parliament, and Lord Bathurst, the Colonial Secretary, sent a letter of inquiry to the Governor. Macquarie's fury was intense on finding that the chaplain had dared to look above and beyond him; and he gave a willing encouragement to whatever resisted the attempts of Marsden at establishing some sense of religion and morality. After refusing to accept his resignation of his post as a magistrate, he dismissed him ignominiously, and all the underlings of Government knew that any attack from them would be regarded with favour. A vile and slanderous letter, full of infamous libels, not only against Samuel Marsden, as a man and a Christian priest, but against the missionaries, and signed [...] "Philo-free," [...] appeared in the Sydney Herald, the <b>Government</b> <b>paper,</b> and was traced to Macquarie's own secretary! The libel was such that Mr. Marsden felt it due to his cause to bring an action against the publisher, and in spite of the prejudice against him, after a trial of three days, he gained a complete victory and damages of 200 pounds; but the newspaper published such a false and scandalous report of the trial that he was obliged a second time to prosecute, and again obtained a verdict in his favour.|$|E
