5|$|As {{the merger}} of the AFL and NFL became {{effective}} in 1970, the unions agreed to meet {{for the first time}} in January of that year. The NFL players wanted Ed Meador—who was the president-elect of the NFLPA prior to the merger—to become president of the newly combined association while the AFL players wanted <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp.</b> The compromise was John Mackey of the Baltimore Colts, an NFL team before the merger, which was grouped with former AFL teams in the American Football Conference. The AFL players agreed to Mackey's election on the condition that former AFL player Alan Miller would become general counsel. Though the NFL owners were open to recognizing the union, their representatives requested lawyers not be present during negotiations, something the players were unwilling to agree to. This prompted the players to petition the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for union certification.|$|E

5000|$|Ralph Benko {{wrote in}} Forbes that <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp's</b> [...] "mantle has fallen, at least provisionally, upon Herman Cain’s shoulders. Cain rises to it.

In 9-9-9 An Army of Davids, coauthored with his senior economic advisor Rich Lowrie, Cain devotes {{over a quarter of}} the book to passionate advocacy of the gold standard." ...|$|R
25|$|LaHaye {{also took}} more direct roles in presidential politics. He {{supported}} Ronald Reagan's elections as United States president. He was a co-chairman of <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp's</b> 1988 presidential bid but {{was removed from}} the campaign after four days when anti-Catholic views which he had expressed became known.

25|$|Overall, Mitt Romney {{holds the}} record of winning more CPAC straw polls than any other individual, with four. Ronald Reagan, <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp</b> and Rand Paul follow with three {{consecutive}} wins each, followed by Ron Paul with two wins. Of these five, the Pauls {{are the only two}} to win more than one straw poll, yet never appear on a Republican presidential ticket in any election (although Ron Paul did receive one Electoral College vote in 2016).|$|E
25|$|He was {{employed}} by Republican politicians such as Congressman <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp.</b> He gained experience in crisis management and {{working for the}} insurance company operated by his father. Caputo was mentored by Roger J. Stone Jr. {{in the ways of}} political advisement, and became his personal driver.

Caputo was influenced by Jerry Garcia and Ronald Reagan, and has written about his views supporting safeguarding the environment.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Theismann helped call Super Bowl XIX for ABC {{alongside}} Frank Gifford and Don Meredith, becoming {{only the}} second player to do commentary on a Super Bowl telecast while still an active player at the time (the first was <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp</b> when he helped call Super Bowl II for CBS).

50|$|Played in {{a chilly}} drizzle, a Bills fumble {{on the opening}} kickoff gave the Chiefs a short field to work with. Quarterback Len Dawson {{immediately}} took advantage of it, hitting Fred Arbanas for the game's first score. Buffalo quarterback <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp's</b> first pass for the Bills was a 69-yard score to Elbert Dubenion. Late {{in the second quarter}} and trailing 14-7, Kemp led the Bills to the Kansas City 10. Bobby Crockett was open in the end zone, but Kemp's pass was intercepted by Johnny Robinson, who returned it 72 yards. That set up a Mike Mercer field goal to close out the first half with a ten-point lead.|$|R
25|$|In the Super Tuesday {{primaries}} Dole defeated Buchanan {{by large}} margins. Having collected only 21 {{percent of the}} total votes or 3.1 million in Republican primaries, Buchanan suspended his campaign in March. He declared that, if Dole were to choose a pro-choice running mate, he would run as the US Taxpayers Party (now Constitution Party) candidate. Dole chose <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp</b> and he received Buchanan's endorsement. After the 1996 campaign, Buchanan returned to his column and Crossfire. He also began a series of books with 1998's The Great Betrayal.|$|E
25|$|In March 1995, the Drudge Report had 1,000 e-Mail {{subscribers}}; by 1997, Drudge had 85,000 {{subscribers to}} his e-Mail service. Drudge's website gained in {{popularity in the}} late 1990s {{after a number of}} stories which he reported before the mainstream media. Drudge first received national attention in 1996 when he broke the news that <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp</b> would be Republican Bob Dole's running mate in the 1996 presidential election. In 1998, Drudge gained popularity when he published the reporting of then Newsweek Reporter Michael Issikoff, becoming the first media outlet to publish the news that later became the Monica Lewinsky scandal.|$|E
25|$|Michael R. Caputo (born 1962) is a Republican {{political}} strategist and media consultant. Caputo {{grew up in}} Southtowns, Buffalo, New York, and gained public relations experience with the United States Army. He became enamored of Ronald Reagan while {{serving in the military}} and became a Republican, later working for politicians including <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp.</b> He worked for the Reagan Administration with Oliver North injecting propaganda for Reagan in Central America and South America. Caputo then {{went to work for the}} United States House of Representatives as assistant director of the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association. He served as director of media services on the campaign for president George H.W. Bush in the 1992 United States presidential election.|$|E
50|$|Flores had {{his most}} {{productive}} season in 1966. Although he completed only 49.3 {{percent of his}} attempts, he passed for 2,638 yards and 24 touchdowns in 14 games. Oakland traded him to the Buffalo Bills in 1967. After serving primarily as <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp's</b> backup, he was released by the Bills after that season (a move that {{would turn out to}} be a mistake, as Kemp would be injured in 1968 and the team lacked a competent backup). Flores signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in 1969, where he was backup to Len Dawson on the Chiefs' Super Bowl Championship team. He retired as a player after the 1970 season. He was one of only twenty players who were in the AFL for its entire ten-year existence. He is the fifth-leading passer in the AFL's history.|$|R
500|$|In the new term, McCain {{gained a}} spot on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in {{addition}} to his existing assignments. [...] McCain got the Indian Economic Development Act of 1985 signed into law, and the following year worked on early attempts at legislation regarding Indian gaming. [...] He took moderate stands on the environment and on social issues, and applauded <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp's</b> concerns for African Americans and other underprivileged groups. [...] In 1985 he returned to Vietnam with Walter Cronkite for a CBS News special, and saw the monument put up next to where the famous downed [...] "air pirate Ma Can" [...] had been pulled from the Hanoi lake; {{it was the first of}} several return trips McCain would make there. In 1986, McCain voted to override Reagan's veto of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act that imposed sanctions against South Africa.|$|R
2500|$|LaHaye was a harsh {{critic of}} Roman Catholicism, {{which he called}} [...] "a false religion". In his 1973 book Revelation Illustrated and Made Plain, he stated that the Catholic Church [...] "is more {{dangerous}} than no religion because she substitutes religion for truth" [...] and [...] "is also dangerous because some of her doctrines are pseudo-Christian." [...] Elsewhere the same book compared Catholic ceremonies to pagan rituals. It was these statements that were largely responsible for LaHaye's dismissal from <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp's</b> presidential campaign. It was later revealed that the San Diego church that LaHaye had pastored throughout the 1970s had sponsored an anti-Catholic group called Mission to Catholics; one of their pamphlets asserted that Pope Paul VI was the [...] "archpriest of Satan, a deceiver, and an antichrist, who has, like Judas, gone to his own place." ...|$|R
25|$|Several former Buffalo Bills {{players have}} earned a name in {{politics}} after their playing careers had ended, almost always {{as members of}} the Republican Party. The most famous of these was quarterback <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp,</b> who was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Western New York in 1971—two years after his playing career ended and remained there for nearly two decades, serving as the Republican Party nominee for Vice President of the United States under Bob Dole in 1996. Kemp's backup, Ed Rutkowski, served as county executive of Erie County from 1979 to 1987. Former tight end Jay Riemersma, defensive tackle Fred Smerlas and defensive end Phil Hansen have all run for Congress, though all three either lost or withdrew from their respective races. Quarterback Jim Kelly and running back Thurman Thomas have also both been mentioned as potential candidates for political office, although both have declined all requests to date.|$|E
25|$|Clinton {{took the}} oath of office of Secretary of State. Just before being sworn in as Secretary of State, Clinton {{resigned}} her senate seat effective just hours before her oath as Secretary of State. She became the first former First Lady to serve in the United States Cabinet. She also became the first Secretary of State to have previously been an elected official since Edmund Muskie's less-than-a-year stint in 1980, with Christian Herter during the Eisenhower administration being the last one before that. In being selected by her formal rival Obama, she became only the fourth person in the preceding hundred years to join the cabinet of someone they had run against for their party's presidential nomination that election year (<b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp</b> ran against and was later chosen by George H. W. Bush to be Secretary of HUD in 1988, George W. Romney by Richard Nixon for Secretary of HUD in 1968, and Philander Knox by William Howard Taft for Secretary of State in 1908 preceded her; Obama's pick of Tom Vilsack for Secretary of Agriculture followed her {{a couple of weeks later}} to be the next such person).|$|E
25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative <b>Jack</b> <b>Kemp</b> and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House. Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.|$|E
50|$|Gaudin {{retained}} {{an interest}} in Republican politics {{after he left the}} legislature. He was a delegate to the 1996 Republican National Convention held in San Diego, which nominated the ticket of Robert J. Dole and <b>Jack</b> French <b>Kemp.</b> The Dole-Kemp combination, however, lost Louisiana's then nine electoral votes in the fall campaign to Bill Clinton and Al Gore.|$|R
5000|$|Next, Pizzella was {{recruited}} by HUD Director <b>Jack</b> F. <b>Kemp</b> to serve {{at the new}} Federal Housing Finance Board, created {{as part of the}} 1989 savings-and-loan bailout legislation, to oversee the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks and channel some of their profits (as much as $100 million in 1992) into housing programs. Pizzella served first as a consultant, then for five years (1990-95) as the FHFB's Director of the Office of Administration (serving for two years at the FHFB while Bill Clinton was President).|$|R

Bush from 1989 to 1993, having previously served nine terms as a congressman for Western New York's 31st congressional district from 1971 to 1989. He was the Republican Party's nominee for Vice President in the 1996 election, where he was the running mate of presidential nominee Bob Dole.
