40|$|Case StudyCase Study 4 : The {{case study}} is about single stage API BB 2 pump. Pump {{operates}} at the temperature of 355 degree C (671 degree F), rated for pumping 442 m 3 /hr of Hydro-treated VGO (Vacuum Gas Oil) and is driven by a steam turbine. Pump bearing housing at <b>Drive</b> <b>End</b> (DE) <b>side</b> started exhibiting intermittent high vibrations during commissioning phase. This resulted in repeated failure of DE bearing and damage to bearing housing. Root cause was analyzed as uneven expansion of pump casing during pump warm-up, which misaligns the DE side floating bearing within bearing housing and restrict its axial displacement (bearing used is of deep groove design). As a consequence, thermal growth of pump shaft was restricted and it was rotating in deflected shape, rubbing within throat bushes. Problem was resolved by replacing the bearing design with NU type Cylindrical roller bearing, which allows higher amount of axial displacement. This case highlights a balanced approach towards the site investigations, root cause analysis and corrective actions implementation. It also provides hints to address thermal growths issues when equipment operates at very high temperature...|$|R
5000|$|Pachalam {{is a place}} {{located near}} the city of Cochin, Kerala in India. Goshree bridge road at Marine <b>Drive</b> <b>side</b> <b>ends</b> at Pachalam. Pachalam can also be reached by Chittoor Road. Mulavukad island is on its west, Vaduthala and Chittoor island is on its north, Elamakkara at north east, Mamagalam and Palarivattom is on its east, Kaloor on southeast. It is also beautifully located between Marine Drive, Kaloor and Edapally acting as a {{connecting}} link between the most important places in Kochi. Although the roads are very narrow (except for the wide Pottakuzhy Road which is badly maintained), the traffic has grown leaps and bounds, as roads inside Pachalam give a much needed respite to motorists who were looking an alternative to escape from the hardships of motoring through Banerjee Road especially during this phase of Kochi Metro construction.|$|R
