He considered its closest relative to be B.caleyi, from which it differs in having narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade <b>from</b> <b>red</b> to cream rather than from cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.|$|E

The main path to {{it comes up}} <b>from</b> <b>Red</b> Tarn, which is linked by a surprisingly level path to Hole-in-the-Wall, making this ridge equally accessible from Patterdale as from Glenridding. The ridge walk can be extended to include the summit of Catstye Cam.|$|E
5|$|The Pasiphae {{group is}} quite dispersed, with a spread over 1.3Gm, inclinations between 144.5° and 158.3°, and eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.43. The colors also vary significantly, <b>from</b> <b>red</b> to grey, {{which might be}} the result of {{multiple}} collisions. Sinope, sometimes included in the Pasiphae group, is red and, given the difference in inclination, it could have been captured independently; Pasiphae and Sinope are also trapped in secular resonances with Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|In 1757, the Afghan ruler, Ahmad Shah Durrani, sacked Delhi. He {{returned}} to Afghanistan leaving a Mughal puppet ruler in nominal control.

However, in 1771, the Marathas established a protectorate over Delhi when the Maratha ruler, Mahadji Shinde, recaptured Delhi and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II was installed as a puppet ruler in 1772. In 1783, Sikhs under Baghel Singh captured Delhi and Red Fort but due to the treaty signed, Sikhs withdrew <b>from</b> <b>Red</b> Fort and agreed to restore Shah Alam II as the emperor.

5|$|Several ancient English towns {{displayed}} the Royal Arms of England upon their seals and, when {{it occurred to}} them to adopt insignia of their own, used the Royal Arms, albeit with modification, as their inspiration. For instance, {{in the arms of}} New Romney, the field is changed <b>from</b> <b>red</b> to blue. Hereford changes the lions from gold to silver, and in the 17th century was granted a blue border charged with silver saltires in allusion to its siege by a Scottish army during the English Civil War. The town council of Faversham changes only the hindquarters of the three lions to silver. Berkshire County Council bore arms with two golden lions in reference to its royal patronage and the Norman kings' influence upon the early history of Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|Shopham Lock {{was another}} where the lock cut was built across a large meander to the north. The bridge {{at the tail}} of the lock is built <b>from</b> <b>red</b> and grey brick, and has a single, round-headed arch. It dates from the {{construction}} of the navigation, and is virtually unaltered. Nearby, the Petworth Canal headed northwards to Haslingbourne Bridge. Below the end of the cut, the river is joined by the stream from Burton Mill Pond, which supplied an iron forge built in 1789. It is crossed by Shopham Bridge, built in the nineteenth century <b>from</b> <b>red</b> brick with grey headers and a parapet in stone, with three segmental arches. At Lower Fittleworth, there is another mill building, although it is unused and in poor condition. It was built in 1628 and enlarged in 1742. It stands in the grounds of the mill house, which was rebuilt in 1913. The lock cut ran along the south-western edge of the site. Fittleworth Bridge consists of a southern section, originally built in the sixteenth century, which was rebuilt between 1717 and 1739, and modified when the navigation was built, to enable boats to pass through the centre arch. A north section, adjacent to the millpond, dates from 1811-12.|$|E
5|$|The authors {{began work}} on a sequel to Better than Life, called The Last Human, but Rob Grant was drawn away <b>from</b> <b>Red</b> Dwarf by an {{interest}} in other projects. Still owing Penguin Publishing two more Red Dwarf novels, Grant and Naylor decided to each write an alternative sequel to Better than Life. Two completely different sequels were made as a result, each presenting a possible version of the story's continuation. Last Human, by Doug Naylor, adds Kochanski to the crew and places more emphasis on the science-fiction and plot elements, while Rob Grant's novel Backwards, is more {{in keeping with the}} previous two novels, and borrows more extensively from established television stories.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 300 ceramic sherds {{were found}} at the sites at Bir Kiseiba. There were no whole or reconstructable vessels found at any site.The surface colors of the sherds ranged <b>from</b> <b>reds,</b> to dark reds, to yellow-reds, yellow-browns, dark browns, and gray-browns. The core colors varied <b>from</b> <b>reds,</b> red-browns, dark browns, and very dark gray-browns. The colors of the {{ceramics}} suggest that they were fired in oxidizing atmospheres. Most of the vessels {{seem to have been}} constructed using a coiling technique and many were decorated with various motifs, the most common being the Woven Mat motif. The assemblages found at Bir Kiseiba are very similar to the Middle Neolithic assemblages found at Nabta Playa, and both fall within the Khartoum Horizon Style of ceramics.|$|R
