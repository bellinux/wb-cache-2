50|$|It {{was based}} on the same {{platform}} chassis as the Citroën 2CV, sharing its advanced independent front to rear interconnected suspension. This comprised a central springing unit, running fore-and-aft in a tube on each side; each suspension arm on that side was linked to the spring, by a tie-rod and a 'knife-edge' pivot-pin. Early cars did not have conventional shock absorbers. See Citroën 2CV for detailed information. The squeak heard from most 2CVs and Dyanes as they go over bumps is due to lack of lubrication either inside the spring tubes or to the 'knife-edges'. The front hubs kingpins need to be greased every 600 miles. Since this is often overlooked, the <b>king-pins</b> can be prone to wear, although some movement is acceptable.|$|R

40|$|Electric power {{steering}} (EPS) systems are important ingredients of modern cars. Basing on mechanic (steering mechanism), electric (electric motor), electronic (controller) and mechatronic (sensors) components, they are typical servo mechanic devices, which support drivers handling action. The paper presents mathematical modelling of EPS systems treated as multi body mechanisms with power assistance, including strong non-linear phenomena {{caused by a}} friction (especially in <b>king-pins)</b> and a feeplay (in gear-box). Mathematical model consists of several variable structure ordinary differential equations with piecewise linear characteristics. Model non-linearities are described with using special piecewise linear luz (…) and tar( [...] .) projections. These projections and their original mathematical apparatus facilitate synthesis {{and analysis of the}} model. The model equations are derived from constitutive equations and control rules. This method can be also applied for synthesis of other non-linear multi-body electromechanical systems. The elaborated models of EPS systems have the forms ready to use in simulation programs. Some examples of simulation studies of the open car tests due to sensitivity analysis of steering system model are also presented in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} {{investigations of}} a car non-linear dynamics with regard to freeplay (backlash in steering gear) and friction (kinetic and static friction in <b>king-pins)</b> is always a challenge for researchers. Fortunately, by special luz(…) and tar(…) projections and their mathematical apparatus the elaborated models and simulation procedures of stick-slip phenomena in a steering system are managed in efficient forms (without any entangle constraints) even for optimization and sensitivity studies. Exactly, the presented studies deal with problems of sensitivity of optimized maneuvers for vehicle models considering freeplay / friction effects. Double lane change maneuvers (overtaking and avoiding) are discussed. A criterion function refers to several evaluations (precision of maneuver, calm steering, feeling of comfortable travel). The optimization of steering wheel angle signal is done on a reference model with „nominal ” freeplay and friction parameters. Such input signal is applied to a „real ” vehicle having „real ” freeplay and friction parameters. The differences of output signals as well as differences between criterion function values are a subject of sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity of reference models on a variation of freeplay and friction parameters appears as important from theoretical as well as practical points of view. The paper takes up the problems of sensitivity analysis of steering system model applied for synthesis steering algorithms for a double lane change maneuver...|$|R

Saravanan is a widower with two kids who are being raised by his sister Ganga (Sumithra). When Saravanan gets some firm clues that a reputed local businessman and philanthropist 'Lion' Dayanidhi (M. N. Nambiar) could be the <b>king-pin</b> behind the cartel, Dayanidhi has him killed. Soon after, a distraught Sivaraj is introduced by a friend to a ferocious criminal lodged in Vellore prison named Sangili (Sivaji Ganesan's dual role) who remarkably resembles his son Saravanan in appearance. Sivaraj decides to reform and train the brutish Sangili to impersonate Saravanan in order to trace those behind Saravanan's death. Sivaraj finds transforming Sangili a seemingly impossible task as Sangili refuses to mend his ways and has his own agenda of seeking revenge against his sister's murderer, but eventually succeeds with some help from Ganga and Saravanan's kids. Sangili, now transposing as Saravanan, launches himself into tracking the real Saravanan's killers and bringing down the smuggling cartel.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{a mistake}} to assess Scheler's concept of Ressentiment as chiefly a theory of {{psychological}} pathology, though surely it is that in part. In addition, Ressentiment is a philosophical and ethical concept from which to assess the spiritual and cultural health both of individual persons and society as a whole: a task which seems all the more urgent given economic globalization (i.e., a tendency toward carte blanche predatory capitalism). For example, it is entirely acceptable to view human ethical transcendence as complementary and commensurate with a bottom-up psychology of needs and drives so long as the arch of that qualitative direction is positive in nature. However the reverse is false. Negative parallel aspects are irreducible to Scheler's top-down metaphysical principal of good as emanating from our personal development as spiritual beings. This distinction is illustrated by the many cases in which negative role models can, and do, emerge as highly self-actualized economically powerful individuals from a psychological standpoint (clearly [...] "Superman" [...] type persons), but who are entirely lacking from an ethical, social and spiritual standpoint: e.g., the drug <b>king-pin</b> or pimp as a person young boys admire and look up to, or the corrupt CEO who absconds with obscene bonuses while his company goes bankrupt and the employee pension fund disintegrates. These negative manifestations of values and value inversions demonstrate how the philosophical conception of Ressentiment rests upon qualitatively different grounds transcending science and pure economics.|$|E

40|$|Suspension {{kinematic}} parameters such as camber, caster and <b>king-pin</b> angles {{as well as}} {{track width}} are important in improving handling performance and stability of a vehicle. Using {{a new model of}} the Macpherson suspension system, the effects of different hybrid semi-active control strategies on the performance of suspension kinematic parameters and on improvement of ride quality are investigated. The control strategies considered in this work comprise hybrid skyhook-groundhook, modified skyhook and, passive-skyhook controllers. It is shown that although contribution of these controllers on the improvement of ride quality of the vehicle is similar, they affect the performance of the Macpherson suspension kinematic parameters significantly different.

40|$|In {{this work}} a multi-body {{analysis}} of kart dynamics has been performed using the commercial software Working Model. For this purpose the vehicle has been modelled using a lumped parameters model consisting of three rigid body linked by two elastic elements, {{that represent the}} frame torsional stiffness. In this way static and dynamic load transfers can be evaluated. The model also considers the particular geometry of the steering system, and also allows to change the characteristic parameters (i. e. caster and <b>king-pin</b> angles, length of the lever arms and tie rods, etc) in order to appreciate the changes in vehicle performance.

40|$|One way {{to reduce}} the fuel {{consumption}} to payload ratio of heavy vehicle combinations is to reduce the empty trailer weight. This requires an understanding of the vehicle structure, assembly techniques and production process, and of special materials (e. g. high strength steel) with emphasis on strength and fatigue. But in all cases, one needs to have realistic design loads available. This paper describes an approach to determine these loads as a first step in the process. For this purpose, tractor-semitrailer combinations have been tested under normal operational conditions, for a longer period, under monitoring {{of a large number of}} measurement data. These data have been transferred into dynamic loading data in terms of forces at each separate wheel and at the <b>king-pin</b> in vertical, lateral and longitudinal direction. The experience with several trailers has resulted in a cost-effective testing procedure, which also allows the assessment of representative loading cycles...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the derivation of test data for three tractor-semitrailer combinations, {{to be used}} for strength and durability analysis of semi-trailers with the ultimate goal to reduce the semitrailer mass. Mathematical relationships have been used to transfer these data to representative loading data for the semi-trailer, in terms of forces and moments in all directions at the axles and <b>king-pin,</b> being used to optimize weight without compromising the vehicle resistance to fatigue. These activities have been the starting point of a follow-up project FORWARD (Fuel Optimised trailer Referring to Well Assessed Realistic Design loads) including now eleven different trailer manufacturers, and the Dutch Chassis and Body work association FOCWA. FORWARD will extend the previous approach with the objective to lower the trailer weight in order to improve the ratio of payload to fuel consumption. FORWARD consists of the following steps (1) a testing program, the larger part of which corresponds to normal use for a representative period, (2) to apply these data to validate a vehicle model allowing the derivation of representative loading data, and exploration of the effect of design changes on these loading data, (3) to apply these loading data for further FEM analysis of the global chassis and of local critical points...|$|E
