40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} analyzes how consumers {{decide between}} <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> fixed price, an ascending auction or a BIN auction. We find that such entry decisions depend both on potential payoffs (price aspects) and consumer characteristics (non-price aspects). For values smaller {{than or equal}} to BIN prices, subjects are more likely to <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> mechanism that involves bidding. Conversely, for values greater than BIN prices, subjects are more likely to <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> mechanism that involves immediate buying. We further find that price aspects mainly play a role for values greater than BIN prices, whereas non-price aspects play a role for values smaller {{than or equal to}} BIN prices. Impatience makes subjects less likely to <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> mechanism involving bidding, whereas sensation seekingness and regret make subjects more likely to <b>enter</b> such <b>a</b> mechanism. Gender also has an impact on entry decisions...|$|R
