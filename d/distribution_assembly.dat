We summarize the posterior <b>distribution</b> of <b>assembly</b> hypotheses generated by GABI as a majority-rule consensus assembly.

40|$|For {{precision}} displacement measurements, {{laser metrology}} is currently {{one of the}} most accurate measurements. Often, the measurement is located some distance away from the laser source, and as a result, stringent requirements are placed on the laser delivery system with respect to the state of polarization.

This system utilizes a concatenated array of couplers, polarizers and lengthy runs of polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber to distribute linearly-polarized light from a single laser to fourteen different optical metrology measurement points throughout the spacecraft. Optical power fluctuations at the point of measurement {{can be traced back to}} the polarization extinction ration (PER) of the concatenated components, in conjunction with the rate of change in phase difference of the light along the slow and fast axes of the PM fiber...|$|E

40|$|An {{optoelectronic}} system distributes {{a reference}} signal of low noise and highly stabilized phase and frequency (100 MHz) from an atomic frequency standard {{to a remote}} facility at a distance up to tens of kilometers. The reference signal is transmitted to the remote station as amplitude modulation of an optical carrier signal propagating in an optical fiber. The stabilization scheme implemented in this system is intended particularly to suppress phase and frequency fluctuations caused by vibrations and by expansion and contraction of the optical fiber and other components in diurnal and seasonal heating and cooling cycles.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview and update of a specialized frequency reference system for the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) to support Ka-band radio science experiments with the Cassini spacecraft, currently orbiting Saturn. Three major components, a Hydrogen Maser, Stabilized Fiber-optic <b>Distribution</b> <b>Assembly</b> (SFODA), and 10 Kelvin Cryocooled Sapphire Oscillator (10 K CSO) and frequency-lock-loop, are integrated to achieve the very high performance, ground based frequency reference at a remote antenna site located 16 km from the hydrogen maser.

40|$|New radio science experiments, {{including}} a gravitational wave search and several atmospheric occultation studies, {{are planned for}} the Cassini Ka-band experiment. These experiments are made possible by reduced solar-induced phase fluctuations at the high-frequency (32 GHZ) of the radio link between {{the earth and the}} spacecraft. In order to match the improved link performance, a significant upgrade is under way to improve the frequency stability capabilities of NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN). Significant improvements are being undertaken in many areas, {{including a}}ntenna vibration and (wet) tropospheric calibration, in addition to frequency generation and distribution.

40|$|ABSTRACT: With the {{advancement}} of information technology and increased market competition, construction companies are driven to employ supply chain management strategies to seek competitive advantage. Managing logistics is one component {{at the core of}} such strategies. An effective logistics system ensures delivery of the right products and services to the right customers at the right time while minimizing costs and rewarding all participants based on value added to the supply chain. As a component of a logistics system, logistics centres can serve the construction industry by offering services such as: storage, transport, <b>distribution,</b> <b>assembly,</b> kitting, consolidation, sorting, breaking bulk, cross-docking, and e-commerce. This paper focuses on the role logistics centres may play and the impact they may have on construction supply chains. Construction companies may configure their logistics centres in different ways to match their global and local supply chain strategy, while addressing challenges posed by variation in demand and supply for material, equipment, and services. A hypothesis is that logistics centres are underused in this industry, yet may offer considerable advantage. The ultimate aim of the research that is reported on here is developing a logistics system to support project-based production needs. The authors present a simulation model of a logistic centre that supports multiple site stores on different construction projects facing variations in supply lead times. The objective of the simulation is to find an approach to reduce material management costs while avoiding resource shortages, and enhancing both reliability and responsiveness of the supply chain...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry has incurred {{a considerable amount}} of waste as a result of poor logistics supply chain network management. Therefore, managing logistics in the {{construction industry}} is critical. An effective logistic system ensures delivery of the right products and services to the right players at the right time while minimising costs and rewarding all sectors based on value added to the supply chain. This paper reports on an on-going research study on the concept of context-aware services delivery in the construction project supply chain logistics. As part of the emerging wireless technologies, an Intelligent Wireless Web (IWW) using context-aware computing capability represents the next generation ICT application to construction-logistics management. This intelligent system has the potential of serving and improving the construction logistics through access to context-specific data, information and services. Existing mobile communication deployments in the construction industry rely on static modes of information delivery and do {{not take into account the}} worker’s changing context and dynamic project conditions. The major problems in these applications are lack of context-specificity in the distribution of information, services and other project resources, and lack of cohesion with the existing desktop based ICT infrastructure. The research works focus on identifying the context dimension such as user context, environmental context and project context, selection of technologies to capture context-parameters such wireless sensors and RFID, selection of supporting technologies such as wireless communication, Semantic Web, Web Services, agents, etc. The process of integration of Context-Aware Computing and Web-Services to facilitate the creation of intelligent collaboration environment for managing construction logistics will take into account all the necessary critical parameters such as storage, transportation, <b>distribution,</b> <b>assembly,</b> etc. within off and on-site project...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiologic {{evidence}} supports associations between inhalation of fine and ultrafine ambient particulate matter [aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2. 5 µm (PM 2. 5) ] {{and increases in}} cardiovascular/respiratory morbidity and mortality. Less {{attention has been paid}} to how the physical and chemical characteristics of these particles may influence their interactions with target cells. Butadiene soot (BDS), produced during combustion of the high-volume petrochemical 1, 3 -butadiene, is rich in polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including known carcinogens. We conducted experiments to characterize BDS with respect to particle size <b>distribution,</b> <b>assembly,</b> PAH composition, elemental content, and interaction with respiratory epithelial cells. Freshly generated, intact BDS is primarily (> 90 %) PAH-rich, metals-poor (nickel, chromium, and vanadium concentrations all < 1 ppm) PM 2. 5, composed of uniformly sized, solid spheres (30 – 50 nm) in aggregated form. Cells of a human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS- 2 B) exhibit sequential fluorescent responses—a relatively rapid (~ 30 min), bright but diffuse fluorescence followed by the slower (2 – 4 hr) appearance of punctate cytoplasmic fluorescence—after BDS is added to medium overlying the cells. The fluorescence is associated with PAH localization in the cells. The ultrafine BDS particles move down through the medium to the cell membrane. Fluorescent PAHs are transferred from the particle surface to the cell membrane, cross the membrane into the cytosol, and appear to accumulate in lipid vesicles. There is no evidence that BDS particles pass into the cells. The results demonstrate that uptake of airborne ultrafine particles by target cells is not necessary for transfer of toxicants from the particles to the cells.

40|$|A facile and {{flexible}} synthesis for colloidal molecules with well-controlled shape and tunable patchiness is presented. Cross-linked polystyrene spheres with a liquid protrusion {{were found to}} assemble into colloidal molecules by coalescence of the liquid protrusions. Similarly, cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) particles carrying a wetting layer assembled into colloidal molecules by coalescence of the wetting layer.

Subsequent polymerization of the liquid yields {{a wide variety of}} colloidal molecules as well as colloidosomes with tunable patchiness. Precise control over the topology of the particles has been achieved by changing the amount and nature of the swelling monomer as well as the wetting angle between the liquid and the seed particles. The overall cluster size can be controlled by the seed size as well as the swelling ratio.
