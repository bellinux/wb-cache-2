Despite global efforts to identify the factors that affect domestic water consumption, those related to domestic water use in rural regions have not been sufficiently studied, particularly in villages that have gained access to improved water supply. To address this gap, we investigated 247 households in eight villages in the Wei River Basin where three types of improved water supply systems are implemented. Results show that domestic water consumption in liters per capita per day was significantly correlated with water supply pattern and vegetable garden area, and significantly negatively correlated with family size and age of household head.

40|$|Abstract: The Water Framework Directive (WFD), whose basic aim was {{to create}} a legal back-ground for water bodies ’ protection, {{undoubtedly}} affects all economic sectors. Being a specific and distinctly different water user, agriculture will have the greatest share in the implementation of WFD out of all sectors of national economy. This results from its special character (60 % of the country area used by agriculture), large volume of water consumed by evapotranspiration, diffuse pollution etc. Implementation of WFD will call for undertaking of many activities to restrict an unfavourable im-pact of agriculture on water resources and water related ecosystems. It is assumed that agriculture should also protect water resources. Accomplishment of this task imposes significant changes in the land use of river basins. Water management can be an essential factor deciding about the sustainable development of rural areas and biological diversity of agricultural landscape. Actions undertaken so far to implement the WFD are mainly limited to the protection of water quality from agricultural pol-lution. It is also necessary to undertake implementation of other aims of WFD. This refers especially to the provision of good hydromorphological status of water bodies, protection of water related eco-systems and <b>effective</b> <b>water</b> <b>use...</b>|$|E

Mediterranean plants have evolved a number of morphological and physiological adapta-tions that determine their ability to survive and grow, being an <b>effective</b> <b>water</b> uptake and <b>use</b> important factors for drought resistance. In this article, we evaluated interspecific differences in morphology, biomass allocation, and architectural traits and their relationship with <b>water</b> <b>use</b> strategies in seedlings of seven co-occurring Mediterranean species (Anthyllis cytisoides L., Genista scorpius L. DC., Myrtus com-munis L., Pistacia lentiscus L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Spartium junceum L. and Ulex parviflorus Pourr.). The results showed that morphological root features vary among species and they are significantly corre-lated with root hydraulic conductance and leaf gas exchange variables. Species with high specific root length (SRL) showed a low hydraulic conductance per root length (KRRL) but high specific hydraulic conduc-tance (KAs). M. communis and P. lentiscus showed the most contrasting <b>water</b> <b>use</b> patterns {{with respect to the}} other species studied.

[...] The first several weeks are especially critical in the management of P. medicaginis as infected seeds die in a short amount of time. Control of alfalfa and chickpea is mostly possible <b>using</b> <b>effective</b> <b>water</b> management, <b>use</b> of resistant cultivars, proper crop rotation and seed application of fungicides such as metalaxyl. <b>Effective</b> <b>water</b> management is aimed at keeping the plants as dry as possible while still getting them enough water. Several ways to do this include assuring good drainage, avoiding excessive irrigation, and allowing plants to be dried by the wind. Oospores can be spread by way of cultural practices on machinery, boots and hooves. This spread can be limited by using proper sanitation before moving from an infected field to a disease free field. All of these control methods are aimed at stopping the initial infection of the seed/plant; water management also functions to limit the spread of zoospores because they may be spread by floods. Stopping the initial infection is important because this disease affects plants early on in their development as it quickly causes root rot and damping off. P. medicaginis can reside in fields as oospores for up to 3.5 years so the crop rotation must be at least 3 years long.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{estimation}} of actual evapotranspiration {{in order to}} evaluate the hydrologic cycle in a catchment area. Estimation of the hydrologic cycle is required for <b>effective</b> <b>water</b> <b>use,</b> flood control, and evaluation of water environment. However, {{it is difficult to}} estimate evapotranspiration in a wide area because of a scarcity of measured data. A method for using remote sensing data to estimate evapotranspirasion is proposed.

We calculate the evapotranspiration several dam catchmment areas in a snowy and cold region. The study areas are covered by mountains with steep slopes and its land use is entirely forested. In these areas, topographic effects on rainfall as well as snowfall must be taken into account. Rainfall and snowfall are accurately estimated by taking into account topographic factors such as elevation and direction of slope. As a result, actual evapotranspiration is calculated by applying the water balance method based on precipitation data. Finally, actual evapotranspiration is related to NDVI values {{so that it can be}} generally estimated in a wide catchment area...|$|E

Annual evaporation losses from these storages are estimated to be around 1. 32 GL/yr and up to 2. 88 GL/yr (Baillie, 2008).

40|$|Understanding the {{influences}} of climatic changes on water use efficiency (WUE) of Tibetan alpine meadows is important for predicting their long-term net primary productivity (NPP) because they are considered very sensitive to climate change. Here, we collected wool materials produced from 1962 to 2010 and investigated the long-term WUE of an alpine meadow in Tibet on basis of the carbon isotope values of vegetation (delta C- 13 (veg)). The values of delta C- 13 (veg) decreased by 1. 34 % during 1962 - 2010, similar to changes in delta C- 13 values of atmospheric CO 2. Carbon isotope discrimination was highly variable and no trend was apparent in the past half century. Intrinsic water use efficiency (W-i) increased by 18 mu mol. mol(- 1) (approximately 23. 5 %) during 1962 - 2010 because {{the increase in the}} intercellular CO 2 concentration (46 mu mol. mol(- 1)) was less than that in the atmospheric CO 2 concentration (C-a, 73 mu mol. mol(- 1)). In addition, Wi increased significantly with increasing growing season temperature and C-a. However, <b>effective</b> <b>water</b> <b>use</b> efficiency (W-e) remained relatively stable, because of increasing vapor pressure deficit. C-a, precipitation, and growing season temperature collectively explained 45 % of the variation of W-e.

A 2 yr field {{study was conducted in}} order to investigate the effects of full root-zone wetting (FI) and partial root-zone drying (PRD) irrigation techniques with 4 and 8 -d (I 2) irrigation intervals and three different irrigation levels (W 1, W 2, W 3) adjusted according to Class A pan evaporation on root, leaf, and sugar yields and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) Three different plant-pan coefficients (0. 70, 0. 60, and 0. 50) were used for adjusting the three different irrigation levels. The irrigation techniques and levels affected yields significantly. Seasonal meanly irrigation quantities were 280. 4 mm in FI treatments and 162. 4 mm in PRD treatments. While mean root yield of 33. 80 t ha- 1 is obtained in FI treatments, it was 26. 43 t ha- 1 in PRD treatments. Similarly, mean white sugar yield (WSY) for FI treatments (5 t ha- 1) was higher than PRD treatments (3. 81 t ha- 1). There were significant polynomial relationships between irrigation quantities and root yield or WSY in both FI and PRD treatment. PRD technique increased by 34. 9 % IWUE compared to FI. Although the highest root yield was determined in FI-I 1 W 1 sub treatment as 37. 57 t ha- 1, the highest IWUE was determined in PRD-I 1 W 3 sub treatment as 173. 9 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 since it has the lowest irrigation water amount as 140. 6 mm.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{framework}} to assess irrigation design and operating strategies. This objective was achieved successfully and the framework was applied to formulate guidelines to increase farm profitability whilst using scarce resources, such as water and electricity, effectively. The study was targeted at sugarcane irrigated with semi-permanent irrigation systems. “ZIMsched 2. 0 ”, a water balance and crop yield prediction model and the “Irriecon V 2 ” economic assessment model were available at the start of the study. The missing link, however, was a relatively cost effective and efficient method to design and cost irrigation hardware alternatives. Irrigation hardware impacts on both the agronomic and economic performance of systems, for example, through different peak design capacities and associated operating limitations. Thus, a novel, spreadsheet-based irrigation design tool, with an automated costing component, was developed to complete the framework. The framework was used to investigate the costs and benefits of potential design and operating solutions to a selection of irrigation issues, including: over-irrigation on shallow soils, the opportunity to shift electricity use out of expensive peak periods and, the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of deficit irrigation strategies. For shallow soils, the increase in system hardware costs, needed to better match water application to soils, increased margins due to more <b>effective</b> <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Innovative deficit designs and operating strategies allowed for reductions in water and electricity costs. The reduced costs, however, did not always offset yield penalties and revenue loss resulting from water stress. The financial benefits of deficit irrigation strategies were shown when water savings were used to convert dry land cane into irrigated cane. This highlighted the differences between the direct and opportunity costs of water. Finally, a field work component, relating to the precise monitoring of irrigation strategies and corresponding crop responses was included in this study. Systems which enabled soil water potential and stalk extension to be monitored remotely via the internet were considered useful for the successful implementation of an optimum irrigation strategy. The easily accessible data allows for effective decision making and more importantly, reassures famers of the current state of their crop...|$|E

40|$|The {{conflict}} between increasing water demand and limited water resources {{has become a}} serious threat to oasis regions in China. Solutions to water scarcity have to curb overall water demands, especially reducing agricultural <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Price control and quantitative control are the two most commonly applied policy instruments for water demand management. This paper used a bio-economic model (BEM) to examine the shadow price of water resources and to investigate farmers’ response to water demand management policies in water scarce regions based on a study in the Heihe River Basin in northwest China. The results indicate that farmers are not very responsive to changes in water price, because it is currently far below the shadow price of water resources in most irrigation zones. A reduction of agricultural water demand could occur only with a large rise in the water price. In comparison, a quantitative control measure is more <b>effective</b> at reducing <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Concerning the effects on farm income, a price control will cost much more than a quantitative control to save the same volume of water.

40|$|The crucial {{challenge}} for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa is feeding a growing population while preserving the natural resource {{base of the}} agricultural system. In future, this challenge will be exacerbated by soil degradation and climate change. Conservation Agriculture (CA) has been promoted as a strategy that can improve yields, soils and <b>eﬀective</b> <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> CA thus has potential to increase the resilience of farming systems facing the mentioned challenges. However, CA since its introduction in sub-Sahara Africa has not moved from the invention to the innovation stage: the CA innovation seen as a package is not meeting the farmers’ needs, capabilities and opportunities. Overall, the attempt to transfer this innovation in a conventional linear way from science to farm has been disappointing. The INCAA project is designed as an action research process aimed at targeting the challenging (and often missing) interfaces of science-driven technology and local realities in innovation systems. The overall objective of INCAA is to mentor and analyse a learning process that supports the innovation of CA in sub-Saharan Africa. The case studies of the project are Laikipia County, Kenya and Koumbia District, Burkina Faso. Building on the experiences of past projects, INCAA will (1) map beneﬁts and adaptations of CA in innovation systems around the partner projects; (2) foster joined learning of stakeholders to test and validate CA tools; and (3) develop learning strategies for an innovation process towards CA including institutional and individual dimensions.

40|$|Attaining {{reasonably}} {{high levels}} of food self-sufficiency rate within a country is important not only for food security but also for efficient use of natural resources inside the country. Japanese food self-sufficiency rate is exceptionally low among developed countries, with only 40 percent at original calorie basis (2002). This implies importation of virtual water from abroad (estimated 40 billion tons per year) without fully utilizing domestic agricultural water (58 billion tons per year). Japan chose to import food and export industrial products during 1960 s of rapid economic growth, but alternative decision making would be possible and may be more relevant at present and in future, as the society matures to prioritize operation of sustainable natural resource management and provision of safe and quality food. We have conducted agronomic study from 2001 to 2007 to assess alternative rice production technology in relation to fresh water resources. This study involved participation {{of students in the}} discipline of plant science: as the educational goal, rice crop responses to different water regimes were analyzed either field or plant levels, while the research goal was to invent new or modified rice production technology adapted to water scarce situations. We chose 3 subprojects: (1) increasing yield for upland rice, (2) developing water-saving lowland rice production, (3) stabilizing rice production in rainfed lowland in northeast Thailand and Cambodia (2003 - 2007). The first and the second are water-saving rice production technology to broaden the perspectives of Japanese scholars for sustainable food production under water in Japan, because rice production is by far the largest water consumer in Japan, and saved is can be utilized for possible other crop production. The reason to include the third subproject rainfed fragile ecosystems, as well as to extend research and academic collaboration with the leading and responsible institutes in the target environments, to attain more sustainable natural resource management and food production in Asia. This paper focuses research and academic achievements through collaboration with Thai scientists, particularly in Ubon Ratchathani Rice Research Center, on improvement of direct seeding in northeast Thailand.

Given the constancy of water resources and the rapidly growing population in the country, the annual water availability per capita decreased by 50 % during the last 35 years, dropping to 4, 000 cu. m in 2004. Water has thus become the principal strategic resource that determines the region‘s economic development options. Water allocation from Amudarya is governed by regional agreements between all Central Asian states. Turkmenistan‘s share is 22 cu. km per year, or 36 % of the river‘s total runoff. Agriculture is the main water user in Turkmenistan, consuming 95 % of the available resources. The emphasis on the expansion of cotton production in the Soviet era and the strategy of food self-sufficiency aggressively implemented since 1992 have led to accelerated growth of irrigated areas, which increased by nearly 4 times in the last 40 years, reaching 2. 3 million hectares. Almost half this area – 1 million hectares – has been added during the 15 years since independence. Irrigation is expanded without proper engineering attention to efficient conveyance of water, using mostly unlined canals and ditches with loss rates exceeding 30 %. <b>Effective</b> <b>water</b> <b>use</b> per hectare of irrigated land has steadily declined, and it is now one-half of its level in 1970. Inadequate water availability {{is one of the reasons}} for low crop yields in Turkmenistan. The expansion of the collector-drainage network lags far behind the expansion of irrigation: between 2000 - 2004 the collector-drainage network grew by 7 %, while the irrigated area increased by 26 %. This has led to accelerated rise of the groundwater table, deterioration of soil quality, and increased salinity. More that 1. 6 million hectares, or 73 % of irrigated land in Turkmenistan, is salinated. Increased use of concrete or plastic lined ditches, adoption of new efficient technologies – sprinkling, drip-irrigation, subsoil irrigation, and careful attention to water consumption for crop irrigation will significantly reduce water losses and seepage into the ground, and alleviate the problems associated with rising groundwater table. Adoption of water-saving technologies is costly, but it is essential for improved efficiency of water use. This technological approach will make it possible to increase the irrigated area in Turkmenistan to 4 - 5 million hectares while actually raising crop yields. It will thus help the country‘s agriculture achieve its economic potential. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|Water {{management}} strategies {{are currently being}} developed in Arizona. Arguments exist over which strategies are most effective and efficient to supply future growth of Arizona's population and economy. Some strategies rely on importation of new water supplies, while other strategies propose reducing total water demanded so existing supplies will be adequate in the future. Agricultural <b>water</b> <b>use</b> has been determined the primary target for demand {{management strategies}} since it accounts for 89 % of all water depletions and is a relatively economically inefficent use. No comprehensive management of Arizona's agricultural <b>water</b> <b>use</b> has been attempted. However, economic projections have indicated that changing variable prices for water will cause <b>water</b> <b>use</b> changes in the agricultural sector. Reviewing these projections in light of historical data shows that manipulating the variable price of <b>water</b> to affect <b>use</b> changes may be too unpredictable for <b>effective</b> <b>water</b> management and control in the agricultural sector...|$|R
40|$|Water {{shortages}} in important grain-producing regions of China may significantly affect China's agricultural production potential and international markets. Falling ground-water tables and disruption of surface-water deliveries to important industrial and agricultural regions have provoked concern {{that a more}} dramatic crisis is looming unless <b>effective</b> <b>water</b> conservation policies can be put into place rapidly. While China's <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is unsustainable in some areas, there is substantial capacity to adapt and avert a more serious crisis. Recent changes in water management policies may serve to bring about more <b>effective</b> <b>water</b> conservation. This report {{provides an overview of}} these changes and some analysis of their effectiveness. Wheat is the most likely crop to show a fall in productiondue to water shortages, but cotton, corn, and rice may also be affected.

50|$|Levels of productivity, {{particularly}} {{in parts of}} sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, are low due to degraded soils, high levels of evaporation, droughts, floods and {{a general lack of}} <b>effective</b> <b>water</b> management. A major study into <b>water</b> <b>use</b> by agriculture, known as the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture, coordinated by the International Water Management Institute, noted a close correlation between hunger, poverty and water. However, it concluded that there was much opportunity to raise productivity from rainfed farming.|$|R
