40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} was to verify, through sampling, is the service technical standard adopted at the biggest rural electrification program, introduced {{in the state of}} ParanÃ from 1983 to 1991 in the concession area of Energy Company from ParanÃ â COPEL, named CLIC RURAL, supplies the electric power needs of the electrified rural properties and if the electric energy introducing was able to contribute to the increase of the family income. The work was based on a field research with a questionnaire application to the farmers and the inspection of the existing technical standard. The results show the rural electrification benefits in some aspects. Social aspect: improvement on the schooling grade of the farmers and the population in a general way, the increase of the average monthly consumption per capita, significant increase on the purchasing of <b>electrical</b> <b>house</b> devices, pumping and rural equipments with the generation of direct and indirect taxes. Economical benefits are identified with the increase of electrical energy consumption by property and acquisition of electrical rural equipments and electrical rural devices. The environmental benefits can be seen through the abandon of fuels derived from oil and the existence of an environmental protection area. As a negative point, the reduction in 31 % in the number of inhabitants by occupied property. According to an opinion research, 76, 4 % are satisfied with the power standard made available at the program introducing period. From it, 4, 5 % made power load increase. Yet, only 37 % of the rural consumers got to increase or generate income with the electrification of their properties. It can also be noticed that the main statal concessionaire has gradually abandoned the materials used in the rural electrification standard named low cost; however it continues using the monophasis system with land return (MRT). The 70 Amps biphasis standard would be the most adequate for the researched region. But, the 50 Amps biphasis standard would be the condition minimum necessary for income generation in the property. These results aim to contribute with the public politics devisers for the universalization of the electrical power service of the consumers still in the dark spread at the rural zones. O objetivo principal deste trabalho foi verificar por meio de amostragem se o padrÃo tÃcnico de atendimento adotado no maior programa de eletrificaÃÃo rural, implantado no estado do ParanÃ no perÃodo de 1983 a 1991, na Ãrea de concessÃo da Companhia Paranaense de Energia â COPEL, denominado CLIC RURAL, supre as necessidades energÃticas das propriedades rurais eletrificadas e se a implantaÃÃo da energia elÃtrica foi capaz de contribuir para o aumento de renda da famÃlia. O trabalho foi fundamentado em pesquisa de campo com a aplicaÃÃo de um questionÃrio aos proprietÃrios rurais e da inspeÃÃo do padrÃo tÃcnico existente. Os resultados comprovam os benefÃcios da eletrificaÃÃo rural sob alguns aspectos. Aspecto social: melhoria no grau de escolaridade dos responsÃveis pelas propriedades e da populaÃÃo de uma maneira geral; aumento no consumo mÃdio mensal de energia elÃtrica per capita, aumento substancial na posse de eletrodomÃsticos e equipamentos para bombeamento e eletrorurais com a geraÃÃo de impostos direta ou indiretamente. Os benefÃcios econÃmicos sÃo comprovados pelo aumento do consumo de energia elÃtrica por propriedade e pela aquisiÃÃo de equipamentos eletrorurais e eletrodomÃsticos. Os benefÃcios para meio ambiente verificam-se pelo abandono de combustÃveis derivados do petrÃleo e pela existÃncia de Ãrea de proteÃÃo ambiental. Como ponto negativo, a reduÃÃo em 31 % no nÃmero de habitantes por propriedade ocupada. Segundo pesquisa de opiniÃo, 76, 4 % estÃo satisfeitos com o padrÃo da entrada de serviÃo disponibilizado na Ãpoca da implementaÃÃo do programa. Desses, 4, 5 % fizeram aumento de carga. Ainda, somente 37 % dos consumidores rurais conseguiram aumentar ou gerar renda com a eletrificaÃÃo de suas propriedades. Constata-se tambÃm que a principal concessionÃria do estado abandonou gradativamente os materiais utilizados no padrÃo de eletrificaÃÃo rural denominado de baixo custo, porÃm continua a utilizar o sistema monofÃsico com retorno por terra (MRT). O padrÃo bifÃsico de 70 AmpÃres para a entrada de serviÃo seria o mais adequado para a regiÃo da pesquisa. PorÃm, a entrada de serviÃo com padrÃo bifÃsico de 50 AmpÃres seria a condiÃÃo mÃnima necessÃria para geraÃÃo de renda nas propriedades. Esses resultados visam contribuir com os idealizadores de polÃticas pÃblicas para a universalizaÃÃo do atendimento com energia elÃtrica dos consumidores ainda no escuro espalhados pelo campo...|$|E

40|$|Our {{interdisciplinary}} team, {{known as}} Forge, {{has built a}} cookstove that not only can be a portable cookstove, but also includes a port to charge devices such as a phone using thermoelectrics. The product has been designed for developing areas in Nicaragua where power is inaccessible and a multi-purpose cookstove/phone charger could be of use. The cookstove features a cylindrical combustion chamber {{that can be used}} for gasification. Gasification is a burning process where smoke from the fire is also burned, creating higher temperatures and a cleaner burn. The combustion chamber is insulated using refractory cement, which will drop the temperature from about 700 Celsius inside the chamber to 200 Celsius outside the chamber. The cookstove outputs heat at a rate of 4. 6 - 6. 6 kW. The cookstove has thermoelectric modules attached to the outside, which, by utilizing the Seebeck effect, convert excess heat into electrical energy. Ideally, the energy would be transferred into the phone at 5 volts and 0. 5 - 0. 6 amps and some of the electrical energy would be used to power a cooling fan to help the stove function properly. The final temperatures that were recorded ranged from around 400 ºC to 700 ºC in the combustion chamber and around 500 ºC for the cooking surface. Gasification was successfully occurring during this stage, and the smoke was being visibly burned off. The electrical output was less successful, resulting with only around 0. 08 V coming out of the thermoelectric generators due to the lack of air flow within the <b>electrical</b> <b>housing</b> and poor <b>electrical</b> connection. The stove does achieve its primary functionality of being more than capable of boiling water, something that presently available cookstoves in Nicaragua cannot do consistently...|$|R
