5|$|Thus, when Harun asked <b>for</b> <b>negotiations,</b> Irene {{dispatched}} {{a delegation of}} three of her most senior officials: the Domestic Anthony, the magistros Peter, and Staurakios himself. Confident of their military position, they neglected to secure promises for their safety or hostages of their own, {{so that when they}} arrived in the Arab camp, they were made prisoners. Coupled with the treachery of Tatzates and the unreliability of the troops under his command, Irene was now forced to negotiate for their release, especially of her trusted aide Staurakios.|$|E

5|$|When Vitalian's forces {{reached the}} capital, they encamped at the suburb of Hebdomon and {{blockaded}} the landward {{side of the}} city. Anastasius opted <b>for</b> <b>negotiations,</b> and sent out Vitalian's former patron, the former consul and magister militum praesentalis Patricius, as ambassador. To him, Vitalian declared his aims: the restoration of Chalcedonian orthodoxy and the settling of the Thracian army's grievances. Patricius then invited him and his officers in the city itself <b>for</b> <b>negotiations.</b> Vitalian refused for himself, but allowed his senior officers {{to go on the}} next day. The officers were well treated by Anastasius, who gave them gifts and promised that their soldiers' grievances would be settled. He also pledged to submit the religious dispute for resolution to the Patriarch of Rome. Upon their return to the rebel camp, these officers unanimously pressured Vitalian to accept this settlement. Faced with no alternative, only eight days after his arrival before the capital, Vitalian retreated and returned with his men to Lower Moesia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{the castle}} was used as a refuge by Richard II from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke.

On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. The king was then taken to London and died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.|$|E
5|$|By October 1971 Prince Souvanna {{had little}} {{alternative}} but to accept the Pathet Lao program as the basis <b>for</b> <b>negotiations.</b> The Pathet Lao agreed to the new negotiating effort and on 14 October, representatives of the party arrived in Vientiane. Two weeks later they were followed by Phoumi Vongvichit, {{secretary general of the}} Pathet Lao. Communist demands included: a cessation of the U.S. bombing of Lao territory; withdrawal of all U.S. advisors and military personnel; an election for a new National Assembly; the establishment of a coalition government; and compensation and resettlement for those Lao who had been forcibly relocated would be undertaken. The pace of negotiations in Laos, however, mirrored those in South Vietnam, the impetus of which was determined by the perceived military success of the protagonists.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for {{reduction}} of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing {{the present value of}} the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern <b>for</b> <b>negotiations</b> with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments would result in the Dawes Plan of 1924.|$|E
5|$|In the north-west, Lithuania faced {{constant}} armed incursions {{from the}} Teutonic Knights—founded after 1226 {{to fight and}} convert the pagan Baltic tribes of Prussians, Yotvingians and Lithuanians. In 1380, Jogaila secretly concluded the secret Treaty of Dovydiškės, directed against Kęstutis. When Kęstutis discovered the plan, the Lithuanian Civil War began. He seized Vilnius, overthrew Jogaila, and pronounced himself grand duke in his place. In 1382, Jogaila raised an army from his father's vassals and confronted Kęstutis near Trakai. Kęstutis and his son Vytautas entered Jogaila's encampment <b>for</b> <b>negotiations</b> but were tricked and imprisoned in the Kreva Castle, where Kęstutis was found dead, probably murdered, a week later. Vytautas escaped to the Teutonic fortress of Marienburg and was baptised there under the name Wigand.|$|E
5|$|No country {{recognised}} the Rhodesian republic. The RF was decisively {{returned to}} power in the first election held as a republic, on 10 April 1970, winning all 50 white seats. Hopes for an Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement were boosted two months later when the Conservatives won a surprise election victory in the UK. Edward Heath took over as Prime Minister while Douglas-Home became Foreign Secretary. Talks between Douglas-Home and Smith began with a lengthy meeting in Salisbury in April 1971 and continued until a tentative understanding was reached in early November. A UK delegation headed by Douglas-Home and the Attorney General Sir Peter Rawlinson flew to Salisbury on 15 November <b>for</b> <b>negotiations</b> over a new constitution, and after six days of discussion an accord was signed on 21 November 1971.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the past}} few years {{there have been a number}} of propos-als <b>for</b> {{mechanisms}} <b>for</b> <b>negotiation</b> between agents that make use of argumentation.

This paper addresses this gap, proposing a particular protocol which is suitable <b>for</b> <b>negotiation,</b> and illustrating its use on an example from the literature. ...|$|R

President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia said a few days after the {{declaration}} that Savimbi had agreed to leave Angola and go into exile, a claim Mobutu, Savimbi, and the U.S. government disputed. Dos Santos agreed with Kaunda's interpretation of the negotiations, saying Savimbi had agreed to temporarily leave the country.|$|E
5|$|That night, the Black Pearl, which Elizabeth {{saw as a}} child, attacks Port Royal {{searching for}} the medallion. The crew of the Black Pearl capture Elizabeth, taking her to meet Captain Barbossa <b>for</b> <b>negotiations.</b> Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner, to conceal her {{identity}} as the governor's daughter, but Barbossa takes her prisoner. Elizabeth learns that after Barbossa's crew took the cursed treasure of Cortés from Isla de Muerta, {{they were forced to}} bear the curse of undeath; they appear as heavily decomposed corpses in moonlight. To lift the curse, they need to return all 882 gold pieces of eight with the blood of the owner of each piece. Elizabeth's medallion is the final piece.|$|E

The new Byzantine emperor, Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867–886), sent an embassy <b>for</b> <b>negotiations</b> to Tephrike. After the talks failed, Basil led a campaign against the Paulician state in the spring of 871, but was defeated and only narrowly managed to escape himself.|$|E

5|$|The fall of Atlanta and {{the success}} of the overall Atlanta Campaign were {{extensively}} covered by Northern newspapers, and were a boon to Northern morale and to President Lincoln's political standing. The 1864 election was between General George B. McClellan and Abraham Lincoln. McClellan ran a conflicted campaign - McClellan was a Unionist who advocated continuing the war until the defeat of the Confederacy, but the Democratic platform included calls <b>for</b> <b>negotiations</b> with the Confederacy on the subject of a potential truce. The capture of Atlanta and Hood's burning of military facilities as he evacuated showed that a successful conclusion of the war was in sight, weakening support for a truce. Lincoln was reelected by a comfortable margin, with 212 out of 233 electoral votes.|$|E

40|$|Under some circumstances, a {{group of}} {{individuals}} may need to negotiate together as a negotiation team against another party. Unlike bilateral negotiation between two individuals, this type of negotiations entails to adopt an intra-team strategy <b>for</b> <b>negotiation</b> teams {{in order to make}} team decisions and accordingly negotiate with the opponent. It is crucial to be able to negotiate successfully with heterogeneous opponents since opponents' negotiation strategy and behavior may vary in an open environment. While one opponent might collaborate and concede over time, another may not be inclined to concede. This paper analyzes the performance of recently proposed intra-team strategies <b>for</b> <b>negotiation</b> teams against different categories of opponents: competitors, matchers, and conceders. Furthermore, it provides an extension of the <b>negotiation</b> tool Genius <b>for</b> <b>negotiation</b> teams in bilateral settings. Consequently, this work facilitates research in negotiation teams. Comment: Novel Insights in Agent-based Complex Automated Negotiation, 201...|$|R
