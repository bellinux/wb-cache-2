5|$|An {{event that}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> impact on Gaudí's {{personality}} was Tragic Week in 1909. Gaudí remained {{in his house}} in Güell Park during this turbulent period.

However, ten days into recording there, Joe and Mario Duplantier learned that their mother had fallen ill, so the band put the recording session on hold. Their mother later died, which <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> influence on the recording process.|$|E
5|$|Innis's {{theories}} of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant: he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> influence on critical media theory and communications and, {{in conjunction with}} McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{programs}} in Singapore <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> {{effect on the}} Communist leadership in China, who made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping, to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship, and subtle suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods.|$|E

5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{succession}} to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy. The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> and permanent effect on the English language.|$|E
5|$|After {{the birth}} of their daughter, Edith in 1896, Louema {{revealed}} that the father of both Edith and her older brother, Harvey (1893), was C. W. Post. Though Post offered him financial interest in La Vita Inn and his prospective famous breakfast drink, Postum, provided Beilhart he would stay and work at the Inn. Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of his house and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> effect upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E

Even though the members of Bonded by Blood were not born when their favorite 1980s thrash metal bands released their debut albums, the music and fashion of that era <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> impact on them.|$|E

5|$|Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low {{with his}} {{daughter}}. The {{loss of his}} wife <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston.|$|E
5|$|Innis did his {{postgraduate}} {{work at the}} University of Chicago and {{was awarded}} his PhD, with a dissertation {{on the history of}} Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> impact on world {{politics}} and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves {{over how to}} interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E

5|$|Megalodon faced {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment. However, its position {{at the top of}} the food chain probably <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> impact on the structuring of marine communities. Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and diversification of cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> {{impact on}} the structure of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> effect on both on population and urbanisation, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford.|$|E
