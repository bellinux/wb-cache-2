However, some of these networks have surface <b>access</b> <b>traps,</b> which may be visible on high-resolution airborne or satellite images and could serve as presence indicators. We put forward a methodology to detect manhole covers and grates on very high-resolution aerial and satellite images.

On the 11/20, this was accomplished by clipping the lead to the low-order bit of the stack register.

5|$|Before European {{settlement}} of North America, Minnesota was populated by a subculture of Sioux called the Dakota people. As Europeans settled the east coast, Native Americans {{moved away from}} them causing migration of the Anishinaabe (also known as Ojibwe) and other Native Americans into the Minnesota area. The first Europeans in the area were French voyageur fur traders who arrived in the 17th century and began using the Grand Portage to <b>access</b> <b>trapping</b> and trading areas further inland. Late that century, Anishinaabe migrated westward to Minnesota, causing tensions with the Dakota people.

40|$|The {{security}} of the standard TCG architecture depends on whether the values in the PCRs match the actual platform configuration. However, this design admits potential for time-of-check time-of-use vulnerabilities: a PCR reflects the state of code and data when it was measured, not when the TPM uses a credential or signs an attestation based on that measurement. We demonstrate how an attacker with sufficient privileges can compromise the integrity of a TPM-protected system by modifying critical loaded code and static data after measurement has taken place. To solve this problem, we explore using the MMU and the TPM in concert to provide a memory event trapping framework, inwhich trap handlers perform TPM operations {{to enforce a security}} policy. Our framework proposal includes modifying the MMU to support selective memory immutability and generate higher granularity memory <b>access</b> <b>traps.</b> To substantiate our ideas, we designed and implemented a software prototype system employing the monitoring capabilities of the Xen virtual machine monitor...|$|R
40|$|With {{the immense}} growth of {{information}} on the web, it is difficult for the user to find the relevant information related to the area concerned. This expansion in amount of information, triggered by growing number of search engines databases, web directories, digital libraries and other information repositories on the World Wide Web has necessitated easy, effective and efficient access to relevant information from multiple information resources. But this gigantic growth compels us to see little through the conventional search engines, towards metasearch engines. To meet this necessity, search engines have been developed to help users to retrieve information of their interest from the Web in real time. Certain limitations related with conventional search engines viz. smaller exposure of Web and suitably low retrieval effectiveness lead to development of fusion based search engines that are commercially termed as Metasearch engines. So the thirst necessitates the use of metasearch engines for easy, effective and efficient access to relevant information from multiple sources. Metasearch engines allow the clients, an automatically joined and <b>fused</b> <b>access</b> to multiple independent search engines. This paper describes various issues belonging to this fascinating approach in the form of building Metasearch engine and other related issues...|$|R
40|$|Binary Translation (BT) {{has been}} {{commonly}} used to migrate application software across Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). Some architectures, such as X 86, allow Misaligned Data Accesses (MDAs), while most modern architectures require natural data alignments. In a binary translation system, where the source ISA allows MDA and the target ISA does not, memory operations must be carefully translated. Naive translation may cause frequent misaligned data <b>access</b> <b>traps</b> to occur at runtime on the target machine and severely slow down the migrated application. This article evaluates different approaches in handling MDA in a binary translation system including how to identify MDA candidates and how to translate such memory instructions. This article also proposes some new mechanisms to more effectively deal with MDAs. Extensive measurements based on SPEC CPU 2000 and CPU 2006 benchmarks show that the proposed approaches are more effective than existing methods and getting close to the performance upper bound of MDA handling.

40|$|Compensated Penning traps with {{cylindrical}} {{ring and}} compensation electrodes and flat endcaps are considered as alternatives to high precision traps with hyperbolic ring and endcap electrodes. Cylindrical and flat electrodes {{can be more}} easily and precisely con-structed, especially for the very small traps which are desirable for ion trapping. They are easily studied since Laplace’s equation can be solved by a series expansion which is discussed in most electricity and magnetism textbooks. A central new-result is that a judicious choice of the height-to-diameter ratio for a cylindrical trap makes the axial oscillation frequency of a trapped particle independent of adjustments in the compensation potential, just as has been recently proposed for hyperbolic traps. Other properties of such orthogonalized cylindrical traps appear to be adequate for particle trapping so that properly designed cylindrical traps are promising alternatives for high precision work, ready for laboratory testing. Whether or not cylindrical traps {{will be able to}} replace hyperbolic traps entirely for the highest precision work, a major point of this paper is that orthogonalized traps can be built with any reasonable electrode geometry. Special <b>access</b> <b>traps</b> with orthogonalized anharmonicity com-pensation are thus completely feasible, though numerical calculations will be generally required for their design. 1...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} {{accessibility}} for disabled {{people through the}} concept of social construction of disability. Impaired bodies are mainly disabled by disabling social and physical impediments. The built environment reflects how society understands disability and accessibility. How can disabled people individually and collectively resist, transcend, and change those disabling barriers? This research is qualitative in approach and based on mixed methods. The discussions are divided into two main themes: 1) meaning, and its product of understanding disability, and 2) the process of negotiating inaccessibility. Firstly, understanding of 'pi-gam' or disability is examined through culture representations such as language, literature, and media. Information from secondary data is used together with primary data {{in the form of}} in-depth interviews complimented by a postal survey. Through a focus on public facilities the thesis investigates how understandings of disability produce the built environments and what are spatial constraints and needs of disabled people. Secondly, the research investigates processes through which disabled people individually and collectively overcome access barriers. A process of disabled people as a collective in overturning existing socio-political structure to press for their access requirements through a case of footpath renovation project is explored in depth as is a lived experience of a disabled individual in Bangkok. The analyses indicate that disabled people resist an idea of disability linked with individual tragedy and illness by changing language use and reproducing the self through daily life. Performing daily activities in public places can be a way to demonstrate to society as a whole that the common notion of disability equalling dependency is mistaken. By actively participating in the movement, disabled people are overturning this dominant ideology. <b>Fusing</b> <b>access</b> issues with mainstream agendas such as quality of life and contributing to the prestige of an icon in Thai society provides opportunities for disabled people as a collective voice to achieve their access requirements. In sum, by individually and collectively acting as agents for change in challenging popular perceptions, disabled people are drawing attention to the social construction of their disability. It is disabling physical environments that must be excluded not their impaired bodies. This research proposes ways in which the environmental experiences of impaired bodies as well as the role of disabled people as partners in creating accessible facilities can be included in consideration of access policies and their implementation in Thailand.
