25|$|Child {{slavery is}} also {{considered}} a contemporary form of slavery, although its <b>does</b> <b>come</b> with debate {{as to what}} constitutes child slavery. However, child prostitution is widely considered a form of slavery in which children, mostly from South East Asia, South Asia, and Latin America, “are sold by their parents either because they are destitute, have too many mouths to feed, or are simply greedy”. On the other hand, in some cases of child prostitution, when parents give their children up to traffickers, they are deceived into believing that their child will earn good money, get an education, or learn a trade.|$|E
25|$|List of Illinois High School Association member {{conferences}} Note that, {{unlike some}} other {{states such as}} Iowa or Texas, Illinois' high school athletic conferences are not officially organized by the IHSA and have little bearing on playoff competition. Individual schools organize themselves into conferences, mostly {{as a way of}} making scheduling easier, and many schools choose to compete as independents. However, conference affiliation <b>does</b> <b>come</b> into play in football competition, as conference champions earn an automatic bid into the playoffs (football conferences must have at least six members for a champion to be automatically playoff-eligible). Football teams not affiliated in a conference can still qualify with six or more wins. Football competition is played with a nine-game schedule.|$|E

25|$|Acemoglu and Robinson {{counter that}} their theory distinguishes between {{political}} and economic institutions {{and that it is}} not political institutions that contribute to growth directly but economic institutions shaped by the political institutions. In the case of China, even though the political institutions on a higher level are far from inclusive, the incentive to reform Chinese economy <b>does</b> <b>come</b> from political institutions; in 1978 from Deng Xiaoping's Opening up policy {{at the end of the}} internal political feud during the Cultural Revolution. This exactly fits into the theory that the change in political institutions has shaped economic institutions and thus has influenced economic performance. This economic growth is further expected to shape the political institutions in China in the future. One can only say that China is an outlier to the theory when in the future China becomes as wealthy as U.S. or Germany but still remains an authoritarian regime.|$|E

[...] Commenting on finding the right balance between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Feige said [...] "Iron Man is a very technological hero; his movies are always technologically based. The first Thor was all about introducing Asgard and Thor in that more fantastical realm into the more reality-based MCU… As we go into Ultron clearly he <b>does</b> <b>come</b> out of technology, but we're using all of our tools at our disposal that we've established so far as part of the MCU to build the storyline of Age of Ultron." ...|$|E
500|$|FLCL has {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics. Christopher McDonald of Anime News Network called it [...] "downright hilarious" [...] and [...] "visually superb" [...] with great music, citing the packaging of 2 episodes per DVD {{as the only}} weakness of Synch-Point's original release. Robert Nelson of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews gave the anime 4 out of 5 stars stating, [...] "FLCL {{may not have a}} straightforward or deep plot. It may not have complex characterizations. Hell, it may not have any meaning. But FLCL does succeed in its true objective. It is fun to watch!" [...] Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A- stating, [...] "FLCL is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and <b>does</b> <b>come</b> off as quite experimental. But nearly everything worked in their favor and you end up with three hours of nearly break neck speed action, comedy and commentary on modern life." [...] Brian Ruh praised the series stating, [...] "It was very frenetic and kept pushing the envelope on what was possible in Japanese animation." ...|$|E

Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan <b>does</b> <b>come</b> to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] What {{you think is going to}} happen is not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind despite the fact that she had moved on.|$|E
500|$|Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} album {{five out of}} five stars, stating Perry [...] "sounds like a woman, and an artist, who's finally found herself" [...] and praised the [...] "vulnerability" [...] of the album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, Alexis Petridis from The Guardian, and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine all also gave the album three out of five stars. Erlewine dubbed Prism [...] "a tighter, cleaner record than its predecessors". Petridis called it [...] "Katy Perry's most spiritual album to date". Mesfin Fekadu from ABC News deemed the tracks [...] "likable", but felt the album lacked [...] "some of the fiery fierceness and {{excitement}} that dominated Teenage Dream". James Reed from The Boston Globe felt Perry [...] "always seemed like the pop star who knows precisely what she does best" [...] and called the album [...] "an unabashedly fun listen". Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound gave the album {{three and a half}} out of five stars, calling Perry [...] "a champion of choruses". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune gave the album 2 out of 4 stars, commenting [...] "Though not exactly spiritual, Prism <b>does</b> <b>come</b> off as a more serious—if no less formulaic—album than its predecessor". Marah Eakin from The A.V. Club gave the album a C+, commenting [...] "A lot of Prism is simply forgettable", though praised the tracks [...] "Roar", [...] "Birthday", and [...] "This Is How We Do". Rob Harvilla from Spin gave the album a 5/10 rating, and felt some of the material was not [...] "all that desirable".|$|E
500|$|Jean {{initially}} makes progress, and earns a small {{profit from}} his rabbit farm. In the long run, getting water proves a problem, and dragging {{it all the}} way from the distant spring becomes a backbreaking experience. Jean asks to borrow Ugolin's mule, but is met only with vague excuses. Then, when the rain <b>does</b> <b>come,</b> it falls on the surrounding area but not where it is needed. Jean loudly berates God, whom he thinks has already given him enough trouble by deforming him. Later, the dusty winds of the sirocco also arrive, bringing the farm to near-catastrophe. Jean is undeterred, and decides to dig a well. At this point Ugolin sees it fitting to try and convince Jean that his project is hopeless, and that he might be better off selling. Jean asks how much he could expect to receive for the farm, and Ugolin gives an estimate of around 8,000 francs. Jean has no intention of leaving though, but wants to use the value of the property to take up a mortgage of half that sum. Ugolin is not happy, but Papet again sees opportunity: he will himself grant the mortgage; that way he will either earn the interest, or drive Jean away for good. From the money Jean buys dynamite to finish the well, but in his first blast is hit by a flying rock and falls into the cavity. At first the injuries seem minor, but it turns out his spine is fractured and when the doctor arrives he declares Jean dead. Ugolin returns with the news to Papet, who asks him why he's crying. [...] "It is not me who's crying," [...] he responds, [...] "it's my eyes".|$|E
