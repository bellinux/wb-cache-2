5|$|The Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly is a hotspot (volcanic complex) on the Moon. It {{is on the}} <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the Moon and {{was found}} by a gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} in 1998.

Lunar rock samples from the Apollo missions reveal that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion years ago, but could have been as recent as 1 billion years ago due to the unknown history of the moon's <b>far</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the <b>far</b> <b>side,</b> among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E

5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of long optical paths. The <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded to}} the goal immediately, as Giggs made a surging run through the Barcelona defence before playing the ball to Berbatov in the inside-right channel. The Bulgarian forward's low cross found Giggs in the centre, and the United captain's shot was {{deflected}} to Ronaldo on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the goal, only for the Portuguese's shot to be blocked by Valdés. The resulting corner reached Berbatov on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the goal, but it was deemed to have crossed the goal line first and Barcelona were awarded a goal kick, from which they launched another attack. Messi played a through-ball to Puyol on the right flank, but as the Barcelona captain reached the goal line, he was fouled by Ronaldo, who – despite going in two-footed – escaped the referee's book. Puyol himself rose to head Xavi's free kick towards goal, but it was directly at Van der Sar, who claimed the ball easily.|$|E

5|$|Doppelgänger is a 1969 British {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Robert Parrish and starring Roy Thinnes, Ian Hendry, Lynn Loring and Patrick Wymark.

In the film, a joint European-NASA mission to investigate a planet in a position parallel to Earth, behind the Sun, ends in disaster {{with the death of}} one of the astronauts (Hendry).

5|$|<b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> Virtual is the thirtieth studio album by the American {{electronic}} musician James Ferraro, {{released on}} October 25, 2011 by the record label Hippos in Tanks. First {{conceived as a}} series of ringtones, the album marked Ferraro's transition from his previous lo-fi recording approach to a sharply produced, electronic aesthetic that deliberately evokes sources such as elevator music, corporate mood music, easy-listening, and outdated computer sound design. The album has been interpreted as engaging with themes such as hyperreality, disposable consumer culture, 1990s retro-futurism, advertising, and musical kitsch.|$|E
5|$|<b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> Virtual was {{met with}} {{polarizing}} but generally positive reviews, with most critics commending its conceptual underpinnings and noting its ambiguous relationship to its subject. It was named {{album of the year}} by UK magazine The Wire, a decision which {{was met with}} contention from some journalists and readers. The album has since been cited as one of the original releases and catalysts of vaporwave, an Internet-based electronic music microgenre that covers much of the same sonic and conceptual territory.|$|E

5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed {{in the construction of}} mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E
5|$|In October 1992 Delrina {{acquired}} Amaze Inc., based out of Kirkland, Washington. The firm created daily planner software, providing {{time management}} features while providing some humour by featuring licensed cartoon strips like Cathy, Bloom County, B.C. and The <b>Far</b> <b>Side.</b> The firm became a wholly owned subsidiary of Delrina {{in a deal}} which also paid down Amaze's $3 million (U.S.) debt and placed two of the firm's directors on Delrina's board. These two individuals were Rowland Hanson, former VP Corporate Communications for Microsoft and George Clut.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 11th century {{dispute over}} the cathedral {{graveyard}} had continued unabated and in 1217 Henry III's government decided to announce that the disputed land would be granted to the cathedral. A panel met to agree exactly how the land should be divided, concluding that the division should run straight across the bailey; the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> was returned to the cathedral, making {{the remainder of the}} castle unusable from a military perspective. Henry thus ingratiated himself with the church and broke the power of the Beauchamps in the city by crippling their local fortress.|$|E
