5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob wishes he could fly with the jellyfish. He makes several attempts to do so, but all of these fail. At home, SpongeBob is drying his hair and receives a phone call, he puts the <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> in his square pants, and the dryer inflates them, giving him the ability to fly. He goes around helping people, earning their admiration and becoming a superhero of sorts. However, other characters continue to ask increasingly unnecessary favors of him, leaving him no time to fly with the jellyfish.|$|E
5|$|The seven-minute long video depicts Beyoncé {{playing a}} beauty pageant contest {{representing}} Third Ward, Houston, {{the area in}} which she grew up. It opens with the sound of a poignant piano and shots of Beyoncé sporting short hair, looking at herself in the mirror. It transitions to a segment of her fellow contestants preparing for the pageant backstage, combing their hair, fitting their dresses and analyzing their bodies; one scene during the preparations shows Beyoncé arguing with another contestant over a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer.</b> Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict her sitting on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E

500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Good Hit" [...] begins with Lopez holding a pointer {{in her left}} hand, while asking for the {{attention}} of the students. Two chalk boards are shown behind her, saying the words [...] "Fierceology" [...] and [...] "Work It Out 101". Lopez is then seen dancing on chairs with several female students, each with a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> in hand. These scenes are intercut with Lopez teaching the students how to whip their hair. They then strut up and down a hallway. The music video was noted for its sex appeal, in which Lopez and the students are dressed in Dolce & Gabbana. An alternate version of the video was leaked online in December 2011. This version begins with Lopez posing in front of a mirror, draped in jewelry and sitting on a couch with a telephone. This footage is taken from a behind the scenes look at the photoshoot for Love?. These scenes are intercut with that from the original version.|$|E
500|$|Back home, {{having given}} up on his dream, SpongeBob dries himself out when he {{receives}} an insulting phone call and puts the <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> in his pants. While he talks, the dryer inflates his pants, giving him the ability to fly. He goes around helping people, earning their admiration and becoming a superhero of sorts. However, the other characters continue to ask increasingly unnecessary favors of him, leaving him no time to fly with the jellyfish. When he tries to escape to the Jellyfish Fields, a mob forms and chases him, but is unable to catch him. Cannonball Jenkins, formerly a farmer and later on, a sailor, launches himself at SpongeBob, popping the pants and sending him plummeting to the ground. Everyone then hold a funeral for his now-deflated pants. Upset, SpongeBob decides to go home, but the jellyfish help him fly and take him back there. Patrick arrives and asks if they could [...] "fly over" [...] to the pizzeria, but SpongeBob decides to leave the flying to the jellyfish, only for Patrick to literally fly off himself.|$|E
500|$|Vala started {{wearing the}} normal SG team uniform in [...] "Origin", the third episode of season 9. Claudia Black was later {{included}} in the design process and was given full control over her wardrobe for scenes that required civilian clothes. As such, Black chose Vala's underwear for the seduction scene in [...] "The Ties That Bind" [...] and her shopping tour outfit in [...] "Family Ties". The latter episode also showed Vala with seven distinctly different hairstyles and outfits in total. Fearing the lack of seriousness, the producers opposed the make-up department's decision of having Vala wear curlers, but the scene could not be reshot. Similarly, a scene showing Vala unpacking her <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> and curling iron during an offworld mission in [...] "The Quest" [...] was deemed too silly and was trimmed to the basics; {{it would have been}} cut if the footage had allowed it. Due to Black's pregnancy during the filming of the films, the costume department needed to hide Black's bump with appropriate dressing.|$|E

500|$|The video {{opens with}} Stan {{and some of}} her male back-up dancers being {{presented}} in a dark white room. Subsequently, the room becomes enlightened and Stan is seen wearing transparent sunglasses, a white sweatband and a silver jacket. Following this, she retrieves a tennis racket from one of her background dancers and holds it {{in front of her face}} before returning the racket to a nearby dancer. Next, Stan performs the pre-refrain of the song, while two female performers clutch a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> in their hands. For the refrain, she and ten other female background dancers are performing synchronized dances, with them having wigs on, and dressing white clothing and red accessories. Following this, Stan is presented standing on a yellow plate which is kept in the air by two threads. She wears a silver leotard and a multicolored wig. Next, Stan is shown walking into a tennis field, whereon she plays a tennis match against herself. For the breakdown of [...] "Cherry Pop", the video gets introduced into a dark-lighted room. There, [...] her previously shown male background dancers are presented; the video continues with Stan dancing accompanied by her dancers. The clip finally ends with a pink tennis ball dropping out of the ceiling, while the screen becomes black.|$|E
500|$|The player fishes {{in pursuit}} of fame as a {{fisherman}} named Billy. The game mechanics are [...] "three tightly-woven minigames in one": casting the fishing line, catching fish, and shooting {{the fish in the}} air. The player casts the line and tilts the device to avoid the fish as the hook sinks. Upon hooking a fish, the hook ascends and the player tilts the device to catch as many fish as possible en route to the surface. Above water, the fish are launched into the air, and the player taps the screen to shoot the fish out of the sky to earn money before they fall into the water. The fish differ in characteristics including swim pattern and the number of shots required to cash in. The jellyfish shot detract from the total income. There are four stages, each with its own visual and audio theme and rare fish, and an endless mode where players can work towards the highest score. Earnings can be spent in a store towards persistent upgrades such as longer fishing line length, invulnerable drills, frivolous hats, bigger guns, chainsaw lures, a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> and toaster (to zap inadvertent catches), fuel for the chainsaw, and a necktie for greater income. There is also a Fish-o-pedia in Billy's smartphone that gives gameplay hints and tracks stats such as fish caught, which is the progress for unlocking new levels. There are no in-app purchases.|$|E

2500|$|The game also {{included}} some gameplay enhancements. [...] New scoring rules were added, most notably to the Mansion. [...] Some rooms randomly awarded players items from Cousin Itt, {{such as a}} <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> or brush, with an accompanying number of points. [...] Wednesday and Pugsley also made their first in-game appearance {{in the form of}} a [...] "trap door", that would sometimes let a player move from one room to another, awarding them both. [...] Numerous new quotes and dot-matrix effects were also added.|$|E
2500|$|A {{thermal fuse}} is {{often found in}} {{consumer}} equipment such as coffee makers, hair dryers or transformers powering small consumer electronics devices. [...] They contain a fusible, temperature-sensitive composition which holds a spring contact mechanism normally closed. When the surrounding temperature gets too high, the composition melts and allows the spring contact mechanism to break the circuit. The device {{can be used to}} prevent a fire in a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> for example, by cutting off the power supply to the heater elements when the air flow is interrupted (e.g., the blower motor stops or the air intake becomes accidentally blocked). Thermal fuses are a 'one shot', non-resettable device which must be replaced once they have been activated (blown).|$|E
2500|$|The {{voice of}} Howard, Chip Zien, was not cast until after {{shooting}} completed. Because Ed Gale's voice {{was difficult to}} hear when he wore his suit, Huyck ordered Gale to perform his scenes without speaking any of the required dialogue, which was later synchronized during the editing process. Lead puppeteer Tim Rose was given a microphone attached to a small speaker, which would allow Rose to speak the dialogue to help the actors respond to Howard's dialogue. While wearing his suit, Gale could only see through Howard's mouth, and had to sense his location without proper eyesight. Gale often had to walk backwards before beginning rehearsals. In between takes, a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer</b> was stuffed in Howard's bill to keep Gale cool. Gale taped two of his fingers together [...] to wear the three-fingered hands created for the Howard costume. A total of six actors gave physical performances as Howard.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>dryers</b> {{speed the}} drying process of hair by blowing air, {{which is usually}} heated, over the wet hair shaft to {{accelerate}} the rate of water evaporation.|$|R
50|$|Around 1915, <b>hair</b> <b>dryers</b> {{began to}} go on the market in {{handheld}} form. This was due to innovations by National Stamping and Electricworks under the white cross brand, and later U.S. Racine Universal Motor Company and the Hamilton Beach Co., which allowed the dryer to be small enough to be held by hand. Even in the 1920s, the new dryers were often heavy, weighing in at approximately 2 lb, and were difficult to use. They also had many instances of overheating and electrocution. <b>Hair</b> <b>dryers</b> were only capable of using 100 watts, which increased the amount of time needed to dry <b>hair</b> (the average <b>dryer</b> today can use up to 2000 watts of heat).|$|R
2500|$|Cockerell {{came across}} the key concept in his design when {{studying}} the ring of airflow when high-pressure air was blown into the annular area between two concentric tin cans, one coffee and the other from cat food and a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer.</b> This produced a ring of airflow, as expected, but he noticed an unexpected benefit as well; the sheet of fast moving air presented a sort of physical barrier to the air {{on either side of}} it. This effect, which he called the [...] "momentum curtain", could be used to trap high-pressure air in the area inside the curtain, producing a high-pressure plenum that earlier examples had to build up with considerably more airflow. In theory, only a small amount of active airflow would be needed to create lift and much less than a design that relied only on the momentum of the air to provide lift, like a helicopter. In terms of power, a hovercraft would only need between one quarter to one half of the power required by a helicopter.|$|E
2500|$|Physical {{violence}} {{of any kind}} is typically not tolerated by the producers. After an incident occurs, producers or cast members are typically given the choice as to whether a violent housemate can stay due to a contract clause that prohibits violence. After an incident during the [...] season in which Stephen Williams slapped Irene McGee as she moved out, {{a response to the}} event was debated by the housemates, who were not present but were shown a videotape of the incident. The producers, not wanting to be seen condoning violence, gave the housemates the choice of having him leave, but instead the housemates chose to let him stay, and Williams was ordered to attend an anger management class. During the [...] season, Brynn Smith and Steven Hill got into an altercation in which Smith threw a fork at Hill. Hill contacted the producers who notified him that it was up to the cast to decide on Smith's fate. The cast let Hill make the ultimate decision, and he chose that Smith could stay. During the [...] season, Trisha Cummings shoved Parisa Montazaran to the ground during a heated altercation. Producers gave Montazaran the choice as to whether Cummings could stay or leave, and she chose that Cummings had to leave. [...] housemates Tyrie Ballard and Davis Mallory got into an explosive altercation that required production to intervene on-screen and separate the two before any violence occurred. Similarly, Hollywood castmates William Gilbert and Dave Malinosky got into an explosive altercation with fellow housemate Greg Halstead that also required intervention from production, as well as Gilbert and Malinosky to undergo anger management. During the [...] season, Nia Moore physically attacked Johnny Reilly in retaliation for Reilly purposely throwing a drink on her during a heated altercation, and later got into a physical altercation with Averey Tressler, when Tressler defended Reilly from an attempt by Moore to attack Reilly again with a <b>hair</b> <b>dryer.</b> Moore also took exception to coming into contact with the fecal matter of Tressler's pet dog Daisy. Unlike prior seasons where the one assaulted housemate was given the sole choice as to whether the attacker could stay, the Portland cast had its producers decide that only those not involved in the confrontation could decide whether Moore could stay via a majority vote. They chose to let her stay, and producers did not order Moore to anger management, despite subsequent threats to attack other cast members. As a result, Reilly and Tressler chose to leave the loft during that season's final episode, along with Tressler's dog Daisy. In the final three episodes of the [...] season, castmates Jenna Thomason and Ceejai Jenkins got into two physical altercations while in the house. During the second altercation, Jenkins gave Thomason a black eye and bruises. As a result, both were removed by production due to the altercation.|$|E
