SCOPE This method describes the procedure to be followed in determining the quality of the seam of a helical continuously welded seam corrugated metal pipe. The procedure to be used involves physically distorting a short length of welded seam by using a 25 mm diameter hemispherical punch and a 38 mm inside diameter contoured die. The resulting <b>distorted</b> <b>weld</b> area will hereafter be called th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{control of}} self-motion is {{supported}} by visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive signals. Recent research has shown how these signals interact in the mon-key medio-superior temporal area (area MST) to enhance and disambiguate the perception of heading during self-motion. Area MST is a central stage for self-motion processing from optic Xow, and integrates Xow Weld information with vestibular self-motion and extraretinal eye movement information. Such multimodal cue integration is clearly important to solidify perception. However to under-stand the information processing capabilities of the brain, one must also ask how much information can be deduced from a single cue alone. This is particularly pertinent for optic Xow, where controversies over its usefulness for self-motion control have existed ever since Gibson proposed his direct approach to ecological perception. In our study, we therefore, tested macaque MST neurons for their heading selectivity in highly complex Xow Welds based on the purely visual mechanisms. We recorded responses of MST neurons to simple radial Xow <b>Welds</b> and to <b>distorted</b> Xow <b>Welds</b> that simulated a self-motion plus an eye movement. About half of the cells compensated for such distortion and kept the same heading selectivity in both cases. Our results strongly support {{the notion of an}} involvement of area MST in the computation of heading...|$|R
5000|$|Aluminium and {{aluminium}} alloys are another class of frequently used materials. They are well-machinable and have low outgassing, unless the alloys contain {{higher proportion of}} zinc. The parts must not be anodized, as the oxide layer traps (and outgases) water vapor. Aluminium and its alloys have low strength at high temperatures, <b>distort</b> when being <b>welded,</b> and the copper-containing ones are poorly weldable. Aluminium wire rings {{can be used as}} cheap gaskets in demountable seals. Aluminium has high thermal conductivity, good corrosion resistance, and low solubility of hydrogen. Loss of strength at high temperatures limits its use in bakeable applications, but aluminium is advantageous for large-size systems due to its lower weight and lower cost than stainless steel. Use of aluminium is limited by difficulties in its welding and brazing. It can be used for x-ray windows.|$|R
