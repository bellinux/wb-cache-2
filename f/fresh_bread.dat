5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce <b>fresh</b> <b>bread</b> for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E

500|$|Bellerophon {{anchored}} off Brixham on {{the morning}} of 24 July, and there Maitland received orders from Admiral Lord Keith to [...] "prevent every person whatever from coming on board the ship you command, except the officers and men who compose her crew." [...] Despite turning away the shore boats which approached the anchored warship bringing <b>fresh</b> <b>bread</b> and fruit to sell, word eventually leaked out that Napoleon was aboard the ship. The news created a sensation, and large numbers of boats filled with sightseers soon surrounded the ship. Occasionally Napoleon would come out to look at them, but despite entreaties from some people to be allowed on board, Maitland refused to allow any contact between ship and shore. On 26 July Bellerophon received orders to proceed to Plymouth harbour where Lord Keith was anchored aboard his flagship [...] Napoleon remained on board Bellerophon and the ship was kept isolated from the throngs of curious sightseers by two guardships, [...] and , anchored close at hand.|$|E
500|$|The BLT Cookbook {{discusses}} the author's {{love of the}} BLT sandwich, which according to Jordan is [...] "America's favorite sandwich". The author wrote, [...] "There are times when the BLT just tastes right, primal and true, {{the best thing you}} could ever eat. The play of the salt and acid, the silk of the tomato against the salt crunch of the bacon ... It is sheer delight." [...] She discusses ways the combination can be used in soups, appetizers, and salads. Recipes are provided for multiple versions of the BLT sandwich. Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients. She recommends shopping at farmers' markets for fresh tomatoes, a butcher for choice bacon, and a bakery for <b>fresh</b> <b>bread.</b> The author recommends mayonnaise brands Hellmann's and Best Foods, and Niman bacon from California. Jordan writes, [...] "For lettuce, remove the first outer leaf and then use only the next three layers. Further in, iceberg lettuce gets a little cabbagey." ...|$|E

2500|$|Afghan {{bread is}} {{commonly}} stocked at Middle Eastern grocery stores in western countries. In Afghanistan the baker still cooks the bread {{the traditional way}} by spreading the dough around the tandoor, so that it quickly puffs up and starts to colour and emit a <b>fresh</b> <b>bread</b> smell that draws the early morning throngs of people. The baker then uses two long iron tongs to pull the bread from the tandoor wall. Afghans carry the bread in cloth bags.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{detailed}} information about Italian Jewish cookery in the book Massechet Purim. It discusses pies, chestnuts, turtledoves, pancakes, small tarts, gingerbread, ragouts, venison, roast goose, chicken, stuffed pigeons, ducks, pheasants, partridges, quails, macaroons, and salad. These were considered luxuries. The oppressed medieval Jews enjoyed large meals only on Shabbat, festivals, circumcisions, and weddings. For example, the Jews of Rhodes, according to a letter of Ovadiah Bartinura, 1488, lived on herbs and vegetables only, never tasting meat or wine. [...] In Egypt, however, meat, fish, and cheese were obtainable, in Gaza, grapes, fruit, and wine. [...] Cold dishes are still relished in the East. Generally, only one dish was eaten, with <b>fresh</b> <b>bread</b> daily.|$|E

2500|$|He {{landed at}} Bojnik near Radan Mountain, a {{position}} surrounded by Bulgars, Albanians, White Russians, and Germans. Through {{the latter part}} of August he, and his team back in Bari and Caserta, and the Partisans in Serbia and elsewhere, finalised the details of Ratweek. Almost to cue, the White Russians blew up their ammunition dump and the enemy started to retreat. The following day, Maclean moved to near Leskovac, and the next day, Ratweek began, with fifty heavy bombers attacking the town at 11:30. [...] "Already the Fortresses were over their target -- were past it -- when, as we watched, the whole of Leskovac seemed to rise bodily into the air in a tornado of dust and smoke and debris,and a great rending noise fell on our ears. When we looked at the sky again, the Forts, still relentlessly following their course, were mere silvery dots in the distance. [...] Even the Partisans seemed subdued." [...] That night, the land offensive began, and Maclean watched the Partisans attack the Belgrade-Salonika railway, blowing up bridges, burning sleepers, and rendering it unusable. [...] When the Germans tried to repair it, the Balkan Air Force soon dissuaded them. They tried to evacuate Greece and Macedonia by air, but again the Allies thwarted them. Maclean, with three British companions and one Yugoslav guide, made his way on horseback north into Serbia. [...] They travelled for several days through prosperous countryside, [...] "so surprising after Bosnia and Dalmatia", where the peasants, who expressed great friendship for Britain and a certain caution about the Partisans, gave them lavish hospitality and food. One evening they camped outside a village, and soon saw [...] "a procession of peasant women arriving with an array of bowls, baskets, jars and bottles. From these they produced eggs and sour milk and <b>fresh</b> <b>bread</b> and a couple of chickens and a roast suckling-pig and cream cheese and pastry and wine and peaches and grapes". The journey produced many such vignettes, some pleasant, others of confusion, discomfort, worry. [...] Altogether Maclean found it [...] "an agreeable existence", reflecting [...] "with heightened distaste" [...] on the life he lived on Vis in the shadow of political negotiations. [...] He hoped he could remain in Serbia to be there when Belgrade was liberated, but received a message that Tito had disappeared—or as Churchill put it [...] "levanted"—and he had to try to find him. [...] A plane was sent to pick up Maclean.|$|E
