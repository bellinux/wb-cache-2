40|$|BACKGROUND: International {{migration}} {{flow data}} often lack adequate measurements of volume, direction and completeness. These pitfalls limit empirical comparative studies of migration and cross national population projections to use net migration measures or inadequate data. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims {{to address these}} issues at a global level, presenting estimates of bilateral <b>flow</b> <b>tables</b> between 191 countries. METHODS: A methodology to estimate <b>flow</b> <b>tables</b> of migration transitions for the globe is illustrated in two parts. First, a methodology to derive flows from sequential stock tables is developed.

50|$|OpenFlow uses TCAM {{tables to}} route packet {{sequences}} (flows). If flows {{arrive at a}} switch, a <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> lookup is performed. Depending on the <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> implementation this is done in a software <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> if a vSwitch is used or in an ASIC if it's implemented in hardware. In the case when no matching flow is found a request to the controller for further instructions is sent. This is handled {{in one of three}} different modes. In reactive mode the controller acts after these requests and creates and installs a rule in the <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> for the corresponding packet if necessary. In proactive mode the controller populates <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> entries for all possible traffic matches possible for this switch in advance. This mode can be compared with typical routing table entries today, where all static entries are installed ahead of time. Following this no request is sent to the controller since all incoming flows will find a matching entry. A major advantage in proactive mode is that all packets are forwarded in line rate (considering all <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> entries in TCAM) and no delay is added. The third mode, hybrid mode, follows the flexibility of a reactive mode for a set of traffic and the low-latency forwarding (proactive mode) {{for the rest of the}} traffic.|$|E

40|$|Hierarchical {{policies}} {{are useful in}} many contexts in which resources are shared among multiple entities. Such policies can easily express the delegation of authority and the resolution of conflicts, which arise naturally when decision-making is decentralized. Conceptually, a hierarchical policy {{could be used to}} manage network resources, but commodity switches, which match packets using <b>flow</b> <b>tables,</b> do not realize hierarchies directly. This paper presents Hierarchical <b>Flow</b> <b>Tables</b> (HFT), a framework for specifying and realizing hierarchical policies in software defined networks. HFT {{policies are}} organized as trees, where each component of the tree can independently determine the action to take on each packet. When independent parts of the tree arrive at conflicting decisions, HFT resolves conflicts with user-defined conflict-resolution operators, which exist at each node of the tree. We present a compiler that realizes HFT policies on a distributed network of OpenFlow switches, and prove its correctness using the Coq proof assistant. We then evaluate the use of HFT to improve performance of networked applications...|$|R

40|$|An {{asynchronous}} unit {{delay is}} an n-input n-output sequential circuit {{in which the}} present value of the output n-tuple is equal to the value of the input n-tuple prior to the last input change. This thesis considers the problem of realization of the asynchronous unit delay and its use in the design of asynchronous circuits. Asynchronous fundamental mode <b>flow</b> <b>tables</b> have been classified as "asynchronous definite" and "asynchronous indefinite", where asynchronous definite and asynchronous indefinite properties are modifications of the definite and indefinite properties of synchronous sequential machines respectively. It is shown that a fundamental mode table is realizable as a feedback-free connection of asynchronous unit delays if and only if the table is asynchronous definite. Straight-forward methods of realizing asynchronous definite and asynchronous indefinite <b>flow</b> <b>tables</b> without critical races by circuits of asynchronous unit delays and combinational gates are developed. The use of asynchronous unit delays avoids complicated secondary assignment problems, results in circuits with very simple structure and brings closer the theories of synchronous and asynchronous sequential machines...|$|R

Packets which are unmatched by the switch can be forwarded to the controller. The controller can then decide to modify existing <b>flow</b> <b>table</b> rules on one or more switches or to deploy new rules, to prevent a structural flow of traffic between switch and controller.

40|$|Obtaining flow-level measurements, {{similar to}} those {{provided}} by Netflow/IPFIX, with OpenFlow is challenging as it requires the installation of an entry per flow in the <b>flow</b> <b>tables.</b> This approach does not scale well {{with the number of}} concurrent flows in the traffic as the number of entries in the <b>flow</b> <b>tables</b> is limited and small. Flow monitoring rules may also interfere with forwarding or other rules already present in the switches, which are often defined at different granularities than the flow level. In this paper, we present a transparent and scalable flow-based monitoring solution that is fully compatible with current off-the-shelf OpenFlow switches. As in NetFlow/IPFIX, we aggregate packets into flows directly in the switches and asynchronously send traffic reports to an external collector. In order to reduce the overhead, we implement three different traffic sampling methods depending on the OpenFlow features available in the switch. We developed our complete flow monitoring solution within OpenDaylight and evaluated its accuracy in a testbed with Open vSwitch. Our experimental results using real-world traffic traces show that the proposed sampling methods are accurate and can effectively reduce the resource requirements of flow measurements in OpenFlow.

40|$|Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has {{recently}} gained considerable attentions from both industry and research communities since {{the development of}} communication technology and smart city. However, a proprietary and closed way of operating hardwares in network equipments slows down the progress of new services deployment and extension in IoV. Moreover, the tightly coupled control and data planes in traditional networks significantly increase the complexity and cost of network management. By proposing a novel architecture, called Software-Defined Internet of Vehicles (SDIV), we adopt the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to address these problems by leveraging its separation of the control plane from the data plane and a uniform way to configure heterogeneous switches. However, the characteristics of IoV introduce the very challenges in rule installation due to the limited size of <b>Flow</b> <b>Tables</b> at OpenFlow-enabled switches which are {{the main component of}} SDN. It is necessary to build compact <b>Flow</b> <b>Tables</b> for the scalability of IoV. Accordingly, we develop a rule optimization approach for real-time query service in SDIV. Specifically, we separate wired data plane from wireless data plane and use multicast address in wireless data plane. Furthermore, we introduce a destination-driven model in wired data plane for reducing the number of rules at switches. Experiments show that our rule optimization strategy reduces the number of rules while keeping the performance of data transmission...|$|R
