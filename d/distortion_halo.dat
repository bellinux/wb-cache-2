40|$|We {{compare the}} {{non-linear}} matter power spectrum in real space calculated analytically from 3 rd-order perturbation theory with N-body simulations at 1 1, {{the shape of}} oscillations is distorted from the linear theory prediction. Nevertheless, our results suggest that one can correct the distortion caused by non-linearity almost exactly. We also find that perturbation theory, which does not contain any free parameters, provides a significantly better fit to the simulations than the conventional approaches based on empirical fitting functions to simulations. The future work would include perturbation theory calculations of non-linearity in redshift space <b>distortion</b> and <b>halo</b> biasing in the weakly non-linear regime...|$|R
40|$|We {{extend the}} concept of galaxy {{environment}} from the local galaxy number density to the gravitational potential and its functions like the shear tensor. For this purpose we examine whether or not one can make an accurate estimation of the gravitational potential from an observational sample which is finite in volume, biased due to galaxy biasing, and subject to redshift space <b>distortion.</b> Dark <b>halos</b> in a ΛCDM simulation are used in this test.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{how different}} amounts of induced spherical aberration (SA) affect the light distortion (LD) phenomena, tests were performed using an experimental device {{to measure the}} <b>distortion</b> (<b>haloes,</b> glare, and so on) of a point source. To simulate the effect of SA, eight different phase plates between þ 0. 300 and − 0. 300 μm of SA for a 5 -mm aperture were used in a random and double-masked experimental design. Measurements were performed {{at a distance of}} 2 m in a darkened room in 10 eyes of five subjects {{with a mean age of}} 26. 4 6. 1 years and a mean refractive error of − 0. 50 0. 70 D. Data were obtained with natural pupil and after pupil dilatation. The measurements with this experimental system showed a significant increase in all distortion parameters with cycloplegia for the phase plates with the higher positive SA (þ 0. 300 and þ 0. 150 μm). The disturbance index increased from 14. 86 6. 12 % to 57. 98 36. 20 % (p < 0. 05) with the þ 0. 300 μm plate. The same effect was observed through at a much lower rate when the eye could accommodate. Plates inducing negative SA did not change the LD compared to the control condition without induction of SA or even decreased the effect of distortion. Pupillary dilation and cyclopegia led to a significant increase in the size of the LD when increasing values of SA were induced. Accommodation and pupillary constriction are capable of compensating the degradation of the optical quality induced.

40|$|We {{present a}} new model for the full shape of {{large-scale}} the power spectrum based on renormalized perturbation theory. To test the validity of this prescription, we compare this model against power spectra measured in a suite of 50 large volume, moderate resolution N-body simulations. Our results indicate that this simple model provides an accurate description of the full shape of the power spectrum {{taking into account the}} effects of non-linear evolution, redshift-space <b>distortions</b> and <b>halo</b> bias for scales k < 0. 15 h/Mpc, making it a valuable tool for the analysis of forthcoming galaxy surveys. Even though its application is restricted to large scales, this prescription can provide tighter constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter w_{DE} than those obtained by modelling the baryonic acoustic oscillations signal only, where the information of the broad-band shape of the power spectrum is discarded. Our model is able to provide constraints comparable to those obtained by applying a similar model to the full shape of the correlation function, which is affected by different systematics. Hence, with accurate modelling of the power spectrum, the same cosmological information can be extracted from both statistics. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} a Magellanic Cloud origin for the warp of the Milky Way can explain most {{quantitative}} features of the outer H I layer recently identified by Levine et al. We construct a model, similar to that presented by Weinberg in 1998, that produces distortions in the dark matter halo, and we calculate the combined effect of these dark <b>halo</b> <b>distortions</b> and the direct tidal forcing by the Magellanic Clouds on the disk warp in the linear regime. The interaction of the dark matter halo with the disk and resonances between the orbit of the Clouds and the disk account for the large amplitudes observed for the vertical m = 0, 1, and 2 harmonics. The observations lead to six constraints on warp-forcing mechanisms, and our model reasonably approximates all six. The disk is shown to be very dynamic, constantly changing its shape as the Clouds proceed along their orbit. We discuss the challenges to MOND posed by the observations...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{structure}} of solvent-free processed poly(pyromellitic dianhydride-oxydianiline) PMDAODA is probed using grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS). The films are cured below the (bulk) {{glass transition temperature}} of the polyimide. The surface-influenced ordering in the top 10 nm {{of the film is}} comparable to that of films which were cast and cured from polymeric precursor solutions in a polar solvent that complexed prior to the conversion to polyimide (PI). This shows that the surface effects are the dominant force to influence the near surface ordering. The crystal orientation closer to the surface has more fiber texture with the b-axis perpendicular to the surface and the a- and c-axes randomly oriented in the film plane. Line shape analysis as a function of X-ray penetration depth and changes in the unit cell dimensions suggests that the distortion is at the ether linkage of theODAunit. The decrease in crystal <b>distortion</b> and amorphous <b>halo</b> peaks relative to crystalline peaks, as penetration depth decreases, shows that both {{the quality and quantity of}} the order improves closer to the air/PI interface...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{precision}} study of large-scale structure from large galaxy redshift surveys. We focus on two main subjects of large-scale structure: precisioncosmology with baryon acoustic oscillations from large galaxy surveys {{and the evolution}} of galaxy clustering for passively flowing galaxies. The baryon acoustic oscillations in galaxy redshift surveys can serve as an efficient standard ruler to measure the cosmological distance scale, i. e., theangular diameter distances and Hubble parameters, as a function of redshift, and therefore dark energy parameters. We use a Fisher matrix formalism to show that such a standard ruler tests can constrain the angular diameter distances and Hubble parameters to a precision of a few percent, thereby providing robust measurements of present-day dark energy density and its time-dependence. We use N-body simulations to investigate possible systematic errors in the recovery of the cosmological distance scale from galaxy redshift surveys. We show that the baryon signature on linear and quasi-linear scales is robust against nonlinear growth, redshift <b>distortions,</b> and <b>halo</b> (or galaxy) bias, albeit partial obscuration of the signature occurs due to nonlinear growth and redshift distortions. We present the improved Fisher matrix formalism which incorporates the Lagrangian displacement field to describe the nonlinear effects on baryon signature as a function of time and scale. We present a physically motivated, reduced 2 -dimensional fitting formula for the full Fisher matrix formalism. We show that distance precision from the revised formalism is in excellent agreement with distance precision from N-body simulations. Finally, we present a numerical study of the evolution of galaxy clustering when galaxies flow passively from high redshift to low redshift, that is, without merging or new formations. We show that passive flow evolution induces interesting characteristics in the galaxy distribution at low redshift: we find an asymptotic convergence in galaxy clustering and halo occupation distribution regardless of the initial distribution of galaxies...|$|R
40|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} the cold dark matter (CDM) hypothesis {{is the presence of}} {{a very large number of}} low-mass haloes, too small to have made a visible galaxy. Other hypotheses for the nature of the dark matter, such as warm dark matter (WDM), predict a much smaller number of such low-mass haloes. Strong lensing systems offer the possibility of detecting small-mass <b>haloes</b> through the <b>distortions</b> they induce in the lensed image. Here we show that the main contribution to the image <b>distortions</b> comes from <b>haloes</b> along the line of sight rather than subhaloes in the lens as has normally been assumed so far. These interlopers enhance the differences between the predictions of CDM and WDM models. We derive the total perturber mass function, including both subhaloes and interlopers, and show that measurements of approximately 20 strong lens systems with a detection limit of M_ low= 10 ^ 7 h^- 1 M_ would distinguish (at 3 sigma) between CDM and a WDM model consisting of 7 keV sterile neutrinos such as those required to explain the recently detected 3. 5 keV X-ray emission line from the centres of galaxies and clusters.
