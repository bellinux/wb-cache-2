One {{of the main}} parameters influencing the cutting process {{is the use of}} different coolants and flushing strategies along with and in accordance with the design of new cutting tools and machine tool components. Using hybrid cooling strategies combining, for example high pressure flushing, or cryogenic cooling, or aerosol and MQL offers the potential to extend profitability and energy efficiency, achieving high performance and improved surface integrity. The paper presents two main problems during machining of dies and molds – drilling and high efficiency in micro machining. Machining results during drilling are compared with results from finite element models, taking into account the different properties of cryogenic <b>flushing,</b> <b>tool</b> geometry and the position of the cooling channels. In order to achieve higher efficiency in micro machining and drilling on large CNC machines the development and application of the coolant flow of the coolant-driven spindle is used at the same time for tool rotation, for cooling and for chip evacuation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTitanium alloys {{have been}} widely used in the aerospace, {{biomedical}} and automotive industries because of their good strength-to-weight ratio and superior corrosion resistance. However, {{it is very difficult to}} machine Titanium alloy materials due to their poor machinability, resulting in short tool life. The effects of oil mist and air jet <b>flushing</b> on <b>tool</b> wear in the milling of Ti 6 Al 4 V were investigated at a cutting speed of 300 m/min in this study. Tests with various flushing directions of oil mist and air jet during up, and down-cut were carried out. Tool wear and chip shape were measured and analyzed. As a result of these cutting tests and considerations, it was revealed that up-cut with oil mist flushed from any direction and air jet flushed from the side were desirable, and dry down-cut was also desirable...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} {{decades of the twentieth}} century {{substantial}} resources were invested in the development of projects for the aerospace sector. The efforts in research and development initiatives were successful, but the related manufacturing success remained elusive. Since then the focus of industrial development in the aerospace domain has shifted towards component manufacture for the major aerospace supply chains of the developed world. This paper discusses current results of a large collaborative project aiming at systematic research towards improved and more efficient utilisation of the High Speed Cutting (HSC), and particularly the High Performance Machining (HPM) technologies especially related to the machining of some of the key materials in the aerospace industry such as selected titanium alloys. In this way the targeted cost optimisation and lead time shortening could be modeled and practically achieved. In the study some basic phenomena such as heat generation, cutting forces and chip flow, performance conditions, i. e. <b>flushing</b> strategies, cutting <b>tool</b> materials, as well as performance criteria such as tool life and tool geometry, during milling of titanium alloys were investigated. The generic results are compared with modeling and simulation runs and implemented in 4 and 5 axis milling of a demonstrator, a typical aerospace part, applying different machining strategies...|$|R
40|$|In {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) process, the debris removed from electrode material strongly affects the machining efficiency and accuracy, especially for the deep small hole machining process. In case of Ti alloy, the debris movement and removal process in gap flow between electrodes for small hole EDM process is studied in this paper. Based on the solid-liquid two-phase flow equation, the mathematical model on the gap flow field with flushing and self-adaptive disturbation is developed. In our 3 D simulation process, the count of debris increases with number of EDM discharge cycles, and the disturbation generated by the movement of self-adaptive tool in the gap flow is considered. The methods of smoothing and remeshing are also applied in the modeling process to enable a movable tool. Under different depth, <b>flushing</b> velocity, and <b>tool</b> diameter, the distribution of velocity field, pressure field of gap flow, and debris movement are analyzed. The statistical study of debris distribution under different machining conditions is also carried out. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted on a self-made machine to verify the 3 D simulation model. The experiment results show the burn mark at hole bottom and the tapered wall, which corresponds well with the simulating conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Direct milling of micro {{structured}} parts {{becomes more}} important due to its inherent advantages, such as the possibility to machine three- dimensional geometrical structures {{over a wide range}} of materials in low production volumes. Despite micro milling being an issue for increased research in the past years, processes still lack of reliability and stability. Moreover, factors exerting a critical influence on conventional machining processes, such as cutting fluids, have not been regarded in detail in micro milling operations. Thus, the main purpose of this work is to investigate the mode of action of different cutting fluids and to deduct its influences on main process response variables. A profile is developed which reflects those properties of cutting fluids required to cope best with the specifications, requirements and demands of the micro milling process. It could be clearly shown that oil based coolants are superior to water based systems in micro milling. It can be concluded that the lubrication effect of the fluid has a higher importance and that strong cooling properties even lead to an increased wear rate of the <b>tool.</b> <b>Flushing</b> away chips of the cutting zone is a major function of the cutting fluid and can be achieved by minimum quantity lubrication. An optimum viscosity is low enough to enable the entrance into the cutting zone and ease the chip transport but high enough to remain in the cutting zone in order to reach sufficient lubrication properties. Cutting fluids with moderate specific heat, heat of vaporization, thermal conductivity and thermal capacity should be used to restrict its cooling action. Constrained space in micro milling applications demands the use of tailor-made solutions of cutting fluid methods of application. Complex loading exerted normal to the cutting tool during a micro milling process may make the delivery of a cutting fluid necessary, particularly at the interface between the tool clearance face and the newly cut machined surface...|$|R
