40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} the historical outline and current development of the educational policy <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> difficulties in Australia, focusing especially {{on the state of}} Queensland. In order to develop educational policy of learning difficulities at the state level, the concept of learning difficulities had been discussed until the middle of the 1970 's. Receiving the submissions which argued strongly against a diagnostically-oriented definition of learning disabilities, the Select Comittee concluded that there was much conceptual confusion regarding the definition and cause of learining difficulties that might take many years to resolve. Despite that it was recongnised that action was needed to assist children by looking at their "total learning environmerit", and recommended the development of an educational policy <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> difficulties. During 1980 's, support teachers <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> difficulties were employed in many schools. Scince the early 1980 's support teachers have been making their efforts in regular classrooms rather than in the resource rooms. Their roles have been to help <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> difficulties using effective and specific skills, and to consult with the regular classroom teacher in solving the problems related to learning difficulties in regular classes. Currently, the support system <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> difficulties has been employed to organize a more systematic and broader approach in Queensland based on the accountability of schools. In the context of enphasizing literacy and numeracy, a systematic whole school approach and particular programs, such as the Year 2 Diagnostic Net and Reading Recovery, have been introduced into the educational system for early identification and early intervention...|$|R
