5|$|Being {{a form of}} carbon, diamond oxidizes in air if <b>heated</b> over 700°C. In {{absence of}} oxygen, e.g. in a flow of high-purity argon gas, diamond can be <b>heated</b> up to about 1700°C. Its surface blackens, but can be {{recovered}} by re-polishing. At high pressure (~20GPa) diamond can be <b>heated</b> up to 2500°C, and a report published in 2009 suggests that diamond can withstand temperatures of 3000°C and above.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the <b>heated</b> water to form a geyser, a {{plumbing}} system made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the water while it is being <b>heated.</b> Geysers are generally aligned along faults. Constrictions in the system {{are essential to the}} building up of pressure before an eruption.|$|E
5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} gem trade by {{marketing}} the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become {{a major issue in}} the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being <b>heated</b> to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and <b>heated</b> them to an artificial blue. A problem with the practice was that <b>heated</b> gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a <b>heated</b> gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E

5|$|Geyser activity, {{like all}} hot spring activity, {{is caused by}} surface water {{gradually}} seeping down through the ground until it meets rock <b>heated</b> by magma. The geothermally <b>heated</b> water then rises back toward the surface by convection through porous and fractured rocks. Geysers differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected {{to one or more}} narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water and pressure tight rock.|$|E

This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E
