5|$|The legal Underbelly DVD was {{released}} 8 May 2008 by Roadshow Entertainment, {{a day after}} the final episode was aired on television. In accordance with the legal suppression, the release was not distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet. Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays will carry a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> sale, distribution or exhibition in Victoria. Legal experts said Victorians who bought the box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, but anyone who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia. In September 2008, a Limited Edition DVD {{was released}}, containing a numbered steel case and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams– A Day of Reckoning. The Underbelly soundtrack was released on 29 March 2008, both as a CD and online. It features elements of the score by Burkhard Dallwitz in addition to music tracks that were featured in the series. Underbelly was released on Blu-ray on 5 August 2010.|$|E

The script for Wanderlust, bought by Universal Pictures, was written by Rudd, Ken Marino, and David Wain, with the latter also directing the film, and was produced by Judd Apatow. The movie was about a married couple who join a commune after losing their money and deciding modern life <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> them. Wanderlust received positive reviews but was a box office failure, grossing only $21 million worldwide, against a production budget of $35 million.|$|E
25|$|Like any {{breed of}} dog, the Picardy Shepherd <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> everyone, and much thought must {{be devoted to}} {{choosing}} the right dog.

In 2006 the Berger Picard Club of America was formed to help promote and protect this breed. The Berger Picard was fully recognized in the herding group by the American Kennel Club as of 1 July 2015.|$|E
25|$|In most of Canada, either partner may informally {{assume the}} spouse's surname after marriage, {{so long as}} it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the {{purposes}} of fraud. The same is true for people in common-law relationships, in some provinces. This is not considered a legal name change in most provinces, excluding British Columbia. For federal purposes, such as a Canadian passport, Canadians may also assume their partner's surname if they are in a common-law relationship. In the province of British Columbia, people have to undergo a legal name change if they want to use a combined surname after marriage. Their marriage certificate is considered proof of their new name.|$|E

25|$|Old East Norse, between 800 and 1100, {{is called}} Runic Swedish in Sweden and Runic Danish in Denmark.

25|$|However, the {{judiciary}} {{has used its}} power to adjudge executive actions and Acts of Parliament unconstitutional and void rather sparingly. To date, the only instance where the High Court struck down a statutory provision was in Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998). It was short-lived, as the decision was later overturned by the Court of Appeal. Delivering the Court's judgment, Chief Justice Yong Pung How emphasized the limits of judicial review, stating that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the courts to dictate the scope and ambit of a section or rule on its propriety. This is a matter which only Parliament can decide, and the courts can only interpret what is enacted. This results in a conflict between the court's responsibility {{to be faithful to}} the Constitution, and its apparently restricted role in reviewing legislation.|$|E
25|$|Warning {{signs are}} often used where sight {{distance}} is insufficient. The US MUTCD requires Stop Ahead, Yield Ahead or Signal Ahead signs at intersections where the traffic control device is not visible from a distance equal to the stopping sight distance at speed of approaching traffic. Hill Blocks View signs can be used where crest vertical curves restrict sight distance. However, many jurisdictions still expect drivers to use ordinary care regarding conditions readily apparent to a driver, without the prompting of a sign. The care and focus ordinarily required of a driver against certain types of hazards may be somewhat amplified on roads with lower functional classification. The probability of spontaneous traffic increases proportionally to the density of access points, and this density should be readily apparent to a driver even when a specific access point <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> <b>For</b> this reason, full corner sight distance is almost never required for individual driveways in urban high-density residential areas, and street parking is commonly permitted within the right-of-way.|$|E
