50|$|The ISI Foundation {{was founded}} and {{supported}} by the Regional Government, the Province and City of Turin, and by the two major Bank institutions in Piedmont: Compagnia di San Paolo and the CRT Foundation. Its core mission is the promotion of scientific research within the international cooperation, fostering the creation of research groups and of innovative and interdisciplinary labs, with a special focus on the science of complex systems. The aim is to create a new connection between basic and applied science, helping to face and solve some of the essential issues of contemporary society. The challenge of complexity has now become a sort of paradigm of modernity, and Turin and Piedmont have nowadays {{become one of the most}} important international locations in such fundamental research. Thanks to the support of the public founding members and to the precious and continuous cooperation with the CRT Foundation (in particular with the Lagrange Project) and the San Paolo Company, the ISI Foundation was able to tackle, by new <b>frontiers</b> <b>research</b> <b>projects,</b> bold paths, settling itself among the main research centres for complexity. The success and richness of the research work at the ISI Foundation resides primarily in the “human factor” encompassing the scientific and personal value of its scientific and administrative staff, as well as the complex web of human relations that everyday brings the institute to life.|$|R

For behavioral networks with different complex networks topology, we analyze the nonlinear dynamics including the chaotic dynamics by the numerical simulation tools. With changing the topological structure, the behavioral networks behave affluent dynamical phenomena. Lastly, we draw the conclusion and paste the prospection about the networks model...|$|R

In this paper, {{we focus on}} the evaluation of <b>frontier</b> scientific <b>research</b> <b>projects.</b> We argue that the "intellectual distance" between the knowledge embodied in research proposals and an evaluator's own expertise systematically relates to the evaluations given (and consequent resource allocation). We empirically evaluate effects in data collected from a grant proposal process at a leading research university in which we randomized the assignment of evaluators and proposals to generate 2, 130 evaluator-proposal pairs. We find evaluators systematically give lower scores to research proposals closer to their own areas of expertise, and to highly novel research proposals. We interpret the empirical patterns in relation to a range of theoretical mechanisms and discuss implications for policy, managerial intervention and allocation of resources in the ongoing accumulation of scientific knowledge...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{a concept}} for inferring attributes of 'frontier research' in peer-reviewed <b>research</b> <b>project</b> proposals under the European Research Council (ERC) scheme. The concept serves two purposes: 1) to conceptualize and define, automatically extract, and comparatively assess attributes of <b>frontier</b> <b>research</b> in proposals; and 2) {{to build and}} compare outcomes of a statistical model with the review decision {{in order to obtain}} further insight and reflect upon the influence of <b>frontier</b> <b>research</b> in the peer-review process. To this end, indicators (including scientific 'novelty', 'risk', or interdisciplinarity') across scientific disciplines and in accord with the strategic definition of <b>frontier</b> <b>research</b> by the Council are elaborated, exploiting textual proposal information and other bibliometric data of applicants. Subsequently, a concept is discussed to measure ex-post the influence of indicators on the decision probability (or, alternatively, the odds) of a proposal to be accepted. The final analysis of the classification and decision probabilities compares and contrasts review decisions in order to, e. g., statistically explain congruence between <b>frontier</b> <b>research</b> and review decision or reveal differential representation of attributes. Ultimately, the concept is aiming at a methodology that monitors the effectiveness and efficiency of peer-review processes...|$|R

40|$|Depression {{and chronic}} pain have been {{estimated}} to co-occur {{in up to}} 80 % of patients suffering from these disorders, with this co-morbidity being more disabling and more expensive to both patients and society than either disorder alone. A number of neural substrates have been proposed to underlie this association; however, there has been increased interest and support for a role of neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory mechanisms as key players in this dyad. This chapter will {{provide an overview of}} the clinical and preclinical data supporting a role for neuroimmune alterations in depression-pain co-morbidity. We propose that such changes may impact on the functioning of key brain regions modulating emotional and nociceptive processing, thus resulting in the behavioural, psychological and physical symptoms observed in patients exhibiting depression and co-morbid pain.

40|$|Journal articleTherapeutic {{strategies}} {{based on}} the principles of tissue engineering by self-assembly put forward the notion that functional regeneration can be achieved by utilising the inherent capacity of cells to create highly sophisticated supramolecular assemblies. However, in dilute ex vivo microenvironments, prolonged culture time is required to develop an extracellular matrix-rich implantable device. Herein, we assessed the influence of macromolecular crowding, a biophysical phenomenon that regulates intra- and extra-cellular activities in multicellular organisms, in human corneal fibroblast culture. In the presence of macromolecules, abundant extracellular matrix deposition was evidenced as fast as 48 h in culture, even at low serum concentration. Temperature responsive copolymers allowed the detachment of dense and cohesive supramolecularly assembled living substitutes within 6 days in culture. Morphological, histological, gene and protein analysis assays demonstrated maintenance of tissue-specific function. Macromolecular crowding opens new avenues for a more rational design in engineering of clinically relevant tissue modules in vitro.

40|$|Abstract. The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Europe (FAIR) {{will provide}} {{worldwide}} unique accelerator and experimental facilities {{allowing for a}} large variety of unprecedented <b>frontier</b> <b>research</b> in extreme state of matter physics and applied science. Indeed, {{it is the largest}} basic <b>research</b> <b>project</b> on the roadmap of the European Strategy Forum of Research Infrastructures (ESFRI), and it is cornerstone of the European Research Area. FAIR offers to scientists from the whole world an abundance of outstanding research opportunities, broader in scope than any other contemporary large-scale facility worldwide. More than 2500 scientists are involved in setting up and exploiting the FAIR facility. They will push the frontiers of our knowledge in plasma, nuclear, atomic, hadron and applied physics far ahead, with important implications also for other fields in science such as cosmology, astro and particle physics, and technology. It includes 14 initial experiments, which form the four scientific pillars of FAIR. The main thrust of intense heavy ion and laser beam-matter interaction research focuses on the structure and evolution of extreme state of matter on both a microscopic and on a cosmic scale. 1.
