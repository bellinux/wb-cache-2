5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E

He implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members {{up to speed on}} the issue. His <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures</b> ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed, gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect and approval of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his industriousness and knowledgability. Cabinet minister George Pearce would later conclude that Bruce was the best of the prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38-year parliamentary career.|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} self-adaptive predictive pursuing policy {{consists of}} an action <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> and a procedure of adjusting the estimation of evader’s action preference. Since correct estimation of opponent’s intention would do good to win adversarial games, it introduces the conception of action preference to model opponent’s decision-making. Because evader often has different action preference in different situation, to model evader’s decision-making, pursuer has to divide the situation space into many categories and provide a set of estimation of evader’s action preference for each kind of situation. Pursuer adjusts the estimation of evader’s action preference in certain situation by observing evader’s action. Action <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> consists of situation sorting, possible future states computation, payoff evaluation and action selection. Action decision-making {{is based on the}} decision tree constructed by expected payoffs. Expected payoffs are integrated from single payoffs.

40|$|Abstract Background Portable energy {{dispersive}} X-ray fluorescence (pEDXRF) spectrometry analysis {{was applied for}} the characterisation of archaeological ceramic findings from three Neolithic sites in Serbia. Two dimension reduction techniques, principal component analysis (PCA) and scattering matrices-based dimension reduction were {{used to examine the}} possible classification of those findings, and to extract the most discriminant features. Results A <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> is proposed, whose goal is to classify unknown ceramic findings based on their elemental compositions derived by pEDXRF spectrometry. As a major part of <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure,</b> the possibilities of two dimension reduction methods were tested. Scattering matrices-based dimension reduction was found to be the more efficient method for the purpose. Linear classifiers designed based on the desired output allowed for 7 of 8 unknown samples from the test set to be correctly classified. Conclusions Based on the results, the conclusion is that despite the constraints typical of the applied analytical technique, the elemental composition can be considered as viable information in provenience studies. With a fully-developed procedure, ceramic artefacts can be classified based on their elemental composition and well-known provenance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Producción CientíficaIn {{this paper}} we propose a <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> where the agents judge the {{alternatives}} through linguistic terms such as `very good', `good', `acceptable', etc. If the agents are not con dent about their opinions, they can use a linguistic expression formed by several consecutive linguistic terms. To obtain a ranking on the set of alternatives, the method consists of three di erent stages. The rst stage looks for the alternatives in which the overall opinion is closer to the ideal assessment. The overall opinion is developed by a distance-based process among the individual assessments. The next two stages form a tie-breaking process. Firstly by using a dispersion index based on the Gini coe cient, and secondly by taking into account the number of best-assessments.
