5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love me, but I have a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to show the full me.|$|E
25|$|I saw the Curtiss planes {{approximately}} 300 meters {{below us}} and falling away below. These aircraft were {{no threat to}} us whatsoever! Now <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to level out of my turning bank, since my colleagues were already at a substantially higher altitude. Keppler (his wingman), overshot me. Once again, I saw the Curtiss planes 300 meters directly below me and counted eleven aircraft.|$|E

25|$|I guess <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> {{this album}} to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E
500|$|Interviewed {{more than}} 35 years later, Northrup stated {{that she had}} signed the {{statement}} because [...] "I thought by doing so he would leave me and Alexis alone. It was horrible. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to be free of}} him!" ...|$|E
500|$|Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf, {{one of the}} show's makeup creators, was {{extremely}} pleased with Drago's makeup in the episode. She later noted, [...] "I remember Billy Drago was awesome–he looked so creepy after makeup. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> this guy to look super-creepy and disturbing to look at, but real enough {{that you might be}} scared if you looked out your window at night and saw him standing there".|$|E

500|$|... "We had a charmed life ... then Francesca became ill. There {{was a game}} in {{the autumn}} of '92 ... that we lost 7–1 at Blackburn. The team stayed in a bleak hotel and it rained endlessly. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to get back home. With {{hindsight}} you think, 'Why the bloody hell was I playing?' Very soon afterwards, Francesca died. She was sleeping between us. I realised what was happening and woke Susan. We cradled Francesca and cried." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E
500|$|... "She {{was unhappy}} with the whole damn thing, so I went in and {{sweetened}} {{up a lot of}} music for her, adding some guitars to 'Lucky Star', some voices, some magic. [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to do the best job I could do for her. When we would play back 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', you could see that she was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. You wanted to help her, you know? As much as she could be a bitch, when you were in groove with her, it was very cool, very creative." ...|$|E

500|$|The A. A. Rayner Funeral Home in Chicago {{received}} Till's body. Upon arrival, Bradley {{insisted on}} viewing {{it to make}} a positive identification, later stating that the stench from it was noticeable two blocks away. She decided to have an open-casket funeral, saying, [...] "There was just no way I could describe what was in that box. No way. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> the world to see." [...] Tens {{of thousands of people}} lined the street outside the mortuary to view Till's body, and days later thousands more attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ.|$|E

It’s something that I did with her voice. I mean, a lot or people who hear it, they might not even realize that it's her. I use textures when I do records and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know where that came from. She's really foolish {{to be out here}} talking [...] I'm still gonna keep her on the song because she ain't know what she was doing".|$|E
500|$|The tour {{launched}} on August 7, 2001, at Corpus Christi, Texas, and ran twenty-five dates through mid-September. Tickets price ranged between $29.99 and $39.99. In {{an interview with}} Deseret News, Simpson said that it [...] "was a fun tour. That was like a preparation for me. It {{was one of those}} things where <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to go out and meet all my fans." [...] A video tape, titled Dream Chaser, was released on January 22, 2002, which included Simpson's biography, music videos, behind-the-scenes looks at [...] "Irresistible" [...] and [...] "A Little Bit", and footage from the tour. The tape reached number twenty-five on Billboard Top Music Videos chart, for the issue dated February 9, 2002.|$|E

500|$|Jamila M'Barek {{told the}} court {{that she was not}} with her brother when he {{disposed}} of the body, and in fact, she stated that she had never been to the site. She claimed that she had no role in the killing other than helping her brother, under duress, load the body into his car. She told investigators, [...] "I did not want him to die. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> my brother to intimidate him so that he would continue to pay me my allowance. But he didn't {{want to have anything to}} do with it, so a violent quarrel broke out. I left the room because I could not stand to see what was happening".|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Mangini joined Dream Theater, Portnoy e-mailed {{the band}} asking to rejoin, but his attempt was rebuffed. Reflecting on his arrival to the band, Mangini told Noisecreep, [...] "As I see it, as I look back, I really think what {{happened}} was that this band kind of started over. They were in a new place as they looked for a drummer, and I when got the news, after the shock wore off, I knew what I wanted to do – which was just basically come in and try to support where they wanted to go. They had a vision, they had great ideas, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to help them achieve those things." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{started writing}} what I felt was Bat Out of Hell part 2, {{definitely}} like The Godfather part I and part 2, that's how I saw it. I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to see if I could make a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E

When asked why the song was remixed, Hugo replied with, [...] "We wanted something with more of a straight-ahead, club-bumping beat, just a different take on it. We like to remix, dismantle, take apart shit {{and put it back}} together. It's just like a Rubik's Cube: When you can't solve it, you just break it and you put it back together." [...] Williams added, [...] "We think that 'Everyone Nose' in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to go and do something different." ...|$|E
500|$|Villa {{admitted}} that he came close to giving up football {{at the age of}} 14 after growing disillusioned and falling out with his coach. However, thanks to his parents' encouragement, he persisted in pursuing his dream, realising his talent could earn him a living. [...] "In those days I was a nobody, not earning a penny and after being made to sit on the bench all season <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to get away and play with my friends" [...] he said. [...] "But my dad always supported me and cheered me up until my career turned round." [...] He went on to begin his footballing career at UP Langreo and when he turned 17 he joined the Mareo football school.|$|E
500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] was {{the first}} episode that did not feature regular {{character}} Kramer (Michael Richards), Jerry's neighbor. David explained {{that the reason for}} Kramer's absence was because—during Seinfelds early seasons—the character never left his apartment and did not go out with the other three. Richards was still displeased with the absence of his character, as he felt the episode was a breakthrough and—as such—essential for the series' development. In an interview for the Seinfeld first and second season DVD box set, he commented, [...] "The Chinese restaurant episode was so unique, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to be a part of}} that because it was cutting edge. I knew that was a very important episode; it was so odd." ...|$|E
