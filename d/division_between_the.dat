5|$|Martin Lichtenstein {{described}} C. a. foetens, the Andean black vulture, in 1817, and Charles Lucien Bonaparte described C. a. brasiliensis, from Central and South America, in 1850 on {{the basis}} of smaller size and minor plumage differences. However it has been established that the change between the three subspecies is clinal (that is, there is no <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> subspecies), and hence they are no longer recognised.|$|E

5|$|English in England can {{be divided}} into four major dialect regions, Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern English. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Yorkshire dialects, and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian). Having been the centre of Danish {{occupation}} during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's {{is a small}} church, {{measuring}} 30feet by 12feet 3inches (about 9.1 by 3.7m). It {{dates from}} the late medieval period, and was constructed using rubble masonry and large stones. It had a slate roof, {{although most of the}} roof has now gone, and there is a bellcote at the west end, which may be original rather than a later addition. There is no physical <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> nave and the chancel, although one account in the 19th century said that there had originally been a screen separating them, and some traces of it still remained at that time.|$|E

5|$|Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament {{were members}} of {{pioneering}} grunge band Green River during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> pair and bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner. In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with Malfunkshun vocalist Andrew Wood, eventually organizing the band Mother Love Bone. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found {{the support of the}} PolyGram record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, Apple, was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a heroin overdose.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{which is}} small and rectangular, has no {{internal}} <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> nave and the chancel. It measures 47feet 6inches by 14feet 9inches (14.5 by 4.5m). It is built of rubble masonry, and the roof is made of slate; there is a gabled bellcote at {{the west end of}} the roof. The roof timbers {{can be seen from the}} inside. Entrance to the church is through a porch with a rounded arch at the west end of the south wall, and there is a vestry, with one window, at the west end of the north wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} saw the {{beginnings}} of a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had its foundation in the Reformation. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Evangelicals and the Moderate Party over fears of fanaticism by the former and the acceptance of Enlightenment ideas by the latter. Ecclesiastical patronage, the right of local lairds or other notables to appoint ministers to a parish, had been abolished at the Glorious Revolution, but it was reintroduced in the Patronage Act of 1711, resulting in frequent protests from the kirk.|$|E

5|$|The {{inheritance}} of Greater Poland by Przemysł II went peacefully. The union {{proved to be}} durable, and {{with the exception of}} its borders with the Duchy of Wrocław, survived throughout his reign. However, despite the personal unification of the territory, the division between Kalisz and Gniezno persisted almost {{to the end of the}} 18th century. Later, in times of Casimir III the Great, there was also a visible <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> old voivodeships of Poznań and Kalisz.|$|E
5|$|A {{scenario}} {{consistent with}} the phylogenetic, ice sheet size, and sea-level depth data is that during the Late Pleistocene the sea levels were at their lowest. A single wave of wolf colonization into North America commenced {{with the opening of}} the Bering land bridge 70,000YBP. It ended with the closing of the Yukon corridor that ran along the <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet 23,000YBP during the Late Glacial Maximum. As wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but the genetic ancestry of modern wolves could be traced back only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through genetic admixture. The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one is {{consistent with the}} findings of earlier studies.|$|E
5|$|Despite his administration's scandals, Grant {{continued}} to be personally popular. His reelection was supported by Frederick Douglas and other prominent abolitionists along with reformers of the Indian question. A growing number of political reformers, however, were disappointed by the Gold Ring, Grant's support of Reconstruction, and corruption in the New York Customs House. To placate them, Grant created a Civil Service Commission authorized by Congress in 1871. The Commission, chaired by reformer George William Curtis, proposed reformist rules and regulations, which Grant implemented by executive order in April 1872, Congress appropriating funds in May. Congress stopped funding the Commission in December 1875, having refused to pass legislation to implement its recommendations. There was further intraparty <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> faction most concerned with {{the plight of the}} freedmen, and the faction concerned with the growth of industry and small government. During the war, both factions' interests had aligned, and in 1868 both had supported Grant. As the wartime coalition began to fray, Grant's alignment with the party's pro-Reconstruction elements alienated party leaders who favored an end to federal intervention in Southern racial issues.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim saw {{religion}} {{as the most}} fundamental social institution of humankind, and one {{that gave rise to}} other social forms. It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw the {{religion as}} a force that emerged in the early hunter and gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the DF renamed {{itself the}} Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and {{underwent}} an internal reorganisation. However, {{the group was}} facing an internal schism between those (such as Hyndman), who argued for a parliamentary path toward socialism, and those (like Morris) who deemed the Houses of Parliament intrinsically corrupt and capitalist. Personal issues between Morris and Hyndman were exacerbated by their attitude to British foreign policy; Morris was staunchly anti-imperialist while Hyndman expressed patriotic sentiment encouraging some foreign intervention. The <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups developed into open conflict, {{with the majority of}} activists sharing Morris' position. In December 1884 Morris and his supporters – most notably Ernest Belfort Bax and Edward Aveling – left the SDF; the first major schism of the British socialist movement.|$|E
5|$|In November 1994, the Siege of Bihać {{entered a}} {{critical}} stage as the VRS and the ARSK {{came close to}} capturing the town from the Bosniak-dominated ARBiH. Bihać {{was seen as a}} strategic area by the international community. It was thought that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war, widening the <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> United States on one side and France and the United Kingdom on the other (advocating different approaches to the area's preservation), and feared that Bihać would become the worst humanitarian disaster of the war. Furthermore, denying Bihać to the Serbs was strategically important to Croatia. Brigadier General Krešimir Ćosić expected the VRS and the ARSK would threaten Karlovac and Sisak once they captured Bihać, while Chief of Croatia's General Staff General Janko Bobetko believed the fall of Bihać would represent an end to Croatia's war effort.|$|E

5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of the}} 19th century the area which is today Minnesota was not {{recognized}} as a single entity. The Mississippi River had divided the eastern British/French lands of North America from the western Spanish lands and even after the Louisiana Purchase this was for a time seen as a separation between territories. The <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> U.S. territories {{in the region and}} the British territories remained ambiguous until the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which set the border with British North America at the 49th parallel west of the Lake of the Woods (except for a small chunk of land now dubbed the Northwest Angle). Border disputes east of the Lake of the Woods continued until the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842.|$|E
5|$|In {{the heart}} of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of {{separation}} between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.|$|E
5|$|M-50 {{also joined}} the freeway at Cascade Road headed east, and {{together}} I-96/US16/M-50 continued through eastern Kent County. M-50 departed {{to the south}} near Lowell, and the freeway crossed into southern Ionia County. Passing south of Portland, the freeway crossed east into Clinton County. North of Grand Ledge, I-96 ended and US16 followed Wright Road off the freeway to Grand River Avenue. From there east, US16 resumed its historic routing into the city of Lansing. Grand River Avenue carried the highway past the Capital City Airport and east to Larch Street, where US16 turned south along US27 north of downtown Lansing. At Saginaw Street, eastbound US16 turned east on the one-way street, while westbound traffic ran a block north on Grand River Avenue. The two directions of travel merge at {{the east end of}} Saginaw Street in East Lansing. Grand River Avenue through East Lansing follows a tree-lined boulevard that forms the <b>division</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> campus of Michigan State University to the south {{and the rest of the}} city to the north. US16 continued east in Ingham County through Okemos and rural parts of the county through Williamston and Webberville.|$|E
