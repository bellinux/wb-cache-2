However, little attention has been given to the adjustment behaviour of capital structure in the construction industry over the business cycles, in particular within the context of emerging markets. The partial adjustment model with the GMM (i. e. generalized method of moments) estimation is used to examine the adjustment behaviour of capital structure in the construction industry within the context of Taiwan during the period 1982 to 2007. The results suggest that, first, the average rate of adjustment is 26. 3 % of the adjustment gap between the target <b>debt</b> <b>ratios</b> and the previous <b>debt</b> <b>ratios</b> for firms in the construction industry of Taiwan. However, the average rate of adjustment towards the target <b>debt</b> <b>ratios</b> has slowed down after the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Secondly, firms with the financial constraint of over-leverage relative to the target <b>debt</b> <b>ratios</b> have lower <b>debt</b> <b>ratios</b> than those firms with the financial constraint of under-leverage. In addition, the difference in <b>debt</b> <b>ratios</b> between firms with the financial constraint of over-leverage and under-leverage has become narrower after the Asian financial crisis.

However, the gap between the highest and lowest income households widened in the five-year period to 2004-2005; in response, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) stated in 2002: [...] "On balance, budgets over the past 10 to 20 years have been more favourable to high income groups than low income groups, but particularly so during periods of high growth". [...] Unemployment fell from 18% in the late 1980s to 4.5% by the end of 2007, and average industrial wages grew at one of the highest rates in Europe. Inflation brushed 5% per annum {{towards the end of the}} [...] "Tiger" [...] period, pushing Irish prices up to those of Nordic Europe, even though wage rates are roughly the same as in the UK.
