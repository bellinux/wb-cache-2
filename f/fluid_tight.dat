The analysis show that the natural frequency of vibration varies from 1306. 3 Hz to 3879 Hz. The External excitation on transmission housing must be eliminated to prevent the fracture of housing. The reason for the fracture is matching of external excitation frequency to natural frequency of transmission housing. Transmission housing design is a complex procedure.

We set out to determine whether hypoxia creates a dysfunctional alveolar epithelial barrier, evidenced by an increase in transepithelial electrical conductance (Gt), due to a decrease in the abundance of TJ proteins at the plasma membrane. Alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) exposed to mild hypoxia (Po 2 = 50 mmHg) for 30 and 60 min decreased occludin abundance at the plasma membrane and significantly increased Gt. Other cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin and claudins were not affected by hypoxia. AEC exposed to hypoxia increased superoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Overexpression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1) but not SOD 2 prevented the hypoxia-induced Gt increase and occludin reduction in AEC. Also, overexpression of catalase had a similar effect as SOD 1, despite not detecting any increase in H 2 O 2 during hypoxia. Blocking PKC-ζ and protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) prevented the hypoxia-induced occludin reduction at the plasma membrane and increase in Gt.

However, these methods often involve complicated procedures and algorithms that are difficult to precisely control. The purpose of the current study is to establish a feasible method to evaluate alterations in lung permeability by instilling fluorescently labeled dextran (FITC-Dextran) intranasally. For the mouse model of direct ALI, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered intranasally. FITC-Dextran was instilled intranasally one hour before the mice were euthanized. Plasma fluorescence intensities from the LPS group were significantly higher than in the control group. To determine the reliability and reproducibility of the procedure, we also measured the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, the protein concentration of the bronchoalveolar lavage <b>fluid,</b> <b>tight</b> and adherens junction markers and pathological changes. Consistent results were observed when the LPS group was compared with the control group. Simultaneously, we found that the concentration of plasma FITC-Dextran was LPS dose-dependent. The concentration of plasma FITC-Dextran also increased with initial intranasal FITC-Dextran doses. Furthermore, increased fluorescence intensity of plasma FITC-Dextran was found in the intraperitoneally LPS-induced ALI model. In conclusion, the measurement of FITC-Dextran in plasma after intranasal instillation is a simple, reliable, and reproducible method to evaluate lung permeability alterations in vivo. The concentration of FITC-Dextran in the plasma may be useful as a potential peripheral biomarker of ALI in experimental clinical studies...|$|E

We present experimental {{results for the}} leak rate of rubber seals, and compare the results to a novel theory, {{which is based on}} percolation theory and a recently developed contact mechanics theory. We find good agreement between theory and experiment. Copyright c © EPLA, 2009 A seal is a device for closing a gap or making a joint <b>fluid</b> <b>tight</b> [1]. Seals {{play a crucial role in}} many modern engineering devices, and the failure of seals may result in catastrophic events, such as the Challenger disaster. In spite of its apparent simplicity, it is not easy to predict the leak rate and (for dynamic seals) the friction forces [2] for seals. The main problem is the influence of surface roughness on the contact mechanics at the seal-substrate interface. Most surfaces of engineering interest have surface roughness on a wide range of length scales [3], e. g, from cm to nm, which will influence the leak rate and friction of seals, and accounting for the whole range of surface roughness is impossible using standard numerical methods, such as the Finite Element Method. In this paper we present experimental results for the leak rate of rubber seals, and compare the results to a novel theory [3 – 5], which is based on percolation theory and a recently developed contact mechanics theory [6 – 12], which accurately takes into account the elastic coupling between the contact regions in the nominal rubber-substrate contact area. Earlier contact mechanics models, such as the Greenwood-Williamson [13] model or the model of Bush et al. [14], neglect this elastic coupling, which results in highly incorrect results [15, 16], in partic-ular for the relations between the squeezing pressure and the interfacial separation [17].

Consistent with this idea, we demonstrate that ZO- 1 siRNA delivery inside the blastomeres of zona-weakened embryos using electroporation not only knocks down ZO- 1 gene and protein expressions, but also inhibits morula to blastocyst transformation in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, ZO- 1 inactivation reduced the expression of Cdx 2 and Oct- 4, but not ZO- 2 and F-actin.

The role of mass transfer in gas injection into an oil phase at fractured media is significant. In naturally fractured reservoirs, fluid exists in two interconnected systems; the rock matrix, which contains the bulk of the volume of the oil reservoir, and the high permeability fractures medium. Laboratory measurements of the diffusion coefficient of methane into crude oil under both unsteady-state and steady-state conditions were carried out to obtain the dissolution rates of methane during gas injection and/or flooding in the short term, and for enhanced oil recovery at thermodynamic equilibrium in the long term. The pressure drop in the core flooding cell during the contact of the methane and oil phases was used to measure the diffusion coefficient of the system under the reservoir conditions. A new empirical correlation for the diffusion coefficient was achieved using the measured experimental data at reservoir conditions. A comparison of this new correlation and previous methods shows that the current method is more accurate than other methods at high pressure and temperature conditions. Experimental tests on <b>fluid</b> flow in <b>tight</b> carbonate porous media were carried out with single and composite core plugs. It was demonstrated that the swelling of oil strongly depended on the contact time of the oil and gas phases and heterogeneity of the system.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is {{a useful}} tool for enhancing rock mass permeability for shale gas development, enhanced geothermal systems, and geological carbon sequestration by the high-pressure injection of a fracturing <b>fluid</b> into <b>tight</b> reservoir rocks. Although significant advances have been made in hydraulic fracturing theory, experiments, and numerical modeling, {{when it comes to the}} complexity of geological conditions knowledge is still limited. Mechanisms of fluid injection-induced fracture initiation and propagation should be better understood to take full advantage of hydraulic fracturing. This paper presents the development and application of discrete particle modeling based on two-dimensional particle flow code (PFC 2 D). Firstly, it is shown that the modeled value of the breakdown pressure for the hydraulic fracturing process is approximately equal to analytically calculated values under varied in situ stress conditions. Furthermore, a series of simulations for hydraulic fracturing in competent rock was performed to examine the influence of the in situ stress ratio, fluid injection rate, and fluid viscosity on the borehole pressure history, the geometry of hydraulic fractures, and the pore-pressure field, respectively. It was found that the hydraulic fractures in an isotropic medium always propagate parallel to the orientation of the maximum principal stress. When a high fluid injection rate is used, higher breakdown pressure is needed for fracture propagation and complex geometries of fractures can develop. When a low viscosity fluid is used, fluid can more easily penetrate from the borehole into the surrounding rock, which causes a reduction of the effective stress and leads to a lower breakdown pressure. Moreover, the geometry of the fractures is not particularly sensitive to the fluid viscosity in the approximate isotropic model...|$|R

The two streams are density-matched, but the slow fluid is R (nu) times more viscous than the rapid stream. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed for several viscosity ratios, R (nu) = nu (h i g h) /nu (l o w), varying between 1 and 9. The space-time evolution of Variable-Viscosity Flow (VVF) is {{compared with that of}} the Constant-Viscosity Flow (CVF), for which R (nu) = 1. The initial Reynolds number, based on the initial momentum thickness, delta (oee integral, 0), is for the considered cases. The study focuses on the first stages of the temporal evolution of the mixing-layer. It is shown that in VVF (with respect to CVF) : (i) the velocity fluctuations occur earlier and are more enhanced for VVF. In particular, the kinetic energy peaks earlier and is up to three times larger for VVF than for CVF at the earliest stages of the flow. Over the first stages of the flow, the temporal growth rate of the fluctuations kinetic energy is exponential, in full agreement with linear stability theory. (ii) large-scale quantities, i. e. mean longitudinal velocity and momentum thickness, are affected by the viscosity variations, thus dispelling the myth that viscosity is a small-scale quantity that affects little the large scales. (iii) the transport equation for the fluctuations kinetic energy is derived and favourably compared with simulations data. The enhanced kinetic energy for VVF is mainly due to an increased production at the interface between the two <b>fluids,</b> in <b>tight</b> correlation with enlarged values of mean velocity gradient at the inflection point of the mean velocity profile...|$|R
30|$|MICP {{data can}} also be used with Hager’s (1998) method to {{estimate}} effective tortuosity values, which characterize the convoluted pathways of fluid flow through porous systems (e.g., Epstein 1989; Hu and Wang 2003; Gommes et al. 2009). Following Gommes et al. (2009) approach (Eq.  2) of relating geometrical tortuosity to the travel paths that molecules will need to follow through a porous medium, the L e/L ratios for the American and Chinese shales are on the order of 2 – 11 (Table  2). These relatively large values of tortuosity imply that <b>fluid</b> within the <b>tight</b> shale formations will need to make its way through some tortuous pathways in order to migrate from one location to another. For example, a tortuosity L e/L of 11 for Longmaxi Formation sample means that it will take 11  cm for fluid to travel a linear distance of 1  cm in that formation. This is consistent with the findings from other approaches presented in this paper, which indicate that the nanopores of the tight shale formations are poorly connected so that fluids require much time to find connected pathways to travel a limited distance.|$|R

Similarly each individual is comprised of a variety of bones of differing lengths. The largest contribution to the lengthening of a skeletal element, and to the differential elongation of elements, comes from a dramatic increase in the volume of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate as they undergo terminal differentiation 1 – 7. Despite this recognized importance, the mechanisms of chondrocyte volume enlargement have remained a mystery 8 – 11. Here we use quantitative phase microscopy 12 to show that chondrocytes undergo three distinct phases of volume increase, including a phase of massive cell swelling in which the cellular dry mass is significantly diluted. In light of the <b>tight</b> <b>fluid</b> regulatory mechanisms known to control volume in many cell types 13, this stands as a remarkable mechanism for increasing cell size and regulating growth rate. It is, however, the duration of the final phase of volume enlargement by proportional dry mass increase at low density that varies most between rapidly and slowly elongating growth plates. Moreover, we find that this third phas...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{explore the}} process of {{knowledge}} exchange in an informal email network for evidence based health care, to illuminate {{the value of the}} service and its critical success factors, and to identify areas for improvement. DESIGN: Illuminative evaluation. SETTING: Targeted email and networking service for UK healthcare practitioners and researchers. PARTICIPANTS: 2800 members of a networking service. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tracking of email messages, interviews with core staff, and a qualitative analysis of messages, postings from focus groups, and invited and unsolicited feedback to the service. RESULTS: The informal email network helped {{to bridge the gap between}} research and practice by serving as a rich source of information, providing access to members' experiences, suggestions, and ideas, facilitating cross boundary collaboration, and enabling participation in networking at a variety of levels. Ad hoc groupings and communities of practice emerged spontaneously as members discovered common areas of interest. CONCLUSION: This study illuminated how knowledge for evidence based health care can be targeted, personalised, and made meaningful through informal social processes. Critical success factors include a broad based membership from both the research and service communities; a loose and <b>fluid</b> network structure; <b>tight</b> targeting of messages based on members' interests; the presence of a strong network identity and culture of reciprocity; and the opportunity for new members to learn through passive participation...|$|R
