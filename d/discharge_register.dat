40|$|AbstractAimTo study if data {{on lower}} limb amputations and {{vascular}} {{operations in the}} National Hospital <b>Discharge</b> <b>Register</b> {{can be used for}} comparison of diabetes care between hospital districts. MethodsWe identified diabetic persons from the National Hospital <b>Discharge</b> <b>Register</b> (1988 – 2002), the National Social Security Institute (since 1964) and pharmacies (since 1994). A search for lower limb amputations and vascular operations was made through the Hospital <b>Discharge</b> <b>Register.</b> An analysis of the correlation of the age and gender adjusted incidence of first major amputations and the age and gender adjusted incidence of first vascular operations for diabetics was made between 14 hospitals districts with the largest diabetic population. ResultsA total of 308, 447 diabetics were identified. There were 11, 070 diabetics who had a lower extremity amputation and 9530 diabetics who had a vascular operation in Finland in 1988 – 2002. The annual number of first amputations decreased from 924 to 387 per 100, 000 diabetics during the study period. There were up to three-fold differences in age and gender adjusted indexed numbers of first amputations between different hospital districts during the last follow-up period from year 2000 to 2002. There was a clear inverse correlation between the incidence of first major amputations and first vascular operations and particularly between incidence of first major amputations and infrapopliteal reconstructions. ConclusionThe incidence of major amputation is declining in the diabetic population. This positive development can be explained by more active vascular operative treatment. Regional differences are wider than acceptable...|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous {{abortions in}} {{hospital}} sterilising staff were analysed {{using data from}} a postal questionnaire and a hospital <b>discharge</b> <b>register.</b> The study included all the sterilising staff employed in Finnish hospitals in 1980; the controls were nursing auxiliaries. Data from the questionnaire showed that the frequency of spontaneous abortions was 11. 3 % for the sterilising staff and 10. 6 % for the nursing auxiliaries. When the staff were concerned in sterilising procedures during their pregnancy the frequency was 16. 7 % compared with 5. 6 % for the non-exposed pregnancies. Adjustment for age, parity, decade of pregnancy, smoking habits, and intake of coffee and alcohol {{did not affect the}} differences. The increased frequency of spontaneous abortion correlated with exposure to ethylene oxide but not with exposure to glutaraldehyde or to formaldehyde. Analysis of spontaneous abortions from the hospital <b>discharge</b> <b>register</b> confirmed the findings.

40|$|Hospital {{discharge}} data {{is routinely}} collected in Finland {{and it is}} an invaluable source of information when assessing injury epidemiology as well as treatment. The database can be used when planning injury prevention and redirecting resources of the health care system. Most recently our hospital <b>discharge</b> <b>register</b> has been used to assess the incidence of surgical treatment of common fractures. This study was aimed to evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the Finnish National Hospital <b>Discharge</b> <b>Register</b> (NHDR) focusing on hip fractures. In other words, patients hospitalized for a pertrochanteric hip fracture were used to assess the validity of the NHDR. Methods The validity of the NHDR was assessed by comparing the data in hospital <b>discharge</b> <b>register</b> with the original patient records and radiographs in three separate hospitals; Tampere University Hospital, Hatanpää City Hospital of Tampere, and the Central Hospital of Kanta-Häme. The study analysis included 741 patients hospitalized due to pertrochanteric hip fracture between 1 st January 2008 and 31 st December 2010. Results The diagnosis was correctly placed on 96 % (95 % CI: 94 to 97 %) of the 741 patients when radiographs were used as golden standard. The procedural coding had coverage of 98 % (95 % CI: 96 to 98 %) and an accuracy of 88 % (95 % CI: 85 to 90 %). The coverage of the external cause for injury was found to be 95 % (95 % CI: 94 to 97 %) with an accuracy of 90 % (95 % CI: 87 to 92 %). Conclusions Our results show that the validity of the Finnish NHDR is excellent as determined by accuracy of diagnosis and both accuracy and coverage of procedural coding and external cause for injury.

40|$|The Swedish National Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) Register {{contains}} more than 200 000 primary and secondary hip replacements. The failure end-point definition is revision. The aim of this thesis was to validate the results presented by the register and to study the outcome of hip replacement surgery in Sweden. The hypothesis was firstly {{that the number of}} failure reported to the Swedish THA register are valid and secondly that adding clinical and radiographic failure criteria will dramatically decrease the survival rate for total hip replacement (THR) implants. The study consisted of three parts with 2 - 10 years' follow-up of patients with total hip replacements. In part I, three general health questionnaires (Nottingham Health Profile, SF- 36, EuroQol) and two disease-specific instruments (WOMAC, Harris Hip Score) were tested for validity and reliability (n= 62). The results showed that the disease-specific questionnaires are at least as valid and reliable as the general instruments are. In part II, all THRs reported to the Swedish THA register from 1986 to 1994 (84 884 primary and 10176 revision hip replacements) were compared with the data from the <b>Discharge</b> <b>Register</b> and the Cause of Death Register in Sweden. 2604 patients were randomly selected from the <b>Discharge</b> <b>Register</b> to determine if they had undergone any revision surgery. The study showed that the Swedish THA register covers 94 % of the revisions actually performed in Sweden and the results did not differ significantly from the data in the <b>Discharge</b> <b>Register</b> and the results reported by the patients. In part III, 1056 patients from the selected cohort were studied further concerning general health and disease-specific health, using the Nottingham Health Profile, SF- 36 and WOMAC. An age and gender matched subcohort of 344 patients were then examined clinically, using the Harris Hip Score, and radiographically. The clinical and radiographic failure rates were in several tests as high as the revision rates documented in the Swedish THA register. The clinical results were, however, dependent on demographics, the definition of clinical failure and the scoring system used. The results presented by the register with revision as failure end-point give exact but limited information about the quality of hip replacement surgery in Swede...|$|E

Information on suicides in women of reproductive age was linked with the Finnish birth, abortion, and hospital <b>discharge</b> <b>registers</b> to find out how many women who committed suicide had had a completed pregnancy during her last year of life. SETTING: Nationwide data from Finland. SUBJECTS: Women who committed suicide in 1987 - 94. RESULTS: There were 73 suicides associated with pregnancy, representing 5. 4 % of all suicides in women in this age group. The mean annual suicide rate was 11. 3 per 100, 000. The suicide rate associated with birth was significantly lower (5. 9) and the rates associated with miscarriage (18. 1) and induced abortion (34. 7) were significantly higher than in the population. The risk associated with birth was higher among teenagers and that associated with abortion was increased in all age groups.

40|$|By {{combining}} {{data from}} the <b>Discharge</b> <b>registers</b> and the census bureaus in The Netherlands and Sweden, we calculated the age-specific incidences of primary total hip replacement (THR), studied the demographic profile of the population receiving THR and predicted demands. In the period 1986 - 1997, the number of THRs increased by 20 % in Sweden to 10, 000 operations (1131100, 000 inhabitants) and by 68 % to 17, 400 operations (112 / 100, 000 inhabitants) in The Netherlands. Of this increase 3 % and 15 % {{could be explained by}} changes in the age-profile and size of the population, respectively. Although the overall incidence of THR was similar in both countries in 1997, we found that, after correction for differences in population structure, the incidence of THR was 20 % higher in The Netherlands. In Sweden, relatively more men were operated on than in The Netherlands. We also found that in Sweden, but not in the Netherlands, relatively more older people were operated on in 1997 than in 1987.
