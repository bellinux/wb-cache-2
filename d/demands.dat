Erkko {{rejected}} the Soviet proposals, saying that the Soviet <b>demands</b> would {{mean the end of}} the Finnish neutrality policy and displease the Germans. When the chairman of the Finnish Defense Council C.G.E. Mannerheim was informed of the negotiations, he opined that Finland should give up the Suursaari islands because their defence would anyway be impossible during a war, but his arguments did not persuade the majority of the Finnish government. Stein departed Helsinki empty-handed on 6 April.|$|E

5|$|Helium must be {{extracted}} from natural gas {{because it is}} present in air at {{only a fraction of}} that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, that 0.1% of the world's helium <b>demands</b> would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium <b>demands</b> could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants. Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.|$|E

The AFL–CIO sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help. Politically, the AFL–CIO supported the twenty-one <b>demands</b> of the Gdansk workers, by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those <b>demands</b> were met. Materially, the AFL–CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund. By 1981 it had raised almost $300,000, which was used to purchase printing presses and office supplies. The AFL–CIO donated typewriters, duplicating machines, a minibus, an offset press, and other supplies requested by Solidarity.|$|E

For example, if the <b>demand</b> for a good such as wheat increases, then this leads to an increase in the <b>demand</b> for labour. For another example, <b>demand</b> for steel leads to derived <b>demand</b> for steel workers, as steel workers are necessary for the production of steel. As the <b>demand</b> for steel increases, so does its price. The increase in price means manufacturers of steel can gain more in revenue if they produce more steel, thus leading to a higher <b>demand</b> for the resources involved in producing steel.|$|R

50|$|<b>Demand</b> {{response}} is generally {{used to refer}} to mechanisms used to encourage consumers to reduce <b>demand,</b> thereby reducing the peak <b>demand</b> for electricity.

Depending on the configuration of generation capacity, however, <b>demand</b> response may also be used to increase <b>demand</b> (load) at times of high production and low <b>demand.</b> Some systems may thereby encourage energy storage to arbitrage between periods of low and high <b>demand</b> (or low and high prices).|$|R

Less {{than half of the}} company's employees had joined the AASEREA, denying Thorpe's committee enough support from the company's employees to enforce a strike. The AASEREA instead sought assistance from other Indianapolis unions. On October 30, a letter signed by Thorpe {{and other members of the}} committee was sent to Robert L.

50|$|In economics, a {{complementary}} good or complement {{is a good}} with a negative cross elasticity of <b>demand,</b> {{in contrast to a}} substitute good. This means a good's <b>demand</b> is increased when the price of another good is decreased. Conversely, the <b>demand</b> for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased. If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the <b>demand</b> curve of A and cause the <b>demand</b> curve for B to shift in; less of each good will be <b>demanded.</b> A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the <b>demand</b> curve of A and cause the <b>demand</b> curve B to shift outward; more of each good will be <b>demanded.</b> Basically this means that since the <b>demand</b> of one good is linked to the <b>demand</b> of another good, if a higher quantity is <b>demanded</b> of one good, a higher quantity will also be <b>demanded</b> of the other, and if a lower quantity is <b>demanded</b> of one good, a lower quantity will be <b>demanded</b> of the other. The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way: if the price of one good rises, so will the price of the other, and vice versa. With substitute goods, however, the price and quantity <b>demanded</b> of one good is related inversely to the price and quantity <b>demanded</b> of a substitute good, meaning that if the price or quantity <b>demanded</b> of one good rises, the price or quantity <b>demanded</b> of its substitute will fall.|$|R
