5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> like a large hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, the power stations' {{operating}} hours were decreased due {{to the opening of}} the much larger Blyth power station in Northumberland. This meant that less ash was produced by the Stella and Dunston stations; so {{by the end of the}} 1960s, the CEGB sold Hexhamshire Lass and Bobby Shaftoe. The former went to a firm in Fareham, Hampshire, where <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> as a sand dredger until scrapped in 1993; the latter to a French dredging company.|$|E

5|$|Tracy and Hepburn reunited {{on screen}} {{for the first}} time in five years for the office-based comedy Desk Set (1957). Berg notes that <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> as a hybrid of their earlier romantic-comedy successes and Hepburn's {{spinster}} persona, but it performed poorly at the box-office. That summer, Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing. The shows were positively received.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Johnson {{returned}} to the House of Representatives. The legislature appointed him to the Senate in 1819 to fill the seat vacated by John J. Crittenden. As his prominence grew, his interracial relationship with Julia Chinn, an octoroon slave, was more widely criticized. <b>It</b> <b>worked</b> against his political ambitions. Unlike other upper class leaders who had African American mistresses but never mentioned them, Johnson openly treated Chinn as his common law wife. He acknowledged their two daughters as his children, giving them his surname, much {{to the consternation of}} some of his constituents. The relationship is believed to have led to the loss of his Senate seat in 1829, but his Congressional district returned him to the House the next year.|$|E
5|$|Frakes {{believes}} that the main themes of First Contact—and Star Trek as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This {{is evident in the}} film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship {{with the rest of the}} crew. The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his putting down his gun. A similar Moby-Dick reference was made in , and although Braga and Moore did not want to repeat it, they decided <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> so well they could not leave it out.|$|E

5|$|Lawrence went on {{to build}} a series of ever larger and more {{expensive}} cyclotrons. His Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University of California in 1936, with Lawrence as its director. In addition {{to the use of}} the cyclotron for physics, Lawrence also supported its use in research into medical uses of radioisotopes. During World War II, Lawrence developed electromagnetic isotope separation at the Radiation Laboratory. It used devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. A huge electromagnetic separation plant was built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which came to be called Y-12. The process was inefficient, but <b>it</b> <b>worked.</b>|$|E
5|$|On May27, the Myanmar {{government}} {{issued a}} rare appeal for {{aid to the}} international community in response to damage from the storm. The request included $220,000 (USD) worth of rice, tarpaulin sheets for temporary shelter, medicine, and clothing, to assist 14,000people. In early June, the government issued an updated appeal to request $337,000 (USD) to help 25,000people, after the scope of the disaster became better known. The Red Cross operation responding to the cyclone ended in December 2004, which marked the first time the agency had a major response to a disaster. <b>It</b> <b>worked</b> in conjunction with the World Food Programme, Bridge Asia Japan, and the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association, utilizing some private donations. Red Cross volunteers helped clear roads and clean ponds to return areas to normalcy. Typically, the government handles relief measures.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E

5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult to read their lips through new face masks that obscured their mouths. Modell tried to help by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment, but none of <b>it</b> <b>worked.</b> Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, who came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s {{was a new}} era for Indian {{women and}} is defined as 'feminism' that was {{responsible}} for the creation of localised women's associations. These associations emphasised women's education issues, developed livelihood strategies for working-class women, and also organised national level women's associations such as the All India Women's Conference. AIWC was closely affiliated with the Indian National Congress. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> within the nationalist and anti-colonialist freedom movements. This made the mass mobilisation of women an integral part of Indian nationalism. Women therefore were {{a very important part of}} various nationalist and anti-colonial efforts, including the civil disobedience movements in the 1930s.|$|E
