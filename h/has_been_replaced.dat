5|$|Uracil is {{not usually}} found in DNA, {{occurring}} only as a breakdown product of cytosine. However, in several bacteriophages, Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages PBS1 and PBS2 and Yersinia bacteriophage piR1-37, thymine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by uracil. Another phage - Staphylococcal phage S6 - has been identified with a genome where thymine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by uracil.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} was formerly called 'Huntington's chorea' but this term <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by 'Huntington's disease' {{because not all}} patients develop chorea and due {{to the importance of}} cognitive and behavioral problems.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the end of}} the 1870s, much of the {{original}} land grant <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by tracts of 40 acre. By 1880, cattle raising <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by agriculture as the most important local industry. During the years between 1910 and 1940, most of the agricultural land <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> by homes and factories.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the last}} 150 years, this layout <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by the usual Spanish colonial {{architecture}} of large square blocks with internal patios. Remnants {{of the initial}} design can still be seen in San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco, places that were not as much exposed to modernization as the other settlements.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the building is also similar to how it appeared when the house was constructed. However, a few changes have been made. In 1910 the two marble fireplaces were replaced by brick. The flooring <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> as needed. The home's basement, once the main living area, has since been converted several times for other uses.|$|E
5|$|Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced.</b>|$|E

5|$|MagSafe, a {{magnetic}} charging connector, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with USB-C charging. Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the user’s {{field of view}} to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power. The Macintosh startup chime {{that has been used}} since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.|$|E
5|$|The Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus, {{headed by}} the prime minister, is the body of {{officials}} that are heads of various ministries of the Belarusian government.

Northamptonshire are the current champions, claiming their second title in the 2016 season.|$|E

CO powers have been toned down, and no longer affect all units or the whole battle or the whole map. Tag powers from Dual Strike which allowed players to move twice in one turn have been removed.

5|$|The {{exterior}} of the observatory building has a brick cornice, with stone sills and lintels, stone water course, ornamental gutters, and original copper downspouts.

5|$|Thorium dioxide is a {{material}} for heat-resistant ceramics, {{as used in}} high-temperature laboratory crucibles, as a main material or as an addition to zirconium dioxide. An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising ammonia to nitrogen oxides, but this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% rhodium because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability.|$|E
5|$|With {{a length}} of , the Limyra Bridge qualifies as the largest {{surviving}} engineering achievement of antiquity in Lycia. The bridge stands on 26 uniform segmental arches consisting of a double, radially laid course of bricks. At the eastern end, the original 27tharch <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by two smaller, semicircular arches of later construction. The latter are built with a single course of bricks. Traces of the original, flat beginning of the collapsed arch are still visible on the piers.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin F. Stapleton was {{the mayor}} of Denver, Colorado, for two periods, the first from 1923 to 1931 and the second from 1935 to 1947. Stapleton was {{responsible}} for many civic improvements, notably during his second stint as mayor when he had access to funds and manpower from the New Deal. During this time, the park system was considerably expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amidst heavy criticism. It was later renamed Stapleton International Airport in his honor. Today, the airport <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by a neighborhood also named Stapleton. Stapleton Street continues to bear his name.|$|E

5|$|On its route southwards, {{the river}} passes the former {{junction}} with Aike Beck, once navigable to Lockington Landing, but the stream was subsequently re-routed {{to join the}} Arram Beck. The Leven Canal used to join on the east bank, but the entrance lock <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by a sluice. The Arram Beck flows in from the west, and then the river is crossed by Hull Bridge, the cause of repeated disagreement between {{the owners of the}} Driffield Navigation and the Corporation of Beverley, who owned the bridge. Just above Beverley Beck, which joins from the west, is Grovehill Bridge, now a lift bridge but once a ferry bridge.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the revolutionary}} {{features}} of the Apache was its helmet mounted display, the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS); among its capabilities, either the pilot or gunner can slave the helicopter's 30mm automatic M230 Chain Gun to their helmet, making the gun track head movements to point where they look. The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position, or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System (TADS). On more modern AH-64s, the TADS/PNVS <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by Lockheed Martin's Arrowhead (MTADS) targeting system.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E
