5|$|Ebert {{lived with}} {{cancer of the}} thyroid and salivary glands from 2002. This {{required}} treatments necessitating the removal of <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> jaw, which cost him the ability to speak or eat normally. His ability to write remained unimpaired, and he continued to publish frequently both online and in print until his death on April 4, 2013.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, Hamels was {{suspended}} for five games after hitting Bryce Harper in <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> back with a pitch, after admitting that it was intentional. On July 21, 2012, Hamels hit his first career home run off San Francisco Giants pitcher Matt Cain, who had homered off {{of him in the}} top half of the same inning, the first time in MLB that two pitchers had hit home runs off of each other in the same inning.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Horta stood {{motionless}} facing the ape-man. His wicked, deep-set eyes flashed angrily. He shook <b>his</b> <b>lowered</b> head.|$|R
60|$|Simon de Montfort {{turned to}} look at him, but the blank wall of <b>his</b> <b>lowered</b> visor gave no sign of the {{thoughts}} that passed beneath.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} I supposed," [...] replied Lapham sullenly. [...] "You always said so." [...] He looked sharply at her under <b>his</b> <b>lowering</b> brows.|$|R
5|$|After his tournament {{victory in}} July 2007, Asashōryū decided {{to skip the}} {{regional}} summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury. The medical forms submitted to the Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries to his left elbow and a stress fracture in <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> back would require six weeks of rest to heal. However, he was then seen on television participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia. He {{was reported to have}} done so {{at the request of the}} Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Mongolian government. However, the suggestion that he had exaggerated the extent of his injuries to avoid his duties on the exhibition tour caused a media storm.|$|E
5|$|Ahn {{was born}} James Anthony Hellmann in the naval {{hospital}} at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, to two US Navy enlisted personnel: his father John, Jr., an aviation electronics technician, {{and his mother}} JoAnn (née Delfarro), a journalist. He dropped out of Oak Harbor High School at age 16 and obtained a GED so he could enroll in community college. After completing <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> division coursework there, he transferred to Western Washington University (WWU). He earned his bachelor's degree in comparative cultural studies at WWU and a master's degree in Counselor Education at Penn State University.|$|E
5|$|At 08:45 Rivoli, {{which had}} been {{struggling}} to reach the harbour of Trieste, lost her mizzenmast under fire from both Victorious and Weasel. Nearly at the same moment, two of her 36-pounder long guns exploded, killing or wounding 60 men, greatly disorganising and demoralising the others, and forcing Barré to transfer gunners from the upper gun deck to man <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> battery. Fifteen minutes later, with his ship unmanageable and battered, Commodore Barré surrendered. Rivoli had suffered over 400 killed and wounded from her crew of over 800, who had only assembled {{for the first time}} a few days before and had never sailed their ship in open water. Losses aboard Victorious were also heavy, with one officer and 25 sailors and marines killed and six officers (including Captain Talbot) and 93 men wounded.|$|E
60|$|The mucker turned, a sulky scowl upon <b>his</b> <b>lowering</b> countenance, and {{the second}} officer {{saw that it was}} the fellow who had given Ward such a {{trimming}} the first day out.|$|R
25|$|He {{was denied}} an All Star that year, which {{caused a lot}} of controversy, even {{prompting}} his father, Frank, to put his own medal up for sale, due to <b>his</b> <b>lowered</b> opinion of the accolade.|$|R
60|$|Captain Barber {{turned and}} {{regarded}} the mate fixedly; the mate, after a vain attempt to meet <b>his</b> gaze, <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> {{eyes to the}} deck.|$|R
5|$|Cartman {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a red coat, brown pants, yellow gloves/mittens, and a yellow-brimmed turquoise knit cap tapered with a yellow pom-pom. He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his hat more often than the other characters with distinctive headwear. As he is overweight, his body is wider, his hands noticeably larger and his head is a more elliptical shape {{in contrast to the}} circular heads of the other children. An additional curved line on <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> face represents a double chin.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his rookie}} season with the Canucks, Daniel made his third World Championships appearance, in 2001 in Germany. He was injured midway through the tournament and {{had to return to}} Vancouver for surgery on a herniated disc in <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> back. Sweden {{defeated}} the United States 3–2 to win its second bronze medal in three years. He made a fourth tournament appearance at the 2005 World Championships in Austria. Sweden missed out on the bronze medal, losing to Russia, 6–3. Daniel had an assist in a losing effort during the bronze medal game. He finished with nine points in nine games, which tied for fourth in tournament-scoring.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. <b>His</b> <b>lower</b> limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo! That's a heavy one," [...] said Jukes, swaying to {{meet the}} long roll till <b>his</b> <b>lowered</b> hand touched the planks. This time the second mate made in his throat a noise of an unfriendly nature.|$|R
6000|$|... "Time is more {{precious}} now than {{any number of}} hands," [...] said the pilot, throwing a glance of impatience from under <b>his</b> <b>lowering</b> brows, [...] "and the consequences of delay must be visited on those who occasion it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Plan hell! You've spoiled my plan an' I've seen about {{enough of}} you." [...] Beasley breathed hard; <b>his</b> <b>lowering</b> gaze boded an {{uncertain}} will toward {{the man who}} had crossed him; his hand still hung low and clutching.|$|R
5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; {{the fingers of his}} right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E
5|$|He {{began to}} feel pain in <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> back shortly {{after the end of}} his junior season. In May 2011, while {{attending}} a basketball camp at the Deron Williams Academy in Chicago, Arcidiacono complained of poor mobility and soreness. He was diagnosed with a herniated disk in his back, forcing him to miss his senior season. Arcidiacono had surgery to repair the disk on December 21, and he could not leave his house for two weeks thereafter. Arcidiacono finished his career at Neshaminy High School as the program's all-time leading scorer. He tallied 1,498 points, 449 rebounds, 378 assists, 178 steals, and 160 three-pointers. Despite missing the season, ESPNU ranked him among the top 50 seniors in the country.|$|E
5|$|High relates {{that the}} great serpent Jörmungandr, also {{described}} as a child of Loki in the same source, will breach land as the sea violently swells onto it. The ship Naglfar, described in the Prose Edda as being made from the human nails of the dead, is released from its mooring, and sets sail on the surging sea, steered by a jötunn named Hrym. At the same time, Fenrir, eyes and nostrils spraying flames, charges forward with his mouth wide open, his upper jaw reaching to the heavens, <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> jaw touching the earth. At Fenrir's side, Jörmungandr sprays venom throughout {{the air and the}} sea.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Verloc, {{with all}} the placidity of an {{experienced}} wife, expressed a confident opinion as to the cause, and suggested the usual remedies; but her husband, rooted {{in the middle of}} the room, shook <b>his</b> <b>lowered</b> head sadly.|$|R
60|$|He hoisted {{the trunk}} on his shoulders, and, rather glad of <b>his</b> <b>lowered</b> face, {{advanced}} {{slowly into the}} house. Uncle and niece had just vanished {{at the head of}} the stairs, and Mr. Gale, after a moment's hesitation, followed.|$|R
6000|$|Captain MacWhirr, {{closing the}} book on <b>his</b> forefinger, <b>lowered</b> <b>his</b> arm and looked {{completely}} mystified. [...] "Why are you thinking of the Chinamen, Mr. Jukes?" [...] he inquired.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the seasons which did not feature post-season fights between the coaches, several seasons have been impacted, forcing postponements. Due to injuries to the season six coaches Matt Serra and Matt Hughes, their fight was postponed. Serra suffered a herniated disc in <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> back and Hughes later suffered a torn MCL before the fight finally took place at UFC 98. The fight between season ten coaches Rashad Evans and Quinton Jackson took place at UFC 114 with Rashad Evans winning by unanimous decision. The fight was postponed by five months due to Jackson's A-Team filming commitments and his temporary decision to retire from fighting.|$|E
5|$|In the Tour de France, Cancellara came {{in third}} of stage one's {{individual}} time trial. On the second stage, he was donned the yellow jersey {{thanks to a}} third place, which gave him four bonus seconds. He {{was involved in a}} mass pile-up on the third stage, and finished the race slowly. After a visit to the hospital, it was revealed that he had suffered two transverse process fractures in two vertebrae in <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> back and he had to abandon.|$|E
5|$|On August 10, 2012, U.S. Figure Skating {{announced}} that an agreement {{had been reached}} and Lysacek would return to competition at the 2012 Skate America. He withdrew after aggravating a groin injury. On November 20, 2012, Lysacek underwent surgery to repair a torn muscle in <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> abdomen, i.e. a sports hernia, with an expected period of six weeks off the ice. In January 2013, he withdrew from the 2013 U.S. Championships, saying he was healthy but needed an additional three weeks to return to competition form. Carroll {{said it would be}} a long recovery.|$|E
6000|$|The boy came doggedly forward. The man {{pushed back}} the well-worn straw hat from Clarence's {{forehead}} {{and looked into}} <b>his</b> <b>lowering</b> face. With <b>his</b> hand still on the boy's head he turned him round to the others, and said quietly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Re-opening <b>his</b> {{eyes and}} <b>lowering</b> <b>his</b> gun, Slagg beheld the peacock sailing {{away in the}} far distance.|$|R

5|$|Preparing for the Canucks' {{training}} {{camp for the}} 2009–10 season, Hodgson injured his back while working out in the summer. The injury, which was misdiagnosed as a bulging disc in <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> back, caused him to miss two months of summer training. After being cleared to play by Canucks team doctors on September 11, 2009, and a back specialist in Toronto, Hodgson was again expected to secure a roster spot during {{training camp}}. After struggling in six pre-season games, he was returned to the Brampton Battalion on September 29 {{in the final round}} of team cuts.|$|E
5|$|Reptile was {{originally}} {{depicted as a}} tall, muscular, light-skinned humanoid. Due to his origin as a palette swap of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green. His clothing consists of pants and boots covering <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> body, along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood. Green light armor covered his forearms and lower legs, while an open V-shaped green vest protected his torso, extending to a matching small fauld and loincloth. He wears a green facial mask {{as part of his}} ninja disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature, however he does remove the mask in-game for his Acid Spit attack or his tongue grab fatality. Reptile stands 6feet (183cm) tall, and speaks in a hissing tone.|$|E
5|$|The Siddheshwara {{temple in}} the Haveri {{district}} has sculptures of deities of multiple faiths. The temple {{may have been}} consecrated first as a Vaishnava temple, later taken over by Jains and eventually becoming a Shaiva temple. The hall in the temple contains sculptures of Uma Mahesvara (Shiva with his consort Uma), Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, Surya (the sun god), Naga-Nagini (the snake goddess), and the sons of Shiva, Ganapati and Kartikeya. Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the damaru (drum), the aksamala (chain of beads) and the trishul (trident) in three arms. <b>His</b> <b>lower</b> left arm rests on Uma, who is seated on Shiva's lap, embracing him with her right arm while gazing into his face. The sculpture of Uma is well decorated with garlands, large earrings and curly hair.|$|E

60|$|Then I {{followed}} her guilty {{eyes to the}} door, where stood my Uncle Hugh, and all the pride and passion of the Montressors sat on <b>his</b> <b>lowering</b> brow. Yet he came forward quietly as Alicia and the snake drew apart and stood up.|$|R
