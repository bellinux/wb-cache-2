These results are considered preliminary and additional testing is underway to clarify these results and determine whether the initial test was accurate. This mail handling facility {{is located on the}} grounds of the Anacostia Naval Station in the Washington D. C. Metropolitan area. Clinicians are urged to review the signs and symptoms of anthrax and consider the diagnosis with their patients. Inhalational anthrax starts with a nonspecific prodrome (i. e., fever, dyspnea, cough, and chest discomfort) follows inhalation of infectious spores. Approximately 2 [...] 4 days after initial symptoms, sometimes after a brief period of improvement, respiratory failure and hemodynamic collapse ensue. Inhalational anthrax also might include thoracic edema and a widened mediastinum on chest radiograph. Gram-positive bacilli can grow on blood culture, usually 2 [...] 3 days after onset of illness. Cutaneous anthrax follows deposition of the organism onto the skin, occurring particularly on exposed areas of the hands, arms, or face. An area of local edema becomes a pruritic macule or papule, which enlarges and ulcerates after 1 [...] 2 days. Small, 1 [...] 3 mm vesicles may surround the ulcer. A painless, <b>depressed,</b> <b>black</b> <b>eschar</b> usually with surrounding local edema subsequently develops. The syndrome also may include lymphangitis and painful lymphadenopathy. Clinicians are encouraged to review the additional information on Anthrax at: [URL] suspected cases of anthrax should be immediately reported to the appropriate local or state health department.

50|$|Cutaneous anthrax, {{also known}} as Hide porter's disease, is when anthrax occurs on the skin. It {{is the most common}} form (>90% of anthrax cases). Cutaneous anthrax is also the least {{dangerous}} form of anthrax (~0% mortality rate with treatment). Cutaneous anthrax presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a <b>black</b> center (<b>eschar).</b> The <b>black</b> <b>eschar</b> often shows up as a large, painless necrotic ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Unlike bruises or most other lesions, cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a couple of weeks. Complete recovery may take longer.Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when B. anthracis spores enter through cuts on the skin. This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products.|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Anthrax is a {{very rare}} disease in Europe and the United States. AIM: A case of {{cutaneous}} anthrax of the hand with a wide skin defect is presented and some clinical observations highlighted. CASE REPORT: A 56 -year-old male patient with cutaneous anthrax attended our infectious diseases department with a swelling up to the upper arm. An urgent fasciotomy was undertaken with a diagnosis of compartment syndrome. A <b>black</b> <b>eschar</b> had formed on the dorsal surface of the hand. A superficial tangential escharectomy was performed. RESULTS: Viable fibrous tissue, about 4 to 5 mm in thickness over the extensor tendons, was found under the eschar.

We describe the case of a 58 -year-old man affected by MSF who developed atrial fibrillation. The patient presented himself to the hospital after 7 days of fever, malaise and severe headache. Cardiac auscultation revealed a chaotic heart rhythm and an electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular response. Diagnosis of MSF was made after the appearance of a maculo-papular skin rash, and treatment with oral doxycycline was started. An immunofluorescence antibody test confirmed R. conorii infection. The patient recovered after 7 days of treatment. Cardiac arrhythmia is a rare complication of MSF. Inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. R. conorii is an intracellular bacterium which could trigger atrial fibrillation. Our patient was previously healthy and had no reported history of cardiac disease. This suggests that heart function should be monitored in MSF patients even in the absence of underlying risk factors...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{demonstrate}} {{the effectiveness of}} conservative treatment modalities utilized to prevent amputation of a patient's lower leg. Clinical Problem: A clinically complex 86 year old black female with diagnoses of diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, anemia, low albumin level, ASCAD, CHF, right femoral-popliteal bypass, left eye blindness and degenerative joint disease presented with a non-healing left heel pressure ulcer acquired, November 1997. Initially, the ulcer was an area that had a purplish to <b>black</b> <b>eschar</b> with surrounding erythema. Numerous modalities were utilized without success. In January, a vascular surgeon recommended below knee amputation as the only effective treatment of this wound.

We made the diagnosis of epidermoid cyst, giant comedone and leech bite {{on the basis of}} the constellation of clinical features. The patient was treated with oral ciprofloxacin at a dose of 2 g daily, and 2 % topical erythromycin solution. Despite improvement, the evidence of cystic lesions persisted. There was no history of similar lesions in any other family member. There was no history of trauma. The patient was not using any topical or systemic medication. Two weeks before his visit, he had a history of leech therapy under the supervision of a general practitioner. His medical history was significant for leech therapy of the lesions, five days previously. He was followed up for another two weeks and after disappearance of the inflammation, with the patient under local anesthesia, the well-circumscribed mass was completely evacuated with a sharp curette and comedone extractor. The patient was subsequently lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Considering the efficacy of leeches, it would be favorable to breed a germ-free leech.

Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volunw I 996) 21 B: 2. 261 262 Mucormycosis (also known as phycomycosis or zygo-mycosis) is an invasive fungal infection which occurs in immunocompromised patients (Hitchcock and Amadio, 1989). The causative fungi, the zygomycetes, are known to invade blood vessels. Inhalation of spores results in either rhinocerebral or pulmonary mucormy-cosis. Rhinocerebral infection {{is the most common}} form of disease and presents as a <b>black</b> <b>eschar</b> in the nose with subsequent extension to the brain and occlusion of cerebral blood vessels. Similarly, pulmonary disease eventually leads to pulmonary infarction secondary to hyphal invasion of pulmonary vessels. Ingestion of spores leads to gastrointestinal mucormycosis with gut necrosis and bloody diarrhoea. Cutaneous mucormy-cosis occurs as a secondary infection following skin injuries such as burns, lacerations and at injection sites (Palmer et al, 1970; Jain et al, 1978). Treatment includes wide local d 6 bridement and systemic amphotericin B. recommendation for surgical debridement. One week later, redness and swelling were observed along the radial artery in the distal forearm and later extended over the thenar area (Fig 2). Until this stage, there was no evidence of any vascular compromise of the hand. A week later, the eschar separated spontaneously resulting in a large ulcer over the dorsum of the forearm (Fig 3).

It affects {{people of all ages}} and even though scrub typhus in pregnancy is uncommon, it is associated with increased foetal loss, preterm delivery, and small for gestational age infants. After an incubation period of 6 - 21 days, onset is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms. A primary papular lesion which later crusts to form a flat <b>black</b> <b>eschar,</b> may be present. If untreated, serious complications may occur involving various organs. Laboratory studies usually reveal leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, deranged hepatic and renal function, proteinuria and reticulonodular infiltrate. Owing to the potential for severe complications, diagnosis, and decision to initiate treatment should be based on clinical suspicion and confirmed by serologic tests. A therapeutic trial of tetracycline or chloramphenicol is indicated in patients in whom the diagnosis of scrub typhus is suspected. The recommended treatment regimen for scrub typhus is doxycycline. Alternative regimens include tetracycline, chloramphenicol, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, and roxithromycin.

The last episode occurred from April to August, 2011 and created mass havoc due to its dreadful clinical outcome and socio-cultural consequences. We report here the clinico-demographic profile and treatment outcome of 15 cutaneous anthrax cases attended at the Dermatology Outpatient Department of Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh between April and August, 2011 with an aim to create awareness for early case detection and management. Findings Anthrax was suspected primarily based on cutaneous manifestations of typical non-tender ulcer with <b>black</b> <b>eschar,</b> with or without oedema, {{and a history of}} butchering, or dressing/washing of cattle/goat or their meat. Diagnosis was established by demonstration of large gram-positive rods, typically resembling B. anthracis under light microscope where possible and also by ascertaining therapeutic success. The mean age of cases was 21. 4 [*]years (ranging from 3 to 46 [*]years), 7 (46. 7 %) being males and 8 (53. 3 %) females. The majority of cases were from lower middle socioeconomic status. Types of exposures included butchering (20 %), contact with raw meat (46. 7 %), and live animals (33. 3 %). Malignant pustule was present in upper extremity, both extremities, face, and trunk at frequencies of 11 (73. 3 %), 2 (13. 3 %), 1 (6. 7 %) and 1 (6. 7 %) respectively. Eight (53. 3 %) patients presented with fever, 7 (46. 7 %) had localized oedema and 5 (33. 3 %) had regional lymphadenopathy. Anthrax was confirmed in 13 (86. 7 %) cases by demonstration of gram-positive rods. All cases were cured with 2 [*]months oral ciprofloxacin combined with flucoxacillin for 2 [*]weeks. Conclusions We present the findings from this series of cases to reinforce the criteria for clinical diagnosis and to urge prompt therapeutic measures to treat cutaneous anthrax successfully to eliminate the unnecessary panic of anthrax. </p...|$|R

White scattered his minor pieces about on either flank and are quite unable to coordinate, the placement of the knights being particularly <b>depressing.</b> But <b>Black</b> has the wonderful duo of Bf5 and Nd3 which completely paralyzes all three White major pieces—a very rare occurrence in a practical game!" ...|$|R
