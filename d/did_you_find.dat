500|$|In Homilies on Ecclesiastes, he wrote: [...] "'I got me slave-girls and slaves.' For what price, tell me? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> in {{existence}} worth {{as much as}} this human nature? What price did you put on rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling that being shaped by God? God said, Let us make man in our own image and likeness. If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, who is he that sets his own power above God's?" ...|$|E

When the passers-by asked what had happened, she told them, [...] "He fought Al-Zubayr. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> Al-Zubayr soft like cheese or dates or full of brass?" [...] That's when they knew that he would grow up to be strong during war.|$|E

2500|$|I was {{returning}} {{from high school}} one day and a runaway horse with a bridle on sped past {{a group of us}} into a farmer's yard looking for a drink of water. The horse was perspiring heavily. And the farmer didn't recognize it so we cornered it. I hopped on the horse's back. Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, [...] "Giddy-up." [...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> him?" [...] I said, [...] "About four miles from here." [...] "How did you know you should come here?" [...] I said, [...] "I didn't know. The horse knew. All I did was keep his attention on the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'Gosh, {{you guys}} are very clever, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> me?" [...] Amrozi's mobile phone, a {{particularly}} important piece of evidence, was seized during his arrest. Bags of chemical ingredients for bombs were found in his workshop and soil samples taken from outside his home showed traces of the primary chemical used in the Sari Club bomb. Police found receipts {{for the purchase of}} chemicals used to make the bombs, as well as a list of expenses incurred in making the bombs. Further search of Amrozi's home revealed copies of speeches by Osama bin Laden, and Abu Bakar Bashir, the radical Indonesian Muslim cleric reputed to be the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah. The speeches exhorted listeners to wage jihad. Police also uncovered training manuals on ambush techniques and numerous articles on jihad. Under questioning Amrozi revealed the names of six others involved in the bombing: Ali Imron, Imam Samudra, Dul Matin, Idris, Abdul Ghani and Umar Patek. But Amrozi's mobile phone proved to be the real catch. Indonesian investigators were able to print out a list of calls he had made immediately before, during and after the bombing, as well as the names and telephone numbers in the phone's memory. Pastika kept Amrozi's arrest secret for two days. After it was announced, Polri monitored the sudden flurry of communications among numbers listed in Amrozi's telephone before the calls abruptly ceased. The investigators were able to identify the location of a number of the telephones, leading to a series of arrests.|$|E
