For this a sufficient tack between first ply and mould surface is important, especially for layups on vertical positioned moulds.

To solve the problem knowledge of cooling/heating curves at selected set of points from casting/mould domain is necessary. The evolutionary algorithm allows to minimize the fitness function containing the differences between the ‘measured’ cooling curves and the same curves found on the basis of boundary initial problem numerical solution for the assumed set of parameters.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{physical}} and chemical properties of mould fluxes are important to the successful operation of continuous casting machines. The principal role of mould fluxes is to provide lubrication between the solidifying steel and the mould but mould fluxes also significantly influence heat transfer between the stand and the <b>mould.</b> <b>Heat</b> extraction from the steel being cast has a marked effect {{on the quality of the}} final product and several defects in cast products can be related to <b>mould</b> flux performance. <b>Heat</b> transfer in <b>mould</b> flux is complicated by the fact that the flux partially solidifies when in contact with the mould. Different rates of solidification of mould fluxes and the resultant structures are critical to the heat transfer characteristics of the mould. Mould fluxes are largely made up of oxides which can form crystalline or glassy solids on cooling from a melt, depending on composition and cooling rate. It is known that heat transfer in a crystalline material differs from heat transfer in the glassy or liquid form of the same material due to the differing heat transfer mechanisms operating in each state. In order to understand <b>heat</b> transfer through <b>mould</b> flux, it is essential to understand the contribution of liquid, glassy, and crystalline structures to the overall heat transfer. This in turn requires an understanding of the solidification behaviour of mould fluxes. Until recently, this knowledge has been based mostly on empirical studies, though more recent research has attempted to relate observed crystallization and glass forming phenomena to fundamental principles. Special techniques have been developed to study mould flux solidification, however, the thermal conditions and the mould flux structures' obtained during casting are difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Methods such as differential thermal analysis, quench tests, high temperature microscopy, single and double hot thermocouple techniques, confocal microscopy and others have been applied, with varying degrees of success, to quantify crystallization and glass formation in mould fluxes.

40|$|The {{injection}} moulding process {{is well known}} as an economical production process {{for the production of}} technical parts in large quantities at low cost. The smaller the parts, the shorter the specific cycle time must be in order to maintain an economical production. To increase the economical viability either the amount of cavities must be increased or the process cycle time must be reduced. When moulding micro parts or micro structured parts in conjunction with a variothermal process, special measures are essential for the implementation of this objective due to the required large heat turnover in the mould during the cycle. With conventional methods of mould temperature control only comparatively long cycle times are possible. The increase of cavities is limited because of the filigreed structures. The principle of inductive heating as a method of variothermal <b>mould</b> <b>heating</b> is one possibility to achieve shorter cycle times despite of the high cavity temperatures.

The three Byssochlamys strains were able to produce patulin in both cloudy and clarified apple juices. Overall, the lower the storage temperature, the lower the patulin levels and mycelium dry weight in the apple juices (p< 0. 05). The greatest variations in pH and degrees Brix were observed in the juices from which the greatest mycelium dry weights were recovered. The maximum levels of patulin recovered from the juices were ca. 150 mu g/kg at 21 degrees C and 220 mu g/kg at 30 degrees C. HPLC-UV, HPCL-DAD and mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the ability of B. fulva IOC 4518 to produce patulin. Due to the heat resistance of B. nivea and B. fulva and their ability to produce patulin either in PET bottles or in laminated paperboard packages, the control of contamination and the incidence of these fungi should be a matter of concern for food safety.
