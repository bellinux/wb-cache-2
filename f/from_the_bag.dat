40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{designed}} and tested a system called <b>the</b> <b>Bag</b> and Belt Cleaner Device (B&BCD) to reduce dust levels {{in and around}} <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> conveying and stacking process. The device physically cleans either 22. 7 kg (50 lb) or 45. 4 kg (100 lb) paper bags by {{using a combination of}} brushes and air jets. It is completely self-contained and is kept under negative pressure by a baghouse to ensure that dust and product removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> during cleaning does not flow into the work environment and contaminate workers. <b>The</b> <b>bags</b> travel through <b>the</b> device on a chain conveyor, which permits any product or dust cleaned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> to fall into a hopper {{at the bottom of the}} device and be recycled back into the process via a screw conveyor. Once exiting the B&BCD, the outside of <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> and <b>the</b> conveyor are essentially product and dust free. The B&BCD was evaluated at two mineral processing plants to determine reductions with the device in use. The results of both field evaluations showed that the amount of product removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside of <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> varied <b>from</b> 77 to 93 pet...|$|R

25|$|Dump valves {{are used}} to release air <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> when in the water. They can be {{operated}} manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some dump valves can be operated in both these ways. One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom to actuate the spring-loaded valve. The dump valve may be a screw-in quick change system, and the spring tension may be adjustable.|$|E
25|$|Roof {{and floor}} screeds and {{insulating}} concretes: exfoliated vermiculite (typically the finer grades) {{can be added}} at site to Portland cement and other aggregates, rheological aids, and water to produce roof and floor concrete screeds which are lightweight and insulating. In many cases, vermiculite-based roof screeds are {{used in conjunction with}} other insulation materials, such as polystyrene board, to form a total roofing system. A bituminous binder can also be used with exfoliated vermiculite to produce a dry, lightweight roof screed which has the advantages of low thermal conductivity, low moisture content, and ease of placement (by pouring <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> and then tamping).|$|E
25|$|The tubing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> {{of fluid}} being {{administered}} that connects to {{directly to the}} patient is called the primary tubing. Any additional IVs to be administered {{are connected to the}} primary tubing and are called secondary IV, or IV piggyback instead of having to place multiple catheters in the patient. When administering a secondary IV medication, the primary bag is held lower than the secondary bag so that the secondary medication can flow into the primary tubing rather than fluid from the primary bag flowing into the secondary tubing. The fluid from the primary bag is needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary IV from the tubing into the patient.|$|E

They work by forcing dust laden air through a bag shaped fabric filter leaving the particulate to collect on the outer surface of <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> and allowing <b>the</b> now clean air to pass through to either be exhausted into the atmosphere {{or in some cases}} recirculated into the facility. Common fabrics include polyester and fiberglass and common fabric coatings include PTFE (commonly known as Teflon).

25|$|In the {{cardinal}} directions of Midwestern Native Americans, the wolf represented the west, but it represented the southeast for the Pawnee tribe. According to the Pawnee creation myth, the wolf {{was the first}} creature to experience death. The Wolf Star, enraged at not having been invited to attend a council on how the Earth should be made, sent a wolf to steal the whirlwind bag of The Storm that Comes out of the West, which contained the first humans. Upon being freed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> the humans killed the wolf, thus bringing death into the world. Native Americans have long seen the wolf as an animal of power. Many tribes credit the actual creator of the earth to be a wolf. The Arikara and Ojibwe believed a wolfman spirit made the Great Plains for them and for other animals. Many tribes consider wolves to be closely related to humans. The reason for this belief {{is because of the}} wolf’s dedication to its pack, a trait the tribes attributed with themselves. The Navajo tribe was known for performing healing ceremonies where they would call upon wolves to restore health to their ill. Wolves were admired for their superb hunting skills.Prayers were offered in honor of wolves before they went out of hunting excursions. The Pawnee’s connection with wolves was so great that their hand signal for Pawnee was actually the same one that they had for wolf. Before battles, Apache warriors would pray, sing, and dance to gain the teamwork, strength, and bravery of wolves.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, Boros {{was hired}} by the Montreal Expos {{organization}} and managed the Calgary Expos. During the 1981 and 1982 seasons, he was the first base coach for the Montreal Expos. Boros {{was hired by}} the Expos in part due to his {{reputation as one of the}} best coaches in baseball at teaching base stealing technique. His San Jose team set the modern minor league record with 372 stolen bases, and the Royals led the American League in stolen bases during his tenure there. During Boros' two seasons as the Expos first base coach, Tim Raines became the leading base stealer in the National League with 71 and 78 stolen bases in 1981 and 1982. In May 1981, Sports Illustrated credited Boros with Raines' sudden burst of base-stealing: [...] "Boros deserves some of the credit for Raines' base-running success. Positioning himself a few yards up the first base line <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> Boros surveys the mound from the same angle as Raines, notes whether the pitcher signals his move home with his front leg, front shoulder or head, and records his findings in a notebook. Boros also carries a stopwatch to time pitchers' deliveries home and catchers' throws to second." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{carbon dioxide}} {{concentrations}} are elevated indoors relative to outdoor concentrations, {{it is only}} an indicator that ventilation is inadequate to remove metabolic products associated with human occupancy. Plants require carbon dioxide to grow and release oxygen when they consume carbon dioxide. [...] A {{study published in the}} journal Environmental Science & Technology considered uptake rates of ketones and aldehydes by the peace lily (Spathiphyllum clevelandii) and golden pothos (Epipremnum aureum.) Akira Tani and C. Nicholas Hewitt found [...] "Longer-term fumigation results revealed that the total uptake amounts were 30−100 times as much as the amounts dissolved in the leaf, suggesting that volatile organic carbons are metabolized in the leaf and/or translocated through the petiole." [...] It is worth noting the researchers sealed the plants in Teflon bags. [...] "No VOC loss was detected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> when the plants were absent. However, when the plants were in the bag, the levels of aldehydes and ketones both decreased slowly but continuously, indicating removal by the plants". Studies done in sealed bags do not faithfully reproduce the conditions in the indoor environments of interest. Dynamic conditions with outdoor air ventilation and the processes related to the surfaces of the building itself and its contents as well as the occupants need to be studied.|$|E
2500|$|On August 10 Hilton {{released}} her 10th fragrance, Tease, which {{was inspired by}} Marilyn Monroe. On August 19 she launched a footwear line in Las Vegas, saying about the collection (priced from $60 to $160) {{in an interview that}} she [...] "chose the styling, design, materials and colours for the line and also wanted {{to make sure it was}} super comfortable". That month Hilton was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession in Las Vegas and her boyfriend, Cy Waits, was charged with driving under the influence. Hilton's defense initially claimed that the handbag (containing 0.8g of cocaine) was not hers: [...] "This purse in question was a high street brand– and by no means up to her high fashion standards." [...] She later claimed personal items (including cash and credit cards) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> acknowledging that it was hers. To avoid a felony conviction, Hilton pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors on September 17, 2010. Under the terms of the plea bargain she was sentenced to one year of probation, 200 hours of community service, a $2,000 fine and the completion of a drug-abuse treatment program. Clark County District Attorney David Roger said, [...] "If she was arrested for anything besides a minor traffic violation she will spend a year in jail. There will be no discussion. The court will have no discretion." [...] On September 21, 2010, on their way to a Tokyo press conference to promote fashion and fragrance lines, Hilton and her sister Nicky were stopped by immigration officers at Narita Airport because of Hilton's drug-possession conviction the previous day. Under Japan's strict drug laws, travelers convicted of a drug crime are usually denied entry into the country. Airport officials questioned Hilton [...] "for hours", and she and Nicky were detained overnight at the airport hotel. On September 22 Japanese authorities denied Hilton entry, and she was put on a plane back to the United States. Other stops on their Asian promotional tour were canceled due to Indonesia and Malaysia's anti-drug laws. The critically acclaimed documentary Teenage Paparazzo, in which Hilton appeared, aired on HBO on September 27.|$|E
