She therefore contacted Al Gore, and he met with her and her father on December 5, 2016, at Trump Tower. Following his visit, Gore spoke briefly to the media standing outside the elevator of Trump Tower. Gore related that: [...] "I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the president-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I'm just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> at that." [...] This was a significant milestone, as Trump once tweeted that [...] "he concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese {{in order to make}} U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carl D. Atkins insinuates {{that the}} final quatrain of Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 is the final stage in which youth disappears forever. [...] "As the fire goes out when the wood which has been feeding it is consumed, so is life {{extinguished}} when the strength of youth is past". He compares the burning fire that slowly {{goes out to the}} passing away of life, as old age prevails youth. Shakespeare is concerned with the reality of death, [...] "the fading out of life's energy". He realizes that what he has [...] "nourished" [...] but must now [...] "expire". [...] "The ashes of his youth doth lie" [...] –the ashes of his youth burn brightly, as he recognizes that what brightened up his youth is devoured by the fire burning away his old age. As a result, Shakespeare informs his audience that we must [...] "love more strongly", because in the end, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> all behind and respond to death.|$|E

The King, always a worrier, was continually dissatisfied with his position and with that of his kingdom.

Following a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and Smith, Collins went to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to try and rebuild the family. He explained: [...] "I was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the band. <b>It</b> was just that if I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] Banks and Rutherford decided to put Genesis on an extended break and make their respective debut solo albums, A Curious Feeling and Smallcreep's Day, at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after his attempt to save his marriage failed. With time to spare before {{working on a new}} Genesis album, Collins performed with Brand X and started writing his first solo album, Face Value, at his home in Shalford, Surrey.|$|R

40|$|In James Joyce’s short story, ‘Eveline’, a {{young woman}} is {{thinking}} about a new life away from an unhappy existence which involves caring for a violent father. In the story Eveline is to elope with Frank to Buenos Aires, but Eveline fails to join him on the night boat. This story has attracted much critical attention. In particular, commentators have {{picked up on the}} faint clues throughout that Eveline is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her home. <b>It</b> is as though Eveline’s subconscious is communicating this while she is consciously reflecting on whether to elope with Frank. But how can such clues be identified in a systematic way whilst responding to the familiar charges made by Stanley Fish that stylistic analysis and interpretation is arbitrary and circular (Fish, 1980 a) ? In this article, I perform a corpus-informed stylistic analysis of ‘Eveline’ in order to reveal some of these subconscious intimations whilst reducing as much as possible arbitrariness and circularity in analysis and interpretation. To do so, I build on formal insights into ‘Eveline’ provided in Stubbs’ (2001) corpus-informed analysis by proceeding to a more functional exploration of the story...|$|R

The one hundred a year to each of them was actually becoming a reality; and Abel Handy was a hero, and Bunce a faint-hearted sycophant, worthy neither honour nor fellowship. But other tidings soon made their way into the old men's rooms. It was first notified to them that the income abandoned by Mr Harding would not come to them; and these accounts were confirmed by attorney Finney. They were then informed that Mr Harding's place would be at once filled by another. That the new warden could not be a kinder man they all knew; that he would be a less friendly one most suspected; and then came the bitter information that, from the moment of Mr Harding's departure, the twopence a day, his own peculiar gift, must of necessity be withdrawn.|$|R

500|$|The group's touring {{schedule}} had put particular {{pressure on}} Collins, whose marriage was {{at risk of}} collapse due to him being away from home frequently.

Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis {{were on the verge of}} an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, Collins said, [...] "I went off for two months to try and sort things out ...

5000|$|Following his {{campaign}} on continental Europe, Moulton returned to Britain {{to contest the}} Eclipse Stakes, which was run that year at Kempton Park Racecourse as a new grandstand at Sandown was being built. He sweated up badly before the race and caused considerable trouble in running. After launching his challenge up {{the centre of the}} course in the straight he veered right towards the inside rail, hampering Sharp Edge (winner of the Irish 2000 Guineas) and Toujours Pret (Prix d'Harcourt. He finished second to Scottish Rifle, with Sun Prince a head away in third place but appeared fortunate to avoid disqualification. At York Racecourse in August Moulton started a 14/1 outsider for the second running of the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. Scottish Rifle, Toujours Pret and Sun Prince were again in opposition but Rheingold was made the odds-on favourite. The 1972 winner Roberto was withdrawn shortly before the race and his scheduled jockey Lester Piggott opted to take the ride on Rheingold, going back on an informal agreement to ride Moulton if he became available. The ride on Moulton therefore went to the Welsh jockey Geoff Lewis. As the confusion over the riding arrangements reached a peak in the early afternoon Harry Wragg reportedly said to his son Geoff [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lunch.
