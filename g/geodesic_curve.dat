40|$|Our {{contribution}} {{presents a}} numerical method {{to be used}} for short wavelength scattering of smooth surfaces. Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD) predicts that electromagnetic energy propagates tangential to, and in the close vicinity of, smooth surfaces. To be able to the evaluate the GTD attenuation factors for the propagating wave, geometrical data is needed along the so called <b>geodesic</b> <b>curves.</b> We have developed an algorithm that compute the <b>geodesic</b> <b>curves,</b> and the corresponding GTD factors, with sufficient accuracy so that the number of triangular elements are inversely proportional to the wave length. The <b>geodesic</b> <b>curves</b> are obtained by wave front construction in phase space. Since we have a representation of the entire wave front we are able to represent the smooth surface diffracted field numerically in points with an arbitrarily number of ray solutions. Typical applications are radar cross section computations. ...|$|R
50|$|In fact Γ can be {{replaced}} by a continuous piecewise <b>geodesic</b> <b>curve</b> Δ with the same endpoints lying at a finite Hausdorff distance from Γ less than c = (2λ2 + 1)ε: in fact break up the interval on which Γ is defined into equal subintervals of length 2λε and take the geodesics between the images under Γ of the endpoints of the subintervals. Since Δ is piecewise geodesic, Δ is Lipschitz continuous with constant λ1, d(Δ(s),Δ(t)) ≤ λ1|s - t|, where λ1 ≤ λ + ε. The lower bound is automatic at the endpoints of intervals. By construction the other values differ from these by a uniformly bounded depending only on λ and ε; the lower bound inequality holds by increasing ε by adding on twice this uniform bound.|$|E
40|$|There are two known ways {{to unfold}} a convex {{polyhedron}} without overlap: the star unfolding {{and the source}} unfolding, both of which use shortest paths from vertices to a source point {{on the surface of}} the polyhedron. Non-overlap of the source unfolding is straightforward; non-overlap of the star unfolding was proved by Aronov and O 2 ̆ 7 Rourke in 1992. Our first contribution is a much simpler proof of non-overlap of the star unfolding. Both the source and star unfolding can be generalized to use a simple <b>geodesic</b> <b>curve</b> instead of a source point. The star unfolding from a <b>geodesic</b> <b>curve</b> cuts the <b>geodesic</b> <b>curve</b> and a shortest path from each vertex to the <b>geodesic</b> <b>curve.</b> Demaine and Lubiw conjectured that the star unfolding from a <b>geodesic</b> <b>curve</b> does not overlap. We prove a special case of the conjecture. Our special case includes the previously known case of unfolding from a geodesic loop. For the general case we prove that the star unfolding from a <b>geodesic</b> <b>curve</b> can be separated into at most two non-overlapping pieces...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ventricular {{enlargement}} is {{an important}} biomarker of Alzhe-imer’s disease (AD). However, ventricular surface morphometry analysis remains challenging due to its complicated and branching topological structure.

Unlike prior ventric-ular surface parameterization methods, the hyperbolic conformal param-eterization computed with hyperbolic Ricci flow is angle-preserving and has no singularities. In the parameter domain, we compute consistent geodesic curves across subjects and map the curves back to the 3 D ven-tricular surface, a method called <b>geodesic</b> <b>curve</b> lifting. The geodesic curves then serve as consistent boundary conditions to guide the one-to-one diffeomorphic mappings between ventricular surfaces.

40|$|This {{research}} studies the {{issues related to}} the draping algorithm using <b>Geodesic</b> <b>Curves.</b> The main work here is the development of a simple new CAD operator that allows draping of given 2 D patterns onto a 3 D mold. The 2 D pattern is any closed, connected polygon or a polygonal approximation of a shape bounded by curves. The mold can be any well behaved composite surface made up of twice differentiable patches; here it will be assumed to be a NURBS or B-Splines surface. The basic idea of draping is to map skeletal lines on the 2 D pattern onto corresponding <b>geodesic</b> <b>curves</b> on the 3 D surface. A major difference between the proposed method with the past works is that we are doing the inverse mapping of surface development, which flattening a sheet covering the 3 D surface into an equivalent 2 D pattern.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} a {{classical}} inverse problem: the computation of the refractive index of a medium from ultrasound time-of-flight (TOF) measurements. This problem is very popular in seismics but also for tomographic problems in inhomogeneous media. For example ultrasound vector field tomography needs a priori knowledge of the sound speed. According to Fermat's principle ultrasound signals travel along <b>geodesic</b> <b>curves</b> of a Riemannian metric which {{is associated with the}} refractive index. The inverse problem thus consists of determining the index of refraction from integrals along <b>geodesics</b> <b>curves</b> associated with the integrand leading to a nonlinear problem. In this article we describe a numerical solver for this problem scheme based on an iterative minimization method for an appropriate Tikhonov functional. The outcome of the method is a stable approximation of the sought index of refraction as well as a corresponding set of <b>geodesic</b> <b>curves.</b> We prove some analytical convergence results for this method and demonstrate its performance by means of several numerical experiments. Another novelty in this article is the explicit representation of the backprojection operator for the ray transform in Riemannian geometry and its numerical realization relying on a corresponding phase function that is determined by the metric. This gives a natural extension of the conventional backprojection from 2 D computerized tomography to inhomogeneous geometries. Comment: 35 pages, 15 (colored) figure...|$|R
