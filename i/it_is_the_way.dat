The song contains rock influences and a guitar solo. Critic John Balfe considered it [...] "appropriately Strokes-ish, even if [...] trademark drawl is fed quite substantially through a vocoder." [...] De Homem-Christo noted, [...] "It is true that it is not his usual register, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Julian reacted to the track so for us it is even more exciting." [...] "Lose Yourself to Dance" [...] features Pharrell Williams and {{was the result of a}} desire to create dance music with live drummers. To that end, Robinson appears as session player. A vocoder chant of [...] "come on" [...] appears in the song alongside Pharrell Williams's singing.|$|E

Heck, she might even outsell Michael with this one." [...] "While her brother loops the loop on Planet Pepsi, it's hard to imagine the spotlight ever shifting to his sassy sis," [...] remarked NME, [...] "but this modern hunk of an album should redress some of the balance." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Warring States period, the pacifist Mohist School opposed {{aggressive}} {{war between}} the feudal states. They took this belief into action by using their famed defensive strategies to defend smaller states from invasion from larger states, hoping to dissuade feudal lords from costly warfare. The Seven Military Classics of ancient China view warfare negatively, and as a last resort. For example, the Three Strategies of Huang Shigong says: [...] "As for the military, {{it is not an}} auspicious instrument; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of heaven to despise it", and the Wei Liaozi writes: [...] "As for the military, it is an inauspicious instrument; as for conflict and contention, it runs counter to virtue".|$|E

25|$|To {{improve the}} {{calculation}} time, the Norden used a mechanical computer inside the bombsight {{to calculate the}} range angle of the bombs. By simply dialing in the aircraft's altitude and heading, along with estimates of the wind speed and direction (in relation to the aircraft), the computer would automatically, and quickly, calculate the aim point. This not only reduced the time needed for the bombsight setup but also dramatically reduced the chance for errors. This attack on <b>the</b> accuracy problem <b>was</b> by no means unique; several other bombsights of the era used similar calculators. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Norden used these calculations that differed.|$|R

2500|$|In a 1982 {{published}} {{conversation about}} black feminism and lesbian activism with her sister, Beverly Smith, Barbara Smith, {{co-author of the}} Combahee River Collective Statement expresses concerns that, [...] "to the extent that lesbians of color must struggle simultaneously against the racism of white women (as against sexism), separatism impedes the building of alliances with men of color". Smith writes that race places lesbians of color in a different relation to men as white lesbians, as [...] "white women with class privilege don't share oppression with white men. They're in a critical and antagonistic position whereas Black women and other women of color definitely share oppressed situations with men of their race". Smith makes {{a distinction between the}} theory of separatism, and the practice of separatism, stating that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> separatism has been practiced which has led to [...] "an isolated, single-issued understanding and practice of politics, which ignores the range of oppressions that women experience".|$|E

Hugh Hefner and Gary Cole later wrote: [...] "Raquel Welch, {{one of the last}} of the classic sex symbols, came from the era when you could be considered the sexiest woman in the world without taking your clothes off. She declined to do complete nudity, and I yielded gracefully. The pictures prove her point." [...] Welch has refused to take all her clothes off on screen or pose naked throughout her career spanning five decades, saying <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she has been brought up. While her image in the 1960s was that of a torrid sex temptress, Raquel's private life was quite different. She once famously said: [...] "What I do on the screen is not to be equated with what I do in my private life. Privately, I am understated and dislike any hoopla".|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>The</b> <b>way</b> it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E
