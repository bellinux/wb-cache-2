5|$|After recovering, {{he joined}} the Kimberley Mounted Corps and guided two {{officers}} from Lichtenburg to Klerksdorp, where they persuaded the Boers to surrender by bluffing that a strong British force was following close behind. The Boers soon retook the town and Guest was captured. He was sent with other prisoners to Pietersburg to be executed {{but he managed to}} escape and travelled to Warmbaths. After satisfying the authorities that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> been taken prisoner and had not surrendered voluntarily, he returned to his depot at Kimberley. His unit had been disbanded and he was discharged.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Cinema Retro {{magazine}} {{hosted a}} screening of the film at Ettington Park. Richard Johnson was a special guest at the event and participated in a Q prior to the screening. Johnson {{said that he had}} never actually stepped foot in the hall during filming, and that this was the first occasion <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> been inside the premises. The movie was mentioned in Dan Simmons' 2002 novel A Winter Haunting.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Singaperumal is {{transferred}} and a corrupt officer (Vinu Chakravarthy) takes his place. The current DGP releases Teja and together, they urge Gemini {{to work for}} them and repay for the losses they incurred but Gemini refuses. To force him to return to his old ways, Teja persuades Isaac to conspire against Gemini. With Isaac's help, Teja plots and kills Kai. Gemini is infuriated and confronts Teja to settle the issue. During the fight, Gemini beats up Teja and swaps their clothes, leaving Teja bound and gagged. The new DGP arrives and shoots Gemini dead; he later realises that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> shot Teja who was in Gemini's clothes. While the DGP grieves over Teja's death, he receives news that he has been transferred to the Sewage Control Board.|$|E

5|$|As Mr. Burns {{fights for}} {{life at the}} hospital, the Springfield police are working to find his assailant. Smithers wakes {{up the next morning}} and vaguely remembers {{shooting}} someone the night before in a drunken rage. Guilt-ridden, Smithers heads for a local church, and is promptly arrested when the confessional {{turns out to be a}} police sting. While passing the media on his way to the police station, Smithers makes a witty remark Sideshow Mel recognizes from an episode of Pardon My Zinger that aired at the same time as the shooting. Mel realizes Smithers must have watched it as well, giving him an alibi. As Smithers' memory clears, it turns out <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> shot Jasper in his wooden leg. Meanwhile, the townsmen pull down the sun-blocker, which crushes Shelbyville to their delight.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 {{video game}} , {{which is the}} sequel to Batman: Arkham City, while under the {{influence}} of Scarecrow's latest toxin, Batman hallucinates the Joker's shooting of Barbara Gordon after she is kidnapped by the mysterious Arkham Knight, a hallucination of Joker noting that he merely got lucky when he shot Barbara as he was ignorant of her true ties to Batman, and also claimed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> been aiming for Barbara's head. In addition, the DLC side story Batgirl: A Matter of Family had various similarities to the story of The Killing Joke, including Joker kidnapping and holding Police Commissioner Gordon hostage at a run-down amusement park as well as the backstory revealing that Joker had conned and murdered the original person who owned the park into granting him control.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's former {{personal}} assistant Fred Seaman (who was earlier convicted for and admitted stealing from Lennon's personal belongings) has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced the counterculture views {{which he had}} helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with conservatism and was supportive of Ronald Reagan, though whether <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed. Some commentators noted that Seaman's claims have low credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released a book with dubious allegations about Lennon which had largely been ignored.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E
5|$|Asashōryū began 2004 {{with two}} {{consecutive}} perfect 15–0 tournament wins (zensho-yūshō) in January and March. Nobody had attained a zensho-yūshō since 1996; yet Asashōryū {{went on to}} add three more such titles after 2004, for a career total of five. Only Hakuhō, with twelve, Taihō, with eight, and Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi with seven, have recorded more 15–0 scores. His unbeaten run continued into the first five days of the May 2004 tournament, giving him a winning streak of 35 bouts in total, the longest run since Chiyonofuji's 53 in 1988. Although he was then upset by maegashira Hokutōriki, he gained revenge by defeating Hokutōriki in a playoff {{on the final day}} to claim the championship. On 27 November 2004, Asashōryū became the first wrestler to win five tournaments in a year since Chiyonofuji achieved the feat in 1986, and won his ninth Emperor's Cup. Asashōryū's below average 9–6 score in the Autumn basho of 2004, the only one he did not win, was attributed in part to the official ceremony for his marriage, which was held in August 2004 (although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> married in December 2002). The hectic social round that inevitably follows Japanese weddings affected his pre-tournament preparations, as it prevented him from doing any training.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the guests}} arrive, they then begin eating their meal, when {{suddenly}} another guest {{arrives at the}} door. It is revealed to be Kevin Swanson, the son of Joe and Bonnie Swanson, whom they had presumed had died fighting {{in the war in}} Iraq. Overjoyed, they ask why the army had reported that he had died in action. Kevin then tells them a story that he was in a coma following a bomb that had been placed inside a turkey during Thanksgiving years before. Later, while having dessert, Kevin voices his distaste of the war, and reveals several inconsistencies about his time in Iraq. Kevin then tells his father that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> gone A.W.O.L., and because most of his unit was killed in the bombing but he miraculously survived, he faked his own death in order to leave the war and return home. Angered by his son's confession, Joe arrests him for the crime of desertion and handcuffs him {{with the rest of the}} family criticizing him for lying about being a war hero.|$|E

25|$|Upon his release, Faizani {{purchased}} a building {{next to the}} Pul-i Khisti mosque and started a library and book business selling only those books that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> read himself.

Zairil Khir Johari {{was elected to}} the central executive committee (CEC) with 803 votes to secure the 20th spot.

25|$|On December 21, 2006, The New York Times {{published}} an editorial condemning the Georgia Supreme Court's original refusal to hear Wilson's appeal, noting that Wilson {{was not a}} sexual predator, and that his behavior would have only been a misdemeanor if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> had sex with the girl, instead of having had oral sex (due to a loophole in the applicable law's provision intended to prevent exactly this kind of dubious conviction).|$|E
