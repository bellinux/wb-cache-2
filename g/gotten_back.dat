After having <b>gotten</b> <b>back</b> to Delta Alpha Kappa sorority house, while opening up presents, Kelli and her sisters are called by an unknown caller who, initially, uses Clair's phone and later Megan's. Worried about Megan, Kelli goes to her room only to find Kyle there. While attempting to find clues about her disappearance the power goes out, causing Megan's computer to switch on from standby mode, revealing a recording Kyle made of himself having sex with Megan.

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters) have <b>gotten</b> <b>back</b> {{together}} after Dennis {{was the only}} person who remembered her birthday. Disturbed by Liz's acceptance of mediocrity, her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), tries to reform her into someone who enjoys the good life. He refers Liz to the fanciest restaurant in the city, Stone. Nevertheless, Liz declines Jack's offer to be her mentor. That night at Stone, Jack and his date walk by Liz and Dennis's table, with Jack very unimpressed by Dennis's manners.

25|$|Nemechek {{started off}} 2005 {{with a strong}} run at the second race of the season at Auto Club Speedway. Coming off a solid 13th-place finish at Daytona, Joe started 4th and led leading a race-high 63 laps before his Hendrick Motorsports-built engine expired on lap 178. This was one of six Hendrick engine failures, which {{included}} that of teammate Scott Riggs. By race 26 at Richmond, the 01 team found itself as a longshot of making the Chase, sitting 16th in the standings 135 points out of 10th place as the last mathematical contender for {{a spot in the}} 10-race playoff. The team's chase hunt was ultimately foiled when Travis Kvapil collided with Nemechek under caution right after he had <b>gotten</b> <b>back</b> on the lead lap, relegating them to a 26th-place finish. Overall, Nemechek improved on the previous years points performance, ranking 16th with 1 pole and 9 top 10s but no wins and only two top 5's.|$|E
25|$|United's chances {{continued}} to flow thick and fast. Michael Carrick rounded the goalkeeper {{only to be}} tackled on the line by Distin, whilst Patrice Evra had a shot turned onto the post by David James before things went {{from bad to worse}} for the Manchester side. With 12 minutes to play, Portsmouth counter-attacked down the right hand side, forcing a two-on-two situation. The ball was squared to Milan Baroš, who was felled by Kuszczak in the box. The referee had no hesitation in sending Kuszczak off, despite both Rooney and Anderson having <b>gotten</b> <b>back</b> behind the ball before the foul. Nevertheless, referee Atkinson's decision meant that United had no recognised goalkeeper available for the remaining time. Wayne Rooney offered his services, but that would have left United without a recognised centre-forward, so Rio Ferdinand was given the responsibility of attempting to save the penalty. However, although he dived the right way, Ferdinand was unable to get a hand to the ball, and Sulley Muntari gave Portsmouth the lead. United fought hard to get their deserved equaliser, but even Ronaldo's free kick was off-target, and United were knocked out of the FA Cup.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which the {{spending}} for relief and public works provided a sufficient stimulus to revive the U.S. economy, or whether it harmed the economy, is also debated. If one defines economic health entirely by the gross domestic product, the U.S. had <b>gotten</b> <b>back</b> on track by 1934, and made a full recovery by 1936, but as Roosevelt said, one third of the nation was ill fed, ill-housed and ill-clothed. See Chart 3. GNP was 34% higher in 1936 than 1932, and 58% higher in 1940 on the eve of war. The economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940 in 8 years of peacetime, and then grew another 56% from 1940 to 1945 in 5 years of wartime. The unemployment rate fell from 25.2% in 1932 to 13.9% in 1940 when the draft started. During the war the economy operated under so many different conditions that comparison is impossible with peacetime, such as massive spending, price controls, bond campaigns, controls over raw materials, prohibitions on new housing and new automobiles, rationing, guaranteed cost-plus profits, subsidized wages, and the draft of 12 million soldiers.|$|E

[...] "Oh Daddy", the last McVie song on the album, was written about Fleetwood and his wife Jenny Boyd, who had just <b>gotten</b> <b>back</b> together. [...] The band's nickname for Fleetwood was [...] "The Big Daddy". McVie commented that the writing is slightly sarcastic and focuses on the drummer's direction for Fleetwood Mac, which always turned out to be right. Nicks provided the final lines [...] "And I can't walk away from you, baby/If I tried".

500|$|The Drug in Me Is You {{has been}} {{described}} as post-hardcore and pop punk. The songs also included synths, pop-choruses, and other sounds. Radke commented on the inclusion of different genres in songs, comparing different parts of the same song to the sounds of Norma Jean, Underoath, and Katy Perry. Lyrically, according to Radke, some of the songs on the album had tones of being arrogant, comparing the attitude to that commonly found in rap music. This is because Radke has cited Eminem as one of his major influences, so much so that he even included a beat made by Eminem and Dr. Dre during a breakdown on the track [...] "Sink or Swim". In an interview, Radke's experiences were compared to Eminem's, noting that, [...] " [...] is someone who has been knocked down and knocked down, and he’s <b>gotten</b> <b>back</b> up again.

[...] While the album itself was written during Radke's time in prison, he does not consider it a [...] "Jailhouse record", though some songs that did not make the album do address a prison theme.|$|E

[...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is.

500|$|The Volunteers {{started at}} their 27-yard line {{to begin the}} drive, but went three and out and punted back to the Hokies without gaining a first down.

On the first play of the drive, wide receiver Bryan Still {{broke away from the}} Tennessee defense and was wide open for a pass. Maurice DeShazo threw the ball to Still, but Still dropped the pass after it bounced off his chest, thus denying the Hokies a touchdown. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer later cited the dropped pass as a critical turning point in the game, saying, [...] "I think if he could have made that catch, we could have <b>gotten</b> <b>back</b> in the game." [...] Tech player Torrian Gray agreed, saying, [...] "When he dropped the ball, that took a lot out of us." [...] After Still's dropped pass, DeShazo threw two incomplete passes and Virginia Tech punted back to Tennessee. The kick was caught by near the Tennessee 10-yard line, and returned {{all the way to the}} Virginia Tech 37-yard line. At the end of the third quarter, Tennessee still led, 3516.|$|E

Beiste also acts as faculty advisor to the school's superheroes club. When Sam (Chord Overstreet) and Brittany think the Mayan apocalypse is imminent and decide to get married, Beiste offers to marry them, but makes sure to perform a ceremony that is not valid legally. When the apocalypse does not happen, they are relieved when the coach tells them that they are not, in fact, married. Later in the season, after Emma leaves Will at the altar on their wedding day and the two are briefly estranged, Beiste confesses to falling in love with him, but he tells the coach that he and Emma have recently <b>gotten</b> <b>back</b> together. Will asks a hurt Beiste to come to glee club; Beiste does so reluctantly, but as the period begins, two gunshots are heard in the school, and Beiste assists in barricading the choir room, helping to keep everyone quiet, and aiding Will in subduing Sam when he wants to go out and search for Brittany, who was not in the room when the lockdown began. Afterward, Beiste tells Will that he should reach out to forgive Finn, whose role as Will's assistant on the glee club was terminated when Finn admitted to kissing Emma while Will was in Washington, and he does so.|$|E
