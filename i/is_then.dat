5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{composition}} of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created. This {{takes the form of a}} handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and scrivener. The grant <b>is</b> <b>then</b> signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it <b>is</b> <b>then</b> handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or {{mirrors and}} {{tracking}} systems to focus {{a large area}} of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat <b>is</b> <b>then</b> used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and <b>is</b> <b>then</b> used for power generation or energy storage.|$|E

5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution <b>is</b> <b>then</b> applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This <b>is</b> <b>then</b> dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) <b>is</b> <b>then</b> added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 <b>is</b> <b>then</b> evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which <b>is</b> <b>then</b> dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E

5|$|Palatography {{involves}} {{the painting of}} a colored substance onto the tongue which <b>is</b> <b>then</b> transferred onto the palate during articulation. A picture <b>is</b> <b>then</b> taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in fieldwork, {{it can be difficult}} to collect large amounts of data.|$|E
5|$|The {{distillery}} has 7 wash stills {{each with}} a capacity of 15,000 litres and 7 spirit stills with a capacity of 10,000 litres. The spirit <b>is</b> <b>then</b> matured in oak casks.|$|E

50|$|The process {{involved}} the melting of pig iron in an oxidising atmosphere. The metal <b>was</b> <b>then</b> allowed to cool, broken up by stamping, and washed. The granulated iron <b>was</b> <b>then</b> heated in pots in a reverberatory furnace. The resultant bloom <b>was</b> <b>then</b> drawn out under a forge hammer {{in the usual}} way.|$|R
5|$|The main {{sources of}} bromine are in the United States and Israel. The element is liberated by halogen exchange, using {{chlorine}} gas to oxidise Br− to Br2. This <b>is</b> <b>then</b> removed with a blast of steam or air, and <b>is</b> <b>then</b> condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth {{the size of the}} chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.|$|E
