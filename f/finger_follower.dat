50|$|The key design {{features}} were an all alloy block and head with twin-camshafts, <b>finger</b> <b>follower</b> 24-valve actuation, one throttle and injector per cylinder (throttle body EFI), equal length tubular exhaust manifolds dual 3-way catalytic converters and a dry sump lubrication system allowing {{the engine to}} be mounted lower in the vehicle chassis. These features enabled the engine to provide lightweight, compact dimensions, extremely fast throttle response and high peak horsepower.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{developed}} by essentially joining two Speed Six engine blocks to a common crankshaft. However it featured a revised cylinder head design with bucket valve actuation {{in place of the}} Speed Six's <b>finger</b> <b>follower</b> system. The completed engine displaced 7.7 litres and was originally developed for racing applications in TVR's Speed Twelve. Later on, a version was developed for the prototype of a road car to be called the Cerbera Speed Twelve.|$|E
5000|$|The Coyote {{features}} all new 4V DOHC {{cylinder heads}} that have shifted the camshafts outboard, which {{allowed for a}} compact roller <b>finger</b> <b>follower</b> setup with remote hydraulic valve lash adjusters and improved (raised) intake port geometry. The result is an intake port that outflows the Ford GT intake port by 4 percent and the Yates D3 (NASCAR) intake port up to 0.472" [...] (12 mm) lift, which is the maximum lift of the Coyote's intake cams. Engine redline is 7000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Toyota {{introduced}} its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an intermediate shaft to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The intermediate shaft has an actuating member for each cylinder. Each actuating member {{is made of}} two <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> {{on either side of}} a roller bearing member. The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached {{to the end of the}} intermediate shaft. The gear threads of the roller member and <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the roller member and <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the intermediate shaft. Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of intermediate shaft, transferring the movement to both <b>finger</b> <b>followers,</b> then towards the roller rocker arms and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> is narrow with respect to the roller member, valve lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> in relation to the roller bearing member.|$|R
50|$|These engines {{like their}} DOHC {{predecessors}} feature bucket tappets {{in contrast to}} the roller <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> found on GM's other 4-cylinder engines.|$|R
5000|$|RFF - The Taurus/Sable/Escape version used roller <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> (RFF) {{instead and}} {{produced}} [...] at 5900 rpm with 207 lbft Nm of torque at 4400 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|The '91 GSX-R750M gained 15 kg {{over the}} {{previous}} model. The most notable feature of the [...] "M" [...] are the faired in headlamps and a slanted nose, {{both of which were}} designed to reduce drag. Also fitted was a new larger seat and new rear body work that featured twin tail lamps. This was the last GSX-R to use the oil-cooled SACS engine (except for US). Internal engine changes included a new valvetrain that used one dedicated cam lobe and rocker arm (<b>finger</b> <b>follower)</b> per valve (previous models used one lobe and one forked rocker per two valves). Valve clearance (lash) was now adjusted with shims (previous models used a screw and nut). The cam duration and indexing changed slightly as well as the porting according to a magazine article. The rear tyre width was increased to a 170 mm section width. The gauges also changed to white coloured needles (previously amber coloured).|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} for robust design of mechanical systems using experimental design techniques is presented. Performance and achievement of functional requirements depend critically on {{variations on the}} geometry, dimensions, and positions of the system components. These variations arise due to limitations imposed by the capabilities of manufacturing processes, the tight control {{of which can be}} prohibitively expensive. This paper presents an {{approach for}} achieving robust designs which are less sensitive to these variations. Two formulations are used where manufacturing tolerances are considered as: (1) control variables; and (2) noise variables beyond the designer’s control. Orthogonal arrays and analysis of variance are used to detect the most important design parameters to ensure performance robustness. The proposed design methodology is illustrated using a <b>finger</b> <b>follower</b> cam valve system. A comparison with other conventional design approaches is included...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. This study {{involved}} the modeling and verification of the <b>finger</b> <b>follower</b> valve train {{arrangement with the}} focus on the non-linear behaviour of high speed valve springs. The project was divided into three phases namely; the measuring of valve train dynamics, modeling of the valve train and the verification of the dynamic models by comparing the results from the two aforementioned two phases. Acceleration and force were measured on a running engine. A force transducer was specially developed for this purpose. Digital signal processing was used in the analysis and implementation of all measured data. The spring model was developed systematically from a solid model, into a finite element model, and finally into a dynamic model. All development steps were continually checked with experiments and calculations. The primary concept used in the spring modeling lends itself to modal analysis theory in conjunction with the superimposing of non-linearities onto a linear model. The dynamic model was verified and good correlations were found, especially at high engine speeds where valve train dynamics play an important role. Parameter adjustments could be made in the dynamic model and the effect that some engine mechanisms, such as engine oil aeration, had on the valve train dynamics were identified. The project was concluded with a case study of a cam profile optimisation project. Dynamic problems were found that would normally not have been identified without the dynamic model...|$|E
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the Speed Six engine suffered from poor valve train durability leading to many warranty claims against TVR. Subsequent third party development work has mitigated this issue by using revised material harnesses for the cam lobes, <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> and valve guides. Softer valve springs and valves with thicker stems were also utilised. Engines that have had these modifications performed have much improved durability. Another third party development offers a redesigned cylinder head with cam and bucket valve actuation so eliminating the use of <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> altogether.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 1997, the SOHC 2-valve 5.4 L has a {{cast iron}} engine block and {{aluminum}} cylinder heads. The 5.4 L features multi-port fuel injection, roller <b>finger</b> <b>followers,</b> fracture-split powder metal connecting rods, {{and in some}} applications a forged steel crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|These engines {{feature a}} {{light-weight}} cast-iron semi-closed deck engine block with an aluminum cylinder head. The valvetrain consists of chain-driven hollowcast dual overhead camshafts (DOHC) that actuate 4-valves per cylinder via roller <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> with hydraulic tappets. These engines also feature a 78 mm bore spacing and fracture-split connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|The F154 V8 engines have a 90° angle {{between the}} {{cylinder}} banks, aluminium block and heads. The forced induction system uses two parallel twin-scroll water-cooled turbochargers supplied by IHI and two air-to-air intercoolers. The valvetrain consists of 32 valves actuated through roller <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> by two overhead camshafts per bank; the timing chain {{is located on}} the flywheel side. All versions feature gasoline direct injection and continuously variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust side.|$|R
50|$|The Pontiac's single {{camshaft}} {{was supported}} by journals within the aluminum valve cover; no separate bearing shells were used. The cam was driven by a noise-reducing fiberglass-reinforced cogged rubber belt {{instead of the usual}} metal chain or gears. Valves were opened with <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> (centered under the cam) that pivoted at one end on stationary hydraulic adjusters. The oil pump, distributor, and fuel pump were driven by an external jackshaft powered by a rubber timing belt nestled within an aluminum housing bolted to {{the right side of the}} block. The head had a single port face with both exhaust and intake valves on the left side and valve stems strongly tilted towards the left. This engine was used in the 1966-67 Tempest and Le Mans and 1967 Firebird.|$|R
5000|$|The RC8 R was {{delivered}} to the United States in 2010 as a 2011 model with more track-oriented features than the standard RC8. Engine displacement increased to [...] with a higher compression ratio of 13.5:1. It has titanium intake valves and a low-friction diamond-like carbon (DLC) treatment on its camshafts' <b>finger</b> <b>followers.</b> The RC8 R's WP suspension includes a 43 mm inverted fork at the front end, with a titanium-aluminum-nitride low-stiction coating on its sliders. A high-end shock supports the bike's rear, and its piston rod is also finished with the titanium-aluminum-nitride coating. The fork has three modes of adjustment (compression damping, rebound damping and spring preload), while the shock separates the compression damping into high and low speed circuits and has ride-height adjustability. An adjustable steering damper completes the suspension.|$|R
50|$|Clarke and his {{engineers}} studied engine designs {{from major}} European and Japanese automakers {{and sought to}} develop a V8 that was technologically advanced and power-dense, yet also dependable with no major service required before 100,000 miles of use. The initial engine design would implement a 90° vee-angle with a bore of 90.2 mm (3.552 in) and a stroke of 90 mm (3.543 in), resulting in a 4.6-liter (4601 cc, 281 CID) displacement and creating a nearly 1:1 bore-to-stroke ratio. This square configuration was chosen primarily for its positive noise, vibration and harshness characteristics. The engine would utilize features such as a chain-driven, single-overhead camshaft valvetrain with roller <b>finger</b> <b>followers,</b> a deep-skirt cast-iron block construction and cross-bolted main bearings, all benefitting long-term durability. In the interest of reducing overall engine weight, aluminum-alloy heads and pistons would be standard and all major engine accessories would be mounted directly to the block, resulting in more complex block casting but {{eliminating the need for}} heavy mounting brackets. Tight construction tolerances were used in shaping the engine’s cylinder bores with narrow piston rings fitted to the engine’s pistons. This would serve to improve engine efficiency through reduced friction and reduce the engine’s oil consumption, while also promoting cleaner emissions.|$|R
5000|$|The F160 is a 60° V6 {{gasoline}} engine that displaces [...] It utilizes a turbocharger for each cylinder bank, twin intercoolers and direct injection. The engine is designed by Ferrari (loosely based on Pentastar engine block) and assembled by Ferrari; specifically, the engine blocks are cast and machined to Ferrari's approved specifications respectively in Chrysler's Kokomo, Indiana and Trenton Engine Plant, then shipped to Modena, Italy for assembly by Ferrari. This engine shares bore and combustion chamber design, the same valves control technology (i.e. roller <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> and four cam phasers), the same twin turbocharging approach and direct injection-ignition system with Ferrari F154 engine. The engine auxiliaries are identical (alternator, starter motor and power steering pump) or very similar (variable displacement oil pump). The difference of F160 from F154: F160 engine block {{is made by}} high pressure die cast (HPDC) process which is extremely suitable for high volume production. However, it is open deck type and can't endure to high specific power in HP/liter. F160 doesn't have an overboost function and is not used in Ferrari cars either (both F136 and F154 engines are used in Ferrari cars as well). Ferrari was responsible for design and bench testing of this engine.|$|R
5000|$|A {{formal letter}} sent to Porsche {{from members of}} the US-based Rennlist.com [...] "991.1 GT3 Concerned Owners Group" [...] about {{additional}} engine durability issues lead to a meeting between representatives of the owners group and Porsche, including head of Porsche Motorsport Dr. Frank-Steffen Walliser, on 3 August 2017 at the Porsche North America Atlanta headquarters. According to Dr. Walliser the concerning high-RPM misfire issue could be traced primarily to a metallurgical defect in certain batches of [...] "finger followers" [...] (valve train rocker arms) and secondarily to individual driving patterns and engine variations - such as temperature, oil quality, oil viscosity and parts tolerances - that lead to increased wear of the specific parts. In response to the issue and after implementing new engine tests to trace down the issue Porsche had developed revised camshafts and <b>finger</b> <b>followers</b> and offers a fully transferable 10-year, 120,000 mile extended engine warranty to all 991.1 generation GT3 owners world-wide that covers the replacement of the defective engine with a new engine with the revised parts if failure {{is a direct result of}} the finger-follower issue. The base bumper-to-bumper warranty and all other warranty terms and conditions remain unchanged. Porsche confirms that the issue is isolated to the 991.1 GT3, and that the 991.1 GT3 RS and the 991 R are not affected.|$|R
50|$|The engine's {{displacement}} is 1,598 cc {{and it has}} a bore/stroke {{ratio of}} 79.7/80.1 mm, attaining cylinder pressures of 180 bar and a compression ratio of 16:1. It uses an aluminum engine block, die-cast aluminum bedplate, and am aluminum cylinder head. A chain-driven dual overhead camshaft with dual continuous variable cam phasing, employing weight-saving hollow sections and lobes, operates four valves per cylinder with low-friction, hydraulic roller <b>finger</b> <b>followers.</b> The pistons are made from aluminum for reduced reciprocating mass, feature a concave, shallow-bowl profile to facilitate efficient combustion, and are cooled by under-skirt oil spraying. The crankshaft employs four counterweights to minimize mass, and both it and the con-rods are made of forged steel. The engine features multiple improvements to reduce NVH, such as a cam cover made of GRP and fully decoupled from the engine to reduce noise and vibration, while also saving weight compared to aluminum; a composite intake manifold encapsulated in acoustic padding as well as an external plastic shield that both significantly reduce noise emissions; a mechanical crankshaft isolator which reduces radiated noise and torsional vibrations in the accessory drive system; and scissor gears for the timing drive system, incorporating tooth profiles ground with a Low Noise Shifting (LNS) process for optimal noise reduction. More than 150 patented diesel control functions are deployed by the engine's ECU, which was developed in-house by General Motors and jointly engineered in Italy (by GM Powertrain Torino), Germany, and the United States, and will be used in all future GM four-cylinder diesel engines.|$|R
