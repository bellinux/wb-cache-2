40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that both the}} interaction of so-called Merkel cells and the epidermal stress distribution {{play an important role}} in the formation of <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns</b> during pregnancy. To model the formation of <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns</b> in a biologically meaningful way these patterns have to become stationary. For the creation of synthetic fingerprints it is also very desirable that rescaling the model parameters leads to rescaled distances between the stationary fingerprint ridges. Based on these observations, as well as the model introduced by Kücken and Champod we propose a new model for the formation of <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns</b> during pregnancy. In this anisotropic interaction model the interaction forces not only depend on the distance vector between the cells and the model parameters, but additionally on an underlying tensor field, representing a stress field. This dependence on the tensor field leads to complex, anisotropic patterns. We study the resulting stationary patterns both analytically and numerically. In particular, we show that <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns</b> can be modeled as stationary solutions by choosing the underlying tensor field appropriately...|$|R

Nevertheless, <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>patterns</b> [denaturing gradient electrophoresis (DGE), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) ] provide {{an image of}} a microbial ecosystem and contain diversity data. We generated numerical simulation <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>patterns</b> based on three types of distribution (uniform, geometric and lognormal) with a range of units from 10 to 500 000. First, simulated patterns containing a diversity of around 1000 units or more gave patterns similar to those obtained in experiments. Second, the number of bands or peaks saturated quickly to about 35 and were unrelated to the degree of diversity. Finally, assuming lognormal distribution, we used an estimator of diversity on in silico and experimental <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>patterns.</b> Results on in silico patterns corresponded to the simulation inputs. Diversity results in experimental patterns were in the same range as those obtained from the same DNA sample in molecular inventories. Thus, <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>patterns</b> contain extractable data about diversity although {{not on the basis of}} a number of bands or peaks, as is generally assumed to be the case...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy and is {{a major cause of}} cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide. Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a potentially malignant condition and it affects approximately 0. 5 % (5 million) people of the population in the Indian subcontinent. The present study has been undertaken to evaluate the genetic predisposition and frequency of specific finger and palm-print patterns in OSCC and OSMF patients by dermatoglyphic analysis. Materials and Methods: Fingerprints of 400 individuals were recorded with the help of korex duplicating ink consisting of 100 normal individuals without habit of chewing or smoking tobacco or betel nut, 100 normal individuals with habit, 100 OSCC patients, and 100 OSMF patients. Result: We found that whorl type of <b>fingerprint</b> <b>pattern</b> was predominant in significantly higher number of individuals of OSCC and OSMF group than in control groups, whereas individuals of both the control groups showed loop as a predominant <b>fingerprint</b> <b>pattern.</b> This indicates that the predominance of whorl type of <b>fingerprint</b> <b>pattern</b> would serve as a candidate screening marker for susceptibility to oral {{squamous cell}} carcinoma and oral submucous fibrosis in general population with or without tobacco chewing habit...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the diversity of}} IS 6110 fingerprints of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the United States and to determine if matching IS 6110 fingerprints represent recent interstate tuberculosis transmission, we performed {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis of M. tuberculosis isolates from 1, 326 patients in three geographically separated states. Seven hundred ninety-five different IS 6110 <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns</b> were generated, and pattern diversity was similar in each state. Ninety-six percent of the <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns</b> were observed in only one state, demonstrating that most IS 6110 <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns</b> are confined to a single geographic location. Of the IS 6110 <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns</b> that were shared by isolates from more than one state, most isolates with 1 to 5 IS 6110 copies were separable by pTBN 12 fingerprinting whereas those with > 15 copies were not. One high-copy-number M. tuberculosis strain had identical IS 6110 and pTBN 12 fingerprints and included 57 isolates from three states. Epidemiological data demonstrated significant recent transmission of tuberculosis within each city but not among the states. This suggests that identical fingerprints of isolates from geographically separate locations most likely reflect interstate tuberculosis transmission in the past, with subsequent intrastate spread of disease. Further evaluation of M. tuberculosis strains that cause outbreaks in different geographic locations will provide insight into the epidemiological and bacteriological factors that facilitate the spread of tuberculosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis IS 6110 <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns</b> and spoligotypes has been assessed by analyzing serial isolates from patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis. Altogether, 165 M. tuberculosis isolates obtained from 56 patients have been analyzed. The time spans {{between the first}} and the last or a changed isolate from one patient ranged from 1 to 772 days. Among the 56 patients, 5 (9 %) were infected with isolates with changes in their IS 6110 <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns.</b> According to the total number of strains analyzed, 5 % of the subsequent isolates showed variations in their IS 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns compared to the pattern of the first isolates. Up to 10 isolates from one patient sampled at time intervals of up to 772 days with no changes in their IS 6110 patterns have been analyzed. A statistically significant correlation could be found between changes in insertion sequence (IS) patterns and the increased time intervals over which the isolates were obtained, whereas changes in IS patterns are not correlated to changes in the drug resistance of the isolates. In contrast to the observed variations in IS 6110 <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns,</b> no changes in the spoligotypes of the isolates analyzed could be found. In conclusion, our results confirm that the IS 6110 <b>fingerprint</b> <b>patterns</b> of M. tuberculosis isolates have high degrees of stability.
