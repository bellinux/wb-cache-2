40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a practical direction finding receiver based on six-port networks. To <b>expand</b> <b>beam</b> direction angles, improve measurement accuracy, and avoid phase ambiguity, we introduce a dual-baseline architecture into the direction finding receiver. We also propose a calibration technique based on support vector regression (SVR) {{for the following}} reasons: The nonlinearity of diode detectors and the asymmetry of six-port junctions can cause measurement phase errors. Moreover, the transmission parameters of two microwave channels differ with changes in received power. Results show that the SVR model can achieve a direction finding accuracy of 0. 2932 ◦. 1...|$|R

The thermal properties of carbon nanowalls, grown at 600 [*]°C on aluminium nitride thin-film sputtered on fused silica, were {{measured with a}} pulsed photo-thermal technique.

50|$|In {{this type}} of microscopy, the {{illumination}} is done perpendicularly to the direction of observation (see schematic image {{at the top of}} the article). The <b>expanded</b> <b>beam</b> of a laser is focused in only one direction by a cylindrical lens, or by a combination of a cylindrical lens and a microscope objective as the latter is available in better optical quality and with higher numerical aperture than the first. This way a thin sheet of light or lightsheet is created in the focal region that can be used to excite fluorescence only in a thin slice (usually a few micrometers thin) of the sample.|$|E

The principal advantage of castellation is the increase in vertical bending stiffness castellated beams have proved to be efficient for moderately loaded longer spans where the Design is controlled by moment capacity or deflection. In this paper a steel beam is selected and Finite Element Analysis is done for constant loading and support condition by using ANSYS software. The deflection pattern at the center of castellated beam is studied for different parametric conditions by changing depth of hexagon to the depth of web ratio and also by changing the position of hexagon along the length of the beam.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the production of high diffraction efficiency holographic lenses for laser machining. A holographic lens is a high efficiency, low absorption phase hologram which, in this application, is used to diffract an <b>expanded,</b> highpower laser <b>beam</b> into a desired focal point or pattern. For ideal phase holograms, the coupled–wave theory, as applied by H. Kogelnik 1, predicts diffraction efficiencies as high as 100 %. This implies that all the power in the <b>expanded</b> laser <b>beam</b> could be diffracted into the focal point or pattern. Single focal point holographic lenses have been produced with 40 % diffraction efficiency. These lenses were produced by reversal bleaching Kodak type 649 F spectroscopic plates. 50 % diffraction efficiency has been obtained with holographic lenses which have a focal pattern. These lenses were constructed on Agfa type 8 E 75 Scientia plates using a modified reversal bleach process...|$|R
40|$|A {{time-dependent}} {{mathematical model}} for the heat transfer in laser-induced hyperthermia has been developed. The model calculates the temperature distribution in surface-irradiated tissues. Good agreement {{was found between the}} predictions of the model and in vitro experimental results obtained for bovine liver irradiated with an <b>expanded</b> <b>beam</b> from a Nd:YAG laser. Surface evaporation of water was included in the model and experimentally verified. The discrepancy between the measured and the calculated rise in temperature at three different depths on the axis of symmetry of the irradiating beam was found to be less than 5 % after 15 min of irradiation. When irradiating in air and not accounting for the surface evaporation in the model, the accuracy of the model predictions was only 75 - 80 %. The model was then used to investigate the influence of surface evaporation of water on the total temperature distribution theoretically in a clinically relevant case. From the numerical simulations, it was shown that, simply by providing a moistened liver surface, the maximum steady-state temperature could be forced into the tissue to a depth of 4 mm. It was also shown that, by employing the numerical model during the initial phase of hyperthermia treatment, overshooting of the temperature during the transient thermal build-up time could be prevented...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} nozzle {{has been}} developed to replace nozzles used previously in an apparatus that generates a substantially unidirectional beam of molecules passing through a vacuum at speeds of several kilometers per second. The basic principle of operation of the apparatus {{is the same for}} both the previous and the present nozzle designs. The main working part of the nozzle is essentially a cylinder that is closed except that there is an inlet for a pressurized gas and, at one end, the cylinder is closed by a disk that contains a narrow central hole that serves as an outlet. The cylinder is heated to increase the thermal speeds of the gas molecules into the desired high-speed range. Heated, pressurized gas escapes through the outlet into a portion of the vacuum chamber that is separated, by a wall, {{from the rest of the}} vacuum chamber. In this portion of the vacuum chamber, the gas undergoes a free jet expansion. Most of the expanded gas is evacuated and thus does not become part of the molecular beam. A small fraction of the <b>expanded</b> <b>beam</b> passes through a narrow central orifice in the wall and thereby becomes a needle- thin molecular beam in the portion of the vacuum on the downstream side of the wall...|$|E
40|$|An expanded-beam spectroscopic {{ellipsometer}} {{has been}} developed and applied toward in-situ, high-speed imaging/ mapping analysis of large area spatial uniformity for multilayer coated substrates in roll-to-roll thin film photovoltaics (PV). Slower speed instrumentation available in such analyses applies a 1 D detector array for spectroscopic mapping and involves width-wise translation of the ellipsometer optics over the moving coated substrate surface, measuring point-by-point in a time-consuming process. The expanded-beam instrument employs instead a 2 D detector array with no moving optics, exploiting one array index for spectroscopy and the second array index for line imaging across {{the width of a}} large area sample. Thus, the instrument enables imaging width-wise and mapping length-wise for uniformity evaluation at the high linear substrate speeds required for real-time, in-situ, and on-line analysis in roll-to-roll thin film PV. In this investigation, we employ the <b>expanded</b> <b>beam</b> technique to characterize the uniformity of the Ag, ZnO, and n-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers of an a-Si:H n-i-p structure deposited on a flexible polyimide substrate in the roll-to-roll configuration. Spectroscopic ellipsometry data across a line image were collected as the substrate was translated by a roll-to-roll mechanism. Coated areas as large as 12 cm × 45 cm were analyzed in this study for layer thickness and optical properties by applying the appropriate analytical models for the complex dielectric functions of the Ag, ZnO and n-type a-Si:H layers...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of dimers, trimers, and tetramers {{in a free}} jet cryogenic expansion of 4 He atoms has been studied by diffraction from a nanostructure transmission grating. The final average velocities, speed ratios and ambient temperatures of the expansions for source temperatures of 30, 12, and 6 K and source pressures between 0. 1 and 80 bar were determined from time-of-flight measurements of the He atoms. The final mole fractions of the He 2, He 3, and He 4 clusters in the beam were determined from the intensities of the corresponding first-order diffraction peaks for the same range of source conditions. For each source temperature, the final mole fractions of these small clusters first rise, pass through a maximum and then decrease with increasing source pressure. The processes leading to the {{formation of}} these clusters are simulated with a kinetic model that allows for density and temperature changes in the <b>expanding</b> <b>beam.</b> The best-fit three- body recombination rate constant for dimer formation increases by over three orders of magnitude as the thermal energy decreases from 1 K to 1 mK, in qualitative agreement with recent theories.
