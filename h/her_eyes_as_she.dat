5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{checks the}} {{rear-view}} mirror, {{her face in}} the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour {{can be seen as a}} foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this can be seen in Sierra Leone, Africa where young girls are {{mutilated}} every year. The number of girls mutilated in Africa per year has risen to 3 million. Rugiatu Turay, founder of the Amazonian Initiative Movement, protects young girls from being circumcised by other women in secret societies like Sande and other female practitioners who still engage in the ceremonial tradition today. Girls as young as the age of five assist in the mutilation of other young girls in the country. At the age of 12, Turay was snatched by female family members, held down and had her clitoris cut off with a knife. She was beaten, forced to walk, and had hot pepper water poured in <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>As</b> <b>she</b> was mutilated, the women sang, danced, and clap ceremoniously. According to these women, Turay had become a woman. However, females are generally mutilated under the age of 15. Girls who are trained to assist in this ceremony are trained as young as five years old. Turay has convinced 400 practitioners to stop the practice of female mutilation, but 97 million females have been mutilated within the country and the numbers remain constant, even increasing. The practice has been enforced by politicians within the country and locals refer to the practice as a ceremony that initiates womanhood, prepares females for marriage, and restricts their sexual conduct.|$|E
500|$|Doggett tells Reyes that, {{in order}} to resolve the situation, she must turn off his {{respirator}} and allow him to die, but she refuses. Suspecting that Lukesh plans to kill Reyes next, Skinner convinces Reyes {{to go back to}} her apartment while he, Scully, and Follmer monitor her. She returns and is attacked by Lukesh. The team rush to her aid and Follmer shoots Lukesh in the head, killing him. Reyes then returns to the hospital, closing <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> shuts off Doggett's respirator. [...] As she opens her eyes, the scene changes back to her apartment at the moment Doggett had disappeared earlier. Reyes, stunned and fighting back tears, embraces Doggett as he, evidently unaware of any of the previous events, asks her what is wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I rather think I should," [...] said Fanny; [...] "you {{would be}} such bores." [...] But there was {{something}} in <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke, which atoned for the harshness of her words.|$|R
60|$|The {{wine was}} delicious; perhaps a TRIFLE, only a trifle, heady. He was {{conscious}} of a slight exaltation. There was also a smile upon the girl's lip and a roguish twinkle in <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked at him.|$|R
6000|$|She {{glanced at}} him as he leaned pensively on the low wall, looking down into the lake, with the level rays of {{sunshine}} on his comely face and figure. Something softer than pity stole into <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> said, anxiously,-- ...|$|R
2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex Oâ€™Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked from one to the other. And nobody else has {{been able to do that}} on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You could call it underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E
60|$|Dorinda winked <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{always did}} when she was doubtful.|$|E
60|$|Julia's {{emotions}} were always sudden, {{and the tears}} came to <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> answered.|$|E
60|$|The softest {{gratitude}} animated <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{lifted it}} a moment. She had yet more to say, but seemed hesitating about time and place. Dusk {{was beginning to}} reign; her parlour fire already glowed with twilight ruddiness; but I thought she wished the room dimmer, the hour later.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} be so kind," [...] he answered, and {{departed}} with a bow. There was a mischievous mirth in <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> took <b>her</b> place in the window. Below in the ball-room sat Miss Trevor surrounded by men, and I saw her face lighting at the Celebrity's approach.|$|R
6000|$|... "The bowl is my offering," [...] Eve answered, smilingly, {{though a}} tear glistened in <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{witnessed}} the strong unsophisticated {{feeling of the}} old tar. [...] "I thought it might serve sometimes to bring me to your recollection, when it was well filled in honour of 'sweethearts and wives.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Tears were in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke, {{and he took}} a man's {{advantage}} of her emotion.|$|E
60|$|A happy {{brightness}} {{came into}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> talked of him. She apologised, blushing, for her eagerness.|$|E
60|$|He was {{suddenly}} conscious of her pity, of a moistness in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked at him.|$|E
60|$|She laughed understandingly. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> twinkled <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{looked at}} him.|$|R
60|$|Gertrude moved <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> {{had some}} {{intention}} of taking to flight.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{gave you}} that {{patchwork}} {{to see what}} you would make of it, and it is as good as a diary to me, for I can tell by the different squares how you felt when you made them,' continued Aunt Pen, with a twinkle in <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> glanced at the many-coloured bits on the carpet.|$|R
60|$|Miss Churton smiled slightly, {{but with}} a strange {{tenderness}} in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> watched the girl's face.|$|E
60|$|A pink tinge {{crept into}} Hetty's cheeks, and a sparkle into <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{looked at her}} companion.|$|E
60|$|A moment's intense dejection {{seized upon}} her. The tears stood in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{looked away from}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes indeed," [...] said Mrs. Orme, wiping a tear {{away from}} <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{thought of all}} the {{troubles}} present and to come. [...] "It is the saddest thing. Poor lady! It would almost break your heart if you were to see her. Since first she heard of this, which was before Christmas, she has not had one quiet moment." ...|$|R
60|$|Tears {{rolled out}} of <b>her</b> little <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke, and she covered her round face with her pocket-handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|Grace stood upright with tender {{compassion}} {{shining in}} <b>her</b> wet <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> fixed {{them on the}} old man.|$|R
60|$|The Chinese girl sighed, and {{the same}} {{compassion}} returned into <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked long at Dick's portrait.|$|E
60|$|She {{held her}} arms out widely, and the {{moonlight}} shone in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> turned her face to him.|$|E
60|$|Then drawing Richard to her, {{she kissed}} him very lovingly, the tears coming to <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did so.|$|E
60|$|Just as {{the last}} gleams were fading {{on the tops of}} the Ormersfield coppices, she heard the hall-door, and James's footstep; and it was more than the {{ordinary}} music of his 'coming up the stair;' there was a spring and life in it that thrilled into her heart, and glanced in <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat up in her chair, to welcome him with no forced smile.|$|R
60|$|She {{came closer}} to me, and I {{can see the}} look in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> yet <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{she stopped}} {{suddenly}} {{in silence and}} looked at Brangwen again, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> flashing, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> shouted loudly and delightedly: ...|$|R
60|$|Eleanor {{stretched}} {{out her hand}} for the paper, {{and there was a}} vindictive sparkle in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> glanced at it.|$|E
60|$|Dipping her {{handkerchief}} in cold water, {{and passing}} it over <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> left the room, she instantly hastened to her sister.|$|E
60|$|Miss Alice cantered {{forward with}} a smile, but pulled her hat down over <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> joined her mother. She was blushing.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> twinkled <b>as</b> <b>she</b> favored <b>her</b> {{companion}} with a passable {{imitation of}} her father's didactic tone and manner.|$|R
60|$|Mother Wolf walked stiffly {{from the}} cave with the cubs behind <b>her,</b> and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> glowed <b>as</b> <b>she</b> saw the skin.|$|R
60|$|She {{cried out}} at that, and {{clutched}} her breast whose calm was suddenly disturbed. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> dilated <b>as</b> <b>she</b> stared at him.|$|R
