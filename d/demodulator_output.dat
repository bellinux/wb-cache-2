A closed-loop gain of 60 dB in the {{action potential}} band is achieved by cascading differential gain-stages utilizing a novel CMFB circuit. An oversampling delta modulator (DM) is proposed to improve the noise efficiency factor (NEF) of the recording system. Moreover, in-site compression is achieved by converting the derivative of the neural signal. The DM employs a novel dynamic voltage comparator with a partial reset preamplifier, which enhances the {{mean time to failure}} of the modulator.

In {{the first part of}} this work, the application of a type-II hybrid ARQ protocol in a slotted direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) packet radio system is investigated. In the physical layer, packet error and packet success probabilities are computed using the improved Gaussian approximation technique, which accounts for the bit-to-bit error dependence within a packet. In the data-link layer, the systems with transmitter buffer length equal to 1 and greater than 1 are analyzed separately. For the first case, two-dimensional Markov chains are employed to model the system dynamic. Based on this model, the performance of the type-II hybrid ARQ protocol is upper and lower bounded by considering, respectively, a superior scheme and an inferior scheme. Steady state throughput and delay performances of the two bounding schemes are obtained. For the second case, Equilibrium Point Analysis (EPA) technique is employed to approximately compute the system performance including throughput and delay, and to analyze stability. Simulations are also performed to check the accuracy of the EPA technique. In the second part of this work, a decision-feedback MAP receiver is proposed for time-selective fading CDMA channels. The receiver consists of a sequence-matched filter and a MAP <b>demodulator.</b> <b>Outputs</b> samples (more than one per symbol) from the matched filter are fed into the MAP demodulator.

40|$|Bit {{synchronization}} is {{an important}} operation used at {{the receiving end of}} synchronous communication systems for providing a reference bit clock to the receiver; this reference marks the instants at which transition in data bits occur at the transmitting end. In some DPSK demodulator realizarions, like the integrate-and-dwnp scheme, the bit clock is essential for &a recovery itself. But in most demodulators the bit clock is required just for &quot;cleaning up &quot; the demodulated data and to provide an output with uniform data widths. Generally this is done by sampling the <b>demodulator</b> <b>output</b> (called the &quot;raw data&quot;) with another clock, which is in phase opposition with respect to the bit clock. Instants at which the bit clock transitions have to occur at the receiver and which are not a prwri known to the receiver, are rcsually estimated based on transitions of the received data. Such estimators are commonly realized as phase locked loops (PLL) with data transitions as reference inpis. In the presence of noise in the communication channel, transitions of bit clock waveform produced by the receiver synchronizer do not occur at exactly uniform intervals, but will have a random fluctuation, called the jitter, associated with them. Hence, cleaning up the <b>demodulator</b> <b>output</b> with the bit clock introduces some additional errors into the demodulated data and thus degrades the bit...|$|E

In WMUE attacks, a malicious user emulates wireless microphone (WM) signals in order to block secondary users. Existing work on WMUE attack detection deals with single channel senario. Although multi-channel WM (MCWM) systems are common, detecting WMUE attacks under a multi-channel setting in noisy environments has not been well studied and the existing solution for single channel case cannot be directly applied. In a practical multi-channel WM system, the audio signals on different channels mix with each other and are contaminated by noises, which introduce great challenges on WMUE attack detection. We propose a novel multi-channel WMUE attack detection scheme which is based on the cross-correlation between the demodulated FM signal and the acoustic signal.
