In the Ross Sea sector of the Transantarctic Mountains, Jurassic igneous rocks, comprising pyroclastic rocks and Ferrar Group tholeiitic basalts, overlie fluvial strata of the Permian-Upper Triassic Gondwana sequence. Petrological, structural and volcano-logical data suggest that the Jurassic pyroclastic rocks and overlying flood basalts were erupted into a volcano-tectonic rift system associated with lithospheric extension andd-compression melting. Geochemically the Ferrar tholeiites form part of the Gondwana low-Ti province, but they exhibit marked <b>ifferences</b> <b>in</b> initial STSr/~'Sr ratios and in high field strength element abundances in comparison with other parts of the province.

A previous model that interpreted <b>ifferences</b> <b>in</b> EMG patterns in terms of pulse-height or pulse-width modulation of rectangular pulses of motoneuron pool excitation cannot explain all the EMG patterns reported in the literature. We proposed a more general version of that model, consisting {{of a set of}} four equations, which specify the parameters of the excitation pulses {{for a wide variety of}} movement tasks. Here we report experiments in which subjects performed fast elbow flexions over a range of distances from 2. 8 ~ to 45 ~ The EMG patterns that we observe are consistent with this more general model. We conclude that this model is sufficient o specify muscle excitation patterns that will launch a movement toward and stop it in the neighborhood of a target.

Very heavy fission-fragment irradia-tion failed to lower the density of each of two low Ceylon zircons significantly, although the specimens were rendered completely amorphous. Further fission-fragment irradiation experiments indicated that low Ceylon zircons showing a previously reported anomalous absorption spectrum have been heated late in their geological histories. ZIRCON is prone to radiation damage from a-particles emanating from uranium or thorium impurities (see e. g. Blumenthal, I 958; Deer et al., 1962). Depending {{on the amount of}} lattice disordering, which depends mainly on the concentration of radio-active atoms and the geological age of a specimen, a zircon may be classified as high (relatively undamaged), intermediate, or low (heavily damaged) (Anderson, 1941).

The findings indicate {{a significant increase in}} parental cultural capital across birth cohorts (from 1900 to 1960). That this increase has been faster among Blacks than among Whites and persists after Black-White differences are taken into account suggests a degree of racial integration in the cultural domain. The results also show that exposure to high-status culture is associated with higher levels of schooling and that the integration of Blacks into high-status culture has contributed to the Black-White convergence in schooling. The latter finding illustrates that cultural capital may serve as a route to upward mobility for less privileged minority groups. D <b>ifferences</b> <b>in</b> schooling are a key factor in the debate on racial inequality in American society.

40|$|Abstract- Prompted by Foster's {{observation}} that free swelling {{is related to}} octahedral substitution, the authors determined the free swelling of six Na-montmorillonites with different amounts of octa-hedral and tetrahedral substitution. They found that the montmorillonites xhibited marked <b>ifferences</b> <b>in</b> free swelling. These differences were not related to differences in cation exchange capacity. Nor were they related to differences in ~ potential, which is a criterion of cation dissociation. Further, calculations indicated {{that they could not}} be accounted for by differences in double-layer repulsion or van der Waals attraction. Therefore, to see if dimensional changes produced by isomorphous ub-stitution were responsible, free swelling was plotted against he b-dimension of the clay structure, which was calculated from its mineralogical composition. The result was a straight line with a negative slope. A similar result was obtained with Foster's data. In addition, free swelling was plotted against the degree of tetrahedral rotation in the clay structure, which was also calculated from its mineralogical composition. The result was a family of nearly parallel straight lines that were distinguished from each other by the amount of tetrahedral AI 3 + in the clays identified with them. These results led to the pro-posal that the clay surface acts as a template for the structure of the adjacent water and that, as the configuration of the surface changes, the water structure changes accordingly. This causes a change in the free energy of the water and, hence, in the swelling of the clay...|$|R
40|$|To {{ascertain}} the activity and substrate specificity of nuclear protein kinases during {{various stages of}} the cell cycle of HeLa $ 3 cells, a nuclear phospho-protein-enriched sample was extracted from synchronised cells and assayed in vitro {{in the presence of}} homologous ubstrates. The nuclear protein kinases increased in activity during S and G 2 phase to a level that was twice that of kinases from early S phase cells. The activity was reduced uring mitosis but increased again in G 1 phase. When the phosphoproteins were separated into five fractions by cellulose-phosphate chromatography each fraction, though not homogenous, exhibited <b>ifferences</b> <b>in</b> activity. Variations in the activity of the protein kinase fractions were observed uring the cell cycle, similar to those observed for the unfractionated kinases. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of the proteins phosphorylated by each of the five kinase fractions demonstrated a substrate specificity. The fractions also exhibited some cell cycle stage-specific preference for substrates; kinases from G ~ cells phosphorylated mainly high molecular weight polypeptides, whereas lower molecular weight species were phosphorylated by kinases from the S, G 2 and mitotic stages of the cell cycle. Inhibition of DNA and histone synthesis by cytosine arabinoside had no effect on the activity or substrate specificity of S phase kinases. Some kinase fractions phosphorylated histones as well as non-histone chromosomal proteins and this phosphorylation was also cell cycle stage dependent. The presence of histone...|$|R
40|$|Some {{divergent}} {{experimental data}} {{have been reported}} on the swelling behavior of sodium montmorillonite. At water contents above 50 percent (based on the weight of dry clay) the basal reflection of sodium montmorillonite at 19. 2 A becomes weak and very diffuse; some workers have stated that it disappears, altogether while others report a persistent weak line even at very high water content. The pronounced <b>ifferences</b> <b>in</b> physical properties of sodium and calcium montmorillonite suggest hat their lat~tiee expansions hould also be dissimilar. This paper describes ome X-ray diffraction experiments using purified lithium, sodium, and potassium montmorillonites di persed in water and in salt solutions which were conducted {{for the purpose of}} resolving some of these disputed points. The X-ray diffraction instrument employed was a General Electric geiger counter spectrometer unit with a copper tube and nickel filters. The knowledge thus gained has provided some insight into other properties of these days, such as their rheologieal behavior. A recording Couette-type viscometer designed to provide a wide spectrum of shear rates and shearing stresses has been used to examine the theological transformations which occur in passing from states of maximum dispersion to states of varying degrees of agglomeration asa result of interactions between LiC 1, NaC 1, KC 1, and CaCI=, and the Li, Na, K, and Ca salts of montmorillonite in terms of certain ideal theological models. Filtration characteristics of these systems have also been explored using a standard technique. PART I [...] X-RAY DIFFRACTION STUDIES...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHere we {{show that}} {{activated}} Th 1 and Th 2 cells have distinct patterns of membrane compartmentalization into lipid rafts.

TCR/raft association <b>in</b> <b>Th</b> 1 cells is deficient in the absence of CD 4, suggesting that CD 4 aids recruitment of the TCR to rafts. We show differential utilization of rafts <b>in</b> <b>Th</b> 1 and Th 2 cells by cholesterol depletion studies, which alters calcium signaling <b>in</b> <b>Th</b> 1 but not Th 2 cells. Furthermore, Th 2 cells have a decreased ability to respond to low-affinity peptide stimulation.
