25|$|Auf Wiedersehen, Pet was {{a popular}} fictional British comedy-drama series about three Geordies (Dennis, Oz and Neville) leaving England to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> work in Germany during the heights of {{unemployment}} in Thatcher's Britain. Finding work on a building site in Düsseldorf, they lived there on-site in a basic wooden hut (not dissimilar from ones seen in a WWII-era POW camp) {{as part of a}} group of seven British migrant construction workers: the other four were Wayne from London, Bomber from somewhere in the West Country, Barry from the West Midlands, and Moxey from Liverpool. The three Geordie characters were supposed to be from Birtley Co. Durham (Dennis, played by Tim Healy), Gateshead (Oz, played by Jimmy Nail), and North Shields (Neville, played by Kevin Whately) and all three actors who played them were Geordies themselves.|$|E
25|$|These rural {{appliances}} {{are extremely}} important for keeping South Australia protected from fires. Almost every town in South Australia would {{have at least}} two of these rural fire trucks. The reason that there are many different types of rural trucks, is because the terrain changes a lot in South Australia. A 14 appliance, only carries 1000 litres nominally but is extremely useful for getting into small tracks which larger appliances can not. Large 34s often have trouble in getting into smaller areas. 24s are the most common, because they are not too heavy and big, but carry a reasonable amount of water, which can last a good time before having to fill up. In most parts of South Australia outside major centres there is no water mains, so this is where Bulk Water Carriers come in handy. These BWCs, often at a rural fire, will be stationary at the edge of it, for smaller trucks to fill up from. when empty it is their job to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> water in places including, rivers, dams, swimming pools and water tanks.|$|E

[...] For the music, Mike Conte of the heavy metal band Early Man was employed as composer. The score, which incorporates heavy metal elements and [...] "lots of [...] ", was originally added to the animatics as a rough draft. Browngardt found that it harmonized with the imagery and what he envisioned for the design.

500|$|Cuse and Lindelof {{admitted}} they took some {{inspiration from the}} final episode of , [...] "", where Captain Picard jumps between three time frames. The Lost writers compared Minkowski's role to Q, as [...] "someone who is undergoing and understands the same events as our protagonist". Faraday, on the other hand, was the expert that always appears in time travel fiction—as Lindelof put it, [...] "He's our Doc Brown here, who basically is gonna tell the protagonist to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> him in the past". Whereas the average Lost episode took two weeks to plan and write, [...] "The Constant" [...] took five because the writers experienced difficulty when determining its effect on future stories. Popular Mechanics analyzed the possibility of time travel using Losts rules. [...] Michio Kaku claimed that [...] "the show's producers did their homework". [...] According to Kaku, [...] "there's no law of physics preventing this kind of time travel—just a lack of know-how… {{it would take a}} very advanced civilization to really do this". [...] Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] try to use enough science to give a sense of credibility". [...] "The Constant" [...] was the first episode set on the Kahana, but the writers decided to avoid using the new setting just to give new information—Lindelof has declared that [...] "you would have mindless exposition unless the characters were {{in a constant state of}} crisis". According to Lindelof, Desmond's confusion prevents the characters who arrived from the island from asking questions to the freighter's crew.|$|E

2500|$|While Marshall was {{attentive}} when {{listening to}} oral arguments and often persuaded other justices to adopt {{his interpretation of}} the law, he was not widely read in the law, and seldom cited precedents.

2500|$|Haeckel was a {{flamboyant}} figure, {{who sometimes}} took great, non-scientific leaps from available evidence.

[...] At that time, no remains of human ancestors had yet been identified. [...] He described these theoretical remains in great detail and even named the as-yet unfound species, Pithecanthropus alalus, and instructed his students such as Richard and Oskar Hertwig to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> it.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Face the Nation, Wasserman Schultz said, [...] "The Republicans {{have a plan to}} end Medicare as we know it.

You're on your own. <b>Go</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> private health insurance in the health-care insurance market.. Four non-partisan fact-checkers called her claim false.

2500|$|Central to {{the plot}} of the poem is the theme of the buzzard (or other bird of prey) who swoops down from the skies to steal a lady's ring, {{prompting}} her knight to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> the ring again. The lovers are thus separated for a while, and the knight is given the opportunity for adventure before they are reunited. A popular theme in literature probably deriving from the One Thousand and One Nights material, it first appears in Western literature in Guillaume d'Angleterre and is in use still, as evidenced in Peter Bichsel's [...] "Der Busant" [...] (1998), a story also involving loss of identity. This theme is to be distinguished from what folklorist Gordon Hall Gerould called [...] "the motive of the man tried by fate", since the main character in such stories (Gerould categorizes them as following the Saint Eustace motif) experiences separation from society for different (usually religious) reasons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{title track}} and opening song, [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", was {{compared}} to her debut single, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), featuring a slap-and-pop bassline, synthesizer chord stabs and a mechanized beat. Lyrically, the song sees Spears warning to an overeager prospective lover: [...] "Oops, you think I'm in love/That I'm sent from above — I'm not that innocent." [...] The song also breaks down for a spoken-word interlude, involving {{a line from the}} film Titanic (1997). The second track [...] "Stronger" [...] is a synthpop and R track, which is lyrically a declaration of independence, where Spears leaves a partner who treats her like property. The line [...] "my loneliness ain't killing me no more" [...] makes reference to the verse [...] "my loneliness is killing me" [...] from her song [...] "...Baby One More Time". Another R track, which also adds a bit more funk to the mix, [...] "Don't Go Knocking on My Door" [...] finds Spears confidently forging ahead after a breakup. The fourth track, a cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", begins with mushy guitar plucking and breathy coos, until a dry, crackling lockstep is thrown down, turning the song into an urban stomp. The dance-pop version also jettisons the song's final verse and adds some new lyrics ("how white my shirts could be" [...] becomes [...] "how tight my skirt should be"). [...] " [...] was my idea [...] ", Spears said. [...] "I was just like, 'I like this song,' and I {{think it will be a}} really cool combination working with [...] Rodney [...] and doing a really funky song like that." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", was co-written by country-pop singer-songwriter Shania Twain and her then-husband, producer Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who also produced the track. The ballad, which boasts a slinky keyboard riff and Lange's characteristically lavish production, finds Spears allowing a bit of country twang into her vocals as she begs a lover to reveal his feelings: [...] "My friends say you're into me ... but I need to hear it straight from you", she sings. The sixth track [...] "What U See (Is What U Get)" [...] demands respect by rebuking a jealous partner, while the seventh track, [...] "Lucky", is a heart-rending tale of a Hollywood starlet's loneliness, proving that fame can be empty. [...] "If there's nothing missing in my life/Then why do these tears come at night?", she asks. [...] "School crush" [...] is the theme of [...] "One Kiss from You", a track that has a reggae-style beat and lyrics about the feelings of falling in love, and the quickness of it, with Spears cooing that after only one kiss she sees her entire future with her lover. The ballad [...] "Where Are You Now" [...] talks about wanting to know where a previous love is, and what that person is up to, so that she can finally let them <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> closure. Lines on [...] "Can't Make You Love Me", an Europop song, state that fancy cars and money pale in comparison to true love, with Spears singing: [...] "I'm just a girl with a crush on you." [...] The mid-tempo, synth-backed [...] "When Your Eyes Say It", written by songwriter Diane Warren, combines a string section with a loping hip hop beat, while Spears makes her own songwriting debut on the modest, keyboard-driven ballad [...] "Dear Diary", which she said is autobiographical. On the track, she sings of wanting to become [...] "so much more than friends" [...] with a boy.|$|E
