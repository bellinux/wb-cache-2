40|$|Critical {{studies have}} been {{presented}} on the falling sphere viscometer as an instrument for obtaining information concerning certain properties of anomalous fluids. The equation of Prasynskii and Rabinovich, which makes possible the calculation of the velocity gradient and shearing force at {{the surface of the}} sphere, was found admirably adapted for use in the techniques developed;The possibility of rating honeys {{on the basis of their}} deviation from true fluidity has been investigated, and it has been shown that there are opposing effects which, at the low rates of shear employed, tend to make such ratings erratic and difficult of interpretation. Thixotropy of the honeys was estimated by comparing viscosities of the sol (stirred) and gel (unstirred) forms of the honey, extrapolated to zero shear;All of the honeys studied showed some degree of anomalous viscosity and thixotropy. These findings are at variance with the published statements of previous investigators who found the above phenomena only in heather honey. This disagreement lies in the fact that the very low thixotropy of non-heather honeys had not been detected by previous methods;Other investigators found a general correlation between thixotropy and the colloidal content of the honey. The heather honey, for which thixotropy had been reported, contained up to 6 % of such materials. The colloidal content of the honeys studied in this thesis was less than 1 % and the observed thixotropy was as low as one-one hundredth that of heather honey. It is not surprising, therefore, that no definite relationship was found between the colloidal content and thixotropy. However, an <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>solution</b> did not show thixotropy. It may be inferred, therefore, that the low thixotropy of the honeys is associated with the colloidal material present...|$|E

40|$|The Limulus {{amebocyte}} lysate {{test has}} been used for determination of pyrogens in sugar of different qualities. All the samples of domestic white sugar and beet raw sugar produced in Sweden during 1976 had a very low content of endotoxins, less than 10 ng/g of sugar. Imported cane raw sugar was, however, highly contaminated. The highest value obtained corresponds to about 100 mg of Escherichia coli endotoxin per g of raw sugar.

However, its potential for further biotechnological development is unexploited. This study reports the characterization of this tubular/porous cellulosic material, which was done by SEM, porosimetry and X-ray powder diffractometry. The {{results showed that the}} structure of nano-tubular cellulose (NC) justifies its suitability for use in "cold pasteurization" processes and its promoting activity in bioprocessing (fermentation). The last was explained by a glucose pump theory. Also, it was demonstrated that crystallization of viscous <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> during freeze drying could not be otherwise achieved unless NC was present. This effect as well as the feasibility of extremely low temperature fermentation are due to reduction of the activation energy, and have facilitated the development of technologies such as wine fermentations at home scale (in a domestic refrigerator).

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} whether vitamin C {{can help to}} prevent obesity and hyperglycemia in Wistar rats treated with excess <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> to induce prediabetes. Methods: One hundred-day-old Male Wistar rats with a mean weight of 336. 58 ± 23. 43 g {{were randomly assigned to}} the following groups: (1) control, receiving water (C); (2) <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> control, receiving a 32 % watery solution of invert sugar; (3) vitamin C control, receiving a watery solution of vitamin C (60 mg/L), and (4) vitamin C plus <b>invert</b> <b>sugar,</b> receiving a watery solution of vitamin C and <b>invert</b> <b>sugar.</b> All animals had access to chow and water ad libitum and were treated for 17 weeks. Prediabetes was assessed according to two criteria: obesity (based on body mass indexand peritoneal fat content) and impaired glucose tolerance (assessed by the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and expressed as area under the curve). Results: Group <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> control gained significantly more weight (p= 0. 035) and visceral fat (p< 0. 001) than groups vitamin C control and vitamin C plus <b>invert</b> <b>sugar.</b> Consequently, groups vitamin C control and vitamin C plus <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> had gained as little body mass index as group C {{by the end of the}} experiment. Vitamin C decreased the fasting glycemia of both groups supplemented with vitamin C and normalized the glucose tolerance of group vitamin C plus <b>invert</b> <b>sugar,</b> whose area under the curve matched that of group C. Conclusion: Vitamin C has anti-obesogenic and glycemia-lowering effects in Wistar rats, which might be promising to prediabetics.

In this examination, six kind of gingerbread was made. The difference in the compound of the examined gingerbreads was use of various kinds of sweeteners. For this examination were used honey, <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> and malt extract. For the other gingerbread doughs were used these combinations of sweeteners (<b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> + honey, <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> + malt extract and honey + malt extract). For this sensory analysis were used eight descriptors [...] shape, colour, surface, smell, porosity, aroma of spices, overall flavour and overall impression. Besides the sensory analysis, also was measured colour of gingerbreads with using spectrophotometer. By the sensory analysis and spectrophotometric determinativ was found, that the darkest gingerbreads were with <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> in combination with honey and the lightnest gingerbreads were with malt extract and with honey. From {{the results of this}} sensory analysis was defined that, the sample where <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> was used, gave best results. The use of malt extract for gingerbread dough is not suitable, mainly because of the bad colour, smell and flavour of the final product.

50|$|The {{way that}} {{crystallization}} of sugars in marshmallows work, make them an amorphous solid. This {{is because the}} crystals formed are not grained, and very fine in size, as opposed to its crystalline counterpart where the crystals are grainy, and larger in size. This is why temperature plays such {{an important role in}} the production of marshmallows. To make an amorphous solid like marshmallow, the <b>sugar</b> syrup <b>solution</b> (sucrose, corn syrup, and <b>invert</b> <b>sugar)</b> is heated at a high temperature. It is then cooled so rapidly that no crystals have time to form. The quick cooling of the liquid in open air does not allow the sucrose molecules to form crystals, so glass (amorphous) crystals are created instead. In most confections, a combination of different sugars is used, each of which influence the solubility concentration of one another. The presence of <b>invert</b> <b>sugar</b> and/or corn syrup causes a substantial decrease in sucrose solubility due to the competition among the sugar molecules for water.|$|R

Twenty beehives of Africanized Apis mellifera were selected, and five were used for each type of feeding. The treatments were T 1 (sugar-cane juice), T 2 (sugar syrup) and T 3 (<b>inverted</b> <b>sugar).</b> Feedings was provided by Boardman feeders and the amount was adjusted according to consumption. A layer of beeswax was manually set up into the honeybee nest and beeswax built area was measured weekly. Total reducing sugar, calorimetry, dry matter and ashes of all feedings were analyzed.

The average consumption of <b>inverted</b> <b>sugar</b> was significantly lower than that of other treatments. The highest beeswax production average occurred in the sugar syrup treatment.
