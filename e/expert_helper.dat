40|$|Previous {{research}} has stressed {{the positive effects}} of receiving autonomy-oriented help over dependency-oriented help but has overlooked a potential downside in terms of recipients' evaluations of the helper. Participants in the current experiment (n= 77) requested help while working on difficult puzzles and received either autonomy- or dependency-oriented help from either an expert or a peer. In line with previous findings, receiving autonomy-oriented help led to more self-competence and positive feelings than dependency-oriented help. However, in support of our prediction, participants also felt angrier, had less respect for and less trust in the peer who provided autonomy-oriented help than the peer who provided dependency-oriented help. No differences in the evaluation of the <b>expert</b> <b>helper</b> were found. These findings highlight the importance of considering both the helpers' characteristics and the type of help provided when investigating the psychological consequences of receiving help. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Friedrich Kratochwil's book {{explores the}} role of law in the {{international}} arena and the key discourses surrounding it. It explains the increased importance of law for politics, from law-fare to the judicialization of politics, to human rights, and why traditional expectations of progress through law have led to disappointment. Providing an overview of the debates in legal theory, philosophy, international law and international organizations, Kratochwil reflects on the need to break down disciplinary boundaries and address important issues in both international relations and international law, including deformalization, fragmentation, {{the role of}} legal pluralism, the emergence of autonomous autopoietic systems and the appearance of non-territorial forms of empire. He argues that the pretensions of a positivist theory in social science and of positivism in law are inappropriate for understanding practical problems and formulates an approach for the analysis of praxis based on constructivism and pragmatism. [...] Introduction : images of law [...] Inter-disciplinarity, the epistemological ideal of incontrovertible foundations, and the problem of praxis [...] On the concept of law [...] On constitutions and fragmented orders [...] Of <b>experts,</b> <b>helpers,</b> and enthusiasts [...] The power of metaphors and narratives : systems, teleology, evolution and the issue of the "global community" [...] Cosmopolitanism, publicity, and the emergence of a "global administrative law'" [...] The politics of rights [...] The limits and burdens of rights [...] The bounds of (non) -sens...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} explores parents’ {{experiences of}} their child’s treatment in an adolescent mental health service in Sydney, Australia. Select {{research suggests that}} parents are pivotal in finding help for their vulnerable child and supporting the consequent mental health treatment. It is surprising however, {{that there is a}} gap in the literature in relation to parents’ experience of their involvement in their young person’s treatment. In this study, a qualitative grounded methodological approach provided a framework within which to explore parents’ experiences of their involvement (or lack thereof) in their child’s treatment. A purposive sample of fourteen sets of parents participated in this research. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews at three points including treatment commencement, discharge, and six months following discharge. Data from interviews were thematically analysed. Clinician feedback and case records were also analysed alongside the parent data to provide a comprehensive overview of parental involvement in the treatment. The strongly emergent themes were the relationship between parents’ hope (a sense of achieving the goal of improvements for the child) and agency (a parent’s belief in their capacity to influence their child’s wellbeing). Parents, who remained more passive in expecting <b>expert</b> <b>helpers</b> to fix their child, experienced reduced hope months after finishing the program. When parents positively changed their interaction with their child they felt a more sustained hopefulness (agency-based hope). These findings provide evidence that, if parents are actively involved in changing themselves as part of their child’s treatment (agency), they experience increased effectiveness in dealing with their child, and as a consequence, increased hope for their child’s improvement. A number of intersecting themes emerge under this overarching narrative regarding where parents’ hope is invested and how it develops or diminishes during the course of treatment and beyond. Discussion focusses on therapeutic approaches that foster a strong alliance with parents, while also assisting them to address any family functioning factors that may {{be a part of the}} child’s difficulties. This research can contribute to improving engagement with parents as part of the mental health treatment offered to their child...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} “distributed TPACK” (SITE 2014) {{suggests}} that “distributing the knowledge across {{a system of}} resources and support is a more accurate and realistic depiction of what teachers actually do in the real setting of a classroom” with respect to thinking that all the knowledge resides in just the teacher’s head. In other words, teaching with technology {{is seen as a}} learning process where the required knowledge (about T, or C, or P) is distributed across a group of “actors” (mainly, but not exclusively, teachers and students) and resources. In this paper we argue that TPACK is often not only distributed but also dynamic, {{in the sense that the}} relevant knowledge is dynamically shared among various actors: teachers, students, outside <b>helpers,</b> <b>experts,</b> etc., so that the final distribution differs from the initial one. The hypothesis is supported by empirical evidence, obtained from a large case study involving hundreds of teachers on the job with a digital storytelling activity...|$|R
