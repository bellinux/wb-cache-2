A <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> element (2) fits {{in front of}} the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> and operates with a slightly larger gap between a surface and lower edge than the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade,</b> operating with the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> to form a chamber (4). USE - In printing operations where good results are required. ADVANTAGE - The <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> is sealed at the top so that during a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> operation or wiping some of the printable material is forced along or rolled in front the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> element, allowing part of the printable material to go under the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> element into the chamber. This system produces very good print results, even for small structures at low cost...|$|R

40|$|The <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> is a {{core part}} of a laser printer and {{directly}} influences the printing quality. The main specifications for <b>doctor</b> <b>blades</b> ate {{for them to be}} precise and durable. It is necessary to study an automatic production system for <b>doctor</b> <b>blades</b> in order to obtain high-efficient manufacturing processes. In this paper, the technology and the design of the automatic production line has for manufacturing <b>doctor</b> <b>blades</b> has been researched. The automated manufacturing process consists of five steps, which are the supplying of raw material, shearing, bending, bracket supplying, and the laser-spot welding process. The proposed automatic manufacturing system allowed for faster and more reliable production of <b>doctor</b> <b>blades...</b>|$|R
50|$|Of necessity, the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> must be {{easy and}} quick to replace. On many machines, the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> holder is easily {{removable}} {{from the machine}} and the replacement of a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> is done by removing the blade holder from the machine; discarding the old blade; inserting the new blade; and then replacing the blade holder + new blade in the machine.|$|R
40|$|The purpose {{with this}} master thesis is to {{investigate}} why the bolts in a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system breaks {{and to find}} a suitable action to prevent this. The <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system can easily be explained as a scraper that cleans a roll. The scraper moves sideways (oscillates) and the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system along with the roll can be folded back for maintenance work. The work began with collecting relevant data about the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system. When this was done various sources of error {{that may have been}} causing the problems were listed and investigated more closely. Based on these studies, the cause of the failure has been concluded based on the most likely sources of error. The result shows three possible causes of accidents listed below:• A unit performing the oscillating movement that was mounted to the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system could have caused to high strain on the bolts• The movement that is created when the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system and the roll is folded back causes bending in the bearings• Too high load on the roll {{as a result of a}} wrongly adjusted <b>doctor</b> <b>blade.</b> Except these reasons, maintenance routines have been listed as a possible cause. This theory has higher insecurity and need to be investigated closer over a longer period of time. The problem with the oscillating unit is already resolved since it was replaced short before the work started. The folding movement has a unit installed that is meant to make the movement parallel, but this unit is malfunctioning. A suitable complement to this is a measurement system that ensures parallelism. The high load can be resolved by adjusting the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system to the roll. In addition to these proposed actions a suggestion for improvement has been made. This should be done by moving the adjustment for the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> to a more beneficial position. Validerat; 20120623 (anonymous...|$|R

50|$|A Yankee dryer is a {{pressure}} vessel {{used in the}} production of tissue paper. On the Yankee dryer, the paper goes from approximately 42-45% dryness to just over 89% dryness. In industry, MG cylinders or Yankee dryers are primarily used to remove excess moisture from pulp that is about to be converted into paper. The Yankee cylinder can be equipped with a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> and sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Creping is done by the Yankee's <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface thereby crêping the paper. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade,</b> speed difference between the yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.|$|R

50|$|The ink is {{controlled}} in the flexographic printing process by the inking unit. The inking unit {{can be either}} of fountain roll system or <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system. The fountain roll system is a simple old system yet if {{there is too much}} or too little ink this system would likely control in a poor way. The <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> inside the anilox/ceramic roller uses cell geometry and distribution. These blades ensure that the cells are filled with enough ink.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary ink {{metering}} systems {{employ a}} self contained system {{known as a}} chambered <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll. Ink is pumped through a hose(s) to the chamber which fills to capacity. Ink is retained within the system by end seals and <b>doctor</b> blades.One <b>blade</b> work as a retaining blade, simply holding ink within the chamber. The other reverse angle blade works as previously described, removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll.Chambered <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> systems are recognized for high quality, consistency and accuracy removing the influence of press speed and some human subjectivity.|$|R
5000|$|In {{rotogravure}} printing the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> (from ductor blade) {{removes the}} excess ink from the smooth non-engraved {{portions of the}} image carrier [...] and the land areas of the cell walls. [...] <b>Doctor</b> <b>blades</b> are also used in other printing and coating processes, such as flexo and pad printing for the same function. It is believed that the name derives from the blades used in flatbed letterpress equipment for blades used to wipe ductor rolls, and [...] "ductor" [...] became doctor.|$|R
5000|$|Important process {{variables}} in gravure coating & printing are the rotational position {{at which the}} blade wipes the cylinder; the angle that the blade makes with the tangent to the cylinder at the contact point; and the pressure applied to the blade. [...] Fine adjustment of in-and-out position, independently on left and right, must also be possible, in order to compensate for any misalignment between blade geometry and cylinder axis. These requirements are fulfilled by a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> assembly which includes a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> holder.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} keep the wear pattern as even as possible, and to help prevent any {{particles}} in the angle between blade and cylinder, all except the smallest machines use oscillating <b>doctor</b> <b>blades.</b> The entire <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> assembly oscillates from side to side. The oscillation, flexibility of the blade, and the various possible misalignments and problems {{due to a lack of}} stiffness may result in the failure to achieve the desired angle of contact between the blade and the cylinder, or at least a failure to consistently achieve this desired angle.|$|R
50|$|Paper that is creped is {{produced}} {{on a paper}} machine that has a single large steam-heated drying cylinder (yankee) fitted with a hot-air hood. The raw material is paper pulp.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the development and}} {{construction of a new}} patented <b>doctor</b> <b>blade.</b> A <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> is used when creping soft paper from a large rotating Yankee cylinder. At the current state the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> are in use for four to six hours before it needs to be switch due to wearing, stopping the production of soft paper. The new idea is to have a very long and small blade that will slide into a fixed blade and be continuously pulled when creping paper. The company CS Production had a concept of the fixed blade but wanted to further develop it since the blade was too wide.   Measurements where done with the old blade and with the old testing device to measure the pull force required to pull the blade. New concepts where made by the method of brainstorming and evaluated with an elimination matrix. Rivet joints where selected as the joining technique for the new design. The new concept contains one dominant blade that smaller parts were assembled to form the final blade. The material selected for the dominant blade and the section blade was a cold rolled stainless spring steel strip and for the middle disc the material was aluminum bronze string casted. Test on the pull force required where done with the new <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> in the new test rig.  FEM simulation where done on {{a small part of the}} blade to see where stresses are occurring in the blade. The FEM result showed that no stresses where on the middle discs, rivets or section blades. This is not reliable results because the small <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> is pushing down onto the middle discs and stresses should be occurring on the discs.  Further testing is needed to see if the blade can withstand the forces applied to it...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{processes}} used in manufacturing of multilayer ceramic packages, multilayer capacitors and large scale integration circuits is tape casting. In this process, the wet tape thickness is one of the single most determining parameters affecting the final properties of the product, and it is therefore of great interest to be able to control it. One way to control the tape thickness is to use a two <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> configuration in the tape casting machine. In this case, it becomes important to fix the height of the slurry in front of both <b>doctor</b> <b>blades</b> according to the desired tape thickness and casting speed (belt velocity). In the present work, the flow in both <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> regions of a slurry is described with a steady state momentum equation in combination with a Bingham plastic constitutive equation, and this is integrated to a closed form analytical solution for both reservoirs based on the desired wet tape thickness and casting speed. The developed model is used to investigate the impact of different material parameters and machine designs on the required slurry height. The solution is compared with experimental findings from the literature, and good agreement is found...|$|R

The conductivity of all samples increases with the temperature and decreases in oxygen, as expected for an n-type semiconducting material. The impedance plots indicated the existence of two time constants related to the grains and the grain boundaries. The Nyquist diagrams at low frequencies revealed the changes that took place in the grain boundary region, with the contribution of the grains being indicated by the formation of a second semicircle at high frequencies.

40|$|Although a large {{diversity}} of single-component and binary superlattices from colloidal nanocrystals have been demonstrated, applications of such ordered nanocrystal assemblies are still hampered {{due to a}} lack of control over the self-assembly processes over large areas. A reel-to-reel compatible large-area coating technique for solutions is given by <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> casting, which is applied here to deposit colloidal nanocrystals onto various substrates. The self-assembly process is demonstrated for magnetic nanocrystals, having a high potential for applications in magnetic memory devices. Shape-controlled (spherical and cubic) and monodisperse nanocrystals with a Wustite core and a cobalt ferrite shell are used in particular. <b>Doctor</b> <b>blade</b> casting of these colloidal nanocrystals results in films exhibiting hexagonally closely packed arrangements, which are formed by a top-down growth, as is evidenced by cross sectional transmission electron microscopy. The ordering in the topmost layer extends over large areas, although some defects and irregularities are found. The degree and quality of self-assembly is quantified by analyzing plan view images of the assemblies by means of the decay of their autocorrelation function. This analysis reveals that the degree of ordering obtained by <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> casting outperforms those provided by alternative deposition techniques such as inkjet printing or drop casting. The results for the coherent lengths deduced from the autocorrelation analysis are shown to be consistent with those from grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering, giving coherence length on the order of 1000 nm...|$|R
