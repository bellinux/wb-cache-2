25|$|The {{solution}} {{he developed}} was the Miami Beach Railway, an electric street railway system which served the additional purpose of providing electric service. He and other investors formed the Miami Beach Electric Company and the Miami Beach Railway Co. It began service on December 14, 1920 and ran from downtown Miami, where it shared tracks with Miami's own trolley system, to the County Causeway (renamed MacArthur Causeway after World War II). After crossing Biscayne Bay to Miami Beach, the tracks looped around {{the section of}} Miami Beach south of 47th Street. Around 1926, Florida Power and Light acquired Fisher's streetcar system, and expanded it, double tracking the line across the causeway. However, while sale of electric service was a <b>growth</b> <b>industry</b> across the United States, the street railway portion went into a period of decline, along with the entire industry. All rail service between Miami and Miami Beach was terminated on October 17, 1939.|$|E

The latter song, [...] "My Heart Still Clings to You", is described by Sant as [...] "a typical tragical-love ballad of this time, and its almost Victorian sentimentality comes through in its words". In the early to mid-1910s Ketèlbey began to write music for silent films—a new <b>growth</b> <b>industry</b> in Britain from 1910 onwards—and he had great success in the medium until the advent of talking films in the late 1920s.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{financial}} dependence on acquisition and investment within existing industries by single-segment and conglomerate firms for industries undergoing different long run changes in industry conditions. Conglomerates and single-segment firms differ more in rates of within-industry acquisitions than in capital expenditure rates, which are similar across organizational type. In particular, 36 percent of within-industry growth by conglomerate firms in <b>growth</b> <b>industries</b> is from intra-industry acquisitions, compared to nine percent for single segment firms. Financial dependence, a deficit in a segment%u 2019 s internal financing, decreases the likelihood of within-industry acquisitions and opening new plants, especially for single-segment firms. These effects are mitigated for conglomerates in <b>growth</b> <b>industries.</b> The findings persist after controlling for firm size and segment productivity. Acquisitions lead to increased efficiency as plants acquired by conglomerate firms in <b>growth</b> <b>industries</b> increase in productivity post acquisition. The results are consistent with the comparative advantages of different firm organizations differing across long-run industry conditions. ...|$|R

2500|$|Entrepreneurs set up {{shops and}} {{businesses}} {{to cater to}} the miners. World-famous were the houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide. Prostitution was a <b>growth</b> <b>industry</b> attracting sex workers from around the globe, pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes; they had to send their earnings back to the family in China. In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, Julia Bulette, {{was one of the}} few who achieved [...] "respectable" [...] status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic; this gave her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867; they gave her a lavish funeral and speedily tried and hanged her assailant. Until the 1890s, madams predominately ran the businesses, after which male pimps took over, and the treatment of the women generally declined. It was not uncommon for bordellos in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma of East Coast cities. Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later―as the female population increased, reformers moved in, and other civilizing influences arrived―did prostitution become less blatant and less common. After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses, organized church societies, worked as laundresses and seamstresses, and strove for independent status.|$|E
