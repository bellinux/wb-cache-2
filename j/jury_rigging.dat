500|$|On 8 August, the French {{squadron}} sailed into Newport harbour, Marseillois coming {{sixth in}} the line. They had begun to disembark troops the following day when Howe's squadron arrived from New York. D'Estaing found his anchored ships were now vulnerable to attacks from land batteries, warships and fireships, and cancelled the landing, putting to sea to challenge Howe in battle. Howe's force moved off, pursued by the French. On 11 August the French closed in and the two fleets manoeuvred {{in preparation for a}} battle, but around 16:00, a Nor'easter storm broke out, scattering both fleets. Marseillois sustained damage to her rigging, losing her mizzen and her bowsprit, and was cut off from the bulk of the French squadron. The next day, around 20:00, having only just erected <b>jury</b> <b>rigging,</b> she was attacked by the 50-gun HMS Preston, under William Hotham. The two ships duelled indecisively for one hour before parting. [...] Marseillois rejoined the French fleet on 14 August.|$|E
2500|$|Apart from Littlejohn Berwick had {{suffered}} minimal casualties, only four men wounded. This had {{been attributed to}} a French desire not to damage the ship too severely and thus only targeting the <b>jury</b> <b>rigging</b> {{during most of the}} engagement. In addition to Lejoille, seven were wounded on Alceste and there were no losses on any of the other French ships present. The crew were removed from Berwick and shared amongst the other ships of the pursuit squadron, forbidden to take any baggage with them except the clothes they wore; British historian William James says that they were [...] "shamefully treated". The officers were later exchanged and honourably acquitted at the subsequent court-martial into the loss of the ship. James and later historian William Laird Clowes both blame Hotham for the loss of the ship through his impatience in sailing for Leghorn and abandoning an obviously vulnerable and disabled member of his fleet.|$|E
60|$|A {{slight breeze}} {{had risen from}} the {{southwest}} since Theriere had left Barbara Harding and now all hands were busily engaged in completing the <b>jury</b> <b>rigging</b> that the Halfmoon might {{take advantage of the}} wind and make the shore that rose abruptly from the bosom of the ocean but a league away.|$|E

50|$|<b>Jury</b> <b>rigging</b> {{is the use}} of {{makeshift}} repairs or temporary contrivances, {{made with}} only the tools and materials that happen to be on hand, originally in a nautical context. On square-rigged sailing ships, a jury rig is a replacement mast and yards (a yard is a spar to which a sail is attached) improvised in case of damage or loss of the original mast.|$|E
50|$|On 15 September 1806, {{while under}} <b>jury</b> <b>rig</b> some 15 miles off Havana, she {{encountered}} HMS Anson, under Captain Charles Lydiard. Anson, mistakenly believing Foudroyant distressed, attacked, and was driven off.|$|R

However, with night falling fast the Royal Navy ships are unable to pursue so break off at 11pm to begin setting up <b>jury</b> <b>rigging</b> and claw back out to sea.|$|E
50|$|Willaumez lingered a {{while in}} the hope that the convoy might still be yet to come, but in the night of 19 to 20 August, his fleet {{sustained}} a hurricane that damaged most of the ships. Foudroyant, having lost both her rudder and her masts, managed to limp back to Havana on <b>jury</b> <b>rigging,</b> but was intercepted and attacked by HMS Anson; as she had retained her full firepower, Foudroyant drove her opponent away within half an hour despite her lack of manoeuvrability, and entered harbour.|$|E
50|$|The {{jury mast}} knot (or {{masthead}} knot) is traditionally used for <b>jury</b> <b>rigging</b> a temporary mast on a sailboat or ship {{after the original}} one has been lost. The knot is placed {{at the top of}} a new mast with the mast projecting through the center of the knot. The loops of the knot are then used as anchor points for makeshift stays and shrouds. Usually small blocks of wood are affixed to, or a groove cut in, the new mast to prevent the knot from sliding downwards.|$|E

5000|$|John Murphy criticized Farrell's approach, {{noting that}} by {{accepting}} the confessions as the baseline truth and hewing to the [...] "conventional" [...] history {{that led to}} mob justice, Farrell had invented conversations and created motivations that were impossible to corroborate and glossed over inconsistencies. Murphy points out the later phone calls placed to make ransom demands came from payphones physically close together, culminating in the arrest of Thurmond at a payphone only 150 ft from San Jose Police Headquarters. Murphy {{would go on to}} write a book, <b>Jury</b> <b>Rigging</b> in the Court of Public Opinion (published in 2007), and write and produce a movie, Valley of the Hearts Delight regarding the 1933 case.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} think of kludges and quick fixes as {{innovative}} practices, characterized by the re- appropriation of available resources in order to adapt them to specific needs. It explores the process of <b>jury</b> <b>rigging</b> beyond its functional dimension. We believe that rearrangements of materials may re-signify our experiences and reinvent everyday life, disclosing potentials of resistance and emancipation. The political and aesthetic dimensions of this practice of the unusual and unexpected are dealt with through the articulation of works by Michel de Certeau, John Dewey, Jacques Rancière and Hannah Arendt...|$|E

50|$|Both {{ships were}} flush deck {{with only a}} <b>jury</b> <b>rig,</b> and could only operate as coastal service vessels. The Admiralty, {{although}} impressed with Coles' rotating turret, required oceangoing vessels to protect its worldwide empire. Unfortunately for Coles, engine technology had not yet caught up with his designs and consequently oceangoing ships required sails. Combining rigging, masts, and turrets proved complicated if rigging was not to impede the turrets' arcs of fire.|$|R

She spent 30 days off Cape Horn, and lost a fore yard.In 1855, Philadelphia to San Francisco, 128 days, under Capt. Manwaring.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of which Levett {{had been part}} succeeded in supplying arms to the Israelis, but it was controversial and hazardous: The airlift violated a United Nations embargo on arms shipments to the Middle Eastern combatants. Some flights by the neophyte fighter pilot Levett had involved actual bombing raids by transport planes <b>jury</b> <b>rigged</b> into bombers. The modified transport planes made bombing runs from the Sinai Peninsula to Damascus, Syria.|$|R

50|$|Stag Hound's crew {{raised a}} <b>jury</b> <b>rig</b> and reached California in 113 days (108 days at sea and 5 days in port), {{a very fast}} time for a partly {{dismasted}} vessel. Stag Hound then proceeded to Guangdong to load a cargo of tea. The entire round-the-world voyage earned a profit of $80,000 in 1851 U.S. dollars, which was enough to inspire {{the construction of a}} fleet of California clippers in future years.|$|R
50|$|Peter, Pat and two volunteers flew to Norfolk Island, {{accompanied}} by {{two police officers}} to extradite the ‘pirates’, the four returning to Sydney the same afternoon (at Fenton's expense). The Fentons and volunteers remained on Norfolk Island to effect minor repairs and sail back to Sydney. This necessitated reduced <b>jury</b> <b>rig,</b> due to damage to rigging and spreaders on both masts, along with the deckhouse windows being smashed in, with only a tarpaulin to keep out water and weather.|$|R
50|$|Ordered {{to proceed}} to Bailey's Beach four miles (6 km) south of Scoglitti she {{discharged}} DUKWs before beaching. Both ramp chains parted while discharging DUKWs and a <b>jury</b> <b>rig</b> of wire pennants was installed. The Beachmaster advised that no pontoons were available. The vessel was beached on 11 July and the commanding officer went ashore to arrange for a causeway. While awaiting the causeway, then in use by another LST, several enemy aircraft attempted to attack the beach and the LST-16 opened fire.|$|R
50|$|The Dallam Tower {{was built}} in 1866 in Birkenhead for the Lancaster Ship-owners Company, and {{launched}} by Mrs Wilson, wife of Mr G. E. Wilson of Dallam Tower. It was the third ship built for that company, and was intended for passenger traffic between Liverpool and Melbourne.
