5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a <b>fodder</b> <b>crop</b> and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a <b>fodder</b> <b>crop</b> for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E

The results of a logistic regression model (LIMDEP ©) revealed {{a number of significant}} factors (P< 0. 05) associated with five main constraints preventing wider use of <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> in cultural practices. These include increased labor demand at peak cropping season, land tenure rights, field protection, availability of fodder seeds, and low productivity gain associated with the introduction of <b>fodder</b> <b>crops.</b> <b>Fodder</b> <b>crops</b> adoption rates would be higher with the adaptation of the technology to local conditions and increased emphasis on farmers' training and sensitization campaigns...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} methodological {{approaches}} of cost evaluation of canned feed production, especially cost evaluation of corn silage or silage from melted multiannual fodder on arable land. Mainly there is {{modification of the}} cost calculation method in two steps used for chosen <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> up to now. The first step is cost calculation of chosen <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> during cultivation and harvesting. The second step is cost calculation of chosen <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> processing, it means process of crops ensilage. The result of methodological modification of cost evaluation of canned feed production is an aggregate of own cost calculation by combining both phases of calculation, i. e. connection in the initial phase of cultivation and harvesting of <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> and the subsequent phase of processing and transport of canned feed.

500|$|The first written {{reference}} of {{the word}} 'cowpea' appeared in 1798 in the United States. The name was most likely acquired due to their use as a <b>fodder</b> <b>crop</b> for cows. Black-eyed pea, a common name used for the unguiculata cultivar group, describes {{the presence of a}} distinctive black spot at the hilum of the seed. Black-eyed peas were first introduced to the southern states in the United States and some early varieties had peas squashed closely together in their pods, leading to the other common names of southern pea and crowder-pea. Sesquipedalis in Latin means [...] "foot and a half long", and this subspecies which arrived in the United States via Asia is characterised by unusually long pods, leading to the common names of yardlong bean, asparagus bean and Chinese long-bean.|$|E
2500|$|Galician Poles {{experienced}} {{among the}} most difficult situations in their homeland. When serfdom was outlawed in 1848, the Austrian government continued to {{drive a wedge between}} Polish peasants and their Polish landlords to detract them from a more ambitious Polish uprising. Galicia was isolated from the west geographically by the Vistula river and politically by the foreign powers, leaving Galician Poles restricted from commercial agriculture in the west of Poland. Galician Poles continued to use outdated agricultural techniques such as burning manure for fuel instead of using it for fertilizer, and the antiquated Medieval-era three-year crop rotation system, which had been long-replaced in western Poland by the use of clover as a <b>fodder</b> <b>crop.</b> Galician Poles resented the government for its apathy in handling disease; a typhus epidemic claimed 400,000 lives between 1847 and 1849, and cholera killed over 100,000 in the 1850s. Galicia suffered a potato blight between 1847 and 1849, similar to Ireland's famine at the same time, but relief was never reached because of political and geographical isolation. A railroad system connecting Poland began reaching West Galicia from 1860 to 1900, and railroad tickets cost roughly half a farmhand's salary at the time. Polish peasants were no longer the property of their landlords, but remained tied to their plots of land for subsistence and were financially indebted to the landlords and government taxmen. The plight of the Galician Poles was termed the [...] "Galician misery", as many were deeply frustrated and depressed by their situations.|$|E
