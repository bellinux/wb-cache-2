25|$|Magnan v.

We are interested in the question of what <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> there are <b>for</b> or against God's existence, and no light is thrown on that question by discovering people who hold their beliefs without having <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> them.|$|R

25|$|Although a {{creditor}} {{may have}} <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> believing the debtor is insolvent, he will usually {{not be in}} a position to prove that the debtor’s liabilities exceed his assets. If, however, the creditor can establish that the debtor has committed one or more “act” of insolvency, he may seek an order sequestrating the debtor’s estate without having to prove that the debtor is insolvent. Therefore, a debtor’s estate may be sequestrated even though he is technically solvent.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the family}} {{spent much of}} his {{childhood}} travelling round Europe, most of his education was by private tutors. He only spent about two years in formal schooling, first at King's College School in London (then located in Somerset House) and then, for a few months, at Warwick Grammar School (now Warwick School). Here his time was ended by a bronchial disease of the kind that was to plague him throughout his long life. His father considered his ill-health as a <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> another European tour.|$|E

Her husband pressed Rupert {{to go to her}} relief. Once, too, the prince was ordered back to Oxford to furnish a travelling escort for the queen, who shortly after this, gave birth to her youngest child and returned to France. The order was countermanded within a few hours, it is true, but Charles had <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> avoiding detachments from his own army.|$|E

25|$|After the An Shi Rebellion (755–763), {{the economy}} of {{northern}} China was greatly damaged and never recovered due to wars and to constant flooding of the Yellow River. Such a case occurred in the year 858 when an enormous flood along the Grand Canal inundated {{thousands of acres of}} farmland and killed {{tens of thousands of people}} in the North China Plain. Such an unfortunate event could reduce the legitimacy of a ruling dynasty by causing others to perceive it as having lost the Mandate of Heaven; this was a <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> dynastic authorities to maintain a smooth and efficient canal system.|$|E
25|$|Although an American citizen {{for many}} years, Joe McManus {{continued}} {{to visit his}} Canadian friends and attend many Canadian meetings {{in spite of the}} numerous demanding professional and scientific positions which he held for more than 3 decades. His continuing interest in Canada and his support and friendliness towards our scientists at meetings is a <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Canadians to remember him. To those of us who met him later in his career it was apparent that he showed the fearlessness of a fighter, regardless of the odds against him whenever it seemed important to state his opinion on controversial scientific, professional or political problems. As a distinguished alumnus he was constantly in touch with Queens University and participated in the scientific program held during the 100th anniversary of the Queen's University Medical School.|$|E
25|$|Malcolm, {{the eldest}} of Earl Henry's sons, was only eleven years old. He was however sent by his {{grandfather}} on a circuit of the kingdom, accompanied by Donnchad, Mormaer of Fife, and a large army. Donnchad had been styled rector, perhaps indicating {{that he was to}} hold the regency for Malcolm on David's death. These preparations were timely, because King David survived his son less than one year, dying on 24 May 1153 at Carlisle. Malcolm was inaugurated as king on 27 May 1153 at Scone at age twelve. Donnchad, who duly became regent for the young Malcolm, ensured that the inauguration took place before the old king was even buried. This might appear unseemly, but there was <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the haste. Malcolm was not without rivals for the kingship. Donnchad himself died a year later, in 1154.|$|E

I demonstrate that these two claims cannot be simultaneously justified.

500|$|When news of {{the event}} first reached England, it was {{dismissed}} as rebel propaganda. When the reports were confirmed, Graves' superior, Lord George Germain expressed surprise rather than offence, noting that [...] "I am to suppose that Admiral Graves had <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the step he took", in spite of orders (not received by Graves until after Mowat had sailed for Falmouth) to not take such acts unless the town clearly refused {{to do business with}} the British. [...] Graves was relieved of his command in December 1775, in part due to his failure to suppress the rebel naval forces. Germain issued the orders before Falmouth burned.|$|E
500|$|Critically, [...] "5,6,7,8" [...] {{garnered}} {{a negative}} review from Peter Robinson of NME in 2001. In {{his review of}} Gold: Greatest Hits, he wrote [...] "Steps were only signed for one single – with <b>good</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>for</b> '5,6,7,8' was shit of the very highest order." [...] Similarly, Digital Spy writer Robert Copsey wrote that retrospectively, [...] "5,6,7,8" [...] was a [...] "bizarre" [...] choice of lead single in his review of The Ultimate Collection in 2011. In a review of Steps best-selling songs for the Official Charts Company in March 2017, Copsey noted how [...] "5,6,7,8" [...] is distinctly {{different from the rest}} of their discography in terms of its techno-pop genre, line dancing lyrics and lack of lead vocals solely from Claire Richards.|$|E

Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer, who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, [...] "That's so wrong.

500|$|Starfish are {{widespread}} in the oceans, but [...] are only occasionally used as food. There may be <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains saponins, which have an unpleasant taste, and others contain tetrodotoxins which are poisonous.
