25|$|The Blue Jays opened August with a 7–6 {{loss to the}} Royals. Ben Revere and Mark Lowe {{made their}} debuts with Toronto, with the latter {{allowing}} 3 runs in 1 inning pitched to take the loss. To close out the series, the Blue Jays and Royals played a heated game on August 2. Royals starter Edinson Vólquez intentionally hit Josh Donaldson with a pitch in the first inning, and both benches were warned by home plate umpire Jim Wolf. In his next at-bat, Volquez narrowly missed hitting <b>Donaldson</b> <b>in</b> the head, but was not ejected. Later, Troy Tulowitzki was hit by Royals reliever Ryan Madson, who followed with another pitch that just missed hitting <b>Donaldson</b> <b>in</b> the face. Manager John Gibbons was ejected for arguing with Wolf, while Madson remained in the game. In the following inning, Aaron Sanchez hit Alcides Escobar on the knee with an inside pitch and was ejected, which lead to a bench-clearing argument on field, with Blue Jays bench coach DeMarlo Hale also being ejected. The Blue Jays would win the game, 5–2, taking 3 of 4 from the AL-leading Royals.|$|E

25|$|The party's misfortunes {{continued}} at the 2005 election. The party held six seats at Westminster immediately before the 2005 general election, down from seven after the previous general election following the defection of Jeffrey <b>Donaldson</b> <b>in</b> 2004. The election {{resulted in the}} loss of five of their six seats. The only seat won by an Ulster Unionist was North Down, by Sylvia Hermon, who had won the seat in the 2001 general election from Robert McCartney of United Kingdom Unionist Party.

According to the British agent known as 'Martin', leading South Armagh republicans blamed him for IRA operations which had been compromised and suspected he had planted covert listening devices which they had found. He stated that he was recruited after compromising himself during a vulnerable time in his life, but did not specify why he was vulnerable or why he would risk his life as a mole for British intelligence in an area such as West Belfast.|$|E
25|$|The Toronto Blue Jays {{acquired}} Marco Estrada, Devon Travis, Josh Donaldson, and Michael Saunders via trades. The Estrada {{trade was}} a one-for-one swap of Estrada and Adam Lind, {{who went to}} Milwaukee Brewers after the Blue Jays exercised the option on his contract. In addition, both the Travis and Saunders trades were single-player deals. Travis came to Toronto for Anthony Gose, {{who went to the}} Detroit Tigers, and Saunders was exchanged for J. A. Happ, who was dealt to the Seattle Mariners. Toronto acquired <b>Donaldson</b> <b>in</b> a five–player trade, sending Brett Lawrie, Kendall Graveman, Sean Nolin, and Franklin Barreto to Oakland Athletics. Barreto played for the Vancouver Canadians in Single A in 2014, while Graveman and Nolin were September additions to the Blue Jays' roster. Toronto spoke to Arizona Diamondbacks about Wade Miley and Mark Trumbo. However, the trade never took place. Toronto wanted Trumbo to trade for Saunders.|$|E

500|$|... "If I Had You" [...] is {{a popular}} ballad by Irving King (a {{pseudonym}} for James Campbell and Reginald Connelly) and Ted Shapiro. It was popularized in Britain by Al Bowlly with Fred Elizalde and His Orchestra, and shortly thereafter by Rudy Vallée in the United States. It was marketed as [...] "the favorite fox-trot of the Prince of Wales". The first jazz recording was made in 1941 by Benny Goodman's sextet. Art Blakey recorded a memorable ballad version with saxophonist Lou <b>Donaldson</b> <b>in</b> 1954.|$|E
500|$|<b>Donaldson,</b> <b>in</b> {{her essay}} [...] "The Last Temptation of Mulder", writes that in Kazantzakis' novel Jesus [...] "represents {{what is the}} utmost human challenge, that of {{releasing}} the divinity within from its earthly confines." [...] In this way, the Jesus of The Last Temptation of Christ represents [...] "utter humanity" [...] and the [...] "struggle between {{the spirit and the}} flesh". Mulder is similarly challenged when he is enticed by The Smoking Man, and overcomes temptation by giving up his dream life and embracing his destiny to stop the alien invasion. Several characters in the episode resemble those in the novel. For instance, Fowley is similar to Kazantzakis' version of Mary Magdalene—both characters [...] "thwart the mission" [...] of the hero. Scully parallels Kazantzakis' version of Judas Iscariot, as they both call the heroes out of their respective trances.|$|E
500|$|According to Amy M. <b>Donaldson</b> <b>in</b> {{her book}} We Want to Believe: Faith and Gospel in The X-Files, Mulder's opening {{monologue}} {{may be an}} example of [...] "Mulder now being more receptive to the possibility of God's intervention". Throughout much of the series, Mulder has shown a disdain for religion. However, in [...] "Closure", Donaldson points out that [...] "Mulder's belief in God, as always, revolves around his beliefs about his sister's fate". As such, Mulder expresses hope that those who die in a cruel fashion [...] "live on in some other way". Furthermore, she argues that because [...] "Closure" [...] opens with the tagline [...] "Believe to understand", Mulder must [...] "take the leap of faith" [...] in order to find enlightenment, and ultimately the truth about his sister. The first half of the episode plays out according to the tagline; Mulder first believes in [...] "his desire stated in the opening voiceover", and then finds closure.|$|E

500|$|The episode makes {{prominent}} use of John 11:25–26 {{from the}} Christian Bible, which reads [...] "Who soever liveth and believeth in me shall never die". These {{were the words}} that were {{believed to have been}} said by Jesus when he raised Lazarus of Bethany from the dead; biblical scholars have noted that the verse was also intended as a foreshadow of his resurrection. For this reason, the verse is used in the episode to represent a physical resurrection from the dead. However, Amy <b>Donaldson,</b> <b>in</b> her book We Want to Believe, notes that the verse is used for the wrong reasons in [...] "Millennium"; the necromancer is able to successfully raise the dead by reciting the line, but only their bodies, resulting in mindless zombies. Later, the verse reappears in the eighth season episode [...] "Deadalive" [...] during Mulder's funeral. In this instance, the verse is used to symbolize its true intentions, and Mulder is returned from the dead, both in mind and body.|$|E
500|$|Amy <b>Donaldson,</b> <b>in</b> {{her book}} We Want to Believe contrasted the soul eater from [...] "The Gift" [...] to Leonard Betts, a [...] "Monster-of-the-Week" [...] {{character}} {{from the fourth}} season episode of the same name. In the episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the supposed death and regeneration of an emergency medical technician (EMT) named Leonard Betts, a mutant who subsists on and can detect cancer in others, as well as regenerate severed body parts. Donaldson reasons that Betts' condition, {{in which he is}} [...] "riddled with cancer" [...] but can [...] "see the sickness within people", is a metaphor for someone who [...] "has let sin or evil become the regular course of life". Although Betts can detect and consume the illness, his motives are derived from [...] "his own self appetite". Donaldson argues that the soul eater is the polar opposite of Betts because it takes an illness in order to help a person. This is in contrast to Betts, who takes an illness—and harms his victim in the process—in order to keep himself alive.|$|E

2500|$|Hume {{returned}} to Edinburgh in 1751.

This resource enabled him to continue historical research for The History of England. Hume's volume of Political Discourses, written in 1749 and published by Kincaid & <b>Donaldson</b> <b>in</b> 1752, was the only work he considered successful on first publication.|$|E
2500|$|Using [...] "engulfing" [...] methods {{similar to}} those in his proof of the Poincaré Conjecture for n > 6, Stallings proved that {{ordinary}} Euclidean n-dimensional space has a unique piecewise linear, hence also smooth, structure, if n is not equal to 4.
