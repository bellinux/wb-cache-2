5|$|In January 2004, the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) {{released}} {{their first}} prediction for tropical cyclone activity throughout the Northeast Pacific. Based on a Neutral El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), {{a total of}} 15 named storms, 6 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 3 major hurricanes was forecast. These values were slightly altered in May to 14 named storms, 7 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 2 major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> again in August to 13 named storms, 6 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 3 major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|CSU updated their {{forecast}} on June 1 {{to include}} 14 named storms, 6 <b>hurricanes</b> <b>and</b> 2 major hurricanes to include Tropical Storm Bonnie. It was again updated on July 1 to include 15 named storms, 6 <b>hurricanes</b> <b>and</b> 2 major hurricanes, to accommodate for tropical storms Colin and Danielle. On July 5, TSR released their fourth forecast for the season, slightly lowering the predicted numbers to 16 tropical storms, 8 <b>hurricanes</b> <b>and</b> 3 major hurricanes. On August 5, TSR released their final forecast for the season, lowering {{the numbers to}} 15 named storms and 7 hurricanes due to the influence that La Niña being less than anticipated previously. NOAA updated their forecast on August11, increasing the their predictions to 12–17 named storms, 5–8 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 2–4 major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day of the 2010 Atlantic season, Florida State University's Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (FSU COAPS) {{released}} their only predictions, forecasting 17 named storms, 10 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an ACE index of 156 units. The next day, CSU upped their forecast to 18 named storms, 10 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 5 major hurricanes. On June4, TSR followed suit, with 17.7 named storms, 9.5 hurricanes, 4.4 major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an ACE index of 182 units. The United Kingdom's Met Office (UKMET) released their only prediction for the season on June17, with the most likely number of tropical storms being 20 and the most likely value of the ACE index being 204 units. On June23, TWC/WSI once again upped their forecast, noting 20 named storms, 11 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 5 major hurricanes. TSR issued their boldest predictions on July6, with 19.1 named storms, 10.4 hurricanes, 4.8 major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an ACE index of 203 units.|$|E

5|$|Pre-season {{forecasts}} by the Colorado State University (CSU) {{called for}} a below average season, with 10 named storms, 4 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 2 major hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued its first outlook on May24, predicting a total of 9–15 named storms, 4–8 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 1–3 major hurricanes; both agencies noted {{the possibility of an}} El Niño, which limits tropical cyclone activity. Following two pre-season storms, the CSU updated their forecast to 13 named storms, 5 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 2 major hurricanes, while the NOAA upped their forecast numbers to 12–17 named storms, 5–8 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 2–3 major hurricanes on August9. Despite this, activity far surpassed the predictions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the season}} began, Dr. Gray {{announced}} he had revised his predictions slightly downwards on August6, citing mild El Niño conditions. His new forecast was thirteen named storms, seven <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> three reaching major hurricane intensity. On August10, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of above-to-near normal activity, {{but the same}} number of storms forecast. CSU issued another forecast on September3, indicating sixteen tropical storms, eight <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> five major hurricanes. The season ended up with sixteen tropical depressions, fifteen named storms, nine <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> six major hurricanes, which matched CSU's final prediction on October1.|$|E
5|$|As {{stated by}} NOAA and CSU, an average Atlantic {{hurricane}} season between 19812010 contains roughly 12tropical storms, 6hurricanes, 3major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index of 66103 units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, of below-average {{based on the}} cumulative ACE Index; however, the number of tropical storms, <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well.|$|E

5|$|Before {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that {{help determine the}} number of tropical storms, <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> major hurricanes within a particular year. According to NOAA, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1950 and 2005 contained 10.3 tropical storms, 6.2 hurricanes, 2.7 major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an ACE index of 66–103 units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index, but the number of tropical storms, <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> major hurricanes within a hurricane season are occasionally considered as well.|$|E
5|$|CSU {{issued a}} more {{detailed}} update on April7, upping their forecast to 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, 4 major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an ACE index of 150. More confidence in the weakening of El Niño (and thus lower vertical wind shear) and the continuation of anomalously warm sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean were cited. Two days later, TSR revised their forecast upward to 16.3 named storms, 8.5 hurricanes, 4 major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an ACE index of 159 units. In their April21 update, WSI predicted the most active year since the record-breaking 2005 season, with 16 named storms, 9 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 5 major hurricanes. Five days later, North Carolina State University (NCSU) released their only forecast for the season, with 15 to 18 named storms and 8 to 11 hurricanes. TSR largely maintained their forecast for their May25 release. The next day, TWC/WSI again raised their forecast to 18 named storms, 10 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 5 major hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), meanwhile, released their forecast prediction for the 2010 season on May27. The organization called for an active to extremely active year including 14 to 23 named storms, 8 to 14 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 3 to 7 major hurricanes, referencing {{a continuation of the}} active era that began in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{slightly}} less active June and July than originally anticipated, TWC/WSI downgraded their number of named storms from 20 to 19 on July21, but kept their June numbers of 11 <b>hurricanes</b> <b>and</b> 5 major hurricanes untouched. In their final seasonal prediction on August4, CSU left their June numbers the same, predicting 18 named storms, 10 hurricanes, 5 major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an ACE index of 185 units. That same day, TSR reduced their predictions for their final seasonal outlook, expecting 17.8 named storms, 9.7 hurricanes, 4.5 major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an ACE index of 183 units. On August5, NOAA announced the official development of La Niña {{in their last}} seasonal outlook. The organization lowered the upper bounds of their forecast compared to May due to less early season activity than expected, in all predicting 14 to 20 named storms, 8 to 12 <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> 4 to 6 major hurricanes. TWC/WSI issued two final forecasts on August25 and September22, both expecting 18 named storms and 10 hurricanes. The number of major hurricanes was increased from 5 to 6 in their September update, however.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} the season, several {{meteorological}} services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms, <b>hurricanes</b> <b>and</b> major hurricanes will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO), Coastal Carolina University (CCU), Colorado State University (CSU), and North Carolina State University (NCSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help {{determine the number of}} tropical storms, <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014–16 El Niño event. On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> two major hurricanes, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of between 66 and 103 units.|$|E
5|$|CSU {{released}} its first prediction on December5, 2003, which projected an above average season, with 13named storms, seven <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> three major hurricanes. This forecast was adjusted upward slightly on April2. On May17, {{prior to the}} start of the season, NOAA forecasters predicted a 50% probability of activity above the normal range, with twelve to fifteen tropical storms, six to eight of those becoming <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> two to four those hurricanes reaching major intensity. Dr. Gray released a prediction on May 28 that was similar, with 14named storms, eightreaching hurricane strength, and threebecoming major hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has 12.1 named storms, of which 6.4 reach hurricane strength, and 2.7 become major hurricanes. In December 1991, CSU issued its first forecast for the year and predicted that 1992 would see eight named storms, four <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> one major hurricane. CSU also issued a forecast in April, June and August, however no revisions were made to the numbers of named storms, <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> major hurricane predicted in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In June, {{predictions}} from CSU and TSR {{were similar}} to pre-season forecasts due to the a lack of an El Niño and warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean. However, by July and August, CSU and TSR all adjusted their forecasts downward because of predictions of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures and above-average wind shear. NOAA also decreased the amount of activity in its final outlook, despite predicting a wetter-than-average western Africa and above-average sea surface temperatures in its report. On June3, CSU issued its first mid-season prediction {{for the remainder of}} the year. In its report, the organization continued to predict well above-average activity, with eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, four major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an ACE index of 165 units. CSU stated that there was a 72% chance of at least one major hurricane impacting any stretch of the United States coastline; the chances of a major hurricane hitting the East Coast and Gulf Coast were 48% and 47%, respectively. The following day, Tropical Storm Risk issued its third forecast for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, calling for sixteen named storms, eight hurricanes, four major <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> an ACE of 134 units; this activity was predicted to be roughly 30% above the 1950–2012 long-term mean. TSR gave a 65% probability that the landfalling ACE index would be above-average. A month later, TSR lowered its numbers to 15named storms, seven <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> three major hurricanes. On August2, Colorado State University issued another update for the season, lowering its numbers slightly. However, the organization continued to state that there was an above-average probability of a United States and Caribbean major hurricane landfall. Finally, on August8, NOAA issued its second and final outlook for the season, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, six to nine <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> three to five major hurricanes; these numbers were down slightly from its May outlook.|$|E
5|$|In advance of, and during, each {{hurricane}} season, several {{forecasts of}} hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. These include forecasters from the United States NOAA's National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, Philip J. Klotzbach, William M. Gray and their associates at CSU, Tropical Storm Risk, and the United Kingdom's Met Office. The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that {{help determine the}} number of tropical storms, <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>and</b> major hurricanes within a particular year.
