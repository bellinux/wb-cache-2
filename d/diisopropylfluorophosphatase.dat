40|$|<b>Diisopropylfluorophosphatases</b> (DFP-ases) {{are capable}} of detoxifying {{chemical}} warfare agents like diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) by hydrolysis. The protein reported here was recombinantly expressed in E. coli. The X-ray crystal structure of this enzyme has been refined to a resolution of 0. 85 Angstrom and a crystallographic R value of 9. 4 %. Reversible flash-cooling improved both, mosaicity and resolution of the crystals considerably. The overall structure of this protein represents a six-bladed beta-propeller with two calcium ions bound in a central water-filled tunnel. 496 water, 2 glycerol, 2 MES-buffer molecules and 18 PEG fragments of different lengths could be refined in the solvent region. The 208 most reliable residues, without disorder or reduced occupancy in their side-chains, were finally refined without restraints. A subsequent full-matrix refinement cycle for the positional parameters yielded estimated standard deviations (esds) by matrix inversion. The herewith calculated bond lengths and bond-esds were used to obtain averaged bond lengths, which have been compared to the restraints used in preceding refinement cycles. [References: 20...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Phosphotriesterases (PTE) are enzymes {{capable of}} detoxifying organophosphate-based {{chemical}} warfare agents by hydrolysis. One subclass of these enzymes comprises {{the family of}} <b>diisopropylfluorophosphatases</b> (DFPases). The DFPase reported here was originally isolated from squid head ganglion of Loligo vulgaris and {{can be characterized as}} squid-type DFPase. It is capable of hydrolyzing the organophosphates diisopropylfluorophosphate, soman, sarin, tabun, and cyclosarin. Results: Crystals were grown of both the native and the selenomethionine-labeled enzyme. The X-ray crystal structure of the DFPase from Loligo vulgaris has been solved by MAD phasing and refined to a crystallographic R value of 17. 6 % at a final resolution of 1. 8 Å. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have structurally and functionally characterized essential residues in the active site of the enzyme. Conclusions: The crystal structure of the DFPase from Loligo vulgaris is the first example of a structural characterization of a squid-type DFPase and the second crystal structure of a PTE determined to date. Therefore, it may serve as a structural model for squid-type DFPases in general. The overall structure of this protein represents a six-fold β propeller with two calcium ions bound in a central water-filled tunnel. The consensus motif found in the blades of this β propeller has not yet been observed in other β propeller structures. Based on the results obtained from mutants of active-site residues, a mechanistic model for the DFP hydrolysis has been developed...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} a new phoX gene encoding the monomeric alkaline phosphatase from Pasteurella multocida X- 73. This gene was {{not found in the}} published genome sequence of Pasteurella multocida pm 70. Characterization of the recombinant PhoX of Pasteurella multocida X- 73 showed that it is a monomeric enzyme, activated by Ca 2 + and possibly secreted by the Tat pathway. These features distinguish phosphatases of the PhoX family from those of the PhoA family. All proteins of the PhoX family were found to contain a conserved motif that shares significant sequence homology with the calcium-binding site of a phosphotriesterase known as <b>diisopropylfluorophosphatase.</b> Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that D 527 of PhoX might be the ligand bound to the catalytic calcium. This is the first report on identification of homologous sequences between PhoX and the phosphotriesterase and on the potential calcium-binding site of PhoX...|$|E
40|$|Human serum paraoxonase (HuPON 1) is a calcium-dependent {{enzyme that}} hydrolyzes esters, {{including}} organophosphates and lactones, and exhibits anti-atherogenic properties. A few amino acids {{have been shown}} to be essential for the enzyme’s arylesterase and organophosphatase activities. Until very recently, a three-dimensional model was not available for HuPON 1, so functional roles have not been assigned to those residues. Based on sequence-structure alignment studies, we have folded the amino acid sequence of HuPON 1 onto the sixfold β-propeller structure of squid <b>diisopropylfluorophosphatase</b> (DFPase). We tested the validity of this homology model by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis. Consistent with predictions from the homology model, CD data indicated that the structural composition of purified HuPON 1 consists mainly of β-sheets. Mutants of HuPON 1 were assayed for enzymatic activity against phenyl acetate and paraoxon. Substitution of residues predicted to be important for substrate binding (L 69, H 134, F 222, and C 284), calcium ion coordination (D 54, N 168, N 224, and D 269), and catalytic mechanism of HuPON 1 (H 285) led to enzyme inactivation. Mutants F 222 Y and H 115 W exhibited substrate-binding selectivity towards phenyl acetate and paraoxon, respectively. The homology model presented here is very similar to the recently obtained PON 1 crystal structure, and has allowed identification of several residues within the enzyme active site...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAcetylcholinesterase is the {{physiological}} target for acute toxicity of nerve agents. Attempts to protect acetylcholinesterase from phosphylation by nerve agents, is currently achieved by reversible inhibitors that transiently mask the enzyme active site. This approach either protects only peripheral acetylcholinesterase or may cause side effects. Thus, an alternative strategy consists in scavenging nerve {{agents in the}} bloodstream before they can reach acetylcholinesterase. Pre- or post-exposure administration of bioscavengers, enzymes that neutralize and detoxify organophosphorus molecules, {{is one of the}} major developments of new medical counter-measures. These enzymes act either as stoichiometric or catalytic bioscavengers. Human butyrylcholinesterase is the leading stoichiometric bioscavenger. Current efforts are devoted to its mass production with care to pharmacokinetic properties of the final product for extended lifetime. Development of specific reactivators of phosphylated butyrylcholinesterase, or variants with spontaneous reactivation activity is also envisioned for rapid in situ regeneration of the scavenger. Human paraoxonase 1 is the leading catalytic bioscavenger under development. Research efforts focus on improving its catalytic efficiency toward the most toxic isomers of nerve agents, by means of directed evolution-based strategies. Human prolidase appears to be another promising human enzyme. Other non-human efficient enzymes like bacterial phosphotriesterases or squid <b>diisopropylfluorophosphatase</b> are also considered though their intrinsic immunogenic properties remain challenging for use in humans. Encapsulation, PEGylation and other modifications are possible solutions to address this problem as well as that of their limited lifetime. Finally, gene therapy for in situ generation and delivery of bioscavengers is for the far future, but its proof of concept has been established...|$|E
