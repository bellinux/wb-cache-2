Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may <b>have</b> <b>only</b> adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these come into contact with a rooting medium.|$|E

5|$|A few {{groups of}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes <b>have</b> <b>only</b> vestigial mitochondria or derived structures: the microsporidians, metamonads, and archamoebae. These groups appear {{as the most}} primitive eukaryotes on phylogenetic trees constructed using rRNA information, which once suggested that they appeared before the origin of mitochondria. However, this is now known to be an artifact of long-branch attraction—they are derived groups and retain genes or organelles derived from mitochondria (e.g., mitosomes and hydrogenosomes).|$|E

If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to <b>have</b> <b>only</b> one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
