5|$|Jimmie Åkesson of the Sweden Democrats, {{coming off}} a {{surprising}} electoral result himself, called the result <b>delightful</b> and that his party has such common themes with the True Finns as criticism of the EU and immigration.|$|E
5|$|Essentially a stylist, Kippax was {{in every}} sense a great batsman, for he could suit his game {{to the needs of}} the occasion. A {{beautiful}} driver to the off, he cut at times in <b>delightful</b> fashion, the slower wickets of England affecting his abilities in that direction in only the slightest degree.|$|E
5|$|He finds Banda <b>delightful,</b> with {{a smoking}} volcano {{and a fine}} view from the top. The nutmeg trees are {{beautiful}} but he regrets {{the ending of the}} Dutch monopoly in the nutmeg trade, which avoided the need to levy direct taxes. The only indigenous animals, he thinks, are bats, except possibly for its opossum species.|$|E
5|$|We all {{holed up}} in (producer) David Bianco's lovely studio, which {{was built in the}} '70s and hasn't changed much since then—and though it was the sticky, hot LA summer outside, inside, it was snowy, <b>delightful</b> Christmastime. We.. {{everything}} together around an invisible campfire; everyone picking up different instruments and playing them on a moment's notice. There was definitely some holiday magic in the air that week.|$|E
5|$|He {{was a most}} <b>delightful</b> man, {{a bizarre}} hidalgo with {{enormous}} moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style, and button boots which he used to rap my shins when I didn't change the pedalling enough.... I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, {{he was the only}} virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} {{generally}} very well received outside London, {{and especially in}} north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures {{we had to go}} through. Perhaps the most <b>delightful</b> part of our experiences was tasted not so much on the field of play as off it".|$|E
5|$|Jardine was {{selected}} to tour Australia with the M.C.C. team in 1928–29 {{as part of a}} very strong batting side, playing in all five Test matches and scoring 341 runs at an average of 42.62. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,168 runs (average 64.88). He was also on the five-man selection committee for the tour, which chose teams to play in specific games but had not chosen the touring party. Wisden judged that he had been as great a success as had been expected and impressed everyone with the strength of his defensive shots and his play on the back foot. It said that he played some <b>delightful</b> innings. Percy Fender, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Jardine never had the chance to play a normal innings in the Test, having to provide the stability to the batting, and often seeming to come out to bat in a crisis.|$|E
5|$|There are {{grotesque}} {{figures of}} vetalas (ghosts) on the pilasters of jaga mohan {{and on the}} faces of vimana of the temple. The figures of nagas (snake-man) and their female counterparts nagins and other females show many graceful but chaste poses. Pilgrimage is the theme of many of the scenes on the vimana. The other notable descriptive representation on the vimana is the hunting scene above the central niche on the south side, where stags are depicted running away from a hunter. On the outermost frame around the latticed window of the jaganamohana, <b>delightful</b> scenes of monkeys playing all manners of pranks are depicted. The vimana of the temple is a triratha with a distant semblance of a Pancharatha as evident from the projecting niches flanking the central projection. The bada of the vimana abruptly starts from the talapatna or pavement which consists of three elements instead of the usual five and encloses a parallelepiped instead of the usual cubic sanctum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Delightful</b> Dolly is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows Marie Allen, an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather, who sees a large doll {{in the window of}} the shop. At night, she sneaks out to visit the shop with the doll, but finds it gone. She sneaks into the shop and ends up hiding in the box, to prevent from being discovered by the store clerk. She is taken to the home of the rich little girl, Daisy. After taking the doll's clothes, Marie hides in the box as Daisy approaches. When Daisy opens the box, Marie acts like a doll. When Daisy takes a break for food, Marie secretly takes the food and drink much to Daisy's bewilderment. Marie's grandfather arrives at the home and explains the situation and Marie receives the doll from the family. Little is known about the production or cast of the film, but Marie Eline played the role of Marie. The film was released on October 14, 1910 and was met with some praise in trade publications. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as <b>delightful</b> as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates {{that when}} Kali (Satyavati) was {{ferrying}} the rishi (sage) Parashara {{across the river}} Yamuna, the sage wanted Kali to satisfy his lust and held her right hand. She tried to dissuade Parashara, saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish. She finally gave in, realizing the desperation and persistence of the sage and fearing {{that if she did}} not heed to his request, he might topple the boat midstream. Kali agreed, and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be <b>delightful</b> to them both. At these words, Matsyagandha was transformed (by the powers of the sage) into Yojanagandha ("she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana"). She now smelled of musk, and so was called Kasturi-gandhi ("musk-fragrant"). When Parashara, tormented with desire, approached her again she insisted that the act was not appropriate in broad daylight, as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank; they should wait till night. The sage, with his powers, shrouded the entire area in fog. Before Parashara could enjoy her, Satyavati again interrupted him to say that he would enjoy her and depart, robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society. The sage then blessed her with virgo intacta. She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, the sage bathed in the river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the Arizona Historical Foundation {{published}} the daily journal Goldwater had maintained on the Grand Canyon journey, including his photographs, in a 209-page volume titled <b>Delightful</b> Journey.|$|E
25|$|Parsi New Year-The Colourful {{dances and}} <b>delightful</b> skits are {{presented}} by the students to celebrate Parsi New Year. Customs, traditions {{and values of the}} Parsis are highlighted in the programmes.|$|E
25|$|The dancers, {{to please}} their lovers the more, dropped {{their clothes and}} danced totally naked the nicest entrées and ballets; one of the princes {{directed}} the <b>delightful</b> music, and only the lovers were allowed to watch the performances.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to newspaper articles {{on a wide}} variety of topics, and a novel, she published <b>Delightful</b> Dalmatia (1914), an account of traveling through Dalmatia prior to World War I. She was elected to the League of American Pen Women in 1915.|$|E
25|$|In {{the valleys}} and {{lowlands}} the vegetation is dense, {{but the general}} appearance of the plateaus is of a comparatively bare country with trees and bushes thinly scattered over it. The glens and ravines on the hillside are often thickly wooded, and offer a <b>delightful</b> contrast to the open downs.|$|E
25|$|Ganga is {{described}} as the melodious, the fortunate, the cow that gives much milk, the eternally pure, the <b>delightful,</b> the body that is full of fish, affords delight to the eye and leaps over mountains in sport, the bedding that bestows water and happiness, and the friend or benefactor of all that lives.|$|E
25|$|The canal {{follows a}} <b>delightful</b> rural route through {{farmland}} across Cheshire, {{with a short}} urban section near the junction at Middlewich. Many of the structures are original, and consequently, {{most of them are}} grade II listed. There is no commercial traffic on the waterway, but transition to the leisure age has resulted in two marinas being constructed to provide moorings for pleasure craft.|$|E
25|$|The garbhagriha has a pancharatha {{plan that}} rests on plinth moldings {{that are similar}} to the Surya Temple at Tezpur. On top of the plinths are dados from a later period which are of the Khajuraho or the Central Indian type, {{consisting}} of sunken panels alternating with pilasters. The panels have <b>delightful</b> sculptured Ganesha and other Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} tomb {{in the church}} is that of Sir Richard Lyster (c.1480–1554). Lyster was Chief Baron and later Lord Chief Justice of the Common pleas. His tomb was erected in 1567. The tomb is {{situated}} in the north-east corner {{of the church and}} is a <b>delightful</b> early-Elizabethan example of the use of fluted columns and other classical details.|$|E
25|$|His {{historical}} essays, {{notably the}} famous anonymous eulogy on Lennart Torstensson crowned by the Swedish Academy, which he established in 1786, {{are full of}} feeling and exquisite in style, and his letters to his friends are <b>delightful</b> to read. Every branch of literature and the arts interested him, every poet and artist of his day found in him a liberal and sympathetic protector.|$|E
25|$|Lesage lived beyond 80 {{years of}} age, but was afflicted with {{deafness}} {{and had to}} use an ear trumpet. However, his conversation was so <b>delightful</b> that when he ventured {{into the world and}} frequented his favourite coffee house in Rue St. Jacques in Paris, guests would gather around him, climbing onto tables and chairs, to hear his famous words of wit and wisdom.|$|E
25|$|For decades, he contributed {{photographs}} {{of his home}} state to Arizona Highways and was {{best known for his}} Western landscapes and pictures of native Americans in the United States. Three books with his photographs are People and Places, from 1967; Barry Goldwater and the Southwest, from 1976; and <b>Delightful</b> Journey, first published in 1940 and reprinted in 1970. Ansel Adams wrote a foreword to the 1976 book.|$|E
25|$|With {{just four}} minutes left, Coppell took a free-kick which was {{diverted}} into the danger zone by Joe Jordan and swung home by defender Gordon McQueen. Taking heart from this, Manchester United stormed forward {{in search of}} an equaliser and when Arsenal were unable to clear the ball properly, Coppell lifted a <b>delightful</b> chipped pass over the defence for Sammy McIlroy to latch on to and beat two Arsenal players before stroking the ball home.|$|E
25|$|The family {{enjoyed the}} spring weather and liked Dr Gully, and it {{developed}} into a <b>delightful</b> holiday in the festive atmosphere around the spa. His stomach trouble was diagnosed as nervous in origin, and he was soon free of sickness and walking sevenmiles (11km) a day. Despite his suspicions of quackery, the cure worked, and after staying 16 weeks they returned home, arriving on 30 June with Darwin eager to resume work on his barnacles.|$|E
25|$|He {{served as}} Principal Conductor of the Royal Bellet from 1959 from 1972. He {{arranged}} La fille mal gardée (original music by Ferdinand Hérold and others), to choreography by Frederick Ashton, for the Royal Ballet in 1960. Lanchbery's <b>delightful</b> re-working also included some Donizetti {{and much of}} his own invention. This work includes the famous Clog Dance used for many years as a theme tune for Home This Afternoon on BBC radio.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 2009, against West Ham, Babel {{came off}} the bench for Dirk Kuyt. At this stage the score was 2–2. Babel picked up the ball and did well to beat the full-back and sent in a <b>delightful</b> cross for Fernando Torres to head home the winner. Babel, who has been criticized {{in the past for}} his work rate and attitude, earned praise for his efforts in the West Ham game.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Paul disliked {{everything}} that was dear {{to his mother and}} Quarenghi's architecture obviously fell into this category. After the emperor took the Maltese knights under his protection, Quarenghi also joined the Order and served as its official architect until 1800. His commissions became less frequent, as the monotonous rhythm of solemn collonnades and the laconic clarity of symmetrical compositions appeared boring to those courtiers who had found Quarenghi's designs so <b>delightful</b> a decade earlier.|$|E
25|$|Her Recollections of a Literary Life (1852) is {{a series}} of causeries about her {{favourite}} books. Her talk was said by her friends, Elizabeth Browning and Hengist Horne, to have been even more amusing than her books, and five volumes of her Life and Letters, published in 1870 and 1872, show her to have been a <b>delightful</b> letter-writer. The many collections available of her letters provide especially useful commentary and criticism of her Romantic and Victorian literary contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|Her home in Boston, {{after her}} marriage, was a <b>delightful</b> one. Her house was soon a centre of attraction; and, {{surrounded}} by friends, she exercised there a gracious hospitality, and met {{the men and}} women who made the Boston of that epoch famous. Here was born her daughter, Florence, who later married William Sehaefer, of South Carolina. Here her husband died, and here she has remained through the days of her widowhood till the house become historic.|$|E
25|$|Ziegler's {{presence}} allows Kubrick {{to change}} {{the mechanics of the}} story in a few ways. In the film, Bill first meets his piano-playing friend at Ziegler's party, and then while wandering around town, seeks him out at the Sonata Café. In the novella, the café encounter with Nightingale is a <b>delightful</b> coincidence. Similarly, the dead woman whom Bill suspects of being the woman at the party who saved him is a baroness that he was acquainted with earlier, not a hooker at Ziegler's party.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} match {{of the tournament}} against Auckland City FC of New Zealand on 10 Dec 2006, Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly to secure and book a semi-final date with Internacional of Brazil. Al-Ahly won 2–0 easily, and Aboutrika capped a fine display by {{stroking}} a superbly flighted free-kick over the wall scoring the second goal for his team. As well as netting with his <b>delightful</b> right-foot effort, Aboutrika {{was at the heart}} of most his side's best moves, dictating the rhythm with his skill and vision.|$|E
25|$|The accompaniments...are <b>delightful</b> to hear, and {{especially}} does {{the treatment of}} the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly.... We place the songs and choruses in The Yeomen of the Guard before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage. (Allen, p. 312).|$|E
25|$|He made {{no attempt}} to direct this picture. He just sat in his {{director}}'s chair like a dead man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really <b>delightful.</b>|$|E
25|$|I can’t {{tell you}} how pleased I was to see this place again. In a moment one goes over the years; every shrub, every turn, every peep of the house has a little history in it. The weather is <b>delightful</b> and the place looks beautiful. The trees are all so grown and there a {{thousand}} pretty sheltered spots, which near the sea in this season is very pleasant. The birds sing, the flowers blow, and make me for moments forget the world and all the villainy and tyranny going on in it.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} that Ernest will win the {{election}} which is to follow the coup and become Grand Duke, which troubles Julia Jellicoe, a famous English comedian. As leading lady of the company, she is bound by contract to play the leading female role in any production. If Ernest, the manager, becomes the Grand Duke, she reasons that {{she will have to}} be the Grand Duchess. She says that this is a repugnant prospect to her (though it is a <b>delightful</b> one to Ernest), but that she will play the part in a professional manner.|$|E
