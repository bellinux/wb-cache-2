It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of [...] "Deus Ex Machina", which introduced the Nigerian airplane, a corpse dressed as a priest with a gun, and Virgin Mary statues filled with heroin, the Lost writers decided {{that the story of}} the Beechcraft would coincide with one of the characters' flashbacks. They decided to use one of the tail section characters to be introduced in season 2, [...] "essentially a bad guy who was forced to disguise himself as a priest, and <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> come about, and could he now be presenting himself as a priest". Since Eko and Locke are both spiritual leaders on the island - but with Locke having a [...] "paganistic, ritualistic appreciation" [...] for the island's powers and Eko, [...] "pure religious faith" [...] - writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof decided to write in this episode parallels with [...] "Deus Ex Machina", where Locke and Boone find the Beechcraft. The biggest similarity is Charlie unwillingly become Eko's [...] "acolyte", just like Boone was being Locke's follower in their expedition to the airplane.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> help us?" [...] demanded Peter. [...] "Even {{if the boy}} were so--so headstrong, so unfilial as to defy his father, who {{has worked}} for him all these years, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> remove the {{obstacle}} of Mr. Appleyard's refusal?" ...|$|E
5|$|<b>How</b> great <b>would</b> <b>that</b> be? A World Series here, {{us against}} the Yankees?… We've proved {{we can put}} on a pretty good show.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but <b>how</b> long <b>would</b> <b>that</b> take him?" [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Chinnery. [...] "If the man {{had been}} run over I could have understood it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose he was lame {{and it was}} sloshy, {{and he made a}} {{call and}} came back. <b>How</b> long <b>would</b> <b>that</b> take?" [...] asked Jill impatiently.|$|R
6000|$|... "And make a scandal?" [...] inquired Michael. [...] "'The Chelsea Mystery; alleged {{innocence of}} Pitman'? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> {{do at the}} Seminary?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> {{change the}} question? Or do you admit that an American {{can be no}} American, unless blind to the faults of the country, however great?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw a keg of soft-soap in the shed. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> go {{with the}} pickles?" [...] {{suggested}} Bob, who felt equal to the biggest and acidest cucumber ever grown.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Sixpence a {{month from}} you, a {{shilling}} perhaps from Gill, <b>how</b> long <b>would</b> <b>that</b> take? No, my dear girls, I am {{going to put you}} to a heavy trial.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if I {{were to say}} yes, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> help him?" [...] {{she cried}} wildly. [...] "He is {{condemned}} by your court-martial--you would only deceive me and murder him after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, you’d better stay then," [...] {{said the}} mate, wearily, [...] "unless {{we take a}} couple of the hands with us. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> suit you? They can’t sail with half a crew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's pleasant," [...] said Brother John, [...] "but supposing that we {{kill the}} god <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> help us or you {{to escape from}} the Motombo and these murdering people of yours? Surely they would slay us for the sacrilege." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was on the}} poop, {{just like}} I am now, and Mr. Harding {{had a lot of}} those miserable sick men putting gaskets on the main-lower-topsail. <b>How</b> far <b>would</b> <b>that</b> be above the deck, Mr. Pike?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Two-fifty, to be precise. My sister {{took your}} clothes away to mend. Now, it's {{possible}} that I might {{manage to get}} you into the office of some lumber or general trading company {{in one of the}} cities. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> do?" ...|$|E
60|$|Suppose {{he were to}} {{communicate}} to Farfrae {{the fact that his}} betrothed was not the child of Michael Henchard at all--legally, nobody's child; <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> correct and leading townsman receive the information?

6000|$|... "Ah! <b>how</b> {{infinitely}} <b>would</b> <b>that</b> idea increase man's responsibility," [...] {{said the}} old palmer, [...] "if, besides man and beast, we should {{find it necessary to}} believe that there is also another set of beings dependent for their happiness on our doing, or leaving undone, what might have effect on them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|All {{of us are}} led, {{like that}} ancient people Israel, like all humanity, by a way we know not, and a path we do not understand.

6000|$|Cotton {{tried to}} smile, though his fingers twitched. [...] "Miss Haldane asked me; {{and it would}} be no use.

6000|$|Little did Mr. Dunboyne {{know what}} changes {{had taken place}} since he and his son had last met, and what hope might yet present itself of {{brighter}} days for poor Euneece!

6000|$|... "Thorny used to 'confound!' every thing, so I {{proposed}} {{that he should}} whistle instead; and now he sometimes pipes up so suddenly and shrilly that it makes me jump. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> do, instead of swearing?" [...] proposed Miss Celia, not the least surprised at the habit of profanity, which the boy could hardly help learning among his former associates.|$|E

60|$|Merton {{passed a}} miserable week of {{suspense}} and perplexity of mind. Never {{had he been}} so imprudent; he felt sure of that, {{and it was the}} only thing of which he did feel sure.
