5|$|In the 1980s, public {{attention}} in the United States was drawn to prosperity theology through the influence of prominent televangelists such as Jim Bakker. Bakker's influence waned, however, after he was implicated in a high-profile scandal.

5|$|In {{the middle}} of this period, through a process of conquest, {{consolidation}} and treaty, the boundaries of Scotland were gradually extended from a small area under direct control of the kings of Alba in the east, to almost its modern borders. For most of the Medieval era the monarchy and court was itinerant, with Scone and Dunfermline acting as important centres and later Roxburgh, Stirling and Perth, before Edinburgh <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> political capital in the fourteenth century. Largely as a result of Viking raids from about 800, Iona declined as a religious centre. Despite royal attempts to establish a new religious centre at Dunkeld, it was St. Andrews on the east coast, close to the heartland of Pictish settlement, that <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> most important religious focus of the kingdom.|$|E

The contested lands were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union {{after the war ended}} in 1921, and the Byelorussian SSR became {{a founding member of the}} Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus remained part of Poland.|$|E
5|$|ARPA {{responded by}} forming Project Defender, {{initially}} considering {{a wide variety}} of far-out concepts like particle beam weapons, lasers and huge fleets of space-borne interceptor missiles, the latter known as Project BAMBI. In May 1958, York also began working with Lincoln Labs, MIT's radar research lab, to begin researching ways to distinguish warheads from decoys by radar or other means. This project <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Range Electromagnetic Signature Studies, or Project PRESS.|$|E

A joint British and Egyptian force recaptured Sudan in 1898. At first, the British severely restricted Abd al-Rahman's movement and activity.

5|$|Adams did {{not speak}} French, the {{international}} language of diplomacy at the time. He therefore assumed a less visible role, but <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> commission's chief administrator, imposing order and methods lacking in his delegation's finances and record-keeping affairs. His first stay in Europe, between April 1, 1778, and June 17, 1779, was otherwise unremarkable, and {{he returned to his}} home in Braintree in early August 1779. Back home, Adams became one of the founders and charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E

While Allen returned quickly from the injury, he was replaced by Walcott as starter and {{was moved to the}} reserve list for a short time. He was reactivated after Walcott was injured with turf toe, but Remi Trudel was started at safety in place of Allen.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the situation in Albania became unstable, and political chaos <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> country was split {{into a number of}} regional governments. As a consequence of the anarchy in central and northern Albania, sporadic armed conflicts continued to occur in spite of the Protocol of Corfu's ratification, and on September 3 Prince Wilhelm departed the country. In the following days, an Epirote unit launched an attack on the Albanian garrison in Berat without approval from the provisional government, managing to capture its citadel for several days, while Albanian troops loyal to Essad Pasha initiated small-scale armed operations.|$|E

5|$|D'Eyncourt {{probably}} avoided proposing any {{design with}} 16-inch guns {{when he saw}} the political situation. In meetings with Leão, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong as that of the Minas Geraes class, but a design with no less than fourteen 12-inch guns <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh had <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{capital in}} the fifteenth century.

After James VI left for London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, it continued to be the centre of government. Even after the Acts of Union in 1707 removed the parliament, it retained the exchequer and law courts.|$|E

5|$|High {{mortality}} {{rates have been}} recorded in the Serengeti.

Lions <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E
