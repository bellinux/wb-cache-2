5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. <b>Her</b> <b>cigarette</b> falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, in 1982, while filming The Thorn Birds, the inhalation of special-effects smoke {{on the set}} {{may have}} caused her to contract bronchitis, which was compounded by <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> habit; she was a smoker {{from the age of}} nine until four years before her death.|$|E
500|$|Julia Vera {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Lana Chee, the Hopi woman whose mind was {{switched}} with a young air force pilot. In order to age her, Vera wore special make-up and facial appliances. Special contact lenses were also crafted to give her eyes a clouded look. [...] It took five takes for her to flick <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> butt into Mulder's lap because the lenses obstructed her vision.|$|E
5000|$|Chris busted Rachel's lies when Harry discovers <b>her</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and smokes them.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is {{your view}} of the subject, Count?" [...] asked Madame Fosco, calmly {{proceeding}} with <b>her</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> and not taking the least notice of me.|$|R
60|$|The Haggerty Woman {{need not}} say a word. You {{have only to}} look at her to know that <b>her</b> <b>cigarettes</b> are not gold-tipped. She tries to brazen it out, which is so often a mistake.|$|R
500|$|She {{just sort}} of sits there with <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> and her hair, and she would pull stuff— these very {{disparate}} elements— and put them together into this ensemble, and you'd go, [...] "Come on, Pat, you can't wear that with that." [...] She'd say, [...] "Eh, just try it on." [...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, but it works on so many different levels— and it allows you to figure out who the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You look at it and you go, [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E
500|$|Becky {{became the}} 50th barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn in June 2008. Kelly opined that the character's ex-con {{personality}} {{would give her}} an advantage behind the bar, explaining: [...] "The previous producer, Steve Frost, loved {{the idea of a}} barmaid who could lose her temper and throw a punch. Becky's an ex-con so she can fight dirty like nobody else." [...] The character's chain smoking tendencies often play out onscreen when she is experiencing stress, something which drew off-screen criticism for her disregard of littering the streets with <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> butts. ITV publicity has described Becky as having many different levels to her persona, stating that she loves drinking cider, and that she isn't bothered by how she looks—though when she dresses up she [...] "dresses to the nines" [...] with big earrings, gold rings, logo belts and hair pieces. She dislikes anyone ordering her about, as she cannot handle being told what to do.|$|E
500|$|The storyline which {{featured}} the character's old nemesis DC Hooch drew criticism of Becky's excessive littering of <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> butts. Environmental agencies 'Keep Britain Tidy' and 'CleanupUK' commented: [...] "It is disappointing that Coronation Street chooses to allow {{one of its}} characters to throw a butt {{on the floor and}} suggest that it is okay to treat our streets like a giant ashtray. We understand the writers are concerned with realism but Becky is a role model to many viewers. We all have a responsibility to keep our local area clean and we would hope that producers of programmes such as Coronation Street would support our call to encourage the public to keep our country tidy." [...] A spokesperson for the show defended Becky's actions, stating they were portraying the character's high levels of stress realistically. Inside Soap readers voted in a poll to find out which character would be missed the most after they depart. Becky won with sixty percent of the vote, whilst up against Eve Jenson (Emmerdale) and Ronnie Mitchell (EastEnders). Julie Richardson writing for Orange U.K. said she [...] "loved a good TV scrap" [...] and the serial had [...] "a corker" [...] with Becky and Kylie's fight which took place in 2011. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror praised Becky's feud with Tracy, explaining it was a [...] "perfectly poised, barbed battle". Though he said it was ruined by Kylie's return.|$|E
5000|$|Edell’s initial case {{focused on}} the factor of the cause of Cipollone’s addiction: the {{nicotine}} found in <b>her</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> In the initial presentation of the facts, Edell brought forth a series of claims. He planned to prove that: ...|$|R
25|$|In June 2008, four teens {{allegedly}} {{obsessed with}} Grand Theft Auto IV {{went on a}} crime spree after being in New Hyde Park, New York. They first robbed a man, knocking out his teeth and then they stopped a woman driving a black BMW and stole her car and <b>her</b> <b>cigarettes.</b>|$|R
60|$|To this sally {{she merely}} laughed, and pressed out <b>her</b> half-smoked <b>cigarette.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Hawtrey {{spent most}} of his life living with his mother, who {{suffered}} senile dementia in later years. Another anecdote recounted by Williams describes how during the filming of Carry On Teacher Joan Sims cried out to Hawtrey that his mother's handbag had caught fire after <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> ash fell into it. Without batting an eyelid, Hawtrey poured a cup of tea into the bag to put out the flames, snapped the handbag shut and continued with his story. Williams also recounted his gathering up of the sandwiches left over from a buffet for the Carry On cast. Williams was envious of Hawtrey's easier acceptance of his sexuality: [...] "He can sit in a bar and pick up sailors and have a wonderful time. I couldn't do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The footage {{shows that}} Encinia {{initially}} wrote a routine traffic violation warning for Bland. After {{he returns to}} her car and speaks briefly to her again, he asks her to put out <b>her</b> <b>cigarette.</b> She responds, [...] "Why do I have {{to put out a}} cigarette when I'm in my own car?" [...] Encinia orders her to [...] "get out of the car", and, when she repeatedly refuses to exit, he tells her she is under arrest. Bland repeatedly asks why she is under arrest, and Encinia responds, [...] "I am giving you a lawful order." [...] She refuses to leave her car, stating she is not under arrest as she is unaware of the reason and not obliged to. Encinia then opens her car door and tells her more than a dozen times {{to get out of the}} car before [...] he tries to pull her out. After struggling, he draws his Taser and points it at Bland, shouting [...] "I will light you up! Get out! Now!", at which point she exits her vehicle.|$|E
60|$|Robert went {{round with}} the matches. Julia sucked <b>her</b> <b>cigarette.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rose forms a {{friendship}} with Kid Devil, using his flame breath to light <b>her</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> When Kid Devil is injured during a mission, Rose defends him, and on multiple occasions threatens those she deemed a threat to him. She later admits to Kid Devil that she is afraid of being kicked out, should the old members return to the team.|$|R
50|$|At home, Lau scolded Chung {{telling her}} that she almost foiled his plan and to stop using drugs while Chung blamed him for {{throwing}} <b>her</b> <b>cigarettes</b> away. At night, Chung cried and told Lau {{that it was not}} easy to quit drugs with no support. Lau then promised Chung that after avenging Lee, he would take her to a quiet place in Lantau Island and help her quit it.|$|R
60|$|A servant {{brought the}} coffee and went out again. Her father lighted a cigar and handed <b>her</b> the <b>cigarettes.</b>|$|R
60|$|BEATRICE. [Letting <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> fall, {{and putting}} her foot on it] No.|$|E
60|$|She threw <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{into the}} grate and {{stood looking at}} him.|$|E
60|$|Manfredi {{looked at}} his wife. She flicked the ash off <b>her</b> <b>cigarette.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{leaned over}} her again, struck a match with {{trembling}} fingers and gave <b>her</b> the <b>cigarette.</b> She {{smiled at him}} very faintly.|$|R
60|$|He offered <b>her</b> the <b>cigarette</b> {{from his}} lips. She was surprised, and {{exceedingly}} excited by his tender tone. She took the cigarette.|$|R
50|$|Chung, who was {{addicted}} to drugs, took a cocaine cigarette before leaving the house. Lau then threw <b>her</b> <b>cigarettes</b> down the toilet before leaving with her and encountered a traffic jam. As a result, they ran and {{made it to the}} store just on time. When Chung's addiction came while at the store, Lo Mo quickly got some methadone for her before she proceeded to leave with Lo Mo's father in-law and Chiu arrived right after.|$|R
60|$|She crushed <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> nervously in her fingers, {{threw it}} away, and lit another.|$|E
60|$|She {{flicked the}} ash from <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> and checked {{him with a}} little gesture.|$|E
60|$|She threw <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{away and}} looked {{at him for a moment}} without speaking.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm hardly in {{training}} yet," [...] he remarked. His legs had gone leaden. [...] "I don't {{feel as though}} I'd had a mouthful of breakfast." [...] Presently he slapped his side pocket and produced therefrom a brand-new cigarette case and a packet of Vansittart's Red <b>Herring</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> He filled the case. Then his eye fell with a sudden approval on the ornamental chequering of his new stockings. The expression in his eyes faded slowly to abstract meditation.|$|R
60|$|He {{made not}} the {{slightest}} movement, but sat with his hands dropped between his knees, watching <b>her,</b> the <b>cigarette</b> wavering up its blue thread of smoke.|$|R
60|$|FITZSIMMONS. [Who, all the time, {{watching}} her transformation, {{has been growing}} bashful, now handing <b>her</b> the <b>cigarette</b> case.] Here's the cigarette case. You may k-k-keep it.|$|R
60|$|She arose {{at once to}} {{her feet}} and threw the remains of <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> into the grate.|$|E
60|$|She threw <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{into the}} grate, swung round toward him, and looked {{steadily}} into his face.|$|E
60|$|The {{professor}} {{buried his}} face in his hands. Elizabeth threw <b>her</b> <b>cigarette</b> away with an impatient gesture.|$|E
60|$|At the top, {{from the}} cage, {{he looked down}} over the {{clustering}} red roofs {{of the town and}} the tower of the church, and then going to the southern side sat down and lit a Red <b>Herring</b> <b>cigarette,</b> and stared away south over the old bramble-bearing, fern-beset ruin, at the waves of blue upland that rose, one behind another, across the Weald, to the lazy altitudes of Hindhead and Butser. His pale grey eyes were full of complacency and pleasurable anticipation. Tomorrow he would go riding across that wide valley.|$|R
60|$|I sat quite still. I {{felt that}} Eve's eyes were {{watching}} me. I set my teeth for a moment; and I turned toward <b>her,</b> my <b>cigarette</b> case in my hand.|$|R
60|$|They {{finished}} dinner presently. Fenn looked {{with admiration}} at the gold, coroneted case from which Catherine helped herself {{to one of}} <b>her</b> tiny <b>cigarettes.</b> He himself lit an American cigarette.|$|R
