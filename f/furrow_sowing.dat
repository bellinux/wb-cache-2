40|$|Water {{repellent}} soils have thin {{layers of}} hydrophobic organic matter on {{the surfaces of}} soil particles. The hydrophobic organic matter makes these soils difficult to wet in opening rains after dry periods. This can cause losses of crop and pasture production and encourage land degradation by wind and water erosion. Wetting patterns in water repellent soils are irregular and incomplete, and no successful model of heat and water movement in water repellent soils has been reported. <b>Furrow</b> <b>sowing</b> improves crop production on water repellent sandy soils. Seeding machinery forms ridges and furrows. Rain is easily shed from dry ridges and runoff accumulates in the furrow (water harvesting). Ponded water infiltrates easily into the soil around the seed. The water movement in furrow-sawn water repellent sandy soils is more regular. This regularity {{makes it possible to}} develop a model. A numerical model of heat and water movement in furrow-sown water repellent sand was developed and validated to help optimize the design of <b>furrow</b> <b>sowing.</b> The model used aerodynamic resistance, soil surface moisture and temperature, and surface evaporative resistance to estimate evaporation from each surface element. Wind speed and radiation was varied by calculation, according to the direction of the Sun or wind to the ridge direction and height. Movement of water and heat in the soil was determined by the initial conditions, boundary conditions, and coupled functions for heat and water movement, as used in many other models. Water repellency effects on drying were included by including the appropriate moisture and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity characteristics. Application of the finite element method to a two-dimensional cross section of a ridge and furrow system allows water to be excluded from a soil region beneath a ridge. Field experiments were used to estimate surface evaporative resistance characteristics and to validate the model. The model has been successfully used to suggest optimized designs for ridge and furrow systems to minimize high soil temperatures and evaporation in Western Australia...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiment}} on canola {{was conducted in}} saline field at Agricultural Research Institute (ARI) Tarnab during 1997 - 98. The field was silty clay having 0. 69 percent organic matter and was alkaline (pH, 8. 84) in reaction. SAR was 2. 23 and lime content was 20. 25 %. Canola was sown using four different sowing techniques included drill, broadcast, furrow and ridge with 4 replication in random arrangement. The results showed that highest grain yield and yield components were recorded when seed were grown with ridge sowing. Grain yield in ridge sowing was higher by 45, 31 and 28 % than broadcast, drill and <b>furrow</b> <b>sowing</b> method respectively. The highest grain yield (1119 kg ha - 1) {{may be associated with}} less saline environment in ridges as irrigation next to the seed row caused movement of salts away from the seeds and into the ridges. This allowed the seed to germinate and establish in less saline conditions thereby increasing yield. The lowest grain yield (618 kg ha - 1) of canola produced with broadcast sowing may be associated with higher salt content in soil solution due to evapotranspiration...|$|E
40|$|Water {{deficits and}} unusually warm soil {{temperatures}} can adversely affect conventional ridge sown systems. Increasingly serious water and temperature {{issues associated with}} global climate change may be problematic in the future, particularly in semiarid regions. This study explored the soil water and crop yield benefits of switching the sowing location of corn from ridges to furrows. Experiments were conducted over three years. Corn was grown in shallow furrow (SF) and deep <b>furrow</b> (DF) <b>sown</b> treatments until the V 8 stage (eight visible leaf collars). New ridges were then built over the existing furrows. Grain yield {{was found to be}} higher in the SF and DF sown treatments than in a conventional ridge sown treatment (CR), especially in drought years. Switching sowing position from ridge to furrow could increase corn yield, directly, by improving soil moisture early in the growing season and, indirectly, by stimulating the growth of resource-capturing organs (e. g., leaves and roots). This simple and efficient approach to crop production in semiarid climates may be practical for the management of numerous agricultural systems, particularly those that are resource-limited, with greater vulnerability to the effects of global climate change.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effects of subsoiling, compaction on <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow</b> and seed treatments with insecticides on the grain yield of upland rice cultivated under no-tillage. Two experiments were carried out, one in an area with and the other in an area without subsoiling, in which five seed treatments combined with five compaction pressures on the <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow</b> were compared in a randomized block design, in a factorial scheme, with three replicates. The seed treatments were: T 0 - without treatment, T 1 - imidacloprid + thiodicarb, T 2 - thiamethoxam, T 3 - carbofuran, and T 4 - fipronil + pyraclostrobin + thiophanate methyl. The compaction pressures were: 25, 42, 126, 268 and 366 kPa. Subsoiling positively affected rice yield in the presence of higher compaction pressures on the <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow.</b> Seed treatment was effective at increasing rice grain yield only at the lowest compaction pressures.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{salinity}} stress and sowing method on yield, yield component and oil percentage in two spring safflower a field experiment was conducted at Research Station of College of Agriculture, Shiraz University. The experimental design was a split split plot based on Randomized Complete Block with three replications. Treatment were two cultivars (Goldasht and Isfahan 14) as main plot and four salinity levels (. 4, 5. 9, 7. 3 and 9. 1 dS m- 1) as sub plot and two sowing method (furrow and ridges) as sub-sub plot. Results showed that with increasing salinity seed yield and its component (capitula number per plant, seed number per capitula, capitula weight per plant and 1000 -seed weight) were significantly decreased. The highest seed yield (2265. 43 Kg ha- 1) obtained at. 4 dS m- 1 level and the lowest seed yield (1559. 19 Kg ha- 1) achieved at 9. 1 dSm- 1 salinity level. The cultivar Isfahan 14 as compared with Goldasht cultivar was found more salt tolerant and in all of levels of salinity has higher seed yield. With increasing salinity, oil percentage of two cultivars decreased but this reduction in Isfahan 14 by (22. 7 percent) lower than Goldasht cultivar. Seed yield in <b>furrow</b> <b>sowing</b> was higher by (4. 7 percent) than ridge sowing.

40|$|Influence of {{existing}} methods and technologies of soil processing for forest crops on establishment {{and growth of}} cultivated tree species was studied. It was found that furrow plough processing of soil can interfere with the cultivated trees’ ecological peculiarities, because the furrow floor, where trees are planted, often constitutes {{the lower part of}} the turf or the upper part of the ashen-gray layers having unfavorable water-physical conditions and decreased crop-producing power. Whenever conifer trees grow on the bottom of a furrow excavated in medium and heavy clay loam, their growth is significantly decreased and accompanied by remarkable changes in morphology. Processing of shallow humus thickness soil with multiple cutter results in mixing of A 0, A 1 and A 2 (ashen-gray) layers. Consequently, the processed horizon obtains a lower amount of fertile substances than the vegetable soil on non-processed places. An apparatus for graded soil tillage, its construction, working principle and usage technology are described. The major peculiarity of the device consists in the ability not to crumbl the soil, but to shake down vegetable earth cut by subsurface plow from beneath. The technology involves removing roots and grass outside cultivated land, so that it cannot be then overgrown with weeds. It was found that exploitation of the device improves soil pulverization quality, enhances percentage of separates less than 10 mm and 10 – 50 mm, decreases content of the separate larger than 50 mm, and reduced specific energy output almost three-fold. Vertical displacement of control particles while soil processing with common cutter machines and the suggested device was studied. Establishment and growth of Siberian pine was determined in experimental productive cultures at different planting technologies. It was shown that under the suggested technology, forest plants <b>furrow</b> <b>sowing</b> can be done while soil processing, so that making nurseries becomes unnecessary, and cleaning, ploughing furrows, planting and further tending seedlings are not needed. Soil layers are not mixed, as within usual tillage. Rich soil layer is not withdrawn, so that germination ability of target seeds increases, and growth of seedlings in enhanced. The entire process takes much less energy compared to traditional technologies. Application of the device increases the quality of forest regeneration and reduces labor input owing to the new technology...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effects of silicon application adjusted with nitrogen fertilization via top-dressing on grain productivity, the silicon contents of the soil, in the plant tissue and nitrogen contents in dry and irrigated conditions. The experimental outlining was from designed blocks with subdivided parcels and four repetitions. The treatments consisted of culture system (dry and irrigated) and the under parcels by the combination of silicon (0 and 100 kg ha(- 1)), in magnesium and calcium silicate form (with 23 % of SiO 2), and four doses of N (urea) via top-dressing (0, 30, 60 and 90 kg ha(- 1)). Silicon application at <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow</b> was a viable technique because it provided {{significant increase in the}} content of this element in the root growth of rice. The application of silicon in the <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow</b> did not change the content of the element nor the nitrogen nutrition in rice plants.

40|$|The {{application}} of calcium carbonate micron {{particles in the}} planting furrow, because of the reduced particle size may favor a faster reaction in the soil and could provide increased pH and P availability for plants such as dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), potentially increasing yield. A field experiment was conducted for two consecutive years with the objective to evaluate {{the effect of the}} liquid calcium carbonate micron particle application in the planting furrow on soil properties (Ph, P, Ca, K and Al content and V) and on the yield components, grain yield, and concentration and content of P in dry bean. The experimental design was a randomized complete block scheme. The treatments consisted of six rates of calcium carbonate micron particles, that is, 0, 1. 05, 2. 10, 4. 2, 8. 4 and 12. 6 kg ha- 1 applied in the <b>furrow</b> at <b>sowing</b> of dry bean. Calcium carbonate increased the pH (from 4. 8 to 5. 3 at 0 to 0. 10 m deep layer) and the P concentration in the soil (from 70 to 80 mg dm- 3 at 0 to 0. 10 m deep layer) until 30 days after application. The concentration of Ca, K and the base saturation of the soil were not affected by the addition of calcium carbonate.

40|$|The water {{availability}} for flood irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) is decreasing worldwide. Therefore, developing technologies to allow growing rice in aerobic condition, {{such as a}} no-tillage system (NTS) can contribute to produce upland rice grains without yield losses and also in saving more water. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of soil management, seed treatment and compaction on the <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow</b> on grain yield of upland rice genotypes. We made two trials, one in an NTS and another using conventional tillage, CT (one plowing and two diskings). The field experiments were performed in the Central Region of Brazil in Cerrado soils. For each trial, the experimental design was a randomized block design in a factorial scheme, with three replications. The treatments consisted of a combination of 10 genotypes with 2 compaction pressures on the <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow</b> (25 kPa and 126 kPa) and 2 types of seed treatment (with and without pesticide). Under CT, the seed treatment did not contribute to increase upland rice grain yields. However, under NTS the grain yield of some genotypes [BRS Esmeralda (from 723 to 1, 766 kg ha- 1), BRS Pepita (from 930 to 1, 874 kg ha- 1), AB 072044 (from 523 to 1, 579 kg ha- 1), and AB 072085 (from 632 to 1, 636 kg ha- 1) at 25 kPA soil compaction pressure, and Sertaneja (from 994 to 2, 167 kg ha- 1), BRS Pepita (from 1, 161 to 2, 100 kg ha- 1), and AB 072085 (from 958 to 2, 213 kg ha- 1), at 126 kPA soil compaction pressure] increased with the use of this practice. At CT the higher soil compaction pressure on the <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow</b> (from 25 kPa to 126 kPa) increased rice grain yield only when it was used seed treatment and the genotypes Serra Dourada (from 1, 239 to 2, 178 kg ha- 1), Sertaneja (from 1, 510 to 2, 379 kg ha- 1), and Cambará (from 1, 877 to 2, 831 kg ha- 1). On the other hand, under NTS, increasing soil compaction pressure on the <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow</b> allowed for an increased rice grain yield of Serra Dourada (from 1, 553 to 2, 347 kg ha- 1), Esmeralda (from 723 to 1, 643 kg ha- 1), AB 072044 (from 523 to 2, 040 kg ha- 1), and Cambará (from 1, 243 to 2, 032 kg ha- 1) without seed treatment and Sertaneja (from 1, 385 to 2, 167 kg ha- 1) and AB 072044 (from 1, 579 to 2, 356 kg ha- 1) with seed treatment. In CT the most productive genotypes were AB 062008 (2, 714 kg ha- 1) and BRSMG Caravera (2, 479 kg ha- 1), while at NTS were the genotypes: BRSGO Serra Dourada (2, 118 kg ha- 1), AB 072047 (1, 888 kg ha- 1), AB 062008 (1, 823 kg ha- 1), BRSMG Caravera (1, 737 kg ha- 1), Cambará (1, 716 kg ha- 1), AB 072044 (1, 625 kg ha- 1), BRS Esmeralda (1, 604 kg ha- 1), and BRS Pepita (1, 516 kg ha- 1). 201...|$|R

The different modes of application provided differences in the firing height and corn yield. The control treatment (0 kg ha- 1 of N and P) provided the highest firing height, superior than those of topdressing and application in the furrow, which were not significantly different. The topdress application of N and P provided an increase in corn yield that exceeded 16 and 42 % of the application in the furrow and the control, respectively. Thus, the results confirmed that increasing rates of P 2 O 5, in soil with high initial P content, influence positively corn production factors, but with little significant responses, and the topdress application of N and P on soil with high P content, without water restriction, provided increased grain yield in relation to the application in the furrow...|$|R

While the petiole and the leaves were easily separated from the soil, the chicory root and the soil having about the same colour and the lighting condition varying widely, it was more difficult to obtain a good contrast between those parts, which leaves place for some improvements. The adapted Hough transform consisted in computing one transform for each line in the cluster with, for reference, the position and direction of the theoretical position of the row. The different transforms were then added. It was found effective for both the sowing rows and the chicory rows.

The {{study was conducted}} to assess the effects of two sowing methods and two mulching materials on soil physical characteristics and yields of wheat and maize during 2008 - 10 at Faisalabad, Pakistan. Results showed that Bed sowing method along with wheat straw mulch increased Leaf Area Index of wheat by 5 to 16 %, and of maize by 4 to 14 % compared with other treatments. This treatment also produced maximum 1000 -grain weight (50. 5 g) of wheat and maize (439. 2 g) as compared to flat sowing method where no mulch was applied. The highest grain yields of wheat (5017 kg ha- 1) and maize (10. 6 Mg ha- 1) were recorded in Bed sowing + wheat straw mulch plots.

In addition, it was evaluated four P levels (0, 60, 120 and 180 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5) applied in the first year in the split plots; and four P levels (0, 30, 60 and 90 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5) applied in the two subsequent crops in the split-split plot. Contents of P were extracted by Mehlich- 1 and Anion Exchange Resin methods from soil samples collected in the split-split plot. It was found {{that it is necessary to}} apply 19. 4 or 11. 1 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5, via triple superphosphate as source, to increase 1 mg dm- 3 of P extracted by Mehlich- 1 or Resin, respectively, in the 0. 0 to 0. 10 m layer of depth. The soil drain P character decreases as the amount of this nutrient supplied in the previous crops is increased...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{influences}} of several organic fertilizer treatment regimens were compared as to their slowing down effect on aldicarb soil metabolism in a sugar beet crop. The organic fertilizers treatment schemes had been repeatedly applied in the past 30 years, according to a 3 -year rotation cycle. The following organic fertilizers treatment regimens [...] which are the main ones used in the agronomy practice [...] were compared: Treatment 1 : no organic fertilizer at all; treatment 2 : 40 tons cow manure ha- 1; treatment 3 : 40 tons pig slurry ha- 1 + green manure + crop wastes; treatment 4 : green manure + crop wastes; treatment 5 : straw cereal wastes alone. A sugar beet crop was sown in April 1991, 1 kg aldicarb ha- 1 being applied in granulates in the <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow.</b> During the 2. 9 first crop months, the soil half-lives of {{the sum of the}} insecticide S(-) +SO(-) +SO 2 -aldicarb in the sowing line in the 0 - 25 cm surface soil layer were 21. 6, 44. 4, 39. 6, 35. 7, and 30. 3 days in the treatments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 treated plots, respectively. The organic fertilizers soil treatments thus increased the persistence of the total insecticide compounds soil concentrations, and probably also the insecticide protection efficiencies. Comparison of the results obtained here with the ones previously obtained with other crop trials, herbicides and soil insecticides, suggests that the soil organic matter is the most efficient to slow down the insecticides soil biodegradation, compared to the old humus originating from the organic fertilizers treatments made more than one year ago.

40|$|Em ensaio conduzido durante nove anos com o algodoeiro sobre latossolo roxo, pobre em fósforo, em Guaíra, SP, confrontou-se o modo tradicional de adubar com aplicações a lanço de produtos fosfatados. Adubações anuais de 121 kg/ha de P 2 O 5, no sulco de semeação, por ocasião do plantio, durante seis anos sucessivos, foram comparadas à fosfatagem única (728 kg/ha de P 2 O 5) a lanço e incorporada no primeiro ano, e à fosfatagem parcelada (364 kg/ha/vez de P 2 O 5) realizada no primeiro e no quarto ano, utilizando-se superiosfato triplo, além de uma fosfatagem parcelada com o termofosfato Yoorin. Todos os tratamentos foram comparados a uma testemunha, com adubação NK, básica e sem P. Durante os seis anos de aplicação de adubo fosfatado, o algodoeiro, variedade IAC 18, reagiu mais à aplicação localizada do fósforo, em termos de produtividade, exceção feita ao primeiro ano, quando era muito baixa a disponibilidade do nutriente no solo. Já altas doses de fosfato a lanço provocaram deficiência de potássio nas plantas, com os prejuízos se estendendo a certas características da fibra, como Micronaire e maturidade. Em face do bom desempenho da fosfatagem moderada nos anos de aplicação, sugere-se que uma associação entre os modos de emprego a lanço e localizado seja avaliada nos próximos estudos. Outras características, como peso de capulho e de semente, além do comprimento da fibra, aumentaram significativamente com o uso de P. O efeito {{residual}} do superfosfato acumulado durante seis anos, no sulco de plantio, estudado nos três subseqüentes anos, com o cultivo da variedade IAC 20, só se destacou nos resultados de produção. The traditional mode of phosphate {{application to}} cotton was compared with broadcasting application {{in a long}} term trial conducted on a DusKy Red Latosol, with a low level of phosphorus. Triple superphosphate was applied annualy (121 kg/ha of P 2 O 5) in <b>furrows</b> at <b>sowing,</b> during six years, or broadcasted and incorporated, through one application (728 kg/ha of P 2 O 5) in the first year, or two applications in the first and fourth years (364 kg/ha, at each time). A thermal phosphate (18 % P 2 O 5) was also tested in two broadcasting applications. All treatments were compared to a control, with constant doses of N and K, but without P. During the six years of phosphate fertilization, higher yields of IAC 18 cotton variety were obtained, with annual application at sowing time, except for the first year due to the low initial disponibility of P. High quantities of broadcasted phosphate led to visual potassium deficiency symptoms, with losses in yield, Micronaire index and maturity of fibers. Therefore, due to the good yield performance obtained with a moderate dose of phosphate, in the years of application, it was suggested that a combination between broadcast and localized application should be studied, in future experiments. Other characteristics of cotton such as boll and seed weight plus fiber length, also increased significantly with P fertilization. The residual effect of the traditional mode of phosphate application, studied during the last three years, with IAC 20 cotton variety, showed significant results only for yield...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Autumn maize intercropped with {{tropical}} forages {{can raise}} the amount of crop residues and improve nutrient cycling, favoring subsequent soybean crop. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of forms of implementation of intercropping of irrigated autumn maize with tropical forages on yield, decomposition, nutrient accumulation and release, and on the ratio of lignin/total N of forage residues, yield components, and grain yield of subsequent soybean, and on soil physical and chemical properties, under no-tillage in lowland Cerrado. The experiment was arranged in randomized blocks in a factorial (4 × 3 + 1) design with one control and four replications. The treatments consisted of four forages: Palisade grass, Congo grass, and two Guinea grass cultivars (Tanzânia and Áries); and three methods of sowing intercrops of forage-autumn maize: forage sown simultaneously with maize in the <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow,</b> mixed with fertilizer; forage sown by broadcasting on the day of maize sowing; and forage seeds mixed with fertilizer broadcast on maize in growth stage V 4; plus a control (maize monoculture). The decomposition and nutrient release rate of the forage residues were evaluated by the litter bag method, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after desiccation. Sowing the forages in the furrow and by broadcasting raise the total amount of maize residues compared to method V 4. Regardless of the forage type and sowing methods, intercropping increases the amount of residues compared to maize monoculture. The forages and sowing methods had no influence on nutrient accumulation in the residues at the time of desiccation and at the lowest lignin/total N ratio in Congo grass residues, and a logarithmic decay was observed. Forage and sowing methods did not influence the macronutrient release rate from crop residues for 120 days after desiccation; the release of N, P, K and Mg is logarithmic and the release of Ca and S exponential. Forage and sowing methods do not influence yield components and grain yield of subsequent soybean. However, intercropping increased grain yield of subsequent soybean compared to soybean after maize monoculture, and preserved the soil chemical and physical properties...|$|R
40|$|Neste artigo os autores apresentam os resultados obtidos em 13 ensaios de adubarão do algodoeiro com doses crescentes de fósforo, empregadas sòzinhas ou na presença de azôto e potássio. Os ensaios foram conduzidos entre 1943 - 44 e 1947 - 48 em diferentes localidades da zona algidoeira do Estado de São Paulo, abrangendo vários tipos de solo. Provavelmente por ter sido aplicada em contato com as sementes, a adubação com azôto e potássio reduziu o "stand" em cêrca de 50 % dos casos, e seu efeito sôbre a produção, em média dêsse grupo, foi apenas um têrço do obtido no grupo em que o "stand" não sofreu tal prejuízo. Tanto na presença como na ausência de azôto mais potássio a resposta média ao fósforo foi muito boa quando se usou a dose de 40 kg/ha de P 2 O 5, e ainda aumentou apreciàvelmente quando se passou para 80 kg/ha; mas permaneceu a mesma com a dose de 120 kg/ha. Separando os ensaios {{conforme}} os tipos de solo, o efeito do fósforo foi muito maior na terra-roxa-legítima ou misturada, decrescendo substancialmente no solo massapê-salmourão e ainda mais no arenito Bauru. Na terra-roxa êle ainda aumentou quando se passou de 80 para 120 kg/ha de P 2 O 5. A presença de azôto mais potássio contribuiu para acentuar o efeito do fósforo na terra-roxa e no arenito Bauru, ao passo que n reduziu no massapê-salmourão, ao que parece por ter aquela adubação prejudicado o "stand" em todos os ensaios conduzidos nesse tipo de solo. Os resultados de alguns ensaios conduzidos em solos já adubados com fósforo nas culturas anteriores indicam a possibilidade de reduzirem-se as doses dêsse nutriente a serem empregadas em tais casos. This paper {{reports the}} results obtained in 13 experiments conducted in the State of São Paulo, to study the effect of increasing rates of phosphorus application in the absence and presence of nitrogen plus potassium. The nutrients used per hectare were: 20 kilograms of N, 30 kilograms of K 2 O, and 40, 80 and 120 kilograms of P 2 O 5. respeetívely in the forms of Chilean nitrate, potassium chloride and superphosphate. These materials were applied in the seed <b>furrows</b> just before <b>sowing.</b> Apparently due to the application {{in contact with the}} seed, the nitrogen plus potassium fertilization impaired the stands in about 50 % of the experiments, and its effect on the yield, in the average of this group, was only 1 / 3 of that obtained in the group, whose stands were not damaged. The average response to phosphorus was very good with the dose of 40 kilograms of P 2 O 5 per hectare and increased appreciably with that of 80 kilograms, but no further increase was obtained with the 120 kilograms rate of application. The effect of phosphorus was better in the "terra-roxa" soil, decreasing in the "massapê-salmourão" and especially in the "arenito Bauru". In the "terra-roxa" it still increased when the rate of application was increased up to 120 kilograms per hectare. The presence of nitrogen and potassium contributed to enhance the response to phosphorus in the "terra-roxa" and "arenito Bauru" soils, but not in the "massapê [...] salmourão", apparently because those nutrients damaged the stands in all of the experiments conducted on the latter type of soil. According to the prices of 1956 - 57 and the average of the 13 experiments the most profitable rates of P 2 O 5 applications would be 50 and 60 kilograms per hectare, respectively n the absence and in the presence of nitrogen and potassium. These doses should be ncreased for the "terra-roxa" and reduced for the "arenito Bauru" soils. For the "massapê-salmourão" soil, in view of what happened to the stands the dose {{to be used in the}} presence of nitrogen plus potassium cannot be estimated; in the absence of these nutrients it should be of 50 kilograms. The results of limited number of experiments indicate the possibility of reducing the doses of phosphorus for soils fertilized with it in the previous crops...|$|R
40|$|A adubaÃÂÃÂo nitrogenada (adubaÃÂÃÂo-N) no trigo permanece muito discutida, sobretudo em sistema plantio direto (SPD), em que o {{manejo de}} doses de nitrogÃÂnio (N) em semeadura e cobertura pode alterar a produtividade, dependendo da fonte de N. O objetivo com o trabalho foi avaliar o manejo da adubaÃÂÃÂo-N do trigo em SPD com as fontes ureia, ureia tratada com inibidor de urease (ureia + NBPT) e nitrato de amÃÂnio (NA), utilizando 0, 40 e 80 kg ha- 1 de N na semeadura e/ou em cobertura. Os manejos com doses totais crescentes resultaram em acrÃÂscimos nos teores foliares de N, cujos valores com a fonte NA nunca foram superados pelos das demais fontes. A massa de mil grÃÂos (MMG) na fonte NA foi {{inferior}} em relaÃÂÃÂo ÃÂs demais fontes em 2011, e em 2013 a MMG com ureia + NBPT foi maior em relaÃÂÃÂo ÃÂ ureia, e os manejos com as menores doses de N tiveram maior MMG. Quanto ÃÂ produtividade e o acÃÂmulo de N nos grÃÂos tiveram comportamento similar em relaÃÂÃÂo ÃÂs fontes, sendo que em 2012, safra com dÃÂficit hÃÂdrico, a fonte NA foi superior ÃÂs demais, e em 2013, safra sem dÃÂficit hÃÂdrico, ureia + NBPT foi superior ao NA. Os manejos com doses totais crescentes de N resultaram em aumento da produtividade e do N acumulado nos grÃÂos. No solo, a adiÃÂÃÂo de NBPT ÃÂ ureia diminuiu o pH em relaÃÂÃÂo ÃÂ ureia isolada, em diferentes camadas avaliadas, mas sem diferenÃÂa em relaÃÂÃÂo ao NA. Este comportamento do pH do solo foi influenciado pelas variaÃÂÃÂes climÃÂticas entre as safras. Dentre os manejos, 0 + 40 e 80 + 40 kg ha- 1 de N normalmente acidificaram o solo em relaÃÂÃÂo aos demais tratamentos. Para os teores de NO 3 - e NH 4 + do solo, nÃÂo se observaram diferenÃÂas atÃÂ 20 cm de profundidade em 2011, mas em 2012 e 2013 a ureia + NBPT mostrou menores teores de NH 4 + em relaÃÂÃÂo a NO 3 - quando comparada ÃÂ ureia, devido ÃÂ nitrificaÃÂÃÂo do NH 4 +, jÃÂ a partir de 20 cm nÃÂo se observam efeitos das fontes. Em 2011 e 2013, quando a produtividade e a exportaÃÂÃÂo de N foram grandes com os manejos de 40 + 40 e 80 + 80 kg ha- 1 de N, os teores de NH 4 + e NO 3 - no solo diminuÃÂram aos nÃÂveis observados na testemunha (0 + 0 kg ha- 1 de N), baixos neste caso pela nÃÂo adiÃÂÃÂo de N via fertilizantes. Em 2012, a testemunha revelou teores normalmente menores que os demais manejos, para NO 3 - e NH 4 +, pois com o dÃÂficit hÃÂdrico, houve menor absorÃÂÃÂo das plantas, fazendo com que a adubaÃÂÃÂo mineral mantivesse teores mais elevados. Nitrogen fertilization of wheat remains under discussion, especially in no tillage (PD), whereupon the management nitrogen (N) rates in sowing and as topdressing may alter yield, depending on N source used. The objective with {{this work was}} to evaluate the Management of wheat nitrogen fertilization under PD using the sources urea, urea treated with urease inhibitor (ureia + NBPT) and ammonium nitrate (NA), applying 0, 40 and 80 kg ha- 1 of N in <b>sowing</b> <b>furrow</b> and/or as topdressing. The managements with growing total N rate resulted in increasing N levels on wheat flag leaf, whose values with source NA were never overcome by other sources. The thousand grain weight (MMG) for NA source was inferior to that obtained with other sources in 2011, and in 2013 the MMG with urea + NBPT was higher in relation to urea alone, and the managements with lower N rates had higher MMG. Grain yield and N accumulation in grains had similar behavior {{in relation to the}} sources, with NA being superior to other sources in 2012, under a water deficit condition, and urea + NBPT being superior to NA in 2013, under normal water condition. The managements with growing N rates resulted in higher yield and N accumulation in grains. The addition of NBPT to urea decrease soil pH in relation to urea alone, in different evaluated soil layers, but without difference to NA source. This behavior of soil pH was influenced by climatic variation in the crop seasons. Among N managements, 0 + 40 and 80 + 40 kg ha- 1 of N normally acidified the soil in relation to other treatments. For the NO 3 - and NH 4 + levels into the soil, no differences were observed until 20 cm depth in 2011, but in 2012 and 2013 the urea + NBPT source showed lower NH 4 + levels in relation to NO 3 - in comparison to urea, due to nitrification. At the 20 - 40 cm layer, no source effect was observed. In 2011 and 2013, when yield and N exportation were high with managements of 40 + 40 and 80 + 80 kg ha- 1 of N, the NH 4 + and NO 3 - soil levels decreased to the levels observed with control (0 + 0 kg ha- 1 de N), low in this case because no N was applied with mineral fertilizer. In 2012, control revealed soil N levels normally lower in relation to other managements, for NO 3 - and NH 4 +, once with water deficit there was lower plant absorption, causing mineral fertilization to maintain higher N levels in the soil...|$|R
