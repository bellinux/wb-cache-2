5|$|Incredibly, 20 years later, {{the aquatic}} {{ecologist}} J. O. Langtry was still compelled to criticise the extremely heavy, lawless, fishing pressure, {{in the form}} of both uncontrolled small-scale commercial fishing and rampant illegal <b>fishing,</b> <b>with</b> which he was confronted in all reaches of the Murray River he investigated in 1949–1950.|$|E
5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} trout in sea-run, resident stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run {{cutthroat trout}} <b>fishing</b> <b>with</b> its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching for trout along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it was too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly <b>fishing</b> <b>with</b> Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E

Despite Juliet Burke's (Elizabeth Mitchell) warning to Sun that women who conceive on the island die during their second trimester, Sun arranges to defect with Jin to the rival faction led by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), who {{does not want to}} leave the island. Juliet tries to stop Sun from leaving by telling Jin that Sun had an affair, causing him to angrily back out of the journey at the last minute. After having a heartfelt conversation while <b>fishing</b> <b>with</b> Bernard Nadler, the only other married man on the island, he forgives Sun, who assures him that the baby is his.|$|E

Attempting to save his life, they take him to the hospital, where they discover that he is in a coma. Peter invites Quagmire's sister, Brenda, to visit him at the hospital, and she manages to wake up her brother. Brenda also brings along Jeffery Fecalman, her obnoxious, aggressive and abusive boyfriend, who harasses her throughout the night much to the fury and concern of Quagmire and his neighbors.|$|E

Portland spent the remainder of the interwar era with the Scouting Force, Cruiser Division 5 and later in the United States Pacific Fleet conducting peacetime training and a number of goodwill missions.

It is the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing' in which a wooden sledge is propelled across the mudflats to collect fish from nets. Catches include: Thinlip mullet, plaice, dogfish, cuttlefish, skate, shrimp, prawns, sea bass, and sole. Watchet Boat Museum displays the unusual local flatner boats which were used for fishing in the bay, along with associated artefacts.|$|E

Lumangwe Falls, Mumbuluma Falls, Mumbotuta Waterfalls, Kundabwika Waterfalls and Chilongo Waterfalls are the major water falls.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Morris {{was kept}} largely housebound at Elm House by his mother; there, {{he spent much}} time reading, favouring the novels of Walter Scott. Aged 6, Morris moved {{with his family to}} the Georgian Italianate mansion at Woodford Hall, Woodford, Essex, which was {{surrounded}} by 50 acres of land adjacent to Epping Forest. He took an interest in <b>fishing</b> <b>with</b> his brothers as well as gardening in the Hall's grounds, and spent much time exploring the Forest, where he was fascinated both by the Iron Age earthworks at Loughton Camp and Ambresbury Banks and by the Early Modern Hunting Lodge at Chingford. He also took rides through the Essex countryside on his pony, and visited the various churches and cathedrals throughout the country, marveling at their architecture. His father took him on visits outside of the county, for instance to Canterbury Cathedral, the Chiswick Horticultural Gardens, and to the Isle of Wight, where he adored Blackgang Chine. Aged 9, he was then sent to Misses Arundale's Academy for Young Gentlemen, a nearby preparatory school; although initially riding there by pony each day, he later began boarding, intensely disliking the experience.|$|E

50|$|In the Exocoetus or {{monoplane}} body plan, {{only the}} pectoral fins are enlarged to provide lift. <b>Fish</b> <b>with</b> this body plan {{tend to have}} a more streamlined body, higher aspect ratios (long, narrow wings), and higher wing loading than <b>fish</b> <b>with</b> the biplane body plan, making these fish well adapted for higher flying speeds. Flying <b>fish</b> <b>with</b> a monoplane body plan demonstrate different launching behaviors from their biplane counterparts. Instead of extending their duration of thrust production, monoplane fish launch from the water at high speeds at a large angle of attack (sometimes up to 45 degrees). In this way, monoplane fish are taking advantage of their adaptation for high flight speed, while <b>fish</b> <b>with</b> biplane designs exploit their lift production abilities during takeoff.|$|R

5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on <b>fishing,</b> <b>with</b> compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E
5|$|Players cast {{a fishing}} line {{into the ocean}} and use motion {{controls}} to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot fish {{out of the sky}} for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical <b>Fishing</b> <b>with</b> the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of their work and finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.|$|E
