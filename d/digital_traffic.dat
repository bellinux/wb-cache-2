2500|$|By the 1990s, most Army units had {{replaced}} their older VRC-12 series FM radios {{for the new}} SINCGARS ("SINgle-Channel Ground-Air Radio Systems") family of equipment. Rather than sending a signal along one signal frequency, the SINCGARS radios sent its signals across many frequencies, [...] "hopping" [...] from one frequency to another at lightning speed. This allowed many channels of talk to share an already-crowded frequency spectrum. Later generations of these radios combined the communications security (COMSEC) encryption devices with the receiver/transmitter, making a single easier-to-program unit.

By the advent of Operation Desert Shield, all Army units were deployed using the most secure FM communications in the world. The SINCGARS radios have a failure rate in extreme heat of once every 7,000 hours compared to the VRC-12 series' failure rate of 2–300 hours.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPacket Radio is a digital communications concept which offers the user {{the capability to}} pass voice and other data traffic in a radio network which may link high power computers with small mobile radios containing microprocessors. The technique of routing <b>digital</b> <b>traffic</b> from source to destination depends on the operational requirements of the network. Most routing concepts today centralize network control (in varying degrees) for normal operations. This thesis describes a concept for completely decentralized control of a packet radio network. The basic protocol is relatively simple and robust, but suffers from the usual build-up of overhead traffic with network size. Another related routing protocol is proposed which, under certain operational situations, reduces routing traffic and memory requirements compared to the basic algorithm.
