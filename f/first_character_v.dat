Characterization of <b>character</b> <b>V</b> is analyzed which indicated four traits in characterization; general traits including regional trait, physical trait, emotional trait and personal trait. The result of the research showed that V is temperamental. He hates hypocrites {{and he wants to}} bring freedom to society by his act. The characterization of V is reflected by two symbols; letter V and a flower. The <b>character</b> <b>V</b> himself is influenced by Guy Fawkes's thought. He imitated Fawkes's face by using his mask, V imitated his idea; fight for unfairly government and follow Fawkes's strategy by destroying important buildings...|$|R

In this paper, we compute the Gieseker wall for v in {{a slice of}} the stability manifold of X. We construct explicit curves parameterizing non-isomorphic Gieseker stable sheaves of <b>character</b> <b>v</b> that become S-equivalent along the wall. As a corollary, we conclude that if there are no strictly semistable sheaves of <b>character</b> <b>v,</b> the Bayer-Macr̀ı divisor associated to the wall is a boundary nef divisor on the modul...|$|R

2500|$|Countries {{with the}} same number of strokes in the <b>first</b> <b>character</b> are sorted by the order of the five basic strokes in Chinese {{characters}} (一,丨,丿,丶 and 乙). If the name of two or more countries has the same <b>first</b> <b>character,</b> then they are ordered according to the stroke order of the second character. For example, Latvia (...) , Great Britain (...) , and British Virgin Islands (...) were the 114th, 115th and 116th to enter respectively while the <b>first</b> <b>characters</b> of their names are all eight strokes. However, the stroke order of Latvia's <b>first</b> <b>character</b> (拉) is 一丨一丶一丶丿一 while that of Great Britain is 一丨丨丨乙一丿丶. Latvia's third stroke (一) is before that of Great Britain (丨), which gave Latvia precedence to Great Britain. Great Britain and the British Virgin Islands share the same <b>first</b> <b>character,</b> 英. However the second one in Great Britain's name is 国, which has 8 strokes, while the second in British Virgin Islands is 属, which has 12 strokes. Thus Great Britain entered before British Virgin Islands. Guinea (...) was the second country to enter following Greece as it only takes two strokes to write the <b>first</b> <b>character</b> in the country's name (几). Australia (...) marched 202nd, just ahead of Zambia (...) , which was the last country to march before China. The <b>first</b> <b>characters</b> of these countries' names ( [...] and [...] ) are written with 15 and 16 strokes respectively.|$|R

40|$|In an {{eye-tracking}} experiment {{we examined}} whether Chinese readers were sensitive to information concerning how often a Chinese character {{appears as a}} single-character word versus the <b>first</b> <b>character</b> in a two-character word, and whether readers use this information to segment words and adjust the amount of parafoveal processing of subsequent characters during reading. Participants read sentences containing a two-character target word with its <b>first</b> <b>character</b> more or {{less likely to be}} a single-character word. The boundary paradigm was used. The boundary appeared between the <b>first</b> <b>character</b> and the second character of the target word, and we manipulated whether readers saw an identity or a pseudocharacter preview of the second character of the target. Linear mixed-effects models revealed reduced preview benefit from the second <b>character</b> when the <b>first</b> <b>character</b> was more likely to be a single-character word. This suggests that Chinese readers use probabilistic combinatorial information about the likelihood of a Chinese character being single-character word or a two-character word online to modulate the extent of parafoveal processing...|$|R
