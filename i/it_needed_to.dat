5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1890s, the CCE struggled unsuccessfully to raise the capital <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fund the construction. Whilst it did so it continued to develop its route proposals. In 1899, parliamentary permission was obtained to modify the route so that the Euston branch was extended northwards to connect to the main route {{at the south end of}} Camden High Street. The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. In 1900, the CCE was taken over by a consortium led by American financier Charles Yerkes which raised the necessary money.|$|E

5|$|In February 2010, President Obama {{formed the}} {{bipartisan}} BowlesSimpson Commission to recommend steps {{that could be}} taken to reduce future budget deficits. The commission released its report on November 10, 2010, which recommended deep domestic and military spending cuts, reforming the tax system by eliminating many tax breaks in return for lower overall rates, and reducing benefits for Social Security and Medicare. The plan did not receive the supermajority vote within the commission which <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be directly sent to Congress, and portions of the plan were rejected by both parties.|$|E

40|$|This paper argues that, if {{cultural}} {{political economy}} is <b>to</b> be worthwhile, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> {{be critical of}} its object. In order to develop its critical understanding of contemporary society, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> do at least three things. Firstly, while the cultural turn has corrected and sometimes inverted economic reductionism's dismissive treatment of culture and the lifeworld, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> avoid reducing economic systems to the lifeworld {{in which they are}} embedded, so that the extent to which systems are responsible for economic and cultural effects-good or bad-is not obscured. Secondly, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> take a more critical look at the social and cultural embedding of economic activities, and at the way system mechanisms of capital accumulation and uneven development have powerful disembedding and disruptive effects. Thirdly, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> reconsider, rather than ignore, classical political economy, which was always cultural and is still of relevance today, even though it failed to anticipate new issues of cultural and political significance, such as the politics of identity...|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest members, {{who had joined}} in the mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee and felt that <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Paramount {{released}} The Wrath of Khan on VHS and Beta in 1983. The studio {{sold the}} VHS for $39.95, $40 below contemporary movie cassette prices. <b>It</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> sell 60,000 tapes {{to make the}} film as profitable as other tapes, but sold 120,000.

5|$|Spedding {{recruited}} two chemistry {{professors at}} Ames for his group there, Harley Wilhelm and I. B. Johns. Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking for}} ways to create the uranium metal.

It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be melted and cast. The Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E

5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be loaded {{from the end}} of the barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E

5|$|Tome of the Unknown is a {{short film}} {{directed}} by Patrick McHale, who also wrote and storyboarded it. Not long after he graduated college, McHale pitched {{the idea for the}} film, among other concepts, to Cartoon Network. At the time, the network was considering the creation of a department for feature films, though this never came to fruition. McHale was asked if it was possible to adapt the idea for Tome of the Unknown to feature length. This proved unsuccessful as he felt <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be episodic, laying out plans for a full television series consisting of three seasons.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent surge of {{interest}} in semantic machine translation, which standard automatic metrics struggle to evaluate. A family of measures called MEANT has been proposed which uses semantic role labels (SRL) to overcome this problem. The human variant, HMEANT, has largely been evaluated using correlation with human contrastive evaluations, the standard human evaluation metric for the WMT shared tasks. In this paper we claim that for a human metric <b>to</b> be useful, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be evaluated on intrinsic properties. <b>It</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be reliable; <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> work across different language pairs; and <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be lightweight. Most importantly, however, a human metric must be discerning. We conclude that HMEANT {{is a step in}} the right direction, but has some serious flaws. The reliance on verbs as heads of frames, and the assumption that annotators need minimal guidelines are particularly problematic. ...|$|R
5|$|According to PfÃ¤lzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, {{which he}} calls the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, which most probably contained remains {{taken out of the}} royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be public and visible to a large crowd; PfÃ¤lzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} was {{dissatisfied}} with this arrangement, it launched plans to establish its own venues. First <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> secure a lot, and in the late 1920s lied its eyes on a parcel of land owned by Hamar JernstÃ¸peri. However, the lot was sold to Oplandske Kreditbank in 1930 and the club had to negotiate purchasing the lot from the bank. The club established a new committee {{to look into the}} stadium issue. Hamar IL was invited to become part-owner of the venue, but they chose to remain at Hamar stadion. As Briskebyen was not able to secure a partner to share the costs with, opposition towards the project grew within the club. Yet, the decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, the {{releases}} of new CD-based consoles {{such as the}} 3DO Interactive Multiplayer rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing public interest in the add-on. In late 1993, {{less than a year}} after the system's launches in North America and Europe, the gaming media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega officially discontinued the add-on in the first quarter of 1996, saying that <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on fewer platforms and felt the Sega CD could not compete in the current marketplace due to its high price tag and outdated single-speed drive. The last two games scheduled to be released for the Sega CD, Myst and Brain Dead 13, were subsequently cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan.|$|E

5|$|By June President Habyarimana {{had come}} to view Hutu Power, rather than the {{mainstream}} opposition, as {{the biggest threat to}} his leadership. This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> draw to a completion. According to Prunier, this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF, than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process. The RPF enjoyed much greater leverage following their successful February campaign, and the government eventually agreed to their power-sharing demands. The RPF were allocated up to 40% of the troops in the proposed unified national armed forces, and 50% of the officer corps. With all details agreed, the Arusha Accords were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{then shot}} the {{sequence}} where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than <b>it</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E
