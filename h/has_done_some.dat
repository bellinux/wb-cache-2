5|$|Both {{in private}} and public performances, Mendelssohn was also renowned for his improvisations. On one {{occasion}} in London, when asked by the soprano Maria Malibran after a recital to extemporise, he created a piece which included the melodies of all the songs she had sung. The music publisher Victor Novello who was present remarked 'He <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>some</b> things that seem to me impossible, even after I have heard them done.' At another recital in 1837, where Mendelssohn played the piano for a singer, Robert Schumann ignored the soprano and wrote 'Mendelssohn accompanied like a God'.|$|E
25|$|Despite his racism, Lashley <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>some</b> {{important}} work in neuropsychology and influenced {{his students to}} reach even greater heights. His works and theories that follow are summarized in his book Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence. Lashley's theory of the Engram was the driving force {{for much of his}} research. An engram was believed {{to be a part of}} the brain where a specific memory was stored. He continued to use the training/ablation method that Franz had taught him. He would train a rat to learn a maze and then use systematic lesions and removed sections of cortical tissue to see if the rat forgot what it had learned.|$|E

500|$|When The Secret River first {{appeared}} in 1955, Saturday Review called it a [...] "little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood... so real and appealing one regrets {{that this is the}} only book the author wrote for children... Leonard Weisgard <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>some</b> of his most sensitive work in drawings that have a feeling for character and place and are quite perfect for the text."

500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly {{commented on}} the {{original}} news that several characters would be leaving the cast when they graduate, and said, [...] "Indeed, a rolling cast list <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>some</b> shows good in the past. I'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the 'new kids' on Friday Night Lights, which ends its run tomorrow on NBC, {{but it was a}} well-done transition. What I loved most was that the new blood didn't try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. Glee could learn a lot from what Friday Night Lights accomplished: a seamless, realistic transition. The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been Glee strong points, {{which is not to say}} they couldn't be. But the question is: Is Glee looking to be the less-attractive comedy cousin of Friday Night Lights... or Saved By the Bell: The New Class?" ...|$|E

Tonight, she cried, she fought, and she learned that she was carrying his child." [...] and added that Pompeo is often [...] "ovelooked" [...] saying, [...] "Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it reviewing [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] wrote, [...] "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added. [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen {{for more than half of}} it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show." [...] USA Today also lauded Pompeo saying, [...] " [...] In some ways, the episode (How to Save a Life) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo. She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes, from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are, to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life." ...|$|E

The latter song contains a lyric that refers {{to one of his}} hits with CCR, by referring to Bush as a [...] "Fortunate Son". Also, this song sounds like Ramones-style punk rock. Fogerty <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>some</b> experimentation with that sound ("She's Got Baggage" [...] from Deja Vu (All Over Again)). Another song, [...] "Summer of Love", is a tribute to Cream and Jimi Hendrix, and has a musical citation from [...] "Sunshine of Your Love".
