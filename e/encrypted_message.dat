5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another chat room user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding the password for one of the Aperture Science login screens from another gameNeuse felt they could have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out. The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the image with the <b>encrypted</b> <b>message</b> to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling some of the players out by name.|$|E
25|$|July 22 - The {{government}} of Spain asks the French {{ambassador to the}} United States, Jules Cambon, to request peace terms from the United States. The request is delayed by four days, as the Spanish give the code key for Cambon's <b>encrypted</b> <b>message</b> to the Austro-Hungarian ambassador, who is vacationing.|$|E
25|$|On {{the inside}} back cover of the book, detectives {{identified}} indentations from handwriting. These included a telephone number, an unidentified number, and a text that resembled an <b>encrypted</b> <b>message.</b> According to statements by police, the book {{was found in the}} rear footwell of a car, {{at about the same time}} that the body of the unidentified man had been found.|$|E
50|$|The {{conditional}} ‘tag’ of the IBCPRE {{facilitates the}} fine-grained access of <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages.</b> By setting different tag values onto different <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages,</b> the data owner Alice {{can control the}} exact set of <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> {{that she wants to}} share with any particular friends of her with great flexibility.|$|R
50|$|IBCPRE {{supports}} one-to-many encryption. The {{data owner}} Alice can choose multiple friends {{to share her}} data with. For multiple friends to share the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> with, Alice simply needs to generate a re-encryption key for each of her friends and sends all the re-encryption keys to the server for carrying out the re-encryption. The number of re-encryption keys that Alice needs to generate depends {{on the number of}} friends that Alice wants to share the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> with. It does not depend on the number of <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages.</b> One re-encryption key will allow the Server to convert all the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> provided the tag of the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> and the tag of the re-encryption key matches.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{features}} of IBCPRE is that when Alice as a data owner <b>encrypts</b> <b>messages,</b> the encryption is done for herself and only Alice herself can decrypt the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> using her secret key. There {{is no need for}} Alice to know in advance about who that she would like to share the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> with. In other words, picking the friends to share with by Alice can be done after she <b>encrypts</b> the <b>messages</b> and uploads to the Server.|$|R
25|$|Following {{a public}} appeal by police, {{the book from}} which the page had been torn was located. On the inside back cover, detectives were able to read – in {{indentations}} from handwriting – a local telephone number, another unidentified number and a text that resembled an <b>encrypted</b> <b>message.</b> The text has not been deciphered or interpreted {{in a way that}} satisfies authorities on the case.|$|E
25|$|The Noga, {{disguised}} as a merchant ship, was fitted with electronic surveillance equipment and satellite communications gear in its superstructure, and was primarily used to intercept communications traffic in Arab ports. As the ship was heading from Antalya in Turkey back to Haifa, the captain was instructed in an <b>encrypted</b> <b>message</b> to change course for Italy and anchor off the coast. The Noga arrived off the Italian port city of La Spezia and anchored in international waters, just outside Italian territorial waters.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{gameplay}} {{is based}} around solving puzzles (such as translating an <b>encrypted</b> <b>message,</b> or opening a puzzle box). However, unlike most modern adventure games, Dark Fall does not keep note of any information or clues {{acquired by the}} player (for example, notes found by the player are not entered into the inventory, and journal entries read by the player are not recorded in any way). This forces the player {{to keep track of}} every clue and detail themselves. If the player wishes to recheck a journal entry, they must find the journal and re-read it.|$|E
50|$|It <b>encrypts</b> <b>messages</b> from user to user, so no passively observing node {{between the}} two is {{supposedly}} able to read the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages.</b> SecureIM does not authenticate its messages, and therefore it is susceptible to active attacks including simple forms of man-in-the-middle attacks.|$|R
50|$|Now when Alice {{wants to}} share these n <b>encrypted</b> <b>{{messages}}</b> with Bob, Alice {{can use a}} proxy re-encryption scheme to allow the server to re-encrypt these n <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> so that Bob can decrypt these re-encrypted messages directly using his own private key.|$|R
30|$|Homomorphic {{encryption}} needs a public-private key pair. Who {{owns the}} private key controls all the information. Assume that a receiver generates the key pair {{and send the}} public key to the senders in a secure communication channel. Thus, senders will use the same key to <b>encrypt</b> their <b>messages.</b> Since homomorphic encryption schemes are probabilistic, sender can use the same key to <b>encrypt</b> the same <b>message</b> that their <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> will be different from each other. However, the receiver does not know who sent the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages.</b>|$|R
25|$|Cryptography {{prior to}} the modern age was {{effectively}} synonymous with encryption, the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense. The originator of an <b>encrypted</b> <b>message</b> shared the decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients, thereby precluding unwanted persons from doing the same. The cryptography literature often uses the name Alice ("A") for the sender, Bob ("B") for the intended recipient, and Eve ("eavesdropper") for the adversary. Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World WarI {{and the advent of}} computers in World WarII, the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread.|$|E
500|$|... have {{proposed}} an alternative encryption system. In their system, the encryption key determines the local rule for each cell of a one-dimensional cellular automaton. A second-order automaton {{based on that}} rule is run for several rounds on an input to transform it into an encrypted output. The reversibility property of the automaton ensures that any <b>encrypted</b> <b>message</b> can be decrypted by running the same system in reverse. In this system, keys must be kept secret, because the same key is used both for encryption and decryption.|$|E
500|$|A further {{source of}} {{information}} [...] became available in 2001. The Höfle Telegram was an <b>encrypted</b> <b>message</b> sent to Berlin on 31 December 1942 by Operation Reinhard deputy commander Hermann Höfle, detailing the number of Jews deported by DRB {{to each of the}} Operation Reinhard death camps up to that point. Discovered among declassified documents in Britain, it shows that by the official count of the German Transport Authority 713,555 Jews were sent to Treblinka in 1942. The number of deaths was probably higher, according to the Armia Krajowa communiqués. On the basis of the telegram and additional undated German evidence for 1943 listing 67,308 people deported, historian Jacek Andrzej Młynarczyk calculated that by the official DRB count, 780,863 people were brought by Deutsche Reichsbahn to Treblinka.|$|E

50|$|Most {{applications}} don't {{require an}} encryption algorithm to produce <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> that are indistinguishable from random bits.However, some authors consider such encryption algorithms to be conceptually simpler {{and easier to}} work with, and more versatile in practice—and most IND-CPA encryption algorithms apparently do, in fact, produce <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> that are indistinguishable from random bits.|$|R
2500|$|A {{reference}} to Fisher was hidden as an <b>encrypted</b> <b>message,</b> the Smithy code, by Mr Justice Peter Smith in the April 2006 judgement on the Da Vinci Code plagiarism case. Smith's biography in Who's Who {{stated that he}} was a [...] "Jackie Fisher fan".|$|E
2500|$|For each {{transmitted}} message, {{the sending}} operator would follow a standard procedure. From September 1938, {{he would use}} an initial position to encrypt the indicator and send it in clear, followed by the message key that had been enciphered at that setting. If the ground setting (...) was GKX for example, he would then use Enigma with the rotors set to GKX to encrypt the message setting, which he might choose to be RTQ; which might encrypt to LLP. (Before May 1940, the <b>encrypted</b> <b>message</b> setting was repeated, but that makes no difference to Herivel's insight.) The operator would then turn his rotors to RTQ and encrypt the actual message. Thus, the preamble to the message would be the unencrypted ground setting (GKX), followed by the <b>encrypted</b> <b>message</b> setting (LLP). A receiving Enigma operator could use the information to recover the message setting and then decrypt the message.|$|E
2500|$|If using a key {{which is}} truly random, {{is at least}} as long as the <b>encrypted</b> <b>message,</b> and is used only once, the Vigenère cipher is {{theoretically}} unbreakable. [...] However, in this case it is the key, not the cipher, which provides cryptographic strength, and such systems are properly referred to collectively as one-time pad systems, irrespective of which ciphers are employed.|$|E
5000|$|Bitmessage {{replicates}} all {{the messages}} inside its own anonymous P2P network, therefore mixing all the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> {{of a given}} user with all the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> of all other users of the network, thus {{making it difficult to}} track which particular computer is the actual originator of the message and which computer is the recipient of the message.|$|R
30|$|The {{aggregation}} and consolidation with DC-Nets {{are easier}} than with homomorphic encryption. Using DC-Nets, participants can just broadcast their <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> or just send directly to an aggregator. Using homomorphic encryption, senders cannot send <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages</b> {{directly to the}} receiver, who can decrypt individual messages. Somehow, senders should aggregate the <b>encrypted</b> <b>messages,</b> and the receiver should receive only the encrypted aggregation, which is a challenge in homomorphic encryption and trivial in DC-Nets due to the trade-off described in Section 7.4. 2. In this work, we are referencing DC-Nets as fully connected DC-Nets. For non-fully connected DC-Nets, aggregation is based on trust and generates new challenges. Sometimes, aggregation and consolidation are used as synonym. However, consolidation is more complicated and generates more elaborate information than the aggregation. For example, the aggregation of the <b>encrypted</b> textual <b>messages</b> is just to join them, while the consolidation of <b>encrypted</b> textual <b>messages</b> generates a speech synthesis.|$|R

2500|$|... "The world wonders" [...] was {{a phrase}} used as {{security}} padding in an <b>encrypted</b> <b>message</b> sent from Admiral Chester Nimitz to Admiral William Halsey, Jr. on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. [...] The words, {{intended to be}} without meaning, were added to hinder Japanese attempts at cryptanalysis, but were mistakenly included in the decoded message given to Halsey and interpreted by him as a harsh and sarcastic rebuke. As a consequence, Halsey dropped his pursuit of a Japanese carrier task force in a futile attempt to aid United States forces in the Battle off Samar.|$|E
2500|$|Al-Kindi is {{credited}} with developing a method whereby variations {{in the frequency of}} the occurrence of letters could be analyzed and exploited to break ciphers (i.e. cryptanalysis by frequency analysis). His book on this topic is Risāla fī Istikhrāj al-Kutub al-Mu'amāh [...] (رسالة في استخراج الكتب المعماة; literally: On Extracting Obscured Correspondence, more contemporary: On Decrypting Encrypted Correspondence [...] ).In his treatise on cryptanalysis,He wrote:One way to solve an <b>encrypted</b> <b>message,</b> if we know its language, is to find a different plaintext of the same language long enough to fill one sheet or so, and then we count the occurrences of each letter. We call the most frequently occurring letter the 'first', the next most occurring letter the 'second' the following most occurring letter the 'third', and so on, until we account for all the different letters in the plaintext sample. Then we look at the cipher text we want to solve and we also classify its symbols. We find the most occurring symbol and change it to the form of the 'first' letter of the plaintext sample, the next most common symbol is changed to the form of the 'second' letter, and the following most common symbol is changed to the form of the 'third' letter, and so on, until we account for all symbols of the cryptogram we want to solve.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} {{it is unclear}} if the first line begins with an [...] "M" [...] or [...] "W", but it is widely {{believed}} to be the letter W, owing to the distinctive difference when compared to the stricken letter M. There appears to be a deleted or underlined line of text that reads [...] "MLIAOI". Although the last character in this line of text looks like an [...] "L", it is fairly clear on closer inspection of the image that this is formed from an 'I' and the extension of the line used to delete or underline that line of text. Also, the other [...] "L" [...] has a curve to the bottom part of the character. There is also an [...] "X" [...] above the last 'O' in the code, and it is not known if this is significant to the code or not. Initially, the letters were thought to be words in a foreign language before it was realised it was a code. Code experts were called in at the time to decipher the lines but were unsuccessful. In 1978, following a request from ABC-TV journalist Stuart Littlemore, Department of Defence cryptographers analysed the handwritten text. The cryptographers reported that {{it would be impossible to}} provide [...] "a satisfactory answer": if the text was an <b>encrypted</b> <b>message,</b> its brevity meant that it had [...] "insufficient symbols", from which a clear meaning could be extracted, and the text could be the [...] "meaningless" [...] product of a [...] "disturbed mind".|$|E

50|$|In an identity-based {{conditional}} proxy re-encryption (IBCPRE) system, users {{set their}} public keys as unique {{identities of the}} users. One of the main advantages of using identity-based cryptographic algorithms is the elimination of public key certificates which can help enhance the usability of the target security applications. The term ‘Conditional’ in IBCPRE refers to an additional feature, which allows each <b>encrypted</b> <b>message</b> to have a ‘tag’ associated with. In addition to the tag, each re-encryption key also has a ‘tag’ attached.
