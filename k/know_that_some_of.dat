Licio Gelli declared that the presence of numerous members of P2 in the committees was casual, since numerous personalities were members at the time, and this was simply a statistic reflected by the composition of the committees. According to Gelli, some members of the committees did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their colleagues were also part of P2.|$|E
2500|$|Gnomes {{are seen}} and {{mentioned}} in every book, {{but we are}} not told very much about their race in general. [...] They are described as being about 2 feet tall.

Gnomes have been described as slightly stupid and very argumentative, and that they have massive backsides. It is not mentioned on whether or not Gnomes are a family of the fairies. [...] There is more or less one notable gnome mentioned in the Artemis Fowl series (Ark Sool) as the successor to Julius Root. Jerbal Argon is also a gnome.|$|E
2500|$|A major study {{published}} more recently in Nature Nanotechnology suggests {{some forms of}} carbon nanotubes – a poster child for the [...] "nanotechnology revolution" [...] – could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in sufficient quantities. Anthony Seaton of the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, who contributed to the article on carbon nanotubes said [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them probably {{have the potential to}} cause mesothelioma. So those sorts of materials need to be handled very carefully." [...] In the absence of specific regulation forthcoming from governments, Paull and Lyons (2008) have called for an exclusion of engineered nanoparticles in food. A newspaper article reports that workers in a paint factory developed serious lung disease and nanoparticles were found in their lungs.|$|E

50|$|It is well <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the main}} estrogens derive from androgens.

25|$|Though {{allegations}} were published against Wise of theft and forgery in 1934, {{it was not}} until 1959 that a detailed scientific investigation was published by the Bibliographic Society.
