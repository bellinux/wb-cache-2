40|$|Bioturbation {{activity}} of sediment-dwelling organisms promotes {{the release of}} contaminants across the benthic-pelagic <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundary,</b> thereby affecting the exposure to and uptake of sediment associated contaminants at the sediment-water interface by themselves and the entire community around them. This way, bioturbation activity may contribute to species specific sensitivities to sediment associated compounds. Therefore we assessed, based on literature data, if invertebrate bioturbation activity determines species specific sensitivities to sediment contamination. For two metals, Ni and Cu, sufficient data were available to construct Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD). The position of the species in the SSDs could indeed be linked to their bioturbation rate: the most active bioturbators being the most sensitive benthic invertebrates. Active bioturbators thus enhance their exposure and therewith their sensitivity to sediment associated toxicants. Moreover, active bioturbators can hence promote the release of sediment-associated contaminants across the benthic-pelagic <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundary,</b> thereby stimulating delivery of contaminants from what is often the most polluted environmental compartment in freshwater ecosystems. It is concluded that trait based ecotoxicology offers a possibly potent tool for predicting sensitivity of benthic invertebrates and the benthic community to sediment-associated contaminants...|$|E

The four-color theorem in mathematics maintains that only four colors are required to color a set of regions so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Before being proven in 1976, the theorem was considered the "four-color issue", which proposed that a small number of colors were required to separate regional boundaries. Applying the principle of "four-color issue" to the ecological field, we can also examine reducing the number of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundaries</b> considered.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of prey resources between ecosystems can have dramatic consequences for both recipient and donor systems by altering food web stability {{and the likelihood}} of trophic effects cascading across the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundary.</b> Landscape-scale factors influence the importance, direction and magnitude of energy flows, but may also alter the ability of consumer organisms to respond to spatio-temporal changes in allochthonous prey availability. Here, I used flood and drying disturbance gradients to investigate interactions between these two processes on populations of a riparian fishing spider Dolomedes aquaticus (Pisauridae). The abundance of aquatic insects with a winged adult stage, a major component of the diet of D. aquaticus, was markedly higher at less flood-prone rivers and declined with increasing flood disturbance. It was expected that spider populations would be largest at these stable rivers where the aquatic prey abundance was highest. However, a habitat (loose, unembedded riverbank rocks) manipulation revealed that the lack of scouring floods at these sites led to habitat-limited populations, preventing response to the increased prey resource. In fact a peak shaped relationship of spider biomass and abundance was found, with the largest spider populations at intermediately disturbed rivers. In addition, patchy habitat availability was the most likely cause of the small scale (4 m 2) aggregation of spiders seen at the most stable and disturbed rivers. These patterns were also associated with strong interactions between the spiders. Stable isotope analysis of field collected spiders and an experimental manipulation of spider densities and food availability indicated that cannibalism rates were likely to be significantly higher at stable and disturbed rivers than those intermediate on the disturbance gradient. Differences in D. aquaticus population size structure and life history traits across the flood disturbance gradient were driven by interactions between resource availability, environmental stability and cannibalism rates. To separate the effects of habitat availability and aquatic prey abundance I used drying rivers, as the amount of aquatic insect prey alters as the water recedes. Desiccation mortality and low aquatic prey biomass most likely caused the spiders' spatial distribution and size class structure to alter in drying river reaches, potentially also leading to differences in cannibalism rates. Overall, cross-ecosystem transfers of prey had large impacts on the distribution, cannibalism rates and life history traits of D. aquaticus but their effects were modified {{by the nature of the}} <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundary.</b> Thus river flow regime controlled the magnitude of the subsidy and its use by a consumer.

40|$|Biotic and abiotic {{interactions}} between adjacent ecosystems are common {{and can take}} the form of resource subsidies or spillover effects of disturbance. These cross-ecosystem exchanges may have significant impacts on the recipient ecosystem by altering the occurrence of strong biotic interactions, such as cannibalism. Cannibalism is ubiquitous and {{has the potential to be}} a defining feature in many food webs through impacts on population and community structure. However, there is little empirical evidence detailing how environmental gradients in adjacent ecosystems may alter cannibalism propensity of predators that live on the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundary.</b> We investigated cannibalism propensity of a riparian spider across a flooding gradient that altered both the magnitude of an allochthonous prey subsidy to the spider (winged aquatic insects) and spider habitat availability (loose riverbank rocks). Spider density was affected by the interaction of prey and habitat availability across the environmental gradient with small-scale spider densities highest at both stable and disturbed rivers and intermediate at others. Stable isotope analysis of spiders and a mesocosm experiment indicated that cannibalism was higher at stable and disturbed rivers. This demonstrates that an environmental gradient in one system can indirectly alter the propensity for strong biotic interactions of a consumer in an adjacent system through interactive effects of allochthonous and in situ resources.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundary</b> changes in northern Brazilian Amazonia during the Holocene period was investigated using soil organic carbon isotope ratios. Determination {{of past and}} present fluctuations of the forest-savanna boundary involved the measurement of natural 13 C isotope abundance, expressed as delta 13 C, in soil organic matter (SOM). SOM 13 C analyses and radiocarbon dating of charcoal fragments were carried out on samples derived from soil profiles taken along transects perpendicular to the ecotonal boundary. SOM delta 13 C values in the upper soil horizons appeared to be in equilibrium with the overlying vegetation types and did not point to a movement of the boundary during the last decades. However, delta 13 C values obtained from deeper savanna and forest soil layers indicated that the vegetation type has changed in the past. In current savanna soil profiles, we observed the presence of mid-Holocene charcoals derived from forest species : fire frequency at that time was probably greater, and more extensive savanna may have resulted. Isotope data and the presence of these charcoals thus suggest that the forest-savanna boundary has shifted significantly in the recent Holocene period, forest being more extensive during the early Holocene than today. During the middle Holocene, the forest could have strongly regressed, and fires appeared, with a maximum development of the savanna vegetation. At the beginning of the late Holocene, the forest may have invaded a part of this savanna, and fires occurred again. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

In response to the pulse, consumers showed marked diet segregation.

The inventory presents parameters measured on hydrodynamics, nutrient dynamics, ecosystem dynamics and pollutant dynamics in the pelagic and benthic realm. The research program had the objective of quantifying fluxes of major budgets, especially contaminants in the North Sea. In spring 1986, following the phytoplankton spring bloom, and in late winter 1987, at minimum primary production activity, the North Sea ecosystem was investigated on a station net covering the whole North Sea. The station net was shaped like a star. Sampling started in the centre, followed by the northwest section and moving counter clockwise around the North Sea following the residual currents. By this strategy, a time series was measured in the central North Sea and more synoptic data sets were obtained in the individual sections. Generally advection processes {{have to be considered}} when comparing the data from different stations. The entire sampling period lasted for more than six weeks in each cruise. Thus, a time-lag should be considered especially when comparing the data from the eastern and {{the western part of the}} central and northern North Sea, where samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the campaign.

40|$|Understanding and {{modeling}} water exchange in and and semiarid ecosystems {{is complicated by}} the very heterogeneous distribution of vegetation and moisture inputs, and the difficulty of measuring and validating component fluxes at a common scale. We combined eddy covariance (EC), sap flow, and stable isotope techniques to investigate the responses of transpiration and soil evaporation to an irrigation event in an olive (Olea europaea L.) orchard in Marrakech, Morocco. The primary goal was to evaluate the usefulness of stable isotope measurements of water vapor in the turbulent boundary layer for partitioning evapotranspiration under Such dynamic conditions. The concentration and deuterium isotope composition (delta(2) H) of water vapor was collected from different heights within the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundary</b> layer of the olive canopy before and over several days following a 100 mm surface irrigation. 'Keeling plots' (isotope turbulent mixing relationships) were generated from these data to estimate the fractions of evaporation and transpiration contributing to the total evapotranspiration (ET) flux. Transpiration accounted for 100 % of total ET prior to irrigation, but only 69 - 36 % of ET during peak midday fluxes over the 5 -day period following irrigation. The rate of soil evaporation and plant transpiration at the stand level was calculated from eddy covariance measurements and the evaporation and transpiration fractions from isotope measurements. Soil evaporation rate was positively correlated with daily atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D), but transpiration was not. Component fluxes estimated from the isotope technique were then compared to those obtained from scaled sap flow measurements. Sap flow in multiple-stemmed trees increased following the irrigation, but large single-stemmed trees did not. We matched the source area for eddy covariance estimates of total ET fluxes with scaled sap flow estimates developed for the different tree types. Soil evaporation was determined from the difference between total ET and the scaled sap flow. Ecosystem-level transpiration and soil evaporation estimated by the isotope approach were within 4 and 15 % of those estimated by scaled sap flow, respectively, for periods of peak fluxes at midday. Our data illustrate the utility of the isotope 'Keeling plot' approach for partitioning ET at the ecosystem scale on short time steps and the importance of accurate spatial representation of scaled sap flow for comparison with eddy covariance measurements of ET.

40|$|Major {{changes have}} taken place in both the plant (phyto-) and animal (zoo-) {{plankton}} of the seas around the British Isles over the last few decades. They include: The important decadal climate indicator for the North Atlantic, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), has been generally rising (with occasional negative NAO years) along with Northern Hemisphere Temperatures over the past 30 years and the surface waters of the European Continental shelf have been warming. This has caused extensive changes in the planktonic ecosystem in terms of plankton production, biodiversity, and species distribution which have had effects on fisheries production and other marine life (e. g. seabirds) (Reid & Edwards, 2001; Edwards et al., 2001, 2002; Beaugrand et al., 2003, 2004; Richardson & Schoeman, 2004; Southward et al., 2004; Alheit et al., 2005; Heath, 2005). In the North Sea the population of the previously dominant and important zooplankton species, (the cold water copepod Calanus finmarchicus) has declined in biomass by 70 % since the 1960 s. Species with warmer-water affinities (e. g. Calanus helgolandicus) are moving northward to replace the species but are not numerically as abundant (Beaugrand et al., 2004; Edwards et al., 2007). There has been a northward shift in the distribution of many plankton and fish species by more than 10 o latitude over the past fifty years. This shift is particularly associated with the shelf edge current running north along the European continental margin (Beaugrand et al., 2002; Brander et al., 2003; Genner et al., 2004). The seasonal timing of plankton production has also been altered in response to recent climate changes. This has consequences for plankton predator species, including fish, whose life cycles are timed in order to make use of seasonal production of particular prey species (Edwards & Richardson, 2004). The decline of the European cod stocks due to overfishing may have been exacerbated by climate warming and climate induced changes in plankton production. It is hypothesised that the survival of young cod in the North Sea depends on the abundance, seasonal timing and size composition of their planktonic prey. As the stocks declined they have become more sensitive to the effects of regional climate warming due to shrinkage of the age distribution and geographic extent (Brander, 2005). The effects of an abrupt ecosystem shift in the late 1990 s were most pronounced in regions of the north-eastern Atlantic near the 9 - 10 °C sea surface temperature isotherm, a critical thermal boundary between 'warm' and 'cold' water ecosystems. As waters warm this <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundary</b> has moved northwards. Future warming is likely to alter the geographical distribution of primary and secondary pelagic production, affecting ecosystem services such as oxygen production, carbon sequestration and biogeochemical cycling. These changes may place additional stress on already-depleted fish stocks as well as have consequences for mammal and seabird populations...|$|E

Additionally, {{little is known about}} how cross-ecosystem resource transfer affects source populations. We used experiments, observations and stable isotopes, to evaluate: (1) the proportion of intertidal-foraging black fire ant (Solenopsis richteri) diet derived from marine sources, (2) how black fire ant cross-ecosystem resource transfer is altered by the dominant bioengineer in the intertidal, a burrowing crab (Neohelice granulata), (3) the top-down impact of these terrestrial ants on a marine resource, and (4) the effect of marine resources on recipient black fire ants. We found that more than 85 % of the black fire ant diet is derived from marine sources, the number of intertidal foraging ants doubles in the absence of crab burrows, and that ants cause a 50 % reduction in intertidal polychaetes. Also, ant mound density is three times greater adjacent to marine systems. This study reveals that cross-ecosystem foraging terrestrial ants can clearly have strong impacts on marine resources. Furthermore, ecosystem engineers that modify and occupy habitat in these <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundaries</b> can strongly regulate the degree of cross-ecosystem resource transfer and resultant top down impacts...|$|R

40|$|Ecosystem {{management}} is an integrative, cooperative, adaptive approach to resource management that has evolved {{in response to}} the growing number of environmental and resource problems over the past several decades. One such problem, the threat to the world’s biodiversity, may be attributed to the destruction, degradation, and fragmentation of habitat resulting from the expanding human population, and the inability to set aside in strict nature reserves, sufﬁcient habitat for wide-ranging mammals and fully functioning ecosystems. The Greater Park Ecosystem concept may be seen as the embodiment of ecosystem management in national parks and a response to the threat to biodiversity. A major challenge to effective implementation of such an idea is deﬁning the boundaries of the management unit or ecosystem. Delineation of these boundaries may be guided by principles of protected area design, as well as by previous efforts to delineate ecosystem boundaries. However, any approach used to delineate the boundaries of a Greater Park Ecosystem should be consistent with the objectives and principles of ecosystem management, both its ecological (substantive) and sociopolitical (process) aspects. In this study an evaluation of previous efforts to delineate ecosystem boundaries was carried out. It concluded, based on criteria drawn from the literature on ecosystem management, national parks management, and protected area design, that no single approach adequately addressed the problem of protecting native biological diversity in national parks, in the face of increasing pressures from beyond the park boundaries. The approach suggested in this study addresses substantive ecological concerns as well as the process of boundary delineation itself. It considers abiotic, biotic, and cultural features and processes of the park region, particularly those that traverse official park boundaries. The location of signiﬁcant and/or representative features and processes guides the preliminary placement of the Greater Park <b>Ecosystem</b> <b>boundary,</b> which will likely change with input from the various stakeholders. The suggested approach addresses the process of boundary delineation by encouraging participation of all stakeholders in the region, fostering a cooperative approach among competing resource users, and ensuring that institutional structures are appropriate. An overriding consideration is that the ﬁnal boundaries encompass an area that is sufficiently large to support a minimum viable population of the most space-demanding species in the region. The substantive aspects of this suggested approach were illustrated in this study with reference to Gros Morne National Park in western Newfoundland. The resulting Greater Gros Morne Ecosystem boundaries were compared to several other alternatives which were based on the boundaries of the region’s ecoregions, physiographic regions, and the Western Newfoundland Model Forest. The suggested boundaries were shown to be superior to the other alternatives in terms of signiﬁcant habitat characteristics, human land use, watershed integrity as well as several other measures. A preliminary assessment of the process components of the suggested approach, again with respect to Gros Morne National Park, revealed that the agencies responsible for resource management in Newfoundland appear to be moving toward an ecosystem management philosophy. The need for greater integration, cooperation, and adaptability has been widely acknowledged. From the general public, there appears to be more appreciation of the consequences of poor resource management, due primarily to the collapse of the Northern cod ﬁshery, greater acceptance of new ideas, and a demand for more input from local groups and individuals. Despite this, the lack of alternative employment opportunities outside the extractive resource sector, and the long history of unrestricted local resource use remain barriers to widespread acceptance of the Greater Gros Morne Ecosystem concept...|$|E

In this study, we manipulated two terrestrial bromeliad-living spider species (Aglaoctenus castaneus, Corinna gr. rubripes) that have variable hunting modes, to test their individual and combined effects on aquatic invertebrate community structure and ecosystem processes (i. e. decomposition rate and nitrogen cycling). We predicted that these terrestrial predators can affect aquatic invertebrates and nutrient dynamics within water-filled bromeliads. 3. Aglaoctenus spiders reduced the richness, abundance and biomass of aquatic insect larvae via consumptive or non-consumptive effects on ovipositing terrestrial adults, but effects of the two spider species in combination were usually the linear average of their monoculture effects. In contrast, invertebrates with entirely aquatic life cycles were unaffected or facilitated by spiders. Spiders did not affect either net detritivore biomass or the flux of detrital nitrogen to the bromeliad. Instead, Corinna spiders contributed allochthonous nitrogen to bromeliads. 4. Our results provide the novel observations that predators in one ecosystem not only directly reduce taxa whose life cycles cross-ecosystem boundaries, but also indirectly facilitate taxa whose life cycles are entirely within the second ecosystem. This compensatory response between cross-ecosystem and within-ecosystem taxa may have led to an attenuation of top-down effects across <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundaries.</b> In addition, our results add to a growing consensus that species identity is an important determinant of community structure and ecosystem functioning.

We characterized a marsh pulsed subsidy of cyprinodontoid, invertebrate and sunfish prey that move into the upper estuary from adjacent drying marshes. In response to the prey pulse, we examined the numerical, fitness and dietary responses of three focal consumers in the upper estuary; two marsh species (largemouth bass and bowfin) that accompanied the subsidy as a result of marsh drying, and one estuarine consumer (snook). At the onset of marsh drying and the prey subsidy, estuarine consumers switched diets to consume the larger marsh prey (sunfishes), while bass and bowfin maintained similar diets (cyprinodontoids and invertebrates respectively) than pre and post subsidy. From the consumption of this subsidy, bass (marsh species) and snook (estuarine species) exhibited fitness gains while bowfin did not. Although both marsh and estuarine consumers benefitted from the subsidy, we found evidence that freshwater consumers shunted some of the subsidy away from snook. Of the prey sampled in consumer stomachs, 41 % of marsh prey biomass was eaten by marsh consumers, while 59 % was consumed by the estuarine consumer. We conclude that the amount of the marsh prey available to estuarine consumers may be greater in the absence of marsh consumers, thus the magnitude of the prey subsidy could depend on the dynamics of the marsh consumers from donor communities...|$|R

Higher organic C inputs through decomposition of plant residues helped in increasing microbial activities. In this study, we evaluated soil quality indicators in different geranium-based intercropping systems. Our overall interpretation of these diverse sets of data is that the quality of soils varies with different geranium-based intercropping conditions. The incorporation of berseem and pulses as intercrops (biological N fixer) led to improved soil chemical and biological properties in a temperate region.|$|R
30|$|Assessment {{of water}} quality is {{important}} because clean water is necessary for human use {{and the integrity of}} aquatic ecosystem. It is usually monitored through conventional method, which involves in situ measurements of physical, chemical, biological, microbiological, and radiological parameters and/or the collection of water samples for laboratory analysis and then comparing with the existing guidelines and standards for designated uses viz drinking, bathing, irrigation provided by national and international agencies. But, guidelines for the protection of aquatic life are more difficult to set, largely because aquatic ecosystems vary enormously in their composition both spatially and temporally, and also because <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundaries</b> rarely coincide with territorial ones. Therefore, scientific community are focusing on the spatiotemporal variations of water quality constituents and impacts of geographical factors and variations in human activities.|$|R
40|$|Migratory {{animals such as}} seabirds, {{salmon and}} whales can {{transport}} large quantities of nutrients across <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundaries,</b> greatly enriching recipient food webs. As many of these animals biomagnify contaminants, they can also focus pollutants at toxic levels. Seabirds arguably represent the most significant biovectors of nutrients and contaminants from the ocean to the land, given their sheer numbers and global distribution. However, long-term census data on seabirds are rare. Using palaeolimnological proxies, we show that a colony of Arctic seabirds has experienced climate-induced population increases in recent decades. We then document increasing concentrations of contaminants, including polychlorinated biphenyls and cadmium, in pond sediments that are linked to biotransport by seabirds. Our findings suggest that climate-related shifts in global seabird populations will have the unexpected consequence of restructuring coastal ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} conduct a replicable {{analysis}} of the possible phylogenetic patterns of extinction risk, one must first formulate a clear set of definitions of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundaries</b> and risk categories. Subsequently, a robust and internally consistent dataset that includes all the available information on species distributions and risk assessments must be assembled. Here, we review the dataset and methodology of a recent paper focused on phylogenetic patterns of plant extinction risk in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Kenya and Tanzania and point {{out some of the}} limitations of inferring such patterns from inadequate and biased data. We show that bias in the dataset is probably responsible for the conclusion that Vulnerable species are more closely related than expected by chance, and provide guidelines for the construction of an appropriate dataset for such an analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{relevance}} of the boundary concept to ecological processes has been recently questioned. Humans in the post-industrial era have created novel lateral transport fluxes {{that have not been}} sufficiently considered in watershed studies. We describe patterns of land-use change within the Potomac River basin and demonstrate how these changes have blurred traditional <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundaries</b> by increasing the movement of people, materials, and energy into and within the basin. We argue that this expansion of ecological commerce requires new science, monitoring, and management strategies focused on large rivers and suggest that traditional geopolitical and economic boundaries for environmental decision making be appropriately revised. Effective mitigation of the consequences of blurred boundaries will benefit from a broad-scale, interdisciplinary framework that can track and explicitly account for ecological fluxes of water, energy, materials, and organisms across human-dominated landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{quality or}} health {{can be defined}} as the {{capacity}} of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or managed <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundaries,</b> to (1) sustain plant and animal productivity, (2) maintain or enhance water and air quality, and (3) support human health and habitation. Soil quality encompasses the interrelated physical, chemical, and biological aspects of soil. Irrigated growers in the Columbia Basin of Washington State have expressed increased interest in improving soil quality and in learning about the benefits versus the costs of implementing soil improvement practices. In addition, producers have been under increasing public scrutiny concerning efforts to maintain and improve soil resources, especially for off-farm impacts such as wind erosion and water quality. This publication discusses factors affecting soil management and soil improvement practices among irrigated growers in the Columbia Basin of Washington State...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Understanding how {{long-term}} abiotic and bio-tic {{processes are}} linked at a landscape level is of major interest for analyzing future impact on humans {{and the environment}} from present-day societal planning. This article uses results derived from multidisciplinary work at a coastal site in Sweden, {{with the aim of}} describing future landscape development. First, based on current and his-torical data, we identified climate change, shoreline dis-placement, and accumulation/erosion processes as the main drivers of landscape development. Second, site-specific information was combined with data from the Scandina-vian region to build models that describe how the identified processes may affect the site development through time. Finally, the process models were combined to describe a whole interglacial period. With this article, we show how the landscape and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>boundaries</b> are affected by changing permafrost conditions, peat formation, sedimen-tation, human land use, and shoreline displacement...|$|R
25|$|Each of {{the five}} major regions has a {{distinct}} <b>ecosystem.</b> Administrative <b>boundaries</b> do not necessarily coincide with ecological boundaries, however. In addition to differences in physical environment, patterns of economic activity and population settlement vary widely among the regions. The principal ecological characteristics of each {{of the five}} major regions, as well as their principal socioeconomic and demographic features, are summarized below.|$|R
