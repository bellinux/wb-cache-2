2500|$|In {{the liner}} lock, an [...] "L"-shaped {{split in the}} liner allows part of the liner to move {{sideways}} from its resting position against the handle to {{the centre of the}} knife where it rests against the flat end of the tang. To disengage, this leaf spring is pushed so it again rests flush against the handle allowing the knife to rotate. A <b>frame</b> <b>lock</b> is functionally identical but instead of using a thin liner inside the handle material uses a thicker piece of metal as the handle and the same split in it allows a section of the frame to press against the tang.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{variations}} on the Linerlock or locking liner, depending on the knife manufacturer. One example would be the <b>frame</b> <b>lock,</b> sometimes called the Reeve Integral Lock and used on the Sebenza. With the [...] "frame lock," [...] the frame rather than the liner acts like the leaf spring/lock bar. [...] Another variation, known as the inset Linerlock has the leaf spring embedded into the plastic scales of the handle, technically forgoing a metal liner. Kershaw Knives uses [...] "a pin-and-dimple lock" [...] on a knife designed by custom knifemaker RJ Martin called the [...] "Nerve" [...] to keep the blade closed.|$|E

The eye bolts are usually {{placed at the}} bottom of the <b>frame,</b> <b>locking</b> above the arm to prevent accidental release. In larger designs, the trigger system is applied at the top of the drop channel. Large scale designs require special trigger mechanisms that can hold the weight of the throwing arm.|$|R

5000|$|Before Porter Rogers {{could call}} to Signalman Jones {{to release the}} ground <b>frame</b> <b>lock,</b> the {{stopping}} train arrived. The youth, Thompson, collected the tablet for the Montgomery-Abermule section from {{the driver of the}} stopping train, and was heading back to the station buildings {{to put it in the}} tablet instrument when he met Lewis returning from the goods yard. He gave the tablet to Lewis, saying that he had to go and collect the tickets (although only one passenger had alighted from the train). He did not mention that he had yet to exchange the tablet for one for the Abermule-Newtown section (which he could not have done, because the Abermule-Newtown tablet machine was still locked). Thompson also mistakenly told Lewis that the express was still [...] "about Moat Lane", presumably from having overheard some of Jones's earlier telephone conversation.|$|E

50|$|The {{method used}} {{to lock the}} drum against the device frame is {{by the use of}} two {{straight}} knurl edge discs that are thrown outwards by centrifugal force as they ride on parallel ramps milled into the drum's enclosed outer periphery. Two light return springs act as centrifugal force trips and as return springs to reset the discs when the fall load is released and the device is unlocked. A simple nylon guide is used to ensure both discs activate simultaneously to jam the discs between each drum ramp and the <b>frame's</b> <b>lock</b> ring.|$|R

50|$|The tripod mount, {{designed}} by L. V. Stepanov for the PKM machine gun entered service in 1969 and weighs 4.5 kg. It is a lighter mount for the PK(M) general-purpose machine gun without affecting {{the accuracy of}} fire. Besides, the Stepanov mount has 20 fewer components than the preceding Samozhenkov tripod and is 40% less labour-intensive.The Stepanov mount {{is based on a}} principle of multi-functional components: the elevation mechanism frame is also used as a pole for kneeled shooting or anti-aircraft fire; the base sleeve also serves as the axis for attaching rear legs of the tripod: the machine gun attachment is combined with the elevation mechanism <b>frame</b> <b>lock</b> for anti-aircraft fire; the fine elevation adjustment mechanism is integrated with the elevation mechanism axis. The ammunition belt box can be secured to the right rear tripod leg. This enables one crew member to carry and operate the gun in combat without having to unload the gun before repositioning the gun.|$|E
5000|$|... Day: Lee, Caffell, Vander Byl* Ice hazard - Packed ice {{beginning}} {{to fall from}} mast & stays. Roads close to station temporarily closed by Councils. Please notify councils when roads are safe (!)* Pye monitor - no <b>frame</b> <b>lock</b> - V10 replaced (low ins). Monitor overheating due to fan choked up with dust- cleaned out, motor lubricated and fan blades reset.* Evening :- Glendenning, Bottom, Redgrove* 1265 ft Mast :- Fell down across Jagger Lane (corner of Common Lane) at 17:01:45. Police, I.T.A. HQ, R.O., etc., all notified.* Mast Power Isolator :- Fuses removed & isolator locked in the [...] "OFF" [...] position. All isolators in basement feeding mast stump also switched off. Dehydrators & TXs switched off. The collapse left sections of twisted mast strewn over the transmitter site, and across the junction of Common Lane and Jagger Lane, and the surrounding fields. Although a falling stay cable cut through a local church and across the transmitter site buildings, no one was injured. It completely disabled the BBC2 UHF transmitter and the ITV VHF transmitter, leaving several million people without service. BBC1 VHF television transmissions continued from Holme Moss. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) owned a collapsible emergency mast, 61 m tall, which was moved to Emley from the Lichfield transmitting station so that some service could be restored. ITV signals were restored to 2.5 million viewers within four days. The BBC provided a mobile mast on an outside broadcast van to restore a restricted BBC2 colour service within two days. The ITA bought a larger temporary mast from a Swedish company. A crew of Polish riggers were hired, and a 204 m mast was erected in under 28 days {{at a cost of}} £100,000. This mast could hold only one set of antennas, so many viewers in outlying areas still could not receive colour programmes. The taller mast was brought into service on 16 April. Some weeks later, the BBC erected a 91 m mast, improving coverage.|$|E
30|$|In {{the typical}} tiled display {{architecture}} as described above, rendering nodes send parts of overall image to be displayed to individual display nodes. The display nodes then utilize a distributed synchronization algorithm and individually display {{parts of the}} image on their display tiles to provide the overall perception of a single continuous image. In some cases, the display nodes can utilize advanced graphics cards such as Nvidia Quadro family of cards and can utilize Genlock <b>frame</b> <b>lock</b> [8] to achieve a better frame synchronization amongst them. However, these cards are expensive. Furthermore, the Genlock <b>frame</b> <b>lock</b> techniques cannot completely solve the synchronization problem as each display node is receiving its image parts over the network. Thus, the image part ready to be displayed by each node at a given refresh instance (e.g., at 60 [*]Hz) may {{not belong to the}} same overall image depending upon the network stream reception performance of each node.|$|E

Changes advised at the FC-FS- 3 and 16 GFC Protocols teleconference on 21 July 2009 have been made. Major differences from version 4 include a) the specification of Forward Error Correction (FEC) is included, by incorporation of T 11 / 09 - 397 v 1; b) the state machine for Transmitter Training Signal Transmission Word synchronization has been changed to {{a reference to the}} 10 GBASE-KR PMD <b>Frame</b> <b>lock</b> state machine in IEEE 802. 3 : 2008, rather than an 8 B/ 10 B-like state machine specified here; and c) the 64 B/ 66 B Transmitter Training Transmission Word synchronization state and the Transmitter Training Transmission Word synchronization state have added dependencies on the (optional) Loss-of-Signal indication.

Finally, a cap on the end of a screw attached to the stem slides into a slot on the drive side of the mainframe, securing it.

40|$|We {{consider}} relativistic non-Abelian superfluids, {{where the}} expectation {{value of the}} global symmetry currents relate space and internal indices, thus creating a "locked" phase. Locking a superfluid with SU(2) internal symmetry in 2 + 1 dimensions breaks parity spontaneously, and introduces parity-odd terms in the constitutive relations. We show that there are qualitatively different extensions of the rest <b>frame</b> <b>locking</b> to non-zero velocities. We construct the resulting superfluid hydrodynamics {{up to the first}} derivative order.
