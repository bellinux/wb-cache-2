500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if {{the words came out}} like the music, and we didn't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Lane {{reunited with}} Richard Gere for the romantic drama Nights in Rodanthe. It {{is the third}} film Gere and Lane filmed together, {{and is based on}} the novel of the same title by Nicholas Sparks. Lane also co-starred in Jumper and Untraceable in the same year. She then {{appeared}} in Killshot with Mickey Rourke, which was given a limited theatrical release before being released on DVD in 2009. While promoting Nights in Rodanthe, she expressed frustration with being typecast and stated that she was [...] "gunning for something that's not so sympathetic. I need to be a bitch, and I need to be in a comedy. I've decided. No more Miss Nice Guy." [...] Lane had even contemplated quitting acting and spending more time with her family if she is unable to get these kinds of roles. She said in an interview, [...] "I can't do anything official. My agents won't let me. Between you and me, I don't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> coming out." [...] Despite her concerns with being typecast, Lane signed on to Secretariat (2010), a Disney film about the relationship between the 1973 Triple Crown-winning racehorse and his owner, Penny Chenery, whom Lane portrayed.|$|E
500|$|The {{entire staff}} agrees to pool their points towards Andy's butt tattoo, {{and the office}} {{suddenly}} becomes a hubbub of activity, with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) even giving up his nap-time to make sales calls for Sabre's new Pyramid tablet. To Andy's great dismay, they earn 5,000 points {{by the end of}} the day. When Andy and the crew go to the tattoo parlor, Andy backs down and admits to Jim that he is not sure why Robert made him manager. Jim reassures Andy that he managed to pick up sales, and that no one in the office expects him to go through with the tattoo idea. Pepped up by Jim's talk, Andy enthusiastically agrees to getting the tattoo, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) changes, without telling Andy, to an image of a dog that has [...] "Nard" [...] written on it, a reference to Andy's nickname [...] "Nard Dog." [...] Upon seeing his completed tattoo in a mirror, Andy is pleased with the result. Robert then reveals to the cameras that he picked Andy because he is an uncomplicated choice which causes people to rally behind him, because he is an underdog. Meanwhile, Pam and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) become walking buddies at Angela's request, but after Angela says she's reported Pam to Social Services for drinking herbal tea out of coffee mugs while pregnant, a disgusted Pam tells Angela they should not <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to do with each other.|$|E

2500|$|Lü Yi's {{abuses of}} power {{finally came to}} an end in 238 when Sun Quan learnt the truth about him and {{understood}} the gravity of the situation. Lü Yi was removed from office and imprisoned under the watch of the Ministry of Justice. Sun Quan then put Gu Yong in charge of investigating Lü Yi's crimes. While interrogating Lü Yi, Gu Yong maintained his composure and performed his job professionally. Before Lü Yi was escorted out, Gu Yong asked him, [...] "Do you <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to say?" [...] Lü Yi kowtowed and remained silent. When another official Huai Xu (懷叙) started scolding Lü Yi, Gu Yong sternly rebuked him, [...] "As government officials, we should follow the laws. Why must you do this?" [...] Some officials proposed that Lü Yi be executed by burning or dismemberment – so as to highlight the severity of his crimes – instead of beheading. When Sun Quan sought Kan Ze's opinion on this, the latter replied that burning and dismemberment should be not be used as means of execution in a civilised age. Sun Quan heeded his advice and probably had Lü Yi executed by beheading.|$|E

She recalled: [...] "Everyone was there and Ja [...] {{was on the floor}} playing video games, and they had the beat playing in the background. Chris Gotti, Irv Gotti's brother, said 'Ja's supposed to be writing this record for J-Lo, but it doesn't look like he's going to be doing anything tonight. Why don't you go in there and see what's happening?' So that's exactly what I did." [...] Ashanti wrote two verses and recorded a demo for the new version of [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] for Lopez. Gotti and 7 flew out to Los Angeles on September 10, 2001 to record the song with Lopez. The song was due to be recorded the following day, but was postponed due to the September 11 attacks. When work resumed on the song, Gotti called Ashanti from Los Angeles asking her to write another verse for the song.

St. Paul Church Of God In Christ was and still is my home church". Furthermore, she explained, [...] "I sang my first solo at the age of seven. I directed the choir, I was an usher. I was a straight-up church girl. I did a lot of stuff in the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school." [...] In discussing the musical transition she said, [...] "it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so I had to do it. I thought {{that it would be a}} perfect time. Choosing to do this at the height of my career rather than doing it when Destiny's Child is at a downfall, you know? Most people do that. They go Gospel when they don't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to do anymore, you know? I chose to do this while I can reach people." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Nazi {{seizure of}} power work became {{harder for the}} Social Democrats in Cuxhaven. The NSDAP put the elected mayor Werner Grube (DVP) on leave, {{claiming}} that the composition of Council and City Parliament did no longer fit [...] "the people's will". Grube was now temporarily deputised by government building officer Schätzler (NSDAP). On 9 May 1933 the SPD councillors were removed from all boardp. Anna Strohsahl thereupon claimed that [...] "it cannot be {{the sense of the}} Gleichschaltung to completely exclude the Left from cooperation, which is representing 4000 voterp." [...] 19 May 1933 the Council decided to pay the 50 Reichsmark expense allowance only to councillors heading a board in future. In a City Parliament session counsillor Morisse declared to no longer setting value on the Social Democrats' work: [...] "You don't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to do than to be ashamed and to keep silent." [...] After this, Anna Strohsahl and the complete SPD group left the City Parliament. Following the prohibition of SPD on 22 June 1933 her political work ended for the time being. Also the personal situation of the Strohsahl family worsened, harassing controls by the National Socialists increased. The supervisory school authority retroactively changed the passed high school diploma of her daughter Ruth from [...] "good" [...] to [...] "poor/fail" [...] which made her flee to the UK.

2500|$|For {{his first}} series, {{producer}} Barry Letts had primarily worked on stories {{inherited from the}} previous production team. [...] When it came to assessing his and script editor Terrance Dicks' approach to the next series, they identified a need to replace the Doctor's assistant, {{for the purposes of}} exposition and audience identification. Previous companion Liz Shaw had been conceived of as a brilliant scientist who could discuss matters with the Doctor on an equal footing; the replacement would be younger and more naive, someone who could ask, [...] "Doctor, what's all this about?" [...] An early memo described Grant as [...] "Not a scientist, though with enough basic background to understand what's going on. Other sources, including Barry Letts, have said there was an initial idea to make the character more 'exotic' with a tougher, sexier edge, but not academically brilliant, so as to give the Doctor the much-wanted (by Pertwee) chance to play the father figure. [...] Along with the Brigadier's new second in command, Captain Mike Yates, the character of Jo Grant was inspired by the male-female companion pairing of Jamie McCrimmon and Victoria Waterfield, whom Letts had previously directed, with the intention of a possible romantic subplot for the two. Manning stated in an 1998 interview with SFX however, that [...] "With Jon and I {{there was no need to}} put any love interests into the show because there was this closeness between Jo and the Doctor, and there was no room for them to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> going." ...|$|E
2500|$|Portrait of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge is {{the first}} {{official}} portrait of the Duchess. Emsley, originally of South Africa and a 2007 recipient of the BP Portrait Award, had previously painted portraits of Nelson Mandela and Naipaul. In a video interview for The Daily Telegraph, Emsley suggested that beginning he was thrilled to receive the commission. [...] "Slowly" [...] he says he realized {{the importance of the}} project was, not just for himself, but for many others, making him slightly nervous. He was keen to capture Catherine's [...] "charm, serenity and intelligence" [...] and [...] "sparkling green eyes". The Duchess sat for him twice—for a day's session in May at the artist's studio in Bradford-upon-Avon, and a brief session in June at Kensington Palace, where he did quick drawings and took more photographs—and he used photographs to assist him. He describes her during the process as [...] "quite amenable". According to Emsley, Catherine had asked for herself to be painted naturally, as opposed to her official self." [...] It shows Catherine wearing a bottle green pussy bow blouse, looking straight out from the picture, smirking, rather than grinning. The artist noted that, if too defined, smiling portraiture occasionally may [...] "look like caricatures". Emsley darkened the eyes slightly to match her tunic; the background is also shaded in a similar hue of dark green. Emsley was also keen {{to draw attention to the}} rich texture of her hair. Talking to the BBC after criticism of his work, he noted that he didn't want to overwhelm her face. Emsley said, [...] "I don't have lots of things in the background. I do like large faces, I find them strong and contemporary. I'm interested in the landscape of the face, the way in which light and shadow fall across the forms. That's really my subject matter. To <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in there is really just an interference." [...] As Catherine's image [...] "is so pervasive", he told the media he needed to go past the image on his mind.|$|E
