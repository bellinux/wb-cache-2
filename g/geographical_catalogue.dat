40|$|Geo-spatial {{applications}} need {{to provide}} powerful search capabilities to support users in their daily activities. However, discovery services are often limited by only syntactically matching user terminology to metadata describing geographical resources. We report our work on {{the implementation of a}} <b>geographical</b> <b>catalogue,</b> and corresponding semantic extension, for the spatial data infrastructure (SDI) of the Autonomous Province of Trento (PAT) in Italy. We focus in particular to the semantic extension which is based on the adoption of the S-Match semantic matching tool and on the use of a faceted ontology codifying geographical domain specific knowledge. We finally report our experience in the integration of the faceted ontology with the multi-lingual geo-spatial ontology GeoWordNet...|$|E
40|$|The Patrimony Atlas of Seine-Saint-Denis (north of Paris) is an {{information}} tool {{related to the}} archaeological, architectural and landscape patrimony of Seine-Saint-Denis, accessible on the Internet address [URL] It is distributed by the Cultural Patrimony Service of the Department of Seine-Saint-Denis, and is registered in the National Patrimony Atlas project of the Ministry of Culture. It is organized into three categories. The documentation platforms gather: a <b>geographical</b> <b>catalogue</b> which includes 50 levels of information geographically referenced, which are free of copyrights and can circulate online; a bibliography with 3700 references classified according to borough, subject and time period; an iconographic catalogue with 2800 images, the issues of archaeological maps and patrimony inventory that collect and collate past data. The “territorial views” offer a rapid access to a selection of ancient maps that represent a selected point on the territory on a contemporary basis, like the Napoleonic cadastral tables. The “Documents” file gathers the documents in a PDF format: university projects, thematic studies, articles and monographs, methodologies, summary charts, as well as hypertext documents, a presentation {{of the evolution of}} the road network {{in the latter part of}} the 18 th century, a “Mathériauthèque numérique” dedicated to construction materials, and an “Atlas des colleges” of Seine-Saint-Denis. In its present version (2. 5. 3, put online in March 2008), the Seine-Saint-Denis Patrimony Atlas receives between 12, 000 and 14, 000 hits per month...|$|E
500|$|In reality, Roman {{expansion}} {{was mostly}} accomplished under the Republic, though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century AD, when Roman control in Europe, Africa and Asia was strengthened. During {{the reign of}} Augustus, a [...] "global map of the known world" [...] was displayed {{for the first time}} in public at Rome, coinciding with the composition of the most comprehensive work on political geography that survives from antiquity, the Geography of the Pontic Greek writer Strabo. When Augustus died, the commemorative account of his achievements (Res Gestae) prominently featured the <b>geographical</b> <b>cataloguing</b> of peoples and places within the Empire. Geography, the census, and the meticulous keeping of written records were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration.|$|R
40|$|<b>Geographical</b> <b>cataloguing</b> of traits, as used {{in human}} ethnography, {{has led to the}} {{description}} of ‘culture’ in some non-human great apes. Culture, in these terms, is detected as a pattern of local ignorance resulting from environmental constraints on knowledge transmission. However, in many cases, the geographical variations may alternatively be explained by ecology. Social transmission of information can reliably be identified in many other animal species, by experiment or distinctive patterns in distribution; but the excitement of detecting culture in great apes derives from the possibility of understanding the evolution of cumulative technological culture in humans. Given this interest, I argue that great ape research should concentrate on technically complex behaviour patterns that are ubiquitous within a local population; in these cases, a wholly non-social ontogeny is highly unlikely. From this perspective, cultural transmission has {{an important role in the}} elaborate feeding skills of all species of great ape, in conveying the ‘gist’ or organization of skills. In contrast, social learning is unlikely to be responsible for local stylistic differences, which are apt to reflect sensitive adaptations to ecology...|$|R
