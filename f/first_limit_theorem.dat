Szegő's Second (or Strong) Limit Theorem for Toeplitz matrices gives a second order correction to the <b>First</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>Theorem,</b> and {{allows one to}} calculate asymptotics for the determinants of large Toeplitz matrices.

In this infill sampling setting, the asymptotic theory gives very surprising results, which (partially) have no counterpart {{in the theory}} of discrete moving averages.

First order asymptotic theory essentially comprise three cases: stable convergence towards a certain infinitely divisible distribution, an ergodic type <b>limit</b> <b>theorem</b> and convergence in probability towards an integrated random process.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a marked {{increase}} {{in the application of}} spatial models in economics and the social sciences, in general. However, the development of a general asymptotic estimation and inference theory for spatial estimators has been hampered by a lack of central <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> (CLTs), uniform laws of large numbers (ULLNs) and pointwise laws of large number (LLN) for random fields under the assumptions relevant to economic applications.

40|$|Introduction The fMRI signal {{associated}} with a given voxel is affected by a subject's general arousal levels, the experimental task being executed, drifting sensor outputs, and noise. Thus, the signal at each voxel consists of a mixture of underlying source signals. One method for separating signal mixtures into a set of statistically independent signals is independent component analysis (ICA) (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995). ICA depends critically on the following two observations. <b>First,</b> the central <b>limit</b> <b>theorem</b> ensures that a linear mixture of any source signals tends to be Gaussian. Second, source signals tend to be statistically independent of each other. Together, these observations appear to suggest that, if a signal mixture can be decomposed into a set of statistically independent, non-Gaussian signals then these signals {{are likely to be}} the source signals of that signal mixture.

40|$|The work of E. Hopf and G. A. Hedlund, in the 1930 s, on transitivity and {{ergodicity}} of the geodesic flow for hyperbolic surfaces, {{marked the}} beginning of the investigation of the statistical properties and stochastic behavior of the flow. The <b>first</b> central <b>limit</b> <b>theorem</b> for the geodesic flow was proved in the 1960 s by Y. Sinai for compact hyperbolic manifolds. Since then, strong relationships have been found between the fields of ergodic theory, analysis, and geometry. Different approaches and new tools have been developed to study the geodesic flow, including measure theory, thermodynamic formalism, transfer operators, Laplace operators, and Brownian motion. All these different points of view have led to a deep understanding of more general dynamical systems, in particular the so-called Anosov systems, with applications to geometric problems such as counting, equirepartition, mixing, and recurrence properties of the orbits. This book comprises two independent texts that provide a self-contained introduction to two different approaches to the investigation of hyperbolic dynamics. The first text, by S. Le Borgne, explains the method of martingales for the central <b>limit</b> <b>theorem.</b> This approach can be used in several situations, even for weakly hyperbolic flows, and the author presents a good number of examples and applications to equirepartition and mixing.

40|$|This paper studies many-server {{limits for}} multi-server queues {{that have a}} phase-type service time {{distribution}} and allow for customer abandonment. The <b>first</b> set of <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> is for critically loaded $G/Ph/n+GI$ queues, where the patience times are independent and identically distributed following a general distribution. The next <b>limit</b> <b>theorem</b> is for overloaded $G/ Ph/n+M$ queues, where the patience time distribution is restricted to be exponential. We prove that a pair of diffusion-scaled total-customer-count and server-allocation processes, properly centered, converges in distribution to a continuous Markov process {{as the number of}} servers $n$ goes to infinity. In the overloaded case, the limit is a multi-dimensional diffusion process, and in the critically loaded case, the limit is a simple transformation of a diffusion process. When the queues are critically loaded, our diffusion limit generalizes the result by Puhalskii and Reiman (2000) for $GI/Ph/n$ queues without customer abandonment. When the queues are overloaded, the diffusion limit provides a refinement to a fluid limit and it generalizes a result by Whitt (2004) for $M/M/n/+M$ queues with an exponential service time distribution. The proof techniques employed in this paper are innovative. First, a perturbed system is shown to be equivalent to the original system. Next, two maps are employed in both fluid and diffusion scalings. These maps allow one to prove the <b>limit</b> <b>theorems</b> by applying the standard continuous-mapping theorem and the standard random-time-change theorem.

After showing that members of this class were approximately normally distributed if the number of observations was large, he argued that least squares provided the [...] "best" [...] linear estimators. Here it is [...] "best" [...] in the sense that it minimised the asymptotic variance and thus both minimised the expected absolute value of the error, and maximised the probability that the estimate would lie in any symmetric interval about the unknown coefficient, no matter what the error distribution.
