5|$|A {{wide range}} of concentrating {{technologies}} exists: among the best known are the parabolic trough, the compact linear Fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage. Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{transitive}} closure algorithms, {{it is possible}} to distinguish pairs of vertices that are reachable by at least one path of length two or more from pairs that can only be connected by a length-one path. The transitive reduction consists of the edges that form length-one paths that are the only paths connecting their endpoints. Therefore, the transitive reduction can be constructed in the same asymptotic time bounds as the {{transitive closure}}.|$|E

5|$|In clade-based phylogenetic taxonomy, Ceratopsia {{is often}} defined {{to include all}} marginocephalians {{more closely related to}} Triceratops than to Pachycephalosaurus. Under this definition, the most basal known ceratopsians are Yinlong, from the Late Jurassic Period, along with Chaoyangsaurus and the family Psittacosauridae, from the Early Cretaceous Period, all of which were {{discovered}} in northern China or Mongolia. The rostral bone and flared jugals are already present <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Men without property, {{who were}} thereby {{excluded}} from the qualifying social classes of the adsidui, were exempted from military service {{on the grounds that}} they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever. However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these proletarii were pressed into service, though their military worth was probably questionable. Troops <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> classes would fight together on the battlefield, with the exception of the most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.|$|E
5|$|Microscopic {{theoretical}} {{treatment of}} fluid phases can become quite complicated, {{owing to the}} high material density, meaning that strong interactions, hard-core repulsions, and many-body correlations cannot be ignored. In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> interactions further complicates analysis. There {{are a number of}} fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.|$|E

5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions {{to succeed in the}} world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 195455 season, along with Neil, Ray was called into an Australian XI for a Test trial against Len Hutton’s touring English team, the closest that two Harveys came to playing in a Test for Australia together. Ray did not make an impact in the match, scoring only seven in his solitary innings, and was not {{selected}} for Australian duty. He came in at No. 4 after the dismissal of his brother. Ray was selected for all six of Victoria’s matches and played <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> matches alongside Neil, as the domestic season was shortened and there were no scheduling clashes between the Tests and the domestic matches. Mick also played in all of Queensland's matches, and three brothers met in their states’ only meeting for the season.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or {{mirrors and}} {{tracking}} systems to focus {{a large area}} of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.|$|E

5|$|The Chadian–Libyan {{conflict}} {{was a series}} of sporadic clashes in Chad between 1978 and 1987 between Libyan and Chadian forces. Libya had been involved in Chad's internal affairs prior to 1978 and before Muammar Gaddafi's rise to power in Libya in 1969, beginning with the extension of the Chadian Civil War to northern Chad in 1968. The {{conflict was}} marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad, taking place in 1978, 1979, 1980–1981 and 1983–1987. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> occasions Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war, while Libya's opponents found the support of the French government, which intervened militarily to save the Chadian government in 1978, 1983 and 1986.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Masonic ritual {{consists}} of degree ceremonies. Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively initiated into Freemasonry, {{first in the}} degree of Entered Apprentice. Some time later, in a separate ceremony, they will be passed to the degree of Fellowcraft, and finally they will be raised to the degree of Master Mason. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> ceremonies, the candidate is entrusted with passwords, signs and grips (secret handshakes) peculiar to his new rank. Another ceremony is the annual installation of the Master and officers of the Lodge. In some jurisdictions Installed Master is valued as a separate rank, with its own secrets to distinguish its members. In other jurisdictions, the grade is not recognised, and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master of the Lodge.|$|E
5|$|Those Mesoamerican {{countries}} that once formed {{part of the}} Maya civilization – Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador – all organized festivities to commemorate the end of b'ak'tun 13 at the largest Maya sites. On 21 December 2011, the Maya town of Tapachula in Chiapas activated an eight-foot digital clock counting down the days {{until the end of}} b'ak'tun 13. On 21 December 2012, major events took place at Chichén Itzá in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala. In El Salvador, the largest event was held at Tazumal, and in Honduras, at Copán. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> archaeological sites, Maya rituals were held at dawn led by shamans and Maya priests.|$|E
