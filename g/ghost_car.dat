5|$|OutRun Online Arcade {{features}} four {{modes of}} play: OutRun, Time Attack, Continuous Race, and Heart Attack. In OutRun mode, the player drives through five of fifteen stages, selecting them en route. The Continuous mode {{is similar to}} OutRun mode, but instead the player must drive through all fifteen stages. As in previous games in the series, {{there is a time}} limit that is extended upon passing checkpoints. Time Attack mode has the player race a <b>ghost</b> <b>car</b> over a pre-selected set of stages while timed. Time checks are presented to the player at various points on each stage.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{attempting}} {{to prove to}} himself he can {{have a good time}} without Marge, leaves Bart, Lisa and Maggie under the supervision of Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates before they got married. Ironically, Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night, but they leave just before Homer arrives. Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home, which Homer accepts. As Ruth and Marge are driving home, Chief Wiggum, with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car, spots Ruth's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other. He decides to pull them over. Reluctant to stop, Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she's driving actually belongs to her ex-husband, and that she had stolen it as revenge for stiffing her on child support (although Marge points out that Ruth could've just reported him to child services). Ruth leads the police on a high-speed chase rather than turning herself in. Homer realizes it is Marge in the car, and believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights, which leads him to believe her car is a <b>ghost</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
500|$|The game {{contains}} three single-player modes: [...] "Circuit Race", [...] "Single Race" [...] and [...] "Time Race", {{as well as}} one multiplayer mode, [...] "Versus Race". The Circuit Race mode {{follows the}} game's main plot, and allows players to race through circuits made up of multiple tracks, gaining points based on where they place. In a circuit, the player must earn enough points {{to move on to the}} next race, and will win if they finish with the most points. Placing third or above in a circuit unlocks the next circuit for the player. The Single Race mode allows the player to race on a single track unlocked from the Circuit Race mode. The Time Race mode places the player in a race against Veronica Voltage driving a <b>ghost</b> <b>car</b> with the aim of beating her best time around a track chosen by the player. Versus Race allows two players to race against each other in a split screen view without non-player character minifigures on the track.|$|E

Bond learns that Goldfinger makes dead drops of gold bars for SMERSH along the way, and that his car's bodywork is 18 carat (75%), solid white gold under the ploy that the added weight is armour plating. Once at Enterprises Auric, the bodywork is stripped off, melted and made into airplane seats for a company that Enterprises Auric is heavily invested in. The plane(s) are then flown to India where the seats are melted down again into gold bars and sold for a much higher premium rate; 100 to 200 per cent profit.|$|E

50|$|The {{inclusion}} of a time attack mode can often be an effective way of adding replay value to a game. Racing games may also include <b>ghost</b> <b>cars</b> recorded by the development staff — attempting to beat their times can provide a final challenge to players who have mastered {{the rest of the}} game. Often the game provides other incentives to use the time attack feature; GoldenEye 007, a first-person shooter on the Nintendo 64, encouraged players to revisit levels more than once by offering unlockable cheat options as a reward for completing them within target times.|$|R

Players {{can choose from}} a multitude of options, whether {{they are looking for}} a quick fix or want to participate in the full procession of Qualifying and Race. There are also various options if the host is frustrated with other players' lack of caution on the track, such as making flags harsher or even turning off collisions, which enables <b>ghost</b> <b>cars.</b> Dedicated players can even choose to play a race with no driving assists, although for it to apply to all players the host must specify it. Other options include whether to use 2010 or equal car performance and the ability to play a custom championship with between 2-19 tracks and choose the weather conditions.|$|R

5000|$|Usually {{the best}} results {{achieved}} in a time attack mode are stored in long-term memory by the game (on a hard disk or non-volatile memory), {{so they can be}} shared with friends or improved upon at a later date. Racing games often feature [...] "ghost cars" [...] which are saved when the player sets a record time. In subsequent races, the <b>ghost</b> <b>car</b> follows the path the player took when setting that record, allowing them to clearly gauge how they are performing against the previous achievement. Saved ghost cars can often be shared with other players.|$|E
