40|$|Insulin and its {{receptor}} {{are critical}} for the regulation of metabolic functions, but the mecha-nisms underlying insulin receptor (IR) trafficking to the plasma membrane are not well understood. Here, we show that Bardet Biedl Syndrome (BBS) proteins are necessary for <b>IR</b> <b>localization</b> to the cell surface. We demonstrate that the IR interacts physically with BBS proteins, and reducing the expression of BBS proteins perturbs IR expression in the cell sur-face. We show the consequence of disrupting BBS proteins for whole body insulin action and glucose metabolism using mice lacking different BBS genes. These findings demon-strate the importance of BBS proteins in underlying IR cell surface expression. Our data identify defects in trafficking and localization of the IR as a novel mechanism accounting for the insulin resistance commonly associated with human BBS. This {{is supported by the}} reduced surface expression of the IR in fibroblasts derived from patients bearing the M 390 R mutation in the BBS 1 gene.

40|$|Insulin receptors (IRs) {{segregate}} on {{plasma membrane}} microvilli, but in cells devoid of microvilli, such as adipocytes, the localization of IRs {{is a matter}} of controversy. In the present study, we examined the distribution of IRs in the plasma membrane of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Quantitative electron microscopy indicates that IRs are predominantly associated with the neck, but not the bulb, of caveolae. Caveola necks represent distinct microdomains of the plasma membrane. Indeed, as shown by freeze-fracture analysis, intramembrane particles are concentrated as necklaces around the craters of caveolae. In addition, subcellular fractionation suggests that the neck and the bulb of caveolae present a different resistance to detergent solubility. Finally, cytoskeletal components, including actin, are highly enriched in the membrane area underlying the neck part of caveolae. IRs coimmunoprecipitate with cytoskeletal components, and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton alters IRs expression, localization, and signaling, thus supporting the notion that caveola necks are involved in intracellular signaling by IRs. Together, these results suggest that cytoskeletal proteins anchor IRs to microdomains in the caveola necks of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. By homology with <b>IR</b> <b>localization</b> in other cell types, we suggest that the necks of caveolae may represent the counterpart of microvillar domains in cells poor in microvilli such as adipocytes and that they play an important role as signaling platforms...|$|E
40|$|To compare {{infrared}} (IR) optical vs. stereoscopic X-ray {{technologies for}} patient setup in image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Retrospective data analysis of 233 fractions in 127 patients treated with hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy was performed. Patient setup at the linear accelerator {{was carried out}} by means of combined <b>IR</b> optical <b>localization</b> and stereoscopic X-ray image fusion in 6 degrees of freedom (6 D). Data were analyzed to evaluate the geometric and dosimetric discrepancy between the two patient setup strategies. RESULTS: Differences between <b>IR</b> optical <b>localization</b> and 6 D X-ray image fusion parameters were on average within the expected localization accuracy, as limited by CT image resolution (3 mm). A disagreement between the two systems below 1 mm in all directions was measured in patients treated for cranial tumors. In extracranial sites, larger discrepancies and higher variability were observed {{as a function of the}} initial patient alignment. The compensation of IR-detected rotational errors resulted in a significantly improved agreement with 6 D X-ray image fusion. On the basis of the bony anatomy registrations, the measured differences were found not to be sensitive to patient breathing. The related dosimetric analysis showed that IR-based patient setup caused limited variations in three cases, with 7 % maximum dose reduction in the clinical target volume and no dose increase in organs at risk. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, patient setup driven by <b>IR</b> external surrogates <b>localization</b> in 6 D featured comparable accuracy with respect to procedures based on stereoscopic X-ray imaging...|$|R
30|$|Many {{state-of-the-art}} bug localization {{techniques are}} based on information retrieval. Information retrieval (IR) consists of finding documents within a collection that match a search query (Manning et al. 2008). When applying <b>IR</b> to bug <b>localization,</b> source code files become the collection of documents, and the bug report represents the query. Then, the task of finding buggy files is reduced to the IR problem of determining the relevance of a document to a query. The relevance is determined by preprocessing the query and the set of documents and then calculating the similarity between each document and the query.|$|R

40|$|The most {{immediate}} biological and medical advantages of therapeutic agent localization on the nanoscale {{arise from the}} increased understanding of targeted delivery, selectivity and intracellular distribution that are gained by imaging at the resolution scale of individual nanovectors and therapeutic agents themselves. This paper reports {{on the use of}} a nanoscale resolution chemical imaging method, infrared (IR) nanospectral absorption imaging, used to map the subcellular localization of a photoactive therapeutic agent - toluidine blue-conjugated gold nanoparticles (TBO) within nanoscale subsections of single colon adenocarcinoma cells. By comparison of photosensitizer distribution with diffraction limited optical imaging, the benefits of <b>IR</b> nanospectral <b>localization</b> are highlighted and the spatial and spectral accuracy of the non-destructive IR imaging method is confirmed. IR spectral ratio imaging is presented as a means to map intracellular nanoparticle density at sub 50 nm lateral resolution with IR nanospectroscopy enabling distinction of nanoparticle seeded cells from a control group with 95 % confidence. In this way we illustrate that IR absorption nanoimaging combined with IR point source data does not only yield intracellular drug detection on the order of nanometres, but also permits extension of the AFM-IR technique from subcellular analysis up to studies of cell numbers that are statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|Recently, many {{information}} retrieval (<b>IR)</b> based bug <b>localization</b> approaches {{have been proposed}} in the literature. These approaches use {{information retrieval}} techniques to process a textual bug report {{and a collection of}} source code files to find buggy files. They output a ranked list of files sorted by their likelihood to contain the bug. Recent approaches can achieve reasonable accuracy, however, even a state-of-the-art bug localization tool outputs many ranked lists where buggy files appear very low in the lists. This potentially causes developers to distrust bug localization tools. Parnin and Orso recently conduct a user study and highlight that developers do not find an automated debugging tool useful if they do not find the root cause of a bug early in a ranked list. To address this problem, we build an oracle that can automatically predict whether a ranked list produced by an IR-based bug localization tool is likely to be effective or not. We consider a ranked list to be effective if a buggy file appears in the top-N position of the list. If a ranked list is unlikely to be effective, developers do not need to waste time in checking the recommended files one by one. In such cases, it is better for developers to use traditional debugging methods or request for further information to localize bugs. To build this oracle, our approach extracts features that can be divided into four categories: score features, textual features, topic model features, and metadata features. We build a separate prediction model for each category, and combine them to create a composite prediction model which is used as the oracle.

40|$|Abstract—Information Retrieval (<b>IR)</b> based bug <b>localization</b> {{techniques}} use a bug {{reports to}} query a software repository to retrieve relevant source files. These techniques index the source files {{in the software}} repository and train a model which is then queried for retrieval purposes. Much of the current research is focused on improving the retrieval effectiveness of these methods. However, little consideration {{has been given to}} the efficiency of such approaches for software repositories that are constantly evolving. As the software repository evolves, the index creation and model learning have to be repeated to ensure accuracy of retrieval for each new bug. In doing so, the query latency may be unreasonably high, and also, re-computing the index and the model for files that did not change is computationally redundant. We propose an incremental update framework to continuously update the index and the model using the changes made at each commit. We demonstrate that the same retrieval accuracy can be achieved but with a fraction of the time needed by current approaches.

Third, files that get modified in commits that fix the bugs might not contain the bug. This study investigates the extent these potential biases affect the results of a bug localization technique and whether bug localization researchers need to consider these potential biases when evaluating their solutions.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that ScN 2 a cells (scrapie-infected neuroblastoma N 2 a cells) express 2 -fold- and 4 -fold-increased levels of IR (insulin receptor) and IGF- 1 R (insulin-like growth factor- 1 receptor) respectively. In addition, the IR alpha- and beta-subunits are aberrantly processed, with apparent molecular masses of 128 and 85 kDa respectively, {{as compared with}} 136 and 95 kDa in uninfected N 2 a cells. Despite the 2 -fold increase in IR protein, the number of (125) I-insulin-binding sites was slightly decreased in ScN 2 a cells [Ostlund, Lindegren, Pettersson and Bedecs (2001) Brain Res. 97, 161 - 170]. In {{order to determine the}} cellular <b>localization</b> of <b>IR</b> in ScN 2 a cells, surface biotinylation was performed, showing a correct <b>IR</b> trafficking and <b>localization</b> to the cell surface. The present study shows {{for the first time that}} neuroblastoma N 2 a cells express significant levels of IR-IGF- 1 R hybrid receptors, and in ScN 2 a cells the number of hybrid receptors was 2 -fold higher than that found in N 2 a cells, potentially explaining the apparent loss of insulin-binding sites due to a lower affinity for insulin compared with the homotypic IR. Furthermore, the decreased molecular mass of IR subunits in ScN 2 a cells is not caused by altered phosphorylation or proteolytic processing, but rather by altered glycosylation. Enzymic deglycosylation of immunoprecipitated IR from N 2 a and ScN 2 a cells with endoglycosidase H, peptide N-glycosidase F and neuraminidase all resulted in subunits with increased electrophoretic mobility; however, the 8 - 10 kDa shift remained. Combined enzymic or chemical deglycosylation using anhydrous trifluoromethane sulphonic acid treatment ultimately showed that the IR alpha- and beta-subunits from ScN 2 a cells are aberrantly glycosylated. The increased formation of IR-IGF- 1 R hybrids in ScN 2 a cells may be part of a neuroprotective response to prion infection. The degree and functional significance of aberrantly glycosylated proteins in ScN 2 a cells remain to be determined...|$|R
