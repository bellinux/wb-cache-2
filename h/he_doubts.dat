5|$|In Hubbard's {{efforts to}} shift from a psychotherapeutic to a spiritual program, he {{introduced}} the concept of thetans: a set of godlike, non-corporeal entities capable of creating and shaping universes, later trapped in the MEST and confined, by reincarnation, to physical bodies. Hugh Urban of Ohio State University states that these teachings bear similarities to Gnosticism, although <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> that Hubbard was well versed in Gnostic thought.|$|E
5|$|He {{finds the}} mixture of bird species {{intermediate}} between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to mean that {{a small number of}} birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> there was ever a land bridge to that continent.|$|E
5|$|A young German rocket {{scientist}} who Edward befriends {{some time after}} arriving in Munich. He is similar in name and appearance to Edward's brother, Alphonse. He is easygoing and enjoys listening to Edward's stories of his homeworld, and while <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> {{whether or not they}} are true and is hurt by how distant Edward behaves, he is nonetheless supportive of his efforts. He suffers from a fatal lung disease and hopes to make a difference for the world before he dies. His wish is granted when he helps Edward return to his world through the opened Gate on a rocket before he is fatally shot by Rudolf Hess of the Thule Society.|$|E
6000|$|Bounding Bull {{pondered the}} words. Little Tim gave vent to a {{doubtful}} [...] "humph"--not that <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> {{the truth of}} the Word, but that <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> its applicability on the present occasion.|$|R
60|$|I can {{understand}} all the disquietude of his heart when that warning, as to the too great length of his story, was given to him. He {{was not a man}} capable of feeling at any time quite assured in his position, and when that occurred he was very far from assurance. I think that at no time did <b>he</b> <b>doubt</b> the sufficiency of his own mental qualification for the work he had taken in hand; but <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> all else. <b>He</b> <b>doubted</b> the appreciation of the world; <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> his fitness for turning his intellect to valuable account; <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> his physical capacity,--dreading his own lack of industry; <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> his luck; <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> the continual absence of some of those misfortunes on which the works of literary men are shipwrecked. Though he was aware of his own power, he always, to the last, was afraid that his own deficiencies should be too strong against him. It was his nature to be idle,--to put off his work,--and then to be angry with himself for putting it off. Ginger was hot in the mouth with him, and all the allurements of the world were strong upon him. To find on Monday morning an excuse why he should not on Monday do Monday's work was, at the time, an inexpressible relief to him, but had become deep regret,--almost a remorse,--before the Monday was over. To such a one it was not given to believe in himself with that sturdy rock-bound foundation which we see to have belonged to some men from the earliest struggles of their career. To him, then, must have come an inexpressible pang when he was told that his story must be curtailed.|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} me for a moment as though <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> I should understand.|$|R
25|$|In an interview, he said <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> {{that any}} other {{newspaper}} in Israel apart from Haaretz would give him the journalistic freedom to publish the kind of pieces he writes.|$|E
25|$|Regardless, Moreton is sceptical {{about the}} honesty of watchmen, and <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> about their {{suspicious}} close {{relation with the}} criminal underworld in different contemporary pamphlets. Watchmen also appear as the accused in the Old Bailey Session Papers under trials for murder and theft, while the bribe they received from street prostitutes was quite common knowledge in eighteenth-century London.|$|E
25|$|On February 14, 2012, Cox and Lawrence {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} that a title change could still take place for the fourth season, mentioning Wine Time, The Sunshine State and Family Jules as potential titles. However, after announcing that the show would move to TBS for the fourth season, Lawrence said if TBS wants that title to change, then it will, but also said that <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> it will happen.|$|E
60|$|Thorn pondered. Gerald's {{statement}} was plausible, but <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> if <b>he</b> {{had told him}} all.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her furtively, as though even then <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> the {{significance}} of her words.|$|R
60|$|The old {{man looked}} at him as though <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> whether or no he were being laughed at.|$|R
25|$|Elsewhere, Catholic priest Jack Landry (Joel Gretsch) is {{suspicious}} of the Visitors, and warns his parishioners {{to be wary of}} them. <b>He</b> <b>doubts</b> his stance when a previously wheelchair-bound parishioner is able to walk again, but has his suspicions confirmed when a mortally wounded man arrives at the church, telling Jack he knows the real reason behind the Visitors' appearance on Earth, handing him a dossier on the aliens and details of a secret meeting.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, Voldemort simply {{sought the}} wand for its {{supposedly}} unbeatable power, after his previous wand unaccountably failed to kill Harry Potter. He had not realised that the wand {{was one of}} three Hallows, nor sought the other two Hallows. He also possessed the Resurrection Stone but only made use of it as a horcrux. Dumbledore says that <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> Voldemort would have any interest in the Cloak or the Stone even if he did know about them.|$|E
25|$|The episode {{begins with}} Frasier writing a {{political}} speech for Woody, who has trouble doing it himself. Rebecca rejects plumber Don Santry's (Tom Berenger) proposal accidentally {{because she is}} too excited to accept it, causing him to break up with her. Sam struggles with his sex addiction and wants to avoid watching Kim Alexis on television. Diane Chambers, making her first appearance on the series after six years, appears on television, accepting an award for outstanding writing of a television movie, surprising Sam. Diane calls Sam at the bar {{to thank him for}} the congratulatory telegram he sent earlier. Diane accepts Sam's invitation to return to Boston, but Sam reveals to Norm that <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> her confirmation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} read you the very words," [...] she said. [...] "This {{is one of my}} poor brother's letters. <b>He</b> never <b>doubted.</b> How could <b>he</b> <b>doubt?</b> They make only such a small handful, these miserable oppressors, before the {{unanimous}} will of our people." ...|$|R
50|$|In February 2010, {{executive}} producer Mark Fennessy stated that <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> the spin-off will {{return for a}} second season.|$|R
60|$|Kit thanked him, and then, {{looking at}} the man thoughtfully, added that <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> if the things would fit.|$|R
25|$|After making {{camp for}} the night, Prompto struggles with the {{knowledge}} that he is a clone who was intended to become a weapon. He admits to Aranea his fear of being rejected by Noctis if Noctis learns his secret and divulges his plan to run away. Aranea chastises him for being too concerned about what other people think as she was enlisted by Noctis to find him. She reveals that Verstael created a new model of magitek weapon called Immortalis that she intends to destroy, but refuses Prompto's help so long as <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> himself. Prompto is visited by the spirit of Lunafreya who reminds him of the bonds he shared with his friends, and Prompto resolves to rejoin them.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} Receiver concluded {{his report}} stating that ‘the Receiver for the debenture holder is continuing {{the business in}} the hopes of disposing of it as a going concern, but he states that having regard to the specialised and somewhat ancient type of plant <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> whether the assets will realise sufficient to discharge the debenture liability, particularly bearing in mind the somewhat heavy claims of the preferential creditors.’ Nevertheless, Sanders Phillips and Co. Ltd took over the company in the same year. Nine months later the Parker Street premises were destroyed by fire during an air raid, but the company, operating from London offices in Norfolk Street, Strand, son established Government contracts for reproducing maps for Bomber Command, plans for M.I.8, and, after ‘D’ Day, ‘communication maps’ which were collected by the R.A.F. and flown direct to France.|$|E
25|$|The deflowerment of Lavinia, {{cutting out}} her tongue, {{chopping}} off her hands, and the numerous decapitations which {{occur in the}} original, are wholly omitted, and a play not only presentable but actually attractive is the result. Aaron is elevated into a noble and lofty character; Tamora, the queen of Scythia, is a chaste though decidedly strong-minded female, and her connection with the Moor appears to be of legitimate description; her sons Chiron and Demetrius are dutiful children, obeying the behests of their mother. Thus altered, Mr. Aldridge's conception of the part of Aaron is excellent – gentle and impassioned by turns; now burning with jealousy as <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> the honour of the Queen; anon, fierce with rage, as he reflects upon the wrongs which have been done him – the murder of Alarbus and the abduction of his son; and then all tenderness and emotion in the gentler passages with his infant.|$|E
60|$|Duveen's {{face was}} inscrutable and Lister {{wondered}} whether <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> his statement. <b>He</b> was annoyed {{because the other}} knew so much.|$|R
60|$|Julius {{declined}} {{to admit that}} <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> his brother's word, to the lady {{who was about to}} become his brother's wife.|$|R
60|$|Kit did {{not know}} much about young women, but hesitated, because <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> if {{she wanted him to}} post the letter.|$|R
500|$|Ścieżyński surmises {{that the}} Soviets must {{likewise}} have intercepted Polish operational signals; but <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> {{that this would}} have availed them much since Polish cryptography [...] "stood abreast of modern cryptography" [...] and since {{only a small number}} of Polish higher headquarters were equipped with radio stations, of which there was a great shortage; and finally, Polish headquarters were more cautious than the Russians and almost every Polish division had the use of a land line.|$|E
500|$|Some modern historians, while rejecting Polybius's {{figure as}} flawed, {{are willing to}} accept Livy's figure. Some more recent historians have come up with far lower estimates. Cantalupi {{proposed}} Roman losses of 10,500 to 16,000. Samuels also regards Livy's figure as far too high, {{on the grounds that the}} cavalry would have been inadequate to prevent the Roman infantry escaping to the rear. [...] <b>He</b> <b>doubts</b> that Hannibal even wanted a high death toll, as much of the army consisted of Italians whom Hannibal hoped to win as allies.|$|E
500|$|The only adult on {{the show}} that Stan {{consistently}} trusted was Chef, the cafeteria worker at his school, as Stan generally holds {{the rest of the}} show's adult population in low regard due to their tendency to both behave irrationally when subjected to the scams, cults, and sensationalized media stories of which he is often skeptical, and engage in hypocritical behavior. <b>He</b> <b>doubts</b> the legitimacy of holistic medicine, declares cults to be dangerous, and regards those claiming to be psychic mediums as frauds, specifically by declaring John Edward to be [...] "the biggest douche in the universe".|$|E
60|$|He was dumb for a time, {{astonished}} beyond measure, as he well {{might have}} been. <b>He</b> <b>doubted</b> his ears. <b>He</b> was outraged.|$|R
25|$|Though Gimlin says <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> the {{existence}} of Sasquatch-like creatures, he agreed to Patterson's insistence {{that they should not}} attempt to shoot one.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps it {{was with}} the {{malicious}} intent of urging him on to his worst that Mr Venus looked as if <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> that.|$|R
500|$|This {{perceived}} {{inability to}} connect {{has led to}} much speculation about Drake's sexuality. Boyd has said he detects a virginal quality in his lyrics and music, and notes that he never observed or heard of the singer behaving in a sexual way with anyone, male or female. Kirby described Drake's lyrics as a [...] "series of extremely vivid, complete observations, almost {{like a series of}} epigrammatic proverbs", though <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> that Drake saw himself as [...] "any sort of poet". Instead, Kirby believes that Drake's lyrics were crafted to [...] "complement and compound a mood that the melody dictates in the first place." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Bethune {{writes in}} Maclean's that Knight's logic is [...] "as absurd as it's unassailable". However, <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> Knight's {{claim that the}} last {{survivors}} {{of the human race}} would have pleasant lives and suspects that a [...] "collective loss of the will to live" [...] would prevail. In response to Knight's platform, journalist Sheldon Richman argues that humans are [...] "active agents" [...] and can change their behavior. He contends that people are capable of solving the problems facing Earth. Alan Weisman, author of The World Without Us, suggests a limit of one child per family as a preferable alternative to abstinence from reproduction.|$|E
500|$|The first topic covered is Astronomy, in Book II. Pliny {{starts with}} the known universe, roundly criticising {{attempts}} at cosmology as madness, including the view that there are countless other worlds than the Earth. <b>He</b> <b>doubts</b> the four (Aristotelian) elements, fire, earth, air and water, but records the seven [...] "planets" [...] including the sun and moon. The earth is a sphere, suspended {{in the middle of}} space. He considers it a weakness to try to find the shape and form of God, or to suppose that such a being would care about human affairs. He mentions eclipses, but considers Hipparchus's almanac grandiose for seeming to know how Nature works. He cites Posidonius's estimate that the moon is 230,000 miles away. He describes comets, noting that only Aristotle has recorded seeing more than one at once.|$|E
60|$|To this Andy {{could only}} answer with a sigh. <b>He</b> <b>doubted</b> very much if the {{precious}} documents would {{ever come to}} light again.|$|R
60|$|To {{this speech}} Jakolu replied by {{shaking his head}} slowly and gravely, as if <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> the propriety of his young commander's intentions.|$|R
