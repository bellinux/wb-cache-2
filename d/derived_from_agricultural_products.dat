30|$|First-generation biofuels, <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> (corn, sugarcane, palm oil, rapeseed, or soybean), have {{produced}} {{an impact on}} grain prices, tightening the supply chain {{and the availability of}} land for food production [1]. The transformation of forests, savannahs, or pastureland into farms for biofuel production could lead to greater CO 2 emission than the emission reduction these biofuels could produce [2, 3]. Consequently, serious damages to the ecosystems have been produced. Second-generation bioethanol is a biofuel made from nonedible raw materials [4]. Wastes or discards should no longer be seen as a burden but rather as another source of material such as energy fuel [1, 5]. Thus, some organic waste may be incorporated as low-cost raw materials for second-generation bioethanol production, depending on the waste composition. Due to the wide variety of technological alternatives for the production of ethanol through fermentation, a global analysis of the process is required, leading {{to the development of a}} sustainable process, which cooperates with the final disposal of certain existing wastes in each region [6, 7, 8, 9].|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Porous carbonaceous adsorbent materials possessing weakly acidic surface functional groups have been evaluated for the selective removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions. Active carbons <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> both <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> (KAU carbons) and polymeric resin (CKC carbon) have been oxidised by hot air or nitric acid to produce samples with different degrees of surface oxidation. A novel phosphorus-containing carbonaceous sorbent (PGP-P) has been prepared by pyrolysis of phosphorylated phenol-formaldehyde resin. Surface modifications {{have been carried out}} to introduce various acidic functional groups capable of selective heavy metal binding. The properties of these sorbents have been compared to those of commercially available polymeric carboxylic resin C 104 (Purolite) and oxidised Filtrasorb 400 (Chemviron). Investigation into the physical structure of the adsorbents using microscopy and nitrogen sorption at liquid nitrogen temperatures showed that the porous structure is adversely affected by carbon oxidation. The surface area and pore volume decrease as the degree of surface oxidation increases. The low surface area and pore volume of PGP-P was attributed to the presence of phosphorus-containing functional groups which protect the surface from excessive burn-off. The surface functionality of the sorbcnts was determined by FT-IR, NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Relatively high concentrations of different weakly acidic functional groups were detected {{on the surface of the}} materials studied. The ion-exchange properties of the sorbents were assessed by acid-base titration techniques and electrophoretic mobility measurements. Oxidation of carbons with hot air resulted in a greater proportion of relatively weaker type surface functionality (i. e. phenolic) whereas nitric acid modification produced a higher concentration of relatively stronger carboxylic groups. Electrophoretic mobility measurements suggested that the carbon surface is negatively charged within the range of pH values studied. pH titration results demonstrated relatively greater surface acidity of active carbons compared to carboxylic resin. Active carbons were successfully applied for the selective removal of radionuclides. The materials showed excellent decontamination factors for a-, b- and y emitters. This was attributed to the presence of mineral admixtures and humic acids in carbons as well as the surface functional groups. Repeated cycles of lead sorption/elution indicated that the metal capacities of the carbon-packed mini-columns were reduced but reached a steady level after 3 - 4 cycles...|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} emerged {{interest in}} using renewable vegetable sources as feedstock for biofuel production requires {{the identification of}} effective solutions aimed to follow the principles of sustainable development. Biofuels from the first generation were produced from sugarcane, starch and oils <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products,</b> {{but they may not}} be sustainable because are competing with the agricultural production. Currently, studies are focused on the obtaining of a second generation of biofuels that originate from plants other then food crops, from agricultural residues and from municipal wastes. Being economically attractive and having certain agro-technical advantages, the Camelina sativa seed oil is considered a sustainable source for obtaining second generation biofuels. The aim of the present research was to record the effect of genotype in 3 foreign varieties of Camelina sativa (CALENA, GP 204 and GP 202) and in 3 autochthonous ones (CAMELIA, one local population Fundulea and one hybrid line) as regards both the growth characteristics and the yield components in a greenhouse experiment, in order to evaluate their potential performance and adaptability in field conditions. Periodic phenological observations were performed on the occurrence of flowering, on the pod maturation and genotypic differences of the biometric measurements such as plant height, number of branches, number of pods per plant, number of seeds in pods and thousand seed weight are discussed...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increase}} of fossil fuels prices and environmental concerns derived of its use, the search of new energy sources has become a central subject. Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable and abundant source of organic material in amount enough to satisfy the growing energetic needs and suitable for the bioconversion into biofuels. The appropriate use of lignocellulosic biomass to produce biofuels must integrate several requirements: selection of the appropriate raw materials, effective biomass pre-treatment to improve the enzymatic saccharification of cellulose into glucose and efficient conversion of hexoses and pentoses from the pre-treatment into biofuels. In this context, great progress has been accomplished in terms of lignocellulosic bioethanol production, but an integrated approach of all stages {{involved in the process}} is still a goal to be achieved. The main highlighted challenges are: reduction of processing costs, recovery and valorisation of all biomass fractions, and development of robust microorganisms able to successfully convert all the available sugars into the desired biofuels under harsh and intensified conditions. (Menon and Rao, 2012) Recent works showed the importance of suitable strain selection from industrial environments (Pereira et al., 2014) for efficient lignocellulose fermentation and for its engineered modification in order to metabolize xylose (Romaní et al., 2015). In this context, the aim of this work was the development of efficient ethanol process from several lignocellulosic materials, <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> (corn cob and wheat straw) and hardwood materials (eucalyptus and paulownia wood), alongside different nutritional sources using a new robust constructed yeast strain for xylose and glucose co-consumption isolated from industrial environment able to withstand harsh environments...|$|E
