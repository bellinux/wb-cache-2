In {{order to improve}} the welding quality of the T-joints, an external electric current was used to aid the laser stake-welding process. The effects of the process parameters on the weld morphology, mechanical properties, and microstructure of the welded joints were analyzed and discussed in detail.

Upon increasing the aided electric current, the weld width at the skin and stringer <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> obviously increased, but there was an insignificant change in the penetration depth.

5000|$|Electric {{resistance}} welding (ERW) {{refers to a}} group of welding processes such as spot and seam welding that produce coalescence of <b>faying</b> <b>surfaces</b> where heat to form the weld is generated by the electrical resistance of material combined with the time and the force used to hold the materials together during welding. Some factors influencing heat or welding temperatures are the proportions of the workpieces, the metal coating or the lack of coating, the electrode materials, electrode geometry, electrode pressing force, electrical current and length of welding time. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the point of most electrical resistance (the connecting or [...] "faying" [...] surfaces) as an electrical current (100 - 100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, {{resistance welding}} methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are limited to relatively thin materials and the equipment cost can be high (although in production situations the cost per weld may be low).|$|E
50|$|Resistance {{seam welding}} {{is a process}} that {{produces}} a weld at the <b>faying</b> <b>surfaces</b> of two similar metals. The seam may be a butt joint or an overlap joint and is usually an automated process. It differs from butt welding in that butt welding typically welds the entire joint at once and seam welding forms the weld progressively, starting at one end. Like spot welding, seam welding relies on two electrodes, usually made from copper, to apply pressure and current. The electrodes are often disc shaped and rotate as the material passes between them. This allows the electrodes to stay in constant contact with the material to make long continuous welds. The electrodes may also move or assist the movement of the material. A transformer supplies energy to the weld joint in the form of low voltage, high current AC power. The joint of the work piece has high electrical resistance relative {{to the rest of the}} circuit and is heated to its melting point by the current. The semi-molten surfaces are pressed together by the welding pressure that creates a fusion bond, resulting in a uniformly welded structure. Most seam welders use water cooling through the electrode, transformer and controller assemblies due to the heat generated.|$|E
50|$|Spot welding is a {{resistance}} welding method used to join {{two or more}} overlapping metal sheets, studs, projections, electrical wiring hangers, some heat exchanger fins, and some tubing. Usually power sources and welding equipment are sized to the specific thickness and material being welded together. The thickness {{is limited by the}} output of the welding power source and thus the equipment range due to the current required for each application. Care is taken to eliminate contaminants between the <b>faying</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Usually, two copper electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. When the current is passed through the electrodes to the sheets, heat is generated due to the higher electrical resistance where the surfaces contact each other. As the electrical resistance of the material causes a heat buildup in the work pieces between the copper electrodes, the rising temperature causes a rising resistance, and results in a molten pool contained most of the time between the electrodes. As the heat dissipates throughout the workpiece in less than a second (resistance welding time is generally programmed as a quantity of AC cycles or milliseconds) the molten or plastic state grows to meet the welding tips. When the current is stopped the copper tips cool the spot weld, causing the metal to solidify under pressure. The water cooled copper electrodes remove the surface heat quickly, accelerating the solidification of the metal, since copper is an excellent conductor. Resistance spot welding typically employs electrical power in the form of direct current, alternating current, medium frequency half-wave direct current, or high-frequency half wave direct current.|$|E

Therefore the numerical simulation {{research has been conducted}} to understand the whole process. In this paper three different cases were analyzed by varying the tip contact area and it was observed that, with the variation of tip contact area the nugget formation at the <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> is affected. The tip contact area of the welding electrode becomes large with long welding cycles. Therefore in order to maintain consistency of nugget formation during the welding process, the current compensation in control feedback is required.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} the friction welding condition and the weld <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> properties on the tensile strength of the friction welded joint between pure titanium (Ti) and pure copper (OFC). The joint strength of the joint, which was made with the weld <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> of the Ti side specimen finished with a surface grinding machine, was investigated. The joint did not have 100 % efficiency and OFC side fracture regardless of the friction welding conditions. When the joint was made with a friction pressure of 75 MPa, the joint efficiency was approximately 64 % regardless of the forge pressures, and all joints fractured at the weld interface, although that efficiency exceeded that of the joints made with other friction pressures. To improve the joint efficiency, one was made with a Ti side specimen whose weld <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> was finished by buff polishing. The joint efficiency was increased to approximately 85 %, although the joint fractured at the weld interface. Moreover, a joint at a friction pressure of 75 MPa with a forge pressure of 270 MPa or higher was obtained with an OFC side fracture, although it did not achieve 100 % efficiency. The fact that the joint did not fracture at the OFC base metal was due to the mechanically mixed layer at the weld interface that depended on the maximum height of the Ti side weld <b>faying</b> <b>surface.</b> To clarify the reason why the joint did not achieve 100 % joint efficiency, the tensile strength of the OFC base metal with the addition of various compressive stresses was investigated. When the compressive stress was higher than the yield stress of the OFC base metal, its tensile strength was lower than that without a compressive load. Moreover, the tensile strength along the radial direction of the OFC base metal was also slightly lower than that of the longitudinal direction. Hence, the fact that the joint did not also achieve 100 % efficiency was due to the decrease in the tensile strength of the OFC base metal by the Bauschinger effect and the difference of the anisotropic property with as-manufactured condition...|$|R

All surfaces of steel or iron work inaccessible after erection shall be protected {{as far as}} possible either by coating them with ` Smith's ' or other approved bituminous composition, or by filling the spaces which they enclose with lime concrete. Repainting Old Work. Before beginning to repaint work of any description it must be thoroughly cleaned. If the surface is in good condition it will be sufficient to scrub down with good soap and water and afterwards sponge and wipe dry. If the work has become rough it will often be necessary to use pumice stone to facilitate the operation of cleaning. The pumice should be cut or rubbed to a flat surface and vigorously applied with plenty of clean water. It is essential that the work should be quite dry before any paint is applied. If the old surface is much cracked and blistered no amount of rubbing with pumice will enable the workman to obtain a good ground for the new coats, and {{it will be necessary to}} remove the old paint entirely. For this purpose painters most frequently use a paint burner or torch that burns paraffin oil under air pressure. This causes the paint to soften and blister under the heat, in which state it is readily scraped off by a blunt knife. The old-fashioned grate filled with charcoal held close to the surface by means of a long handle is now not often used. There has recently been a considerable increase in the use of chemical paint removers in paste or liquid form; as a rule these contain some alkali, such as lime or caustic soda.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{evaluation}} of stress intensity factors (SIFs) for cracks in mechanically fastened joints {{is one of}} the central issues in a damage tolerance analysis. Accurate stress intensity solutions may be difficult to determine due to geometric complexity along with variations in fastener load transfer and fastener interference and material thickness because of corrosion. Detailed finite element models that include specific aspects of fastener for lap joints analysis, but such representations are often impractical for large lap joints involving many fasteners. In order {{to reduce the number of}} degrees of freedom in a particular model, a methodology was implemented that efficiently depicts mechanical fasteners in lap joints using finite elements. Uncorroded and corroded lap joints with three crack scenarios were studied by the computationally efficient model. The effects of pillowing corrosion and fastener interference were also included in the model. The results show that the effect of MSD and thinning of the material is to increase substantially stress intensity factors (SIFs) values compare to that of a single crack without corrosion. For a given cyclic stress range, SIF decreases with increasing rivet interference level. This is particularly true for shorter crack lengths. SIF values for the longer crack are not sensitive to the length of shorter crack on the opposite side of the rivet hole. The effects of corrosion pillowing cause SIF values on the <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> to be larger than those on the opposing surface, and the crack front distorts from the straight front. Moreover, stresses on the <b>faying</b> <b>surface</b> may exceed the yield strength of the material...|$|R

In the present study finite element techniques were used to determine the effect that pillowing has on the stress-intensity factor for cracks located at rivet holes in lap joints. The stress caused by the internal pressure and riveting process was taken into account while the fuselage curvature was ignored.
