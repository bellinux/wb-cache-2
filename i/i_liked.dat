5|$|<b>I</b> <b>liked</b> {{them both}} {{because they were}} ironic and provocative {{at the same time}} but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I {{certainly}} wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the play on words; I thought they were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool. I never realized they would become my signature songs, especially the second one.|$|E
5|$|There {{were other}} folk-music records, {{commercial}} folk-music records, like those by the Kingston Trio. I never really was an elitist. Personally, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the Kingston Trio. I {{could see the}} picture...the Kingston Trio were probably the best commercial group going, {{and they seemed to}} know what they were doing.|$|E
5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
60|$|I mix a {{good deal}} with the Millionaires. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> them. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> their faces. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the way they live. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the things they eat. The more we mix {{together}} the better <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the things we mix.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>like</b> London. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> here, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> Cotton, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> home pretty well, and <b>I</b> love Pendridny--and--I <b>like</b> Ravensham." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>like</b> the taxes, when they're not too many; [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> a seacoal fire, {{when not}} too dear; [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> a beef-steak, too, {{as well as}} any; [...] Have no {{objection}} to a pot of beer; [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the weather,--when it is not rainy, [...] That is, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> two months of every year. [...] And so God save the Regent, Church, and King! [...] Which means that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> all and every thing.|$|R
5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
5|$|The train {{stopped at}} a station that had no town, and {{a short while later}} it passed the only banana {{plantation}} along the route that had its name written over the gate: Macondo. This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E
25|$|In your {{position}} I wouldn't tie myself {{in any way}} for the present. I should look for a libretto <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> and set it to music without any engagement and in my own time.(Italics in the original).|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>like</b> compliments. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to go {{home and}} tell them all over again to the members of my family. They don't believe them, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to tell them in the home circle, all the same. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to dream of them if I can.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{say what}} <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to my son, sir. I can {{cut him off}} with a {{shilling}} if <b>I</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> can make him a beggar if <b>I</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> WILL say what I like," [...] the elder said.|$|R
6000|$|... "No--not {{particularly}} pretty. But <b>I</b> <b>like</b> her body. And <b>I</b> <b>like</b> {{the fresh}} air. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the fresh air, the summer sea-air all through it--through her as well." ...|$|R
25|$|It {{was never}} a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I {{remember}} correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent {{as it would have}} been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> school and for {{the first time}} I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the {{property}} of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.|$|E
500|$|In his {{autobiography}} , Dylan added: [...] "I liked The Kingston Trio. Even though their style was polished and collegiate, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> {{most of their}} stuff anyway." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{regards to}} the album's lyrical themes, Blasko told Rolling Stone Australia magazine: [...] "The basis is {{definitely}} my life, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to take it into a heightened reality. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the idea of 'the character' on the record. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> musicals, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it to be fancy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "England! {{with all}} thy faults I love thee still,"[220] [...] I said at Calais, {{and have not}} forgot it; [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to speak and lucubrate my fill; [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the {{government}} (but that is not it); [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> {{the freedom of the}} press and quill; [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the Habeas Corpus (when we've got it); [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> a Parliamentary debate, [...] Particularly when 'tis not too late; ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Dick, deliberately, 'I <b>like</b> the power; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the fun; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the fuss; {{and above}} all <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the money. <b>I</b> almost <b>like</b> {{the people who make}} the fuss and pay the money. Almost. But they're a queer gang,--an amazingly queer gang!' ...|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} also well-liked by the band. Mick Avory, who noted the song {{as one of}} the songs he was most proud to be {{associated}} with, said [...] "I always liked 'Lola', <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the subject. It's not like anything else. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> it for that. We'd always take a different path". In a 1983 interview, Ray Davies said, [...] "I'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it". The band revisited the [...] "Lola" [...] character in the lyrics of their 1981 song, [...] "Destroyer", a minor chart hit in America.|$|E
500|$|Ebert and Roeper {{gave the}} film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating, with Roger Ebert saying, [...] "I liked the action, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the absurdity, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and I {{especially}} {{liked the way}} it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight {{it out with the}} special effects." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com gave it a mixed review, noting that it was [...] "only half a mess", and that Ratner [...] "could have stuck a bit more closely to the 'Dark Phoenix' narrative than he did." [...] However, Zacharek did note that that third act captured some of the original story's [...] "majesty".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Hall's {{cinematography}} and {{the thematic}} use of water. He, too, felt an emotional detachment from the characters, saying, [...] "I knew I admired it, but I didn't know if <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> it... It {{is cold and}} holds us outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{want to do}} as <b>I</b> <b>like,</b> young man,' {{he added}} after a short silence; 'to go to bed when <b>I</b> <b>like,</b> get up when <b>I</b> <b>like,</b> come in when <b>I</b> <b>like,</b> go out when I like--to be asked no {{questions}} and be surrounded by no spies. In this last respect, servants are the devil. There's only one here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|O {{my father}} <b>I</b> <b>like</b> not the houses, [...] They will never to me be anything, nor do <b>I</b> <b>like</b> money, [...] But to mount up there <b>I</b> would <b>like,</b> O father dear, that banner <b>I</b> <b>like,</b> [...] That pennant I would be and must be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Dick, deliberately, [...] "I <b>like</b> the power; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the fun; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the fuss; {{and above}} all <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the money. <b>I</b> almost <b>like</b> {{the people who make}} the fuss and pay the money. Almost. But they're a queer gang,--an amazingly queer gang!" ...|$|R
500|$|The movie {{would remain}} the most financially {{successful}} {{of all the}} AIP Poe films. [...] "It's also the one <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the best {{because it was the}} scariest," [...] said Arkoff. [...] "We had a wonderful piece of artwork for the poster... as well as some great sets by Danny Haller." ...|$|E
500|$|... "To me [...] a singer/songwriter. But his album {{itself is}} incredible. He’s super talented. To me he’s like the Black James Taylor. He’s lyrical—he’s {{got a great}} {{perspective}} and super sick melodies. I haven’t seen anybody bob and weave through chords with such catchy melodies in a long time—that’s why <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> working with him.” ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{had a lot}} {{in common}} with Nikki. She's courageous and sweet and funny and misjudged. But she clears her name in the end, and that's always good to do. I'm {{continuously}} doing that with the public. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> Nikki's tough side and her sweet side. The toughness is only a mask for the vulnerability she feels inside." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 26) The Pat that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> is {{a genius}} 27) The Pat who <b>I</b> <b>like</b> {{is a genius}} 28) The only person that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> whose kids Dana is {{willing to put up}} with is Pat ...|$|R
6000|$|Child: [...] O {{my father}} <b>I</b> <b>like</b> not the houses, [...] They will never to me be any thing, nor do <b>I</b> <b>like</b> money, [...] But to mount up there <b>I</b> would <b>like,</b> O father dear, that banner <b>I</b> <b>like,</b> [...] That pennant I would be and must be.|$|R
5000|$|Where no {{subject is}} specified, {{the subject of}} a gerund is {{generally}} understood to be the subject (or [...] "interested party") of the main clause: <b>I</b> <b>like</b> singing loudly means <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it when <b>I</b> myself sing; Singing loudly is nice implies the singer is the person who finds it nice. This does not apply to deverbal nouns: <b>I</b> <b>like</b> loud singing is likely to mean that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it when others sing loudly. This means that a sentence may have alternative meanings depending on whether the -ing form is intended as a gerund or as a deverbal noun: in <b>I</b> <b>like</b> singing either function may be the intended one, but the meaning in each case may be different (<b>I</b> <b>like</b> to sing, if gerund; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> hearing others sing, if deverbal noun).|$|R
500|$|Redding added, [...] "I had {{borrowed}} a terrible old hollow-body electric guitar from {{someone at the}} studio... because <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> to play along on rhythm to familiarise myself with a sequence, not being quite {{at home on the}} bass yet". [...] The guitar was tuned down one-half step, with the tone controls set to resemble a bass guitar.|$|E
500|$|... "I’m {{really happy}} {{and want to}} thank my {{teammates}} who helped me too much during the race. This is the biggest win of my career so far," [...] Spilak said. [...] "The time trial was really hard but <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> it. It was up and down {{all the way and}} that helped me. I gave it everything." [...] It was the Slovenian's tenth victory in the professional ranks.|$|E
500|$|However, he is keen {{to express}} his fondness for stonemasonry and its {{position}} alongside his music: [...] "I wasn't going {{to sit in a}} room and write songs seven days a week and live on bread and beans. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> doing stonemasonry as well". He still does it on an occasional basis: [...] "We wouldn’t be carving gravestones or anything. We’d do the fronts of houses, entrance walls, stuff like that".|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>like</b> {{living in}} Ambridge — 'I live in Ambridge, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it' ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{this same}} interview, Dost also said, {{regarding}} his music, [...] "I'm pretty {{heavily influenced by}} '60s pop, but also love experimenting with modern sounds. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the Beatles, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> musical theater, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> Drake." ...|$|R
