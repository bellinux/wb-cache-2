40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{several types of}} nonlin-earities used for the unique identification of receiving room im-pulse responses in stereo acoustic echo cancellation. The effective-ness is quantified by the mutual coherence of the transformed sig-nals. The perceptual degradation is studied by psychoacoustic ex-periments in terms of subjective quality and localization accuracy in the medial plane. The results indicate that, of the several non-linearities considered, ideal half-wave rectification and smoothed half-wave rectification {{appear to be the}} best choices for speech. For music, the nonlinearity parameter of the <b>ideal</b> <b>rectifier</b> must be readjusted. The smoothed rectifier does not require this read-justment, but is a little more difficult to implement.

40|$|Abstract – A novel {{control method}} is {{proposed}} for single-stage three-phase isolated buck+boost rectifier. The control method {{is based on}} the conventional cascade two-loop control structure and is modified to achieve constant instantaneous input power. Input voltages, output voltage, and DC-link inductor current are measured to control the power switches to achieve output voltage regulation as well as input power factor correction. In the proposed method, input currents are controlled such that input power is constant, even for unbalanced mains. Thus, for the balanced mains converter it behaves like an <b>ideal</b> <b>rectifier,</b> and for unbalanced mains, low-frequency harmonics of the output voltage are suppressed. The performance of the proposed control structure is verified by the numerical simulation of a 6 kW, 380 V/ 48 Vdc designed prototype...|$|E
5000|$|Rectifier {{efficiency}} (η) {{is defined}} as the ratio of DC output power to the input power from the AC supply. Even with <b>ideal</b> <b>rectifiers</b> with no losses, the efficiency is less than 100% because some of the output power is AC power rather than DC which manifests as ripple superimposed on the DC waveform. For a half-wave rectifier efficiency is very poor, ...|$|R

40|$|The preponderant {{application}} of rectifier circuits is the powering of dc loads from the ac utility line. Ordinary rectifier circuits present a nonlinear load impedance to the utility line, thereby generating harmonic currents, {{and contributing to}} the harmonic current problem. There are many active and passive rectifier circuits offering reduced harmonic currents, and in this work a methodology is developed by which these circuits may be analyzed and compared. Rectifier circuits can be classified as either active or passive. A passive rectifier circuit contains passive components (inductors, capacitors, saturable reactors, etc.), and passive switches (rectifier diodes) only. Active rectifier circuits use at least one controllable active switch (power transistor), in addition to passive switches and passive components. The performance characteristics of these circuits can be assessed {{with respect to a}} fictional device called the <b>ideal</b> <b>rectifier.</b> This assessment allows direct comparison of various approaches, passive or active, using the <b>ideal</b> <b>rectifier</b> as the common reference. Rectifier circuit performance may also be compared against specified requirements. The next topic considered is the analysis of active rectifier circuits employing a pwm (pulse width modulation) converter as a means to control power flow within the rectifier circuit. The pwm converter is modeled using the pwm switch method. A large-signal nonlinear pwm switch model is used for modeling large-signal rectifier circuit behavior, and models are developed for operation in either the continuous or discontinuous conduction mode. Similarly, a small-signal model is developed for small-signal considerations. In addition, for pwm converters operating in the continuous conduction mode, the effect of lossy resistive elements inside the converter are accounted for in the pwm switch model, and this modeling technique is shown to give results identical to those obtained via the state-space averaging method. The methods developed are then applied to the analysis of the boost rectifier operating in the discontinuous conduction mode. Three control schemes are compared, each offering a different compromise between circuit complexity and performance. Finally, a design example is given, and experimental results are provided...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a new 4 H-SiC Lateral Dual Sidewall Schottky (LDSS) {{rectifier}} on a highly doped drift layer {{consisting of a}} high-barrier sidewall Schottky contact {{on top of the}} low-barrier Schottky contact. Using two-dimensional device simulation, the performance of the proposed device has been evaluated in detail by comparing its characteristics with those of the compatible Lateral Conventional Schottky (LCS) and Lateral Trench Sidewall Schottky (LTSS) rectifiers on 4 H-SiC. From our simulation results, it is observed that the proposed LDSS rectifier acts as a low-barrier LTSS rectifier under forward bias conditions and as a high-barrier LTSS rectifier under reverse bias conditions making it an <b>ideal</b> <b>rectifier.</b> The LDSS rectifier exhibits an on/off current ratio (at 1 V / - 500 V) of 5. 5 x 10 e 7 for an epitaxial layer doping of 1 x 10 e 17 /cm^ 3. Further, the proposed LDSS structure exhibits a very sharp breakdown similar to that of a PiN diode in spite of using only Schottky junctions in the structure. We have analyzed the reasons for the improved performance of the LDSS. Comment: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the junction capacitance in resonant rectifiers which has {{a significant impact on}} the operating point of resonance circuits is studied in this paper, where the junction capacitance of the rectifier diode is to decrease the resonant current and output voltage in the circuit when compared with that in an <b>ideal</b> <b>rectifier</b> diode. This can be represented by a simplified series resonant equivalent circuit and a voltage transfer function versus the normalized operating frequency at varied values of the resonant capacitor. A low voltage to high voltage push-pull DC/DC resonant converter was used as a design example. The design procedure is based on the principle of the half bridge class-DE resonant rectifier, which ensures more accurate results. The proposed scheme provides a more systematic and feasible solution than the conventional resonant push-pull DC/DC converter analysis methodology. To increase circuit efficiency, the main switches and the rectifier diodes can be operated under the zero-voltage and zero-current switching conditions, respectively. In order to achieve this objective, the parameters of the DC/DC converter need to be designed properly. The details of the analysis and design of this DC/DC converter’s components are described. A prototype was constructed with a 62 – 88 kHz variable switching frequency, a 12 VDC input voltage, a 380 VDC output voltage, and a rated output power of 150 W. The validity of this approach was confirmed by simulation and experimental results...|$|E
2500|$|The {{average and}} RMS no-load output {{voltages}} of an <b>ideal</b> single-phase full-wave <b>rectifier</b> are: ...|$|R
2500|$|Conversion ratio (also called [...] "rectification ratio", and confusingly, [...] "efficiency") η {{is defined}} as the ratio of DC output power to the input power from the AC supply. [...] Even with <b>ideal</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> the ratio is less than 100% because some of the output power is AC power rather than DC which manifests as ripple {{superimposed}} on the DC waveform. [...] The ratio can be improved with the use of smoothing circuits which reduce the ripple and hence reduce the AC content of the output. Conversion ratio is reduced by losses in transformer windings and power dissipation in the rectifier element itself. This ratio is of little practical significance because a rectifier is almost always followed by a filter to increase DC voltage and reduce ripple. [...] In some three-phase and multi-phase applications the conversion ratio is high enough that smoothing circuitry is unnecessary.|$|R

The MEA is aimed to replace the conventional nonelectric power in aircraft with electric power {{in order to reduce}} the size and weight of the aircraft power system. This thesis considers a model of the MEA power system consisting of the following components: converters with uncontrolled diodes and controlled <b>rectifiers,</b> <b>ideal</b> constant power loads (CPL), and non-ideal CPL driven by electromechanical actuators. The system has narrow stability range under the conventional two-loop PI control.

40|$|Piezoelectric-device-based {{vibration}} energy harvesting requires a rectifier for conversion of input ac to usable dc form. Power loss due to diode drop in rectifier {{is a significant}} fraction of the already low levels of harvested power. The proposed circuit is a low-drop-diode equivalent, which mimics a diode using linear region-operated MOSFET. The proposed diode equivalent is powered directly from input signal and requires no additional power supply for its control. Power used by the control circuit is kept at a bare minimum to have an overall output power improvement. Diode equivalent was used to replace the four diodes in a full-wave bridge rectifier, which is the basic full- wave rectifier and {{is a part of}} the more advanced rectifiers like switch-only and bias-flip rectifiers. Simulation in 130 -nm technology and experiment with discrete components show that a bridge rectifier with the proposed diode provides a 30 - 169 % increase in output power extracted from piezoelectric device, as compared to a bridge rectifier with diode-connected MOSFETs. The bridge rectifier with the proposed diode can extract 90 % of the maximum available power from an <b>ideal</b> piezoelectric device-bridge <b>rectifier</b> circuit. Setting aside the constraint of power loss, simulations indicate that diode drop as low as 10 mV at 38 mu A can be achieved...|$|R
