5000|$|Cross-border higher {{education}} <b>is</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>to</b> become a fascinating but very complex phenomenon. The mobility of students, professors, knowledge and even values {{has been part}} of {{higher education}} for centuries, but it has recently grown at an extraordinary pace. The last two decades have seen a significant growth in the mobility of higher education programs and providers through physical and virtual modes of delivery. This presents many new opportunities such as improved access to higher education, strategic alliances between countries and regions, as well as the expansion of human resource and institutional capacity.

For others, it is a bad thing: they argue that at least the academics and the elites had some rational, thought-through and coherent ideas about socialism.|$|E

5000|$|The Network have in {{a number}} of {{different}} places asserted that idea that Libya should have a liberal and democratic political structure with inspiration and advice derived from religious leaders, seeing an integrated place for religion in public life, contrary for example to the secularism that exists in France. See this excerpt from interview with a member: The Libyan people are a Muslim people of faith, even if religiosity varies from person to person, from secularists to leftists to those that are very deeply religious, and with a variety of religious schools. Yet the majority of Libyans are clearly traditionalist Muslims, following the old, mainstream, Azhari line. The one paradigm that <b>is</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>to</b> encompass all such variety is that of a liberal state. This is likely to be a localised form of Anglo-American liberalism that has lots of room for religiosity, and not an anti-religious secularism.|$|E
5000|$|This {{idea was}} faced with disbelief, denial and strong scepticism, but further {{evidence}} <b>is</b> <b>emerging</b> <b>to</b> support it. In 2007, isotopic analyses by a team including Hueber and Kevin Boyce of the University of Chicago concluded that Prototaxites was a giant fungus. They detected a highly variable range of values of carbon isotope ratios {{in a range of}} Prototaxites specimens; autotrophs (organisms such as plants and algae, that make a living via photosynthesis) living at the same time draw on the same (atmospheric) source of carbon; as organisms of the same type share the same chemical machinery, they reflect this atmospheric composition with a constant carbon isotope trace. The inconsistent ratio observed in Prototaxites appears to show that the organism did not survive by photosynthesis, and Boyce's team deduce that the organism fed on a range of substrates, such as the remains of whichever other organisms were nearby. [...] Nevertheless, the large size of the organism would necessitate an extensive network of subterranean mycelia in order to obtain enough organic carbon to accumulate the necessary biomass. Root-like structures have circumstantially been interpreted as Prototaxites rhizomorphs and could support the possibility of the organism transporting nutrients large distances to support its above-ground body.|$|E
