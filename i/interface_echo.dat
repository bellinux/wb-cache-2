The velocities of wedge {{waves in the}} air and the water, and the sensitivities for the measurement, are compared with the simulation and the results obtained in the experiments. Combining the simulation and the measurement theory, it is verified that the foundation framework for the methods is available. The liquid-level sensing is carried out using the aluminum waveguide with a 30 ° wedge in the water. The liquid-level is proportional to the traveling time of the mode 1 wedge wave. The standard deviations and the uncertainties of the measurement are 0. 65 mm and 0. 21 mm using <b>interface</b> <b>echo,</b> and 0. 39 mm and 0. 12 mm utilized by end echo, which are smaller than the industry standard of 1. 5 mm.

40|$|Cased {{petroleum}} wells must be logged {{to determine}} the bonding and hydraulic isolation properties of the cement. Ultrasonic logging of single casings has been widely studied and is commercially available. However, ultrasonic logging in multiple-casing geometries is an unexplored topic despite its importance in plug and abandonment operations. Therefore, current logging technologies should be studied to evaluate whether they indicate the potential for multiple-casing logging. In this study, we used two finite-element models of pulse-echo logging. The first model represents logging in the transverse cross section of a double-casing well. The second model is {{a copy of the}} first, but with the outer casing and formation removed so that the pulse-echo transducer receives only a resonant first <b>interface</b> <b>echo</b> from the inner casing. By subtracting the received signals of the second model from those of the first, we can recover the third <b>interface</b> <b>echo</b> (TIE) signal representing the resonant reflection from the outer casing. This signal is used to study what information can, in principle, be drawn from TIEs in double-casing geometries, with the caveat that TIEs can only approximately be recovered in practical cases. We simulated variations of the material in the annulus beyond the outer casing, of the thickness of the outer casing, and of the eccentering of the outer casing. We have determined that the first two of these variations have only weak effects on the TIE, but that the eccentering of the outer casing can, in principle, be found using the TIE arrival time...|$|E

40|$|Axles are {{important}} part of railway locomotives and vehicles. Periodic ultrasonic inspection of axles can effectively detect and monitor axle fatigue cracks. However, in the axle press-fit zone, the complex interface contact condition reduces the signal-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, the probability of false positives and false negatives increases. In this work, a novel wavelet threshold function is created to remove noise and suppress press-fit interface echoes in axle ultrasonic defect detection. The exponential threshold function proposed by Andria [1] can 2 ̆ 7 t get a gradual curve for later optimum searching process; and the novel wavelet threshold function with two variables is designed to ensure the precision of optimum searching process. Based on the positive correlation between the correlation coefficient and SNR [2] and with the experiment phenomenon that the defect and the press-fit <b>interface</b> <b>echo</b> have different axle-circumferential correlation characteristics, a discrete optimum searching process for two undetermined variables in novel wavelet threshold function is conducted. The performance of the proposed method is assessed by comparing it with traditional threshold methods using real data. The statistic results of the amplitude and the peak SNR of defect echoes show that the proposed wavelet threshold denoising method not only maintains the amplitude of defect echoes but also has a higher peak SNR...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the acoustic theory behind current ultrasonic cement evaluation tools. The UltraSonic Imager tool's {{pulse echo technique}} and the new Isolation Scanner tool's pitch-catch leaky lamb wave measuring technique is explained. A laboratory experiment is conducted on a steel casing set-up (BeCaLoS) designed by SINTEF Petroleum Research to test, and highlight weaknesses of these measuring techniques. Both evaluation methods are successfully performed under four different conditions; with air, water, mud and cement behind the steel casing. Pulse-echo wave resonance attenuation measurements prove {{to be successful in}} evaluating the physical state of the material behind the casing. Interference from the third <b>interface</b> <b>echo</b> in the resonance waveform gives good annulus thickness information. Calculated cement impedance values indicate the presence of a microannuls. The pitch-catch plate wave attenuation measurements prove the evaluation method's weakness to thick casings. Lamb wave mode analysis is done and shows a possible mix of higher-order lamb modes present in the plate wave. Annulus material with high acoustic attenuation gave values that were difficult to interpret. The cement measurements showed low attenuation values caused by cement impedance above critical values; illustrating the importance of using both pulse-echo and pitch-catch to determine well integrity conditions. Third interface echoes were recorded successfully and gave a pretty accurate annulus thickness value. A question was raised to whether the amplitude of the initial flexural wave can be used to give information on annulus condition. The need for cement evaluation will greatly increase in the near future, and the limitations of current tools are a cause for concern and further research in the field of cement evaluation is encouraged. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cased {{petroleum}} wells must be logged {{to determine}} the bonding and hydraulic isolation properties of the sealing material and {{to determine the}} structural integrity status. Although ultrasonic pitch-catch logging in single-casing geometries has been widely studied and is commercially available, {{this is not the}} case for logging in double-casing geometries despite its increasing importance in plug and abandonment operations. It is therefore important to investigate whether existing logging tools can be used in such geometries. Using a finite-element model of a double-casing geometry with a two-receiver pitch-catch setup, we have simulated through-tubing logging, with fluid between the two casings. We found that there appears a cascade of leaky Lamb wave packets on both casings, linked by leaked wavefronts. By varying the geometry and materials in the model, we have examined the effect on the pulse received from the second wave packet on the inner casing, sometimes known as the third <b>interface</b> <b>echo.</b> The amplitude of this pulse was found to contain information on the bonded material in the outer annulus. Much stronger amplitude variations were found with two equally thick casings than with a significant thickness difference; relative thickness differences of up to one-third were simulated. Finally, we have developed a simple mathematical model of the wave packets’ time evolution to encapsulate and validate our understanding of the wave packet cascade. This model shows a more complex time evolution in the later wave packets than the exponentially attenuated primary packet, which is currently used for single-casing logging. This indicates that tools with more than two receivers, which could measure wave packets’ amplitude at more than two points along their time evolution, would be able to draw more information from these later packets. The model was validated against simulations, finding good agreement when the underlying assumptions of the model were satisfied...|$|E

30|$|Contrarily, in the {{classical}} frequency division duplexing mode (FDD), the data between BS and MT can be delivered continuously in the time domain in both directions if needed, but the split between UL and DL is realized in the spectrum domain, i.e., dedicated fragments of the frequency spectrum are assigned to each transmission direction. In such a case, the problem of asymmetric traffic can be solved by allowing data transmission in a selected direction in both bands. In other words, UL band can be utilized for DL transmission and vice-versa. Some interesting discussion can be found in, e.g., [5, 6]. It is also worth noticing here that the frequency bands dedicated for UL and DL transmission are separated by a dedicated frequency gap guaranteeing enough isolation between the transmit and receive signals. This isolation is required, as the problem of efficient canceling of strong interference at the reception <b>interface</b> <b>echoed</b> from the transmitted one is not mature enough today, although much progress has been achieved {{in the area of}} wireless full-duplex transmission [7, 8].

40|$|The time {{required}} for inspection and maintenance of piping systems and vessels needs to be reduced to both minimize down time and decrease operational costs of petrochemical plants. Current ultrasonic inspection systems are not suited for on-line monitoring, with the main issues being the resistance of transducers and their coupling to high temperatures {{and the removal of}} insulation to access structures. The use of welded cylindrical rods is thus proposed, but measurements are threatened by "trailing echo" generation in waveguides. The introduction of a taper angle is investigated to attenuate these undesired echoes. While clean signals can always be obtained by increasing the taper angle in long rods, that is not always the case for short rods, which are considered here. In addition, temperature variations have a non-negligible impact on the arrival time of the backwall echo when performing measurements with a waveguide, and on-line compensation is essential. Since the <b>interface</b> <b>echo</b> between the rod and the pipe wall may be suppressed after the welding operation, a notch is machined {{at the end of the}} rod to create a reflected echo, which can be used for on-line compensation. Finally, the implementation of waveguides is considered for both pulse-echo and pitch-catch modes. In the pitch-catch mode, the backwall echo and the notch echo are received by different transducers and signals of interst are both first arrivals. As a result, trailing echoes do not impede measurements and their attenuation becomes unnecessary. In contrast, pulse-echo measurements are sensitive to trailing echoes and the waveguide's design plays an essential role in the feasibility of measurements. However, the environment also imposes a set of constraints on waveguide dimensions that complicates the implementation of pulse-echo measurements. Being more flexible, the pitch-catch configuration is chosen for final implementation. Experiments are performed to verify the concept feasibility, and the accuracy of measurements with thickness and temperature changes is also confirmed. M. S.

40|$|When {{ultrasonic}} pulses {{are used}} to detect flaws that are near the surface or in thin-layered structures, the natural tendency {{is to use a}} narrow pulse. A broadband pulse with a high center frequency and a large bandwidth will allow the flaw <b>echo</b> and <b>interface</b> <b>echoes</b> to be resolved from the front surface echo in an immersion or squirter testing situation. However, {{there are a number of}} limitations in using high frequency ultrasound. The major disadvantages are the high attenuation, hence the limited interrogation depth, and the degradation of ultrasonic scan images due to interference effects. Interference fringes can arise from minute thickness changes of the various material layers and can mask the flaw images [1]. In ultrasonic C-scans it is also important that the time gate used for interrogating a certain depth range be properly positioned and that the gate be able to follow the surface contour if the part is not flat. These problems can largely be avoided at lower frequencies, but the correspondingly poorer temporal resolution can impair the detection of near-surface flaws. It is generally accepted that there is a “dead time” associated with the front surface ringdown during which near-surface flaws are undetectable. Authors of this paper have encountered these problems in their studies of (1) foreign object detection in composite laminates, (2) disbond and corrosion detection in adhesively bonded aircraft skins, and (3) defects in the bond between thin composite face-sheet and honeycomb core of sandwich structures...|$|R

30|$|US is an imaging {{modality}} {{widely available in}} the Emergency Department. The lower cost {{and in particular the}} lack of radiation exposure are the most important advantages of US compared to CT. Furthermore US is a real-time dynamic examination and this characteristic conveys dynamic information about bowel motility and changes in position, and to depict blood flow. Another important advantage of US examination is the possibility to correlate the US findings with the point of maximal tenderness. Besides, in not too obese patients, US may be superior to CT, and it is most useful in early, uncomplicated diverticulitis. From a technical point of view, both curved (3.5 – 5.0 -MHz) and linear (5.0 – 12.0 -MHz) transducers are most commonly used, in particular the higher frequency probes are useful for detailed investigation of the large bowel wall, identifying its typical haustral pattern. Focal bowel masses, segments of wall thickening, and dilated loops may be evident even at lower frequencies, but high-frequency probes are essential to identify and chracterize changes in the layers of the bowel wall. At higher frequencies, US images the bowel wall as five alternating bands (gut signature) of high and low echogenicity to produce a characteristic sonographic signature approximating to the concentric layered histologic structure [48]. Visualization of the fine inner and outer bright layers (<b>interface</b> <b>echoes)</b> is highly dependent on the echogenicity of adjacent structures and is most easily seen where there is fluid in the bowel lumen or ascites between bowel loops. Even at lower diagnostic frequencies in loops further from the probe, at least the two most prominent layers are evident due to their relative thickness and high contrast: the bright submucosa (third layer) and the dark muscularis propria (fourth layer) [34]. Doppler scanning demonstrates no signal in normal bowel wall [49, 50].|$|R

Echo in telephone networks, Line Echo, is observed naturally due to impedance mismatches at the long-distance/local-loop <b>interface.</b> Acoustic <b>echo</b> {{is due to}} the acoustic coupling between the microphone and the speaker of a speakerphone. The Affine Projection (APA) and the Fast Affine Projection (FAP) algorithms are two examples of reliable and efficient adaptive filters used for echo cancellation. The FAP Algorithm is considerably less complex than the APA while demonstrating similar convergence properties. Both algorithms use a fixed regularization parameter to mitigate undue noise amplification for small eigenvalues in the excitation covariance matrix. However, this regularization also introduces a bias and limits the convergence property of the adaptive filter.

40|$|The {{principles}} of US physics and technology hampering both {{the production of}} US images of the bone and {{the assessment of the}} soft tissue structures underlying it are discussed. In theory, two US parameters play a role in this field: the different transmission velocity of the US beam through soft tissues and bone, and the marked attenuation of the US beam when crossing the bone. The former parameter, due to higher density and lower compressibility of the bone with respect to soft tissues, causes both intense reflection (and thus beam weakening) and refraction (and thus lateral resolution and US image distortions) at the soft tissue/bone interfaces. Moreover, US transmission velocity in the bone differs significantly from the reference velocity of the US scanners on the market based on that of soft tissues. As a consequence, during the reconstruction of a bone US image, artifacts resulting in the axial compression of bone structures should, at least in theory, occur. The latter parameter, due to both conversion into heat (absorption) and local dispersion (scattering), is likely to be main factor causing the loss of US energy when the US beam passes through the bone. Although the amount of matter (bone mass or density) undoubtedly accounts for some attenuation, local bone architecture (bulk and shear moduli of bone and marrow, bone and marrow density, marrow viscosity and porosity, permeability and tortuosity of cancellous bone structure) seems nevertheless also responsible for some attenuation through both absorption and scattering. Other consequences of attenuation reflecting on US imaging of the bone are: marked lowering of central transducer frequency and US beam widening preventing the correct identification of the <b>interfaces</b> originating <b>echoes</b> by relating them to the structures on the transducer axis. In conclusion, based on the above parameters, echoencephalography and transcranial Doppler US can be expected to improve, in the near future, their bone-crossing capabilities, even though no true gray-scale bone sonogram will ever be feasible...|$|R
40|$|The Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) {{will conduct}} a global survey of Mars from the Mars Express Orbiter {{starting}} in 2004. The primary objective of the subsurface observations is to detect material interfaces in the upper several kilometers of the crust of Mars, with a particular emphasis on mapping the 3 D distribution of water and ice in {{that portion of the}} crust. In order to detect subsurface <b>interfaces,</b> the returned <b>echo</b> from the subsurface must be distinguished from noise and clutter, which can arise from a variety of sources. One source of clutter is surface topography that generates backscattered energy at the same time delay as the subsurface region of interest. Surface topography can affect the detectability of subsurface features in several other ways. Surface roughness at scales comparable or somewhat smaller than the radar wavelength reduces the coherency of the wave as it passes the upper interface. Also, surface slope (tilt) at scales of the radar footprint and larger (> 5 km) affects the apparent Doppler signature of the echoes, and effectively disperses the wave transmitted into the subsurface, making processing and interpretation difficult. In this paper, we report on the roughness characteristics of Mars at these various scales as measured by the Mars Global Surveyor Laser Altimeter (MOLA), and consider the implications for achieving the subsurface sounding goals of MARSIS.

Furthermore, to develop and describe a computerized method for measurement of intima-media thickness (IMT) and lumen diameter. The aims of the clinical {{part of the study}} was first to evaluate the whether hypertensive patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease had larger far wall common carotid IMT than a control group and to relate the IMT to signs or symptoms of atherosclerotic disease. A 3 -year follow up study was then performed in the high risk group to analyze if a favorable change in risk factors, caused by a risk factor modification program, might beneficially affect ultrasound assessed IMT or plaques in the carotid artery in comparison with usual care. Furthermore, to evaluate ultrasound measurements of IMT and plaque occurrence in the femoral artery in relation to symptoms of claudicatio intermittens and ankle-arm index. Finally, to evaluate the presence of possible myocardial ischemia according to different exercise ECG and 24 -h Holter monitoring criteria and the relationship to common carotid IMT in the high risk hypertensive group and a group at low cardiovascular risk. We concluded from the in vitro ultrasound imaging experiments that lumen and IMT of the far wall were accessible for quantitative measurements. A computerized system for measurements of wall thickness and lumen diameter was developed. Studies of inter- and intra-observer variability showed a satisfactory reproducibility for measurements of both carotid and femoral IMT. The IMT and lumen diameter of the common carotid artery were increased in the high risk hypertensive patients in comparison to a control group and the IMT was related to plaque status in the carotid artery region. Occurrence of moderate to large plaque formations in the carotid artery was related to clinically manifest cardiovascular disease. Though favorable changes in risk factors occurred, {{there was no difference in}} IMT and plaque status between the intervention and usual care groups after 3 years. Fasting insulin at baseline was related to the increase in IMT during follow-up. The femoral artery study suggested that the sonographic variables were valuable indicators of atherosclerotic disease and that subclinical atherosclerosis in the femoral artery was more common in the patients than earlier known. The exercise ECG study showed that heart rate adjusted ST criteria were more sensitive in detecting possible myocardial ischemia than standard criteria. The ST/HR slope and rate recovery loop completed each other and abnormal changes were related to an increased IMT. The contribution of standard criteria and Holter monitoring to diagnosis were insignificant. A new quantitative method to assess the rate recovery loop was described. In summary, new computer-aided ultrasound methods has been presented, suitable for direct evaluation of early subclinical atherosclerosis in large superficial arteries as the carotid and femoral arteries. These methods are useful tools in evaluating IMT in cross-sectional and prospective studies.
