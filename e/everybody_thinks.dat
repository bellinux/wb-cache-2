5|$|Brian and Stewie {{decide to}} go to the North Pole to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get {{disappointed}} if Santa is not what <b>everybody</b> <b>thinks</b> he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to the North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see the Aurora borealis and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E

500|$|The Slim Shady LP was {{recorded}} at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. [...] Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since {{listening to his}} group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous {{to work with him}} on the album: [...] "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." [...] However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. [...] The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; [...] "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled.

500|$|Ian McShane, who {{previously}} {{starred in the}} HBO television series Deadwood, guest starred in the episode as Ray. His casting for the series was announced in August 2015.

[...] McShane also revealed that his character would [...] "bring back a much-loved character <b>everybody</b> <b>thinks</b> is dead," [...] leading many to speculate prior to the season that he would either play a role in bringing back Jon Snow, or the Hound, whose fate had also been called into question since his disappearance. McShane was asked about whether there was pressure involved with joining a show that has become an [...] "international hit," [...] with McShane responding [...] "No pressure! It's the most popular TV show in the world, isn't it? I enjoyed meeting showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss – nobody ever expects the kind of reaction this has gotten. It's kind of like Deadwood when we started off, but they've managed to go another three seasons. It's interesting because you're a part of the show, but you're not part of the show. I only needed Rory for my scenes, so I didn't meet anybody else in it." [...] Bryan Cogman stated that the character of Ray was a combination of several different characters from the A Song of Ice and Fire series, most evidently the Elder Brother, and Septon Meribald.|$|E

2500|$|Foster's {{mother was}} {{concerned}} that her daughter's career would end {{by the time she}} grew out of playing children, and decided that to ensure continued work and to gain greater recognition, Foster should also begin acting in films for adult audiences. After the minor supporting role in Alice, Martin Scorsese cast her in the role of a teenage prostitute in Taxi Driver (1976). The Los Angeles Welfare Board initially opposed twelve-year-old Foster's appearing in the film due to its violent content, but relented after governor Pat Brown intervened and a UCLA psychiatrist assessed her. A social worker was required to accompany her on set and her older sister Connie acted as her stand-in in sexually suggestive scenes. Foster later commented on the controversy saying that she hated [...] "the idea that <b>everybody</b> <b>thinks</b> if a kid's going to be an actress it means that she has to play Shirley Temple or someone's little sister." ...|$|E

Former Steubenville baseball player Michael Nodianos, responding to hearsay of the event, tweeted [...] "Some people deserve to be peed on," [...] which was retweeted later by several people, including Mays.

That's how you know she's dead, because someone pissed on her." [...] While he did not sexually assault the victim himself, Nodianos, a scholarship student at Ohio State at the time news of the rape broke, received numerous threats for his comments, as did his family in Steubenville, and subsequently dropped out of school. In one text, Mays described the victim as [...] "like a dead body" [...] and [...] "deader than Caylee Anthony" [...] and in another he told the victim that a photo of her lying naked in a basement with semen on her body had been taken by him, and that the semen was his.
