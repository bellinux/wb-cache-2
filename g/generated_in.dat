5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{prepared}} by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water. Hydrogen chloride can be <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> many ways, and thus several precursors to hydrochloric acid exist.

5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines {{because of the high}} magnetic fields <b>generated.</b> <b>In</b> the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{moves in}} a single outward {{direction}} from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space. Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> blood vessels by the beating of the heart.

5|$|Control {{of water}} {{was the primary}} concern in the {{building}} of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{significant}} reclamation {{on the two}} sites very little evidence remains of the power stations, other than {{a small number of}} bricks and steel rods. Some minor structures have survived to the North West of the North station's site, including a road bridge over the rail line which served the station, a brick wall, and a concrete staircase. More obvious remains of the power stations are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. Much of this electrical power is <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 kilovolt (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E

5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Given that Ganymede is {{completely}} differentiated {{and has a}} metallic core, its intrinsic magnetic field is probably <b>generated</b> <b>in</b> a similar fashion to the Earth's: {{as a result of}} conducting material moving in the interior.
