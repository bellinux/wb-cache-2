5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. <b>Direct</b> <b>current,</b> as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state <b>direct</b> <b>current,</b> such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E

5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use <b>direct</b> <b>current,</b> but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of <b>direct</b> <b>current,</b> as well as alternating current. However, with <b>direct</b> <b>current,</b> because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{appearance}} of <b>directed</b> <b>current</b> in tunnel junctions, quantum ratchet effect, {{in the presence of}} an external ac field f(t). The current is established in a one-dimensional discrete inhomogeneous "tight-binding model". By making use of a symmetry analysis we predict the right choice of f(t) and obtain the <b>directed</b> <b>current</b> as a difference between electron transmission coefficients in opposite directions, Δ T = T^LR-T^RL. Numerical simulations confirm the predictions of the symmetry analysis and moreover, show that the <b>directed</b> <b>current</b> can be drastically increased by a proper choice of frequency and amplitudes of the ac field f(t).

Eventually, <b>Direct</b> <b>Currents</b> contained a flipbook format, with one side containing features about DC Universe titles, and the other containing features about titles from DC's Vertigo and Paradox Press imprints.

5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into <b>direct</b> <b>current.</b> Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the rectification of thermal fluctuations in a mesoscopic on-chip heat engine. The engine {{consists of a}} hot chaotic cavity capacitively coupled to a cold cavity which rectifies the excess noise and generates a <b>directed</b> <b>current.</b> The fluctuation-induced <b>directed</b> <b>current</b> depends on the energy asymmetry of the transmissions of the contacts of the cold cavity to the leads and {{is proportional to the}} temperature difference.

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E

Treating {{the strength of the}} external potential as a small parameter with respect to thermal energy, we present a perturbative calculation to obtain the expression for average <b>directed</b> <b>current.</b> This depends on driving frequency, phase, and particle density. The <b>directed</b> <b>current</b> vanishes as density goes to zero or close packing. For two choices of hopping rates, it reaches maximum at intermediate densities, while for a third choice, it shows a curious current reversal with increasing density. This can be interpreted in terms of a particle-hole symmetry. Stochastic simulations of the model show good agreement with our analytic predictions.

5|$|The {{preferred}} polarity of the SMAW system depends primarily {{upon the}} electrode being {{used and the}} desired properties of the weld. <b>Direct</b> <b>current</b> with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) causes heat to build up on the electrode, increasing the electrode melting rate and decreasing {{the depth of the}} weld. Reversing the polarity so that the electrode is positively charged (DCEP) and the workpiece is negatively charged increases the weld penetration. With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an even heat distribution and providing a balance between electrode melting rate and penetration.|$|E
5|$|Weld spatter, {{while not}} {{affecting}} {{the integrity of}} the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. It can be caused by excessively high current, a long arc, or arc blow, a condition associated with <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow can also cause porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding arc, especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, but even in the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a <b>direct</b> <b>current,</b> gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding magnesium.|$|E
