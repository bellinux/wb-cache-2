500|$|Fox {{said that}} while filming her highly {{anticipated}} kissing scene with Seyfried that Seyfried was [...] "extremely uncomfortable" [...] but that she herself was not. [...] "I feel much safer with girls, so <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> comfortable kissing [...] than kissing {{any of the other}} people that I had to kiss", she said. Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused [...] "giggling fits" [...] between takes. Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes. She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. [...] "It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman", she stated. [...] "It is just weird. It is a woman. With a woman's smell—soft and floraly—and maybe the pheromones are different. Something about it felt uncomfortable for me." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 5, 2010, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that Dirty Sexy Money actor Seth Gabel had been {{cast as the}} lead Fringe investigator in the parallel universe, and would be making his first appearance in the finale as a possible recurring character. Jeff Pinkner described the character as [...] "the scientist-cop-leader of the team on the Other Side." [...] In an interview with TV Guide, Gabel commented that during shooting {{he felt that he}} looked [...] "like such a doofus holding a gun," [...] but changed his mind when he saw the finished production. Gabel elaborated, [...] "I was so scared that I wouldn't pull it off. Once I saw myself being a scientist-slash-FBI hero, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> confident and relaxed." [...] His character is caught in a large explosion in the finale, but Gabel confirmed, in a Chicago Tribune interview, that his character would be returning for the third season. He states that the parallel universe has [...] "special technology than can heal burns".|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackman went {{to primary}} school at Pymble Public School and later {{attended}} the all-boys Knox Grammar School on Sydney's Upper North Shore, where he starred in its production of My Fair Lady in 1985 {{and became the}} school captain in 1986.

2500|$|Adele {{had said}} that she began writing it on her {{acoustic}} guitar {{in the wake of}} the break-up of her 18-month relationship with the 30-year-old man she thought she would marry. A few months after their split, he was engaged to someone else. [...] "We were so intense I thought we would get married. But that was something he never wanted... So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever. But after I wrote it, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> at peace. It set me free... I didn't think it would resonate... with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for." [...] She also said that [...] "I wrote that song on the end of my bed. I had a cold. I was waiting for my bath to run. I'd found out that he'd got engaged to someone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chase J. Nielsen, {{one of the}} U.S. airmen {{who flew}} in the Doolittle raid {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors. At their trial for war crimes following the war, he testified [...] "Well, I was put on my back {{on the floor with}} my arms and legs stretched out, one guard holding each limb. The towel was wrapped around my face and put across my face and water poured on. They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation, then they would let up until I'd get my breath, then they'd start over again... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death." [...] In 2007, Senator John McCain claimed that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II. A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{charge of}} the Heavy Brigade was {{anything}} but a charge – the brigade had launched uphill from a standing start, and the short distance between the two combatants had hardly allowed their horses to reach the trot. Moreover, the Russians were at last moving to meet them. [...] Scarlett was first into Ryzhov's cavalry, closely followed by his staff, and, initially, just three squadrons – two of the Scots Greys on the left, {{and one of the}} 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons on the right, totalling 300 men. The first to feel the force of the British attack were the Ingermanland Hussars, under the command of Major General Khaletsky. Staff-captain Arbuzov later described how they [...] " [...] … had to fight with the regiment of Queen Victoria's Dragoon Guards in their red coats … Neither we nor the English wanted to yield." [...] A British Dragoon later described the action from his own perspective – [...] "They were so superior in numbers, they outflanked us, and we {{were in the middle of}} them … I hope God will forgive me, for <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> like a devil than a man." ...|$|E

60|$|Well, Azeglio is a man. Seldom have I seen a {{man whom}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> sympathy towards. He has a large, clear, {{attractive}} 'sphere,' as we Swedenborgians say.|$|E

5000|$|Leonov later {{spoke of}} how greatly he valued his {{experience}} with Stanislavski and the cast. [...] "The play was long and difficult, I had to make considerable cuts...

6000|$|... "Before I {{left the}} deck <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> another shock.

60|$|At first I had {{a time of}} it dodging their villainous hook-swords, {{but after}} a minute or two I had succeeded in wresting a second {{straight}} sword from one of the racks along the wall, and thereafter, using it to parry the hooks of my antagonists, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> evenly equipped.|$|E
60|$|Look at the {{influence}} of a mere play of physiognomy! If you remember {{what we were talking about}} you will hardly believe that I caught myself grinning down at that demure little girl.

60|$|She {{looked so}} attentively and anxiously at me (I even saw her tremble), that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> now, <b>more</b> than ever, {{that she had}} {{followed}} my late thoughts.
