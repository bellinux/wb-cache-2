Larger levels of crank power are produced during the downstroke phase of the pedal cycle where the knee extensor muscles are highly activated and produce large levels of joint power. Reductions in force-generating capacity of the knee extensors resulting from <b>fatiguing</b> <b>cycling</b> exercises have been linked with {{a reduction in the}} ability of individuals to produce crank power and alterations in muscle coordination. However, <b>fatigue</b> induced by <b>cycling</b> exercises is likely to reduce the force-generating capacities of the other lower limb muscles, making it impossible to identify the effect of fatigue in the knee extensors on crank power production and muscle coordination. Isolated reductions in force-generating capacity of the knee extensors have been observed following singlejoint exercises requiring repeated contractions of this muscle group. To date, it is unknown how a unilateral single joint exercise effects power production during a bilateral movement.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the change in the}} energetically optimal cadence after prolonged cycling. The energetically optimal cadence (EOC) was determined in 14 experienced cyclists by pulmonary gas exchange at six different cadences (100 - 50 rpm at 10 rpm intervals).

The EOC decreased after prolonged cycling exercise at a high as well as at a low fixed cadence (P < 0. 01). According to the generalized muscle equations of Hill, this indicates that most likely more type I muscle fibres contribute to muscular power output after <b>fatiguing</b> <b>cycling</b> exercise compared to cycling in the beginning of an exercise bout.

30|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) pose of rigid {{segments}} can {{be fully}} specified by {{six degrees of}} freedom (DOF): three relating to translation and three defining orientation. As such, even for a relatively simple 14 -segment human body model, a large number of DOF (potentially as many as 84 depending on the anatomical constraints employed) need to be recovered to completely characterise 3 D body configuration. From such a model, it is possible to compute joint angles, and with the incorporation of body segment inertia parameters, the whole body centre of mass location can be deduced, as in previous research in sprinting [11, 12], gymnastics [13] and rugby place-kicking [14]. Moreover, kinematic and kinetic data can be combined to allow the calculation of joint moments and powers through inverse dynamics analysis [15]. Such analyses have value across diverse areas from, for example, understanding lower-limb joint power production across <b>fatiguing</b> <b>cycling</b> efforts [16] to characterising joint torque profiles following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery [17]. However, obtaining accurate body pose is an essential step before reliable joint moments (and powers) can be robustly acquired, as inaccuracies in kinematic data will propagate to larger errors in joint kinetic parameters [18].|$|R

Methods: Twelve novice male triathletes aged 23. 7 ± 2. 1 years participated in this quasi experimental study. Surface electromyographic activity from gastrocnemius, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris and semitendinosus were recorded during support and non-support phases of running before and after <b>cycling</b> <b>fatigue</b> protocol. General and directed co-activation of the knee muscles were calculated. Paired t-test was used to analyze the data(p< 0. 05). Results: General co-activation was significantly reduced in propulsion sub-phase, total support and non-support phases after fatigue (p= 0. 001), but there were not any differences in heel contact and midstance sub-phases. Fatigue only altered directed co-activation of medial and lateral knee muscles during heel contact sub-phase (p= 0. 034).

From 16 healthy male subjects performing a constant-load test at 60 % peak oxygen consumption (VO(2 peak)) until volitional exhaustion, electroencephalography data were analysed during repetitive, artefact-free periods of 1 -min duration.

Following previous imaging studies reporting the mid/anterior insular cortex as an essential instance processing a variety of sensory stimuli and signalling forthcoming physiological threat, our results provide further evidence that during a fatiguing exercise this structure might not only integrate and evaluate sensory information from the periphery, but also act in communication with the motor cortex.

40|$|It {{is now a}} well {{established}} fact that fatigue cracks initiate from persistent slip bands (PSBs). Previous work on copper fatigued in reverse bending has revealed that the PSBs form much earlier near indentations or surface pits than in regions well away from them. The cause of this effect has been attributed partly to a dislocation microstructure introduced by the indentations as well as possible contribution from the residual stresses resulting from them and geometric stress raising effects. To study this phenomenon in a greater depth, an attempt {{has been made to}} make a comprehensive study of the plastic deformation around indentations and to study their effect on the low ampltude <b>fatigue</b> <b>cycling</b> of mono and polycrystalline copper. This effect has been studied using both surface as well as Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) observations. The project was divided into four main categories; a study of the deformation around indentations; a study of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>cycling</b> mechanism; a study of the low strain amplitude <b>fatigue</b> <b>cycling</b> of the indented specimens and a study of the effect of indentation on the fatigued specimens. The surface topographical studies were made on specially designed polycrystalline and single crystal specimens of copper. The transmission electron microscope study has been done mainly on thin strips sliced and prepared from two bulk single crystals with axial orientation close to [124] and [012]. The dislocation structures due to indentations were studied in regions at different positions in relation to the indentations and included a study of the microstructures close to the surface as well as ~ 50 mum from it. Specimens were fatigued in air, at room temperature, at total strain amplitudes in the range = 2 x 10 - 4 to 9. 8 x 10 - 4 for bulk specimens and a 0. 8 x 10 - 3 to 1. 9 x 10 - 3 for thin foil specimens. The number of fatigue cycles given to the specimens varied (from specimen to specimen) from a few cycles to several hundred thousand cycles. The Dyer model (1965) has been satisfactorily extended from ball to pyramid indentations to explain the hill formation and the general surface topography around indentations. Dislocation, microstructures around indentations in the 'indented' and 'indented and fatigued' specimens of the same orientation have been analysed and compared. Such an analysis has revealed that in the regions of indentations in which PSBs are initiated more readily, the dislocation microstructure due to indentation contained predominantly the Burgers vectors +/-a/ 2 [110] or +/-a/ 2 [011] and +/-a/ 2 [110] or +/-a/ 2 [011]. In contrast to these, the most frequently found Burgers vectors in the same regions of the indentation followed by fatigue were +/-a/ 2 [101] and +/-a/ 2 [011], which reveals that the Burgers vectors of the dislocations introduced by the indentation in these regions are quite favourable for the later stage of <b>fatigue</b> <b>cycling,</b> with an enhanced density of dislocations. A little work was also done to study the effect of the indentations made in the fatigued specimens. It has showed an enhancement of the inhomogeneous and anisotropic deformation around the indentations caused by <b>fatigue</b> <b>cycling</b> as well as a significantly different type of slip bands...|$|E

In contrast to the usual practice of picking one particular characteristic of the signal, e. g., the median or mean frequency, multiple variables were used to obtain a thorough characterization of EMG signals in the spectral domain. Based on these variables, linear and non-linear (random forest) models were built to predict blood lactate concentration and oxygen consumption. The results showed that mean and median frequencies are sub-optimal choices for predicting these physiological quantities in dynamic exercises, as they did not exhibit significant changes over the course of our protocol and only weakly correlated with blood lactate concentration or oxygen uptake. Instead, the root mean square of the original signal and backward difference, as well as parameters describing the tails of the EMG power distribution were the most important variables for these models. Coefficients of determination ranging from R 2 = 0 : 77 to R 2 = 0 : 98 (for blood lactate) and from R 2 = 0 : 81 to R 2 = 0 : 97 (for oxygen uptake) were obtained when using random forest regressors...|$|R
