40|$|We {{examined}} {{the development of}} stress assignment in reading Italian aloud. We investigated frequency effects as a marker {{of the use of}} item-specific lexical knowledge in assigning stress together with stress dominance and stress neighborhood (the number of words sharing both stress and ending) as markers of distributional information regarding properties of the lexicon extracted from spoken language. We tested second and fourth graders in a reading aloud experiment including high- and low-frequency words and nonwords. Results show that despite the regularity of orthography-phonology mappings in Italian and the predominant use of phonological recoding procedures, item-specific lexical knowledge is also used, even by beginning readers. The frequency effect was significant and did not increase with age, while stress errors on low frequency words decreased with increasing <b>grade.</b> <b>Stress</b> neighbourhood increasingly affected stress assignment on nonwords with older children. Taken together, our findings show that both item-specific knowledge and general information about stress distribution are relevant in children’s reading, suggesting the simultaneous use of both lexical and sub-lexical information. Moreover, as the reading system develops and knowledge about the relative distribution of stress neighborhood increases, larger grain-size units are also exploited...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship between stress and acne severity. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 144 6 th year female medical students 22 to 24 years in age attending the medical faculty at King Abdulaziz University. This study used the global acne grading system (GAGS) to assess acne severity in relation to stress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The questionnaire also included some confounding factors involved in acne severity. Results: The results indicated an increase in stress severity strongly correlated with an increase in acne severity, which was statistically significant (p< 0. 01). Subjects with higher stress scores, determined using the PSS, had higher acne severity when examined and graded using the GAGS. Conclusion: On the basis of this study, it is concluded that stress positively correlates with acne severity.

40|$|This report {{describes}} progress, experiments, {{and results}} {{for a project}} to develop a pipeline inline inspection tool that uses electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) to detect and <b>grade</b> <b>stress</b> corrosion cracking (SCC). There is a brief introduction that gives background material about EMATs and relevant previous Tuboscope work toward a tool. This work left various choices about the modes and transducers for this project. The experimental section then describes the lab systems, improvements to these systems, and setups and techniques to narrow the choices. Improvements, which involved transducer matching networks, better magnetic biasing, and lower noise electronics, led to improved signal to noise (SNR) levels. The setups permitted transducer characterizations and interaction measurements in plates with man-made cracks, pipeline sections with SCC, and a full pipe with SCC. The latter were done with a moveable and compact EMAT setup, called a lab mouse, which is detailed. Next, the results section justifies the mode and transducer choices. These were for magnetostrictive EMATs {{and the use of}} EMAT launched modes: SH 0 (at 2. 1 MHz-mm) and SV 1 (at 3. 9 MHz-mm). This section then gives details of measurements on these modes. The measurements consisted of signal to noise ratio, insertion loss, magnetic biasing sensitivities crack reflection and transmission coefficients, beam width, standoff and tilt sensitivities. For most of the measurements the section presents analysis curves, such as reflection coefficient versus crack depth. Some notable results for the chosen modes are: that acceptable SNRs were generated in a pipe with magnetostrictive EMATs, that optimum bias for magnetostrictive transmitters and receivers is magnetic saturation, that crack reflection and transmission coefficients from crack interactions agree with 2 D simulations and seem workable for crack grading, and that the mouse has good waveform quality and so is ready for exhaustive measurement EMAT scans of SCC interactions. This section also reviews further coil optimization and implementation requirements. These involve transmitter and receiver power, acquisition parameters, and magnetic configuration. At this time all these seem reasonable for an ILI tool...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} prototypes, measurements, {{and results}} {{for a project}} to develop a prototype pipeline in-line inspection (ILI) tool that uses electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) to detect and <b>grade</b> <b>stress</b> corrosion cracking (SCC). The introduction briefly provides motivation and describes SCC, gives some background on EMATs and guided ultrasonic waves, and reviews promising results of a previous project using EMATs for SCC. The experimental section then describes lab measurement techniques and equipment, the lab mouse and prototypes for a mule, and scan measurements made on SCC. The mouse was a moveable and compact EMAT setup. The prototypes were even more compact circuits intended to be pulled or used in an ILI tool. The purpose of the measurements {{was to determine the}} best modes, transduction, and processing to use, to characterize the transducers, and to prove EMATs and mule components could produce useful results. Next, the results section summarizes the measurements and describes the mouse scans, processing, prototype circuit operating parameters, and performance for SH 0 scans. Results are given in terms of specifications [...] like SNR, power, insertion loss [...] and parametric curves [...] such as signal amplitude versus magnetic bias or standoff, reflection or transmission coefficients versus crack depth. Initially, lab results indicated magnetostrictive transducers using both SH 0 and SV 1 modes would be worthwhile to pursue in a practical ILI system. However, work with mule components showed that SV 1 would be too dispersive, so SV 1 was abandoned. The results showed that reflection measurements, when normalized by the direct arrival are sensitive to and correlated with SCC. This was not true for transmission measurements. Processing yields a high data reduction, almost 60 to 1, and permits A and C scan display techniques and software already in use for pipeline inspection. An analysis of actual SH 0 scan results for SCC of known dimensions showed that length and depth could be determined for deep enough cracks. Defect shadow and short length effects were apparent but may be taken into account. The SH 0 scan was done with the mule prototype circuits and permanent magnet EMATs. These gave good enough results that this hardware and the processing techniques are very encouraging for use in a practical ILI tool...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relation between SOC, attitudes towards <b>grades,</b> and perceived <b>stress</b> levels among adolescents, and whether there was any difference in this relation between gender. The first research hypothesis was: "there is a gender difference to the degree of SOC, attitude to <b>grades,</b> and perceived <b>stress</b> level". The second was that "SOC and attitude to <b>grades,</b> predict <b>stress</b> in adolescents". To answer these hypotheses, a questionnaire survey was carried out among upper secondary students, 95 boys and 89 girls. The result of the analysis showed a significant difference between the gender. Similarly, that the degree of SOC predicts stress in adolescents was detectable. Further analyses revealed that this evidence was only detected among boys, after splitting the gender into two groups. These results partly support earlier research. The conclusion of this study was that there is a gender difference in degree of SOC, attitudes toward grades, and the perceived stress level. Moreover, that SOC and the attitudes to <b>grades,</b> predicts <b>stress</b> is rejected for youth as group, but confirmed for boys.

40|$|High-power voltage sourced converters(VSC’s) are {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent in modern transmission systems. These systems primarily use switching schemes generating kHz range harmonics, which may be magnified {{by one or more}} system resonances. Despite the high frequency harmonics, VSC systems widely use insulated equipment designed for operation at power frequencies; this includes critical substation components such as medium voltage polymeric cables and terminations. The <b>stress</b> <b>grading</b> systems of non-geometric (compact) cable terminations are susceptible to insulation degradation and eventual flashover failure, under high frequency harmonic stresses. As such, the present work studies high frequency voltage effects in cross-linked polyethylene cable terminations, and their relationship to <b>stress</b> <b>grading</b> (SG) design and material properties. Finite element modeling (FEM) has been used to analyze electric field and resistive heating in termination designs, in response to parametric variations in SG material properties. Experimental studies investigate thermal behaviour in a variety of commercial termination designs, using a high voltage, high frequency test setup developed to replicate conditions of high frequency harmonic resonance in a VSC system. The study results show that high frequency voltage application increases the electric field, resistive heating, and surface temperature rise, in non-geometric (compact) termination designs using field-dependant <b>stress</b> <b>grading</b> materials. Geometric (<b>stress</b> cone) designs are insensitive to high frequency harmonics; however, they have disadvantages compared to compact designs, making them a less practical long-term solution for high frequency applications. Among non-geometric designs, the field-dependent electrical conductivity σ (E), the permittivity ε, and the temperature dependencies of σ (E) and ε strongly influence the termination electrical and thermal behaviour under high frequency stress. Since thermal hotspots in cable termination SG areas may lead to material degradation and eventual failure, recommendations are made for an optimal non-geometric <b>stress</b> <b>grading</b> design, for terminations operating in environments where high frequency harmonics may be present...|$|R

These groups were tested on preassessment measures on the Art and Me Scale (AAMS), Group Inventory for Finding Creative Talent (GIFT), and the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, Figural Form A (TTCT). ^ During the experimental phase of the study each group was exposed to one of three different evaluation conditions: evaluation with <b>grades</b> being <b>stressed</b> as important, evaluation with peer comparisons stressed, self-evaluation with subjects being told they were responsible for assessing their results, and a control group. The experimental conditions were delivered via scripts as were the task instructions. ^ The following conclusions were drawn: (1) It was found that the groups were very similar on three preassessment measures. Group equivalency was established on the AAMS and the TTCT. A significant difference was noted on the GIFT, although mean scores were very similar. Sex of subject was not significant in any of the analyses. (2) The group that received the treatment where <b>grades</b> were <b>stressed</b> as being important spent the most time on the drawing task, but was least willing to commit themselves to doing similar tasks at a later date. (3) No significant differences were found in the artistic quality of the drawings among the four groups.

A focus of the stress study is on {{the investigation of the}} acoustic factors which contribute to the perception of stress level. This study examined all possible acoustic/physiological cues to stress based on data from Annotated Chinese Speech Corpus and proposed that times of vibration of vocal folds (TVVF) reflects stress level best. It is traditionally held that pitch and duration are the most important acoustic parameters to stress. But for Chinese which is a tone language and features special strong-weak pattern in prosody, these two parameters might not be the best ones to represent stress degree. This paper proposed that TVVF, reflected as the number of wave pulses of the vocalic part of a syllable, is the ideal parameter to stress level. Since number of pulses is the integral of pitch and duration (Pulse=∫f(pitch) dt), TVVF can embody the effect of stress on both pitch and duration.

Relaxing music {{has proven to be}} an effective tool to reduce patients’ experiences of stress and pain during many health care procedures. Parameters as heart rate and blood pressure can be affected by the music. Release of hormones and signal substances can reduce the patient’s feelings of different kinds of discomfort. Venous blood sampling is performed as a routine at health care centers across Sweden. In primary health care there are no guidelines on how relaxing music can be used to increase the patient’s well-being in this care situation.   Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether relaxing background music has an impact on the health center patient’s <b>grading</b> of <b>stress</b> and pain during venipuncture, and to examine differences in <b>grading</b> of <b>stress</b> and pain during venipuncture dependent on patient characteristics.   Method: A quantitative intervention study with a survey at a health center was performed. Questionnaires were distributed immediately after venous blood sampling to 70 patients. Of these, 35 had been exposed to relaxing background music during the venipuncture, and 35 had not been exposed to any music during the procedure.   Main results: No significant differences were found between the music intervention group and the control group. Significant differences were found in <b>grading</b> of <b>stress</b> and pain between patients dependent on their age group, younger patients ranked their stress and pain higher than older patients. Between male and female patients a significant difference in grading of pain were found, women ranked their pain higher than men. The patients who expressed a fear of needles ranked their stress and pain higher than other patients. No difference in <b>grading</b> of <b>stress</b> or pain could be found between those patients who were considered accustomed, and those who were not considered accustomed to venipuncture.   Conclusion: No significant difference in <b>grading</b> of <b>stress</b> and pain could be found related to the music intervention in this study. Based on previous studies, there is still a possibility that more extensive research on the same topic can produce a different result. The majority of findings related to patient characteristics seems to be aligned with previous research in this field. ...|$|R

Results: Kidney failure was more likely to develop in patients with lower heart rate change, heart rate reserve, percentage of achievement of maximal predicted heart rate, and circulatory power (P =. 002, P =. 01, P =. 02, and P =. 008, respectively), even after adjustment for age, resting pulse pressure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and exercise test result (hazard ratios, 5. 9, 2. 9, 3. 3, and 2. 9, respectively). A resting pulse pressure of 60 mm Hg and higher was accompanied by 7. 4 times (95 % confidence interval, 1. 8 to 30. 9) greater risk of developing kidney failure, independent of age and resting systolic blood pressure (P =. 006). Conclusions: Hemodynamic responses to a standard <b>graded</b> exercise <b>stress</b> test independently predicted the development of kidney failure. Also, arterial stiffness (represented by resting pulse pressure) could be a factor linking ventricular and kidney function. Early diagnosis of kidney disease should include a cardiovascular assessment and vice versa...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We prospectively {{assessed}} {{the role of}} nerve sparing surgery on urinary continence after open radical retropubic prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated a consecutive series of 536 patients who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy with attempted bilateral, unilateral or no nerve sparing, {{as defined by the}} surgeon, without prior radiotherapy at a minimum followup of 1 year with documented assessment of urinary continence status. Because outlet obstruction may influence continence rates, its incidence and management was also evaluated. RESULTS: One year after surgery 505 of 536 patients (94. 2 %) were continent, 27 (5 %) had <b>grade</b> I <b>stress</b> incontinence and 4 (0. 8 %) had <b>grade</b> II <b>stress</b> incontinence. Incontinence was found in 1 of 75 (1. 3 %), 11 of 322 (3. 4 %) and 19 of 139 patients (13. 7 %) with attempted bilateral, attempted unilateral and without attempted nerve sparing, respectively. The proportional differences were highly significant, favoring a nerve sparing technique (p < 0. 0001). On multiple logistic regression analysis attempted nerve sparing was the only statistically significant factor influencing urinary continence after open radical retropubic prostatectomy (OR 4. 77, 95 % CI 2. 18 to 10. 44, p = 0. 0001). Outlet obstruction at the anastomotic site in 33 of the 536 men (6. 2 %) developed at a median of 8 weeks (IQR 4 to 12) and was managed by dilation or an endoscopic procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of incontinence after open radical retropubic prostatectomy is low and continence is highly associated with a nerve sparing technique. Therefore, nerve sparing should be attempted in all patients if the principles of oncological surgery are not compromised...|$|R
40|$|Backgrounds. Heart rate variabi 1 ity {{increases}} with increased vagal effect. Compared to sedentary individuals, athletes {{have an increased}} vagal tone. Their resting heart rate decreases and heart rate variability increases. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether heart rate variability correlates with maximal aerobic capacity in a random population of athletes, and to establish any differences in heart rate variability between male and female athletes. Methods. The study included a sample of 63 athletes ofboth genders from different sporting disciplines. After recording alO-minute ECG at rest inthe supine position, they underwent a continuous <b>graded</b> <b>stress</b> test on a treadmill to determine their maximal aerobic capacity. The heart rate variability components and their relationships were then compared to maximal aerobic capacity. In order to determine the differences in heart rate variability between the high capacity and low capacity groups, and between themale and female groups, t-test for normally distributed and ANOVO test for non-normally distributed variables were used. The Pearson method for normally distributed variables and the Spearman method for non-normally distributed variables were used to determine the correlation coefficients between heart rate variability and maximal aerobic capacity. The P-value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results. No significant differences werefound in heart rate variability between the lower and higher maximal aerobic capacity groups or between the males and females. There was also no correlation between heart rate variability and maximal aerobic capacity in ourgroup of athletes. Conclusions. The connection between maximal aerobic capacity and heart rate variability in highly trained individuals is obviouslynot as direct as in the non-athletic population.

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} receptors (FGFRs) are {{involved}} in proliferative and differentiation physiological responses. Deregulation of FGFR-mediated signaling involving the Ras/PI 3 K/Akt and the Ras/Raf/ERK MAPK pathways is causally involved {{in the development of}} several cancers. The caspase- 3 /p 120 RasGAP module is a stress sensor switch. Under mild stress conditions, RasGAP is cleaved by caspase- 3 at position 455. The resulting N-terminal fragment, called fragment N, stimulates anti-death signaling. When caspase- 3 activity further increases, fragment N is cleaved at position 157. This generates a fragment, called N 2, that no longer protects cells. Here, we investigated in Xenopus oocytes the impact of RasGAP and its fragments on FGF 1 -mediated signaling during G 2 /M cell cycle transition. RasGAP used its N-terminal Src homology 2 domain to bind FGFR once stimulated by FGF 1, and this was necessary for the recruitment of Akt to the FGFR complex. Fragment N, which did not associate with the FGFR complex, favored FGF 1 -induced ERK stimulation, leading to accelerated G 2 /M transition. In contrast, fragment N 2 bound the FGFR, and this inhibited mTORC 2 -dependent Akt Ser- 473 phosphorylation and ERK 2 phosphorylation but not phosphorylation of Akt on Thr- 308. This also blocked cell cycle progression. Inhibition of Akt Ser- 473 phosphorylation and entry into G 2 /M was relieved by PHLPP phosphatase inhibition. Hence, full-length RasGAP favors Akt activity by shielding it from deactivating phosphatases. This shielding was abrogated by fragment N 2. These results highlight the role played by RasGAP in FGFR signaling and how <b>graded</b> <b>stress</b> intensities, by generating different RasGAP fragments, can positively or negatively impact this signaling...|$|R
40|$|From {{a cohort}} of 43 {{hypertensive}} patients (BP> 160 / 95 mmHg) who had undergone coronary angiography for the diagnosis of chest pain, the results of exercise testing (EXT) and dobutamine stress echocardiography (Echo) were compared to assess their relative roles {{for the detection of}} coronary artery disease. These selected patients had no electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or basal ST-T changes. <b>Graded</b> <b>stress</b> dobutamine (5 – 40 μg/kg/min) Echo was carried out until end-points were achieved. Graded treadmill EXT was performed using the Bruce protocol. A coronary artery lesion > 50 % was considered significant. Left ventricular mass index was calculated by Echo and 28 out of the 43 patients had increased left ventricular mass index. Coronary artery disease was present in 29, of whom, 21 had multi-vessel disease, and 14 patients had normal coronary anatomy. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of coronary artery disease by dobutamine Echo were 93 % and 100 %, and for the EXT these were 72 % and 29 %, respectively. Similarly, for detection of multi-vessel disease the values were 82 % and 95 %, for dobutamine Echo and 77 % and 33 % for EXT, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that EXT was a poor predictor of coronary artery disease (p= 0. 09) while dobutamine Echo was significantly better (p< 0. 001). When patients with increased left ventricular mass index were excluded, prediction of coronary anatomy by EXT improved only marginally (p= 0. 4) while dobutamine Echo remained unchanged (p< 0. 001). Stress dobutamine Echo is safe in hypertensive patients and is probably the method of choice for evaluating underlying coronary artery disease...|$|R
