40|$|The {{legal process}} {{involved}} in domestic mergers has been considered. European Union regulations were investigated, {{as well as}} their direct transposition into Polish legislation. The process itself always consists of managerial, ownership and registration phases. Nevertheless, these phases are not homogeneous and may take different courses depending on the provisions prescribed by the regulations. Several methods of measuring the time to complete mergers have been presented. In the empirical part of the article, the definition of the private time to completion has been adopted which assumes that that the procedure starts by <b>drafting</b> the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>merger</b> and ends with the registration <b>of</b> the <b>merger.</b> The influence <b>of</b> different provisions on this measure has been analyzed for the case <b>of</b> Polish domestic <b>mergers.</b> Moreover, statistical reasoning has been conducted for this market showing that several recent legal amendments have shortened the legal procedure involved in consolidation. Finally, some conclusions and suggestions for future research have been presented in the paper. (original abstract...|$|R

Zinātniskā darba ietvaros tiek aplūkota sabiedrību pārrobežu apvienošanas institūta vēsturiskā attīstība, analizēts sabiedrību pārrobežu apvienošanas institūts starptautisko privāto tiesību kontekstā, kā arī noskaidrots atsevišķu tiesību subjektu - kreditoru, dalībnieku un darbinieku interešu aizsardzības pasākumu kopums pārrobežu apvienošanas procesā. Tāpat darbā uzmanība tiek veltīta sabiedrību pārrobežu apvienošanas procesa aplūkošanai, atsevišķi analizējot tādus procesa posmus kā reorganizācijas līguma noslēgšana, reorganizācijas prospekta sagatavošana, lēmuma par reorganizāciju pieņemšana un pārrobežu apvienošanas reģistrācija. On April 26 th, 2008 Latvian Parliament {{adopted the}} {{amendments}} of the Commercial Law, allowing {{limited liability company}} registred in Latvia to merge with another limited liability company established in accordance with regulatory enactments of the European Union Member States. These amendments of Commercial Law were based on directive 2005 / 56 /EC on cross-border mergers adopted by the Council of the European Union on October 26 th, 2005. The goal of this thesis is to explore the transpositon of the directive 2005 / 56 /EC into Commercial Law. In {{the beginning of the}} thesis, the author offers to analyze two events which promoted the cross border <b>merger</b> <b>of</b> limited liability companies - the judgment of the European Union Court of Justice of December 13 th, 2005 (case SEVIC System AG) and the directive 2005 / 56 /EC. The first event allows to study cross border reorganization process in a context of freedom of establishment. The harmonization process of national rules in EU member states is the second event to be viewed. Since the cross border merger process contains cross border element, the determination of the nationality of companies participating in the cross border reorganization is a significant question {{in the context of the}} conflict of laws. Nationality of the companies can be determined by the reference to the statutory seat or real seat theories. Because of the fact that the cross border merger subjects are companies registered in the different European Union member states, the author of this thesis clarifies applicable laws to the merger process. Cross border merger influences creditors’, minority shareholders’ and employees’ interests. As the national legislators are required to ensure appropriate protection of those interests, the thesis analyzes whether Latvian legislator has reached the balance between the interests of the subjects and companies’ rights to implement the cross border merger. Cross border <b>merger</b> process consists <b>of</b> four main steps: Firstly, the management of each of the merging companies shall draw up the common <b>draft</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> cross-border <b>merger</b> known as reorganization agreement. Secondly, the management of the merging companies is required to draft the cross border merger report known as reorganization prospectus explaining all legal and economic aspects <b>of</b> the cross-border <b>merger</b> to shareholders. Thirdly, the shareholders have to approve common <b>draft</b> <b>terms</b> at the meeting of shareholders. The final step is the registration <b>of</b> cross-border <b>merger</b> in commercial register and its entry into effect. The thesis analyses all these steps, discovering problems and offering proposals how to improve the process of reorganization...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the mergers and {{acquisitions}} activity from various perspectives. The concept <b>of</b> <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions always has a strong economic background, which will be considered even if the concept is discussed from a legal perspective.

From legal point of view this paper mainly concentrates on the relevant directives of the European Union. Currently, there are four relevant company law directives related to corporate reconstruction in the law of the European Union: the Merger Directive, which regulates mergers between public companies, the Sixth Company Law Directive, which covers the division of an existing public company into entities, the directive, which concerns cross-border mergers and last but not least the Takeover Directive.
