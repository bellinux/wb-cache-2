500|$|After Aaliyah's death, the German {{newspaper}} Die Zeit published {{excerpts from}} an interview done shortly before her death, {{in which she}} described a recurring dream: [...] "It is dark in my favorite dream. Someone is following me. I don't know why. I'm scared. Then suddenly I lift off. Far away. How do I <b>feel?</b> <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am swimming in the air. Free. Weightless. Nobody can reach me. Nobody can touch me. It's a wonderful feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Alexandra {{became the}} first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. In a {{remarkable}} departure from precedent, for two hours {{she sat in the}} Ladies' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill, a bill to remove the right of the House of Lords to veto legislation, was debated. Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill. Shortly afterward, she left to visit her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe. She told Frederick Ponsonby, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had been turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all." [...] Later that year, she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House, but she retained possession of Sandringham. The new king, Alexandra's son George, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported her son's reluctant agreement to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{stirring}} speech against {{racial discrimination}} {{was given by}} African-American activist Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, in which she said [...] "You white women speak here of rights. I speak of wrongs. I, as a colored woman, have had in this country an education which has made me <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were in the situation of Ishmael, my hand against every man, and every man's hand against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I can't as long {{as father}} acts this way," [...] {{answered}} Mollie, in a choked voice. [...] "I--I want to, Eb, and Mirry and Bob want me to, but I can't. I do hope that the evangelist won't {{come and talk to}} me special to-night. <b>I</b> always <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was being pulled two different ways, when he does." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wants {{something}} {{to take the}} taste of that place out of one's mouth," [...] Tring said to Dick, as, directly they entered, he poured some spirits into the glasses. [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> queer <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had been hocussed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{at first}} perhaps I would. But why--why don't I {{want to marry}} her or anybody? <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{sometimes}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wronged my women, mother." ...|$|R
2500|$|Skaat has said, [...] "My wish {{was always}} to be a singer, and I'm still working on it." [...] Skaat {{is one of many}} {{well-known}} singers, both past and present, of Yemenite Jewish heritage—a long line that includes Bracha Zefira, Shoshana Damari, Haim Moshe, Zohar Argov, Ofra Haza, Gali Atari, Dana International, Achinoam Nini (Noa), and many others. [...] However, unlike the music of some Yemenite Jewish singers, there have been generally few hints of the distinctive singing style often associated with that culture in Skaat's music. Although Skaat has said that he has been influenced by Rivka Zohar and he has named Rami Kleinstein and Sarit Hadad as two of his favorite singers, he stated in a February 2010 interview that, [...] "I don't think I [...] ever been influenced by someone in specific. I have always listened to so many different kinds of music. I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have learned from each singer I listened to and still do. From the vigour of the great female singers, through the song interpretation of French performers to the intricate structures of classical music pieces. I find inspiration in them all!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were dying on the cross.|$|E
