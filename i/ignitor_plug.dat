40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a one-millipound pulsed plasma ignition system study. The preliminary data indicate that inductively coupling the ignition plug cathode to the thruster cathode is more beneficial to <b>ignitor</b> <b>plug</b> longevity than resistive coupling. These benefits arise from {{the ability of the}} coupling conductor to control the build-up of a carbonaceous deposit on the plug face. The deposit build-up is a strong function of the peak coupling current experienced during thruster operation. The relationship between the <b>ignitor</b> <b>plug</b> discharge and thruster discharge is shown to be very complex with equivalent circuit elements which are dynamic in nature. A preliminary representation of this equivalent circuit is developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{operating}} {{characteristics of the}} semiconductor spark gap <b>ignitor</b> <b>plug</b> used to initiate the discharge in a pulsed plasma thruster are investigated. Current and voltage waveform measurements for the <b>ignitor</b> <b>plug</b> alone, and for the plug mounted in the thruster cathode indicate an average dynamic impedance of 0. 2 ohms {{for a wide range}} of operating conditions, and a trigger circuit energy transfer efficiency to the plug on the order of 25 %. Two modes of trigger ignition are found which are related to the rise time of the applied voltage pulse. Analysis of plasma characteristics reveals plug erosion to occur primarily in the semiconductor and anode regions, by mechanisms including plug metal embrittlement, plasma sputtering and vaporization caused by the discharge current pulse. Measurements also indicate a plume velocity on the order of 1580, 000 cm/sec which increases with trigger circuit stored energy. The results establish levels of performance for future applications of semiconductor spark gap ignitor plugs in plasma devices...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of power on pulsed plasma thruster (PPT) discharge current with respect to its peak, duration, and behavior while the power elevates in a low power range. Design/methodology/approach – A rectangular parallel‐plate breech‐fed PPT has been developed with a self‐inductor coupling element connecting the PPT cathode to the <b>ignitor</b> <b>plug</b> cathode. The PPT has been operated in vacuum chamber at 10 − 6 [*]mbar and its discharge current has been recorded using a Rogowski coil while input power has been changed by means of varying the capacitor voltage at given capacitance and frequency. Findings – The analysis leads to elucidate the effects of input power on discharge current of a PPT employing a self‐inductor coupling element. The power varies within a range of less than 10 to more than 50 [*]W. The results show that current peak rises from 5 to 10 [*]kA while discharge duration and behavior seems to be independent of power within the operating range. Additionally, utilization of the coupling element seems to change the typical oscillating behavior of PPT discharge to a more efficient behavior. Research limitations/implications – The analysis is mainly focused on breech‐fed PPTs while employing a coupling element. Originality/value – The paper analyzes the influence of power on discharge current of a PPT employing a self‐inductor coupling element. It clarifies the behavior of current peak, duration and behavior while power varies in a low power range. The effect of coupling element is shown to be promising. The results can be a help in design of μPPTs. Abdolrahim Rezaeih...|$|E

50|$|Some magnetos have {{a second}} coil of wire located next to the first, called a {{secondary}} coil. This coil is usually much longer than the primary loop, accomplished by many more loops around the magnetic core. As the magnetic field is built, it induces a current in the secondary coil as well. When the contact breaker opens the circuit, the magnetic field collapses, causing a high electric voltage in the primary and secondary coils. However, due to the greater number of turns of the secondary coil, the voltage is much higher, causing a larger spark at the <b>ignitor</b> or spark <b>plug,</b> meaning more assured ignition.|$|R
