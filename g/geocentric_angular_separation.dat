40|$|We study spin Hall {{effect in}} a three {{terminal}} Y-shaped device in presence of tunable spin-orbit (SO) interactions via Landauer-Büttiker formalism. We have evolved a fabrication technique for creating different <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> {{between the two}} arms of the Y-shaped device so as to investigate the effect of angular width on the spin Hall conductance (SHC). A smaller <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> yields a larger conductance. Also arbitrary orientation of the spin quantization axes yields interesting three dimensional contour maps for the SHC corresponding to different <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> of the Y-shaped device.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that, {{within the context}} of face recognition, <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> between centred feature vectors is a useful measure of dissimilarity. In this thesis we explore this observation in more detail and compare and contrast <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> with the Euclidean, Manhattan and Mahalonobis distance metrics. This is applied to 2 D, 2. 5 D and 3 D face images and the investigation is done in conjunction with various feature extraction techniques such as local binary patterns (LBP) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We also employ error-correcting output code (ECOC) ensembles of support vector machines (SVMs) to project feature vectors non-linearly into a new and more discriminative feature space. It is shown that, for both face verification and face recognition tasks, <b>angular</b> <b>separation</b> is a more discerning dissimilarity measure than the others. It is also shown that the effect of applying the feature extraction algorithms described above is to considerably sharpen and enhance the ability of all metrics, but in particular <b>angular</b> <b>separation,</b> to distinguish inter-personal from extra-personal face image differences.
