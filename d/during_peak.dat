5|$|Express routes run {{between the}} {{outskirts}} of the city and downtown or between major rail stations and other points in the city. These routes typically run only <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> hours, going inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening, except the 76X Marin Headlands Express, which runs on weekends and holidays; and the 83X Mid-Market Express, which runs in both directions <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> hours.

5|$|In 1997, {{the airport}} {{introduced}} Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE), {{becoming the first}} airport {{in the country to}} do so. With multiple airlines serving McCarran, it became inefficient to have separate facilities for each airline. CUTE allows for shared use of ticket counters and gates; an airline can overflow to inactive facilities <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> times.|$|E

40|$|International audienceStorage {{elasticity}} on IaaS clouds is {{a crucial}} feature {{in the age of}} data-intensive computing. However, the traditional provisioning model of leveraging virtual disks of fixed capacity and performance characteristics has limited ability to match the increasingly dynamic nature of I/O application requirements. This mismatch is particularly problematic in the context of scientific applications that interleave periods of I/O inactivity with I/O intensive bursts. In this context, overprovisioning for best performance <b>during</b> <b>peaks</b> leads to significant extra costs because of unnecessarily tied-up resources, while any other trade-off leads to performance loss. This paper provides a transparent solution that automatically boosts I/O bandwidth <b>during</b> <b>peaks</b> for underlying virtual disks, effectively avoiding overprovisioning without performance loss. Our proposal relies on the idea of leveraging short-lived virtual disks of better performance characteristics (and thus more expensive) to act <b>during</b> <b>peaks</b> as a caching layer for the persistent virtual disks where the application data is stored. We show how this idea can be achieved efficiently at the block-device level, using a caching mechanism that leverages iterative behavior and learns from past experience. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposal both for microbenchmarks and for two real-life applications using large-scale experiments...|$|R
5|$|The station {{opened on}} July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station 20 {{hours a day}} on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> periods, with less {{frequent}} service at other times. Columbia City station is also served by two King County Metro bus routes that connect it to Mount Baker, Renton and West Seattle.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} the busiest {{stop on the}} Westside line by 1999 {{with an average of}} 3,005 daily boardings. In March 2008, TriMet added {{additional}} capacity during the morning and evening commuting period. This was accomplished by extending three Red Line trains from the Beaverton Transit Center stop each morning and evening <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> ridership times.|$|E
5|$|A 7-Day Short Trip Pass for $38.50, {{valid for}} seven {{consecutive}} days for Metrorail trips costing up to $3.85 (the maximum off-peak fare) <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> fare times and any trip during off-peak hours. If the trip {{costs more than}} $3.60 the difference is deducted from the cash balance of a SmarTrip card, possibly after the necessary value is added at the Exitfare machine. A non-negative stored value is required to enter the Metrorail system.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the end of}} 2016, two-car trains started being {{deployed}} on both directions of the West Loop <b>during</b> the weekday <b>peak</b> hours, due to {{the increasing number of}} commuters living in new HDB flats located near Thanggam, Kupang and Farmway LRT Stations. Before this, two-car trains were only deployed towards the direction of Cheng Lim <b>during</b> morning <b>peak</b> hours, and towards the direction of Renjong <b>during</b> evening <b>peak</b> hours.|$|R
50|$|Blood {{levels of}} folate, a {{nutrient}} vital for fetal development, can be degraded by UV radiation, raising concerns about sun exposure for pregnant women. Lifespan and fertility can be adversely affected for individuals born <b>during</b> <b>peaks</b> of the 11-year solar cycle, possibly because of UV-related folate deficiency during gestation.|$|R
50|$|For many testing {{laboratories}} {{the incoming}} workload is inherently volatile with significant peaks and dips.

5|$|A {{light rail}} {{station in the}} Mount Baker area was first {{proposed}} in 1995 and approved the following year. Construction began in late 2005 and the station was opened for regular service on July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> periods, with less frequent service at other times. Mount Baker station is also served by five King County Metro bus routes that connect it to Downtown, Capitol Hill, Rainier Beach, the Central District, and the University District.|$|E
5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also be considered when setting energy prices. The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions consume more electricity during summer while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> and off-peak hours) and the consumption demand (i.e. whether it is low or high) will be taken into consideration.|$|E
5|$|After {{operating}} only <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> {{hours for}} more than 30years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts at Aldwych required replacement {{at a cost of}} £3million. This was not justifiable as only 450 passengers used the station each day and it was losing London Regional Transport £150,000 per year. The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch closed on 30 September.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the above}} MDCL methods (DDC and AMC) {{can be used}} {{simultaneously}} if desired. Some stations choose a mixture of DCC and AMC which uses a complex carrier vs. modulation curve, typically running less carrier for modulation in the 25% to 75% range, and with more carrier <b>during</b> <b>peaks</b> and pauses.|$|R

5|$|As planned, {{counterclockwise}} trains, to {{and from}} Jamaica and Howard Beach, would have run every 2 minutes <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> hours, for a frequency of 30 trains per hour (tph). Each branch would have been served by a train every four minutes, or 15 tph. The final environmental impact statement planned for even higher frequencies of 40 tph, or a train every 90 seconds in the central terminal area. However, , actual frequencies were much lower, with each branch being served by one train every 7 to 12 minutes <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> hours, or 5 to 8.5 tph. During middays, trains come every 10 to 15 minutes, with 4 to 6 tph on each branch. Late night service is less frequent: trains come every 15 to 20 minutes, with 3 to 4 tph on each branch. Weekend service is similar to night service, with trains coming every 16 minutes, or 4 tph on each branch. Trains make the journey between the terminals and either Jamaica or Howard Beach in about eight minutes.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Delhi Metro {{has about}} 220 trains of four, six and eight coaches totalling 1,290 coaches. It is further {{planning}} to add 421 more coaches {{on the existing}} route before the completion of phase 3. During the financial year 2015, DMRC on an average pressed 1,083 coaches in an hour (<b>during</b> <b>peak</b> hour), in 2012–13, the number was 819. On an average trains make 2,880 trips per day.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains <b>during</b> <b>peak</b> times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E
