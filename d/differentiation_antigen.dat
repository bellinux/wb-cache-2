40|$|Since {{the early}} classic work on murine {{lymphocyte}} cell surface <b>differentiation</b> <b>antigens</b> (1), immunological {{analysis of the}} cell surface has been a powerful tool with which to distinguish and separate different classes of functional cell types (2).

40|$|Many {{human and}} mouse tumor antigens are normal, nonmutated tissue <b>differentiation</b> <b>antigens.</b> Consequently, {{immunization}} with these “self” antigens could induce autoimmunity. When {{we tried to}} induce immune responses to five mouse melanocyte <b>differentiation</b> <b>antigens,</b> gp 100, MART- 1, tyrosinase, and tyrosinase-related proteins (TRP) 1 and TRP- 2, we observed striking depigmentation and melanocyte destruction only in the skin of mice inoculated with a vaccinia virus encoding mouse TRP- 1. These mice rejected a lethal challenge of B 16 melanoma, indicating the immune response against TRP- 1 could destroy both normal and malignant melanocytes. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for TRP- 1 could not be detected in depigmented mice, but high titers of IgG anti-TRP- 1 antibodies were present. Experiments with knockout mice revealed an absolute dependence on major histocompatibility complex class II, but not major histocompatibility complex class I, for the induction of both vitiligo and tumor protection. Together, {{these results suggest that}} the deliberate induction of self-reactivity using a recombinant viral vector can lead to tumor destruction, and that in this model, CD 4 + T lymphocytes {{are an integral part of}} this process.

The criterion of adequate immune system response in patients with EBV infectious mononucleosis is high concentration of soluble forms of <b>differentiation</b> <b>antigens</b> (sCD 95, sCD 18, sCD 50, sHLA-I, sCD 54).

50|$|Other {{examples}} include tissue <b>differentiation</b> <b>antigens,</b> mutant protein antigens, oncogenic viral antigens, cancer-testis antigens and vascular or stromal specific <b>antigens.</b> Tissue <b>differentiation</b> <b>antigens</b> {{are those that}} are specific to a certain type of tissue. Mutant protein antigens are likely to be much more specific to cancer cells because normal cells shouldn't contain these proteins. Normal cells will display the normal protein antigen on their MHC molecules, whereas cancer cells will display the mutant version. Some viral proteins are implicated in forming cancer (oncogenesis), and some viral antigens are also cancer antigens. Cancer-testis antigens are antigens expressed primarily in the germ cells of the testes, but also in fetal ovaries and the trophoblast. Some cancer cells aberrantly express these proteins and therefore present these antigens, allowing attack by T-cells specific to these antigens. Example antigens of this type are CTAG1B and MAGEA1.|$|R

50|$|The FLT3 gene {{codes for}} {{the cluster of}} <b>differentiation</b> <b>antigen</b> 135 (i.e. CD135) protein or FLT3 protein. This protein {{is a member of}} the class III family of {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases; PDGFRA, PDGFRB, c-KIT and CSF1R also belong to this receptor class. FLT3 protein binds and is activated by the FLT3 ligand; FLT3 protein activation involves its forming dimers, changing to an open conformation to allow access of the phosphate donor, ATP, to its binding pocket, and autophosphorylation. The activated receptor initiates cell proliferation and survival signals in various precursor blood cells types through RAS p21 protein activator 1, Phospholipase Cβ, STAT5, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases. The FLT3 gene is located on human chromosome 13q12.2. Chromosome translocations between it and ETV6 (chromosome 12p13.2), SPTBN1 (2p16.2), GOLGB1 (3q13.33), or TRIP11 (14q32.12) genes create fusion genes which, it is hypothesized, encode for fusion proteins that have continuously active FLT3 protein-related tyrosine kinase activity and thereby force the uncontrolled proliferation and survival of hematological cells.|$|E
5000|$|Mesothelin is a tumour <b>differentiation</b> <b>antigen</b> that is {{normally}} {{present on the}} mesothelial cells lining the pleura, peritoneum and pericardium. Since mesothelin is overexpressed in several cancers and is immunogenic, the protein could be exploited as tumor marker or as the antigenic target of a therapeutic cancer vaccine. A 2016 review indicates that some immunotherapeutic strategies have shown encouraging results in early-phase clinical trials. Elevations of serum mesothelin specific to ovarian and other cancer patients may be measured using ELISA assays. [...] Assays for blood-bourne mesothelin and MPF for tumor diagnosis, especially applied to asbestos-related mesothelioma have been developed. [...] Elevated serum mesothelin was found in most patients with mesothelioma (71%) and ovarian cancer (67%). [...] Blood MPF and mesothelin levels were correlated, with modest accuracy for malignant pleural mesothelioma and lung cancer (sensitivity 74% and 59%, specificity 90% and 86%, respectively for MPF and mesothelin assays). [...] Circulating mesothelin is reported in nearly all pancreatic cancers, [...] however the levels in healthy persons often exceed 80 ng/mL (using 40 kD molecular weight as the conversion factor) and to widely overlap the values in the pancreatic cancer patients. It was noted that the cutoff levels for normal could differ as much as 10-fold among publications, depending on the assay used (compare Sharon et al. [...] and Iwahori et al. with Hassan et al.) and thus that normal levels must be determined anew when new assays are introduced.|$|E
40|$|A key {{limitation}} to {{the analysis}} of the immune response in man has been the difficulty of defining and characterizing the unique surface components of human lymphocyte subpopulations.

In the mouse, the most extensively studied antigen systems have been those of the various functionally distinct lymphocyte subpopulations (e. g., LyT (3) and LyB (4)). In addition, the expression of a number of endogenous retroviruses or products thereof have been observed in the mouse within lymphoid organs (5, 6), reproductive organs (7), and in the embryo (8), and have been likened to <b>differentiation</b> <b>antigens</b> because of their apparent lineage-specific expression.

Reactivity against Melan A/MART- 1 -derived peptide antigens was readily detectable in both melanoma patients and controls. Reactivity directed against tyrosinase-derived peptide antigens was also detected in both melanoma patients and healthy individuals, but less frequently. A measurable response against gp 100 /Pmel 17 -derived antigens was found in 1 / 10 controls and in 1 / 26 of the melanoma patients.
