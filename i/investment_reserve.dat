40|$|A {{key problem}} with {{renewable}} energy is intermittency. This paper develops {{a method to}} quantify the social costs of large-scale renewable energy generation. The method {{is based on a}} theoretical model of electricity system operations that allows for endogenous choices of generation capacity <b>investment,</b> <b>reserve</b> operations, and demand-side management. We estimate the model using generator characteristics, solar output, electricity demand, and weather forecasts for an electric utility in southeastern Arizona. The estimated welfare loss associated with a 20 % solar photovoltaic mandate is 11 % higher than the average cost difference between solar generation and natural gas generation. Unforecastable intermittency yields welfare loss equal to 3 % of the average cost of solar. Eliminating a mandate provision requiring a minimum percentage of distributed solar generation increases welfare. With a $ 21 /ton social cost of CO 2 this mandate is welfare neutral if solar capacity costs decrease by 65 %. ...|$|E

40|$|After {{reviewing}} the economic reform strategy of Mauritius {{for the past}} 10 years {{in the face of}} several external shocks, we apply a balance sheet analysis (BSA) focusing on currency, maturity, and intersectoral mismatches. In reviewing developments over this decade, we find that the currency and maturity mismatches have fallen across various sectors, and the intersectoral risks to each analyzed sector’s balance sheet appear controllable. The government has implemented reforms in recent years that have contributed to general improvement in the balance sheet of the Mauritian economy and its subsectors. We conclude that from a BSA perspective, the macroeconomic vulnerabilities of Mauritius seem manageable, though vulnerabilities remain, and data gaps mean that more work will be needed to support these findings.

Although {{the external}} current account shifted to a moderate deficit, mainly reflecting the recovery in imports, export performance has been robust, and {{gross international reserves}} are now about three-fourths their pre-crisis level. The authorities’ program appropriately focuses on fiscal consolidation keeping inflation low through prudent monetary policy, promoting sound credit flows in a strengthened financial system, and other growth-oriented reforms. Key to maintaining macrostability will be achieving sufficiently large primary surpluses over the medium term to keep the public debt on a firm downward path.

50|$|In 1996 Gilbert was {{appointed}} Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne. He played the {{key role in}} establishing and subsequently developing Melbourne University Private Limited (MUP), a private university established to work alongside the University of Melbourne, so as to circumvent regulations strictly limiting the money-making educational ventures of Australian universities. This was pursued despite numerous buildings on campus in serious states of disrepair and inadequate funding to allow lecture theatres to be heated.The venture was a financial disaster and was widely criticised by academics, politicians and the media. To rescue MUP, the University Council borrowed $150 million from the National Australia Bank and agreed to provide additional money from its <b>investment</b> <b>reserves.</b> The present University of Melbourne VC, Glyn Davis, announced the closure of MUP on 7 May 2005, citing no need for such a venture now that market ventures are permitted in the public university sector, and their plans to integrate most of MUP back into the public university. Gilbert {{declined to comment on}} the actions of his successor. The building originally intended for MUP, and now a part of the public university, has been named the Alan Gilbert Building.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{potential}} {{developments of the}} world natural gas industry at the horizon of 2030. We use the World Gas Model (WGM), a dynamic, strategic representation of world natural gas production, trade, and consumption between 2005 and 2030. We specify a "base case" which defines the business-as-usual assumptions based on forecasts of the world energy markets. We then analyze {{the sensitivity of the}} world natural gas system with scenarios: i) the emergence of large volumes of unconventional North American natural gas reserves, such as shale gas; ii) on the contrary, tightly constrained reserves of conventional natural gas reserves in the world; and iii) the impact of CO 2 -constraints and the emergence of a competing environmental friendly "backstop technology". Regional scenarios that have a global impact are: iv) the full halt of Russian and Caspian natural gas exports to Western Europe; v) sharply constrained production and export activities in the Arab Gulf; vi) heavily increasing demand for natural gas in China and India; and finally vii) constraints on liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure development on the US Pacific Coast. Our results show considerable changes in production, consumption, traded volumes, and prices between the scenarios. Investments in pipelines, LNG terminals and storage are also affected. However, overall the world natural gas industry is resilient to local disturbances and can compensate local supply disruptions with natural gas from other sources.
