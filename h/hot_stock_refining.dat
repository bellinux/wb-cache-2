40|$|Buy low, sell high ” {{is often}} quoted in finance. While its wisdom {{is hard to}} question, its {{application}} is hardly extensive. To understand why this is so, {{it is helpful to}} put ourselves in the shoes of a typical investor. Let's call him Joe. To Joe, “buy low, sell high ” probably means: “I’m gonna find the next hot thing and get it early when its stock price is low. ” While that's not a totally unreasonable target, such an endeavour is deeply flawed. To start with, for Joe to successfully find the “next hot thing ” he needs extensive and specific business knowledge. Unless he is a genuine visionary (of the Steve Jobs type), chances are quite low that he has deep insights. Those who make a living trying to find the “next hot thing ” are called venture capitalists and they expect to lose money on most projects and have a few pay off in a big way. Joe probably doesn't have the required resources to back a large number of investment prospects {{in the same manner as}} venture capitalists. But suppose that Joe does indeed stumble on the next hot thing. What are the odds that he will find it early enough? It would be tempting to say he has a better probability of winning the lottery. Even worse, by the time Joe buys shares of a <b>hot</b> <b>stock</b> in the open market, he has probably overpaid for them. After all, a <b>hot</b> <b>stock</b> is one that attracts excess attention from the trading public and therefore commands a hefty price premium. Moreover, the competitive advantage that made a <b>hot</b> <b>stock</b> perform in a stellar manner would most likely attract more competition. The economic law of diminishing returns would kick in resulting in a low likelihood of long-term profitability for the underlying business. For instance, Microsoft was one of the most prominent <b>hot</b> <b>stocks</b> of the 1990 ’s. But since then competitors have caught up with the software giant and market participants are no longer feverishly buying its shares. Ditto for the most recent case of Research in Motion...|$|R

Another source was likely the Irish Hobby, a now-extinct breed established prior to the 13th century.

Advocates of passive management believe that better returns are achieved by buying broad based mutual funds, such as index funds, and holding them.

Dedicated portfolios fall {{into the category of}} passive management because once bonds are purchased, they are held to maturity.

40|$|Widely used in {{the early}} 1900 s, conical {{refiners}} have been reworked to eliminate high energy requirement, tendency to cut short fibers Early in the 20 th Century, conical refining evolved away from beaters used for fiber defibrillation (i. e., why some mills still call the refining area "the beater room"). The conical fit {{the requirements of the}} time quite well, because it was very good for shortening the long, non-wood fibers then in use. The conical continued to be applicable for <b>stock</b> <b>refining</b> into the 1960 s because, as wood fibers began to replace non-wood fibers, long fiber softwoods were used, and cutting was still desired. However, the tackle system of the older conical refiners limited their ability to fibrillate without cutting. This became more and more of a drawback as short-fiber hardwoods entered the stock furnish. The shorter hardwood fibers require fibrillation with minimal or no cutting to achieve their best papermaking potential. Refining intensities down to 0. 2 Ws/M are recommended, 1 and this is usually not possible with the older style conicals...|$|R
50|$|From {{high density}} storage or from slusher/pulper the pulp is pumped {{to a low}} density storage chest (tank). From there it is {{typically}} diluted to about 4% consistency before being pumped to an unrefined stock chest. From the unrefined stock chest stock is again pumped, with consistency control, through a refiner. Refining is an operation whereby the pulp slurry passes between a pair of discs, {{one of which is}} stationary and the other rotating at speeds of typically 1,000 or 1,200 RPM for 50 and 60 Hz AC, respectively. The discs have raised bars on their faces and pass each other with narrow clearance. This action unravels the outer layer of the fibres, causing the fibrils of the fibres to partially detach and bloom outward, increasing the surface area to promoting bonding. Refining thus increases tensile strength. For example, tissue paper is relatively unrefined whereas packaging paper is more highly <b>refined.</b> <b>Refined</b> <b>stock</b> from the <b>refiner</b> then goes to a <b>refined</b> <b>stock</b> chest, or blend chest, if used as such.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the financing decisions of U. S. REITs from a capital market perspective, {{with an emphasis}} on their market-timing behavior. The role of market-timing {{has been the focus of}} a few recent studies on the capital structure of corporations. Tracking the financing activities of the REIT sector between 1986 and 2003, this paper shows that the market-timing hypothesis describes REITs financing activities much better than either the capital structure trade-off or the pecking-order hypotheses. The evidence shows that REITs exhibit strong market-timing behavior, in terms of when and what type of capital to issue, to take advantage of variations in their relative costs in the capital market. Specifically, REITs time their equity offerings to coincide with periods of high stock valuation and when the <b>hot</b> <b>stock</b> market is <b>hot.</b> Debt securities, on the other hand, are preferred when the long-term rate is low and the credit spread is narrow. REITs appear to issue both debt and equity securities when investors are more risk-averse. The market-timing hypothesis suggests that firms choose the time and form of external financin...|$|R

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, privatization of the financial sector, which has been the major policy thrust evident in numerous countries, took a backseat with governments taking over banking institutions and providing various forms of support ranging from capital injections to outright nationalization of the global banks adversely affected by the crisis. The current crisis also may encourage governments to keep their stakeholding in the public banks in view of the need to support the vital sectors of the economy and also pursue financial inclusion that emerged as a major policy priority.

40|$|Though {{known to}} {{financial}} academics for many years, momentum is for most investors the "undiscovered style, ” {{a valuable tool}} in building diversified portfolios with aboveaverage returns. Definition. Momentum is the tendency of investments to exhibit persistence in their relative performance. Investments that have performed relatively well, continue to perform relatively well; those that have performed relatively poorly, continue to perform relatively poorly. Momentum is about much more than buying a handful of <b>hot</b> <b>stocks</b> – it is a disciplined, systematic investing style that applies across asset classes. Intuition. Momentum is a phenomenon driven by investor behavior: slow reaction to new information; asymmetric responses to winning and losing investments; and the "bandwagon ” effect. Numerous academic and practitioner studies have confirmed momentum’s existence. Implications. Virtually all investors can expect higher risk-adjusted returns by adding momentum to their portfolios. Growth investors will see that momentum delivers much better performance. Value investors will find momentum {{to be an effective}} complement. Value-growth investors will want to consider momentum as an alternative to their growth allocation.
