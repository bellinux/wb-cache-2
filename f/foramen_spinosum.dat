5|$|The <b>foramen</b> <b>spinosum</b> is a foramen {{through the}} sphenoid bone {{situated}} in the middle cranial fossa. It {{is one of two}} foramina in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The foramen ovale is one of these two cranial foramina, situated directly anterior and medial to the <b>foramen</b> <b>spinosum.</b> The spine of sphenoid falls medial and posterior to the foramen. Lateral to the foramen is the mandibular fossa, and posterior is the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} perfect ring-shaped {{formation of}} the <b>foramen</b> <b>spinosum</b> was observed in the eighth month after birth and the latest seven years after birth in a developmental study of the foramen rotundum, foramen ovale and <b>foramen</b> <b>spinosum.</b> The majority of the foramina in the skull studies were round in shape.
