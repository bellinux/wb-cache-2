At least three pirates were {{wounded in the}} shootout with the commandos, and four captured on board while 11 more on their mothership decided to surrender and seized the weapons and ammunition. The 23 Bunga Laurel crews successfully rescued and no among casualties and losses to Filipinos and Malaysians including PASKALs in the battle. The swift action prevented the MISC from losing the cargo worth an estimated RM30mil, and saved 23 Filipino crew members on board the vessel. The Bunga Mas Lima had just completed the task of escorting the tanker and another MISC liquefied natural <b>gas</b> <b>carrier,</b> MT Seri Balhaf, bound for Fujairah, to a safe zone called Easton 4 in the gulf.

25|$|On 20 January 2011, {{the pirates}} boarded the Bunga Laurel. Seven pirates {{emerged from a}} skiff to hijack it. With only eleven pirates {{remaining}} behind, a group of commando forces were deployed from Bunga Mas Lima in two rigid-hull speedboats. The Fennec attack helicopter was dispatched to provide reconnaissance. All seven of the pirates got into a gunfight with the commandos resulting {{in three of the}} pirates being injured. The engagement was over within minutes. No casualties were reported from the rescue team or the Bunga Laurel's crew members. The swift action prevented MISC from losing the cargo worth an estimated RM30mil and saved the 23 Filipino crew members on board the vessel. The Bunga Mas Lima had just completed the task of escorting the tanker and another MISC liquefied natural <b>gas</b> <b>carrier,</b> MV Seri Balhaf, bound for Fujairah, to a safe zone called Easton 4 in the Gulf. All seven captured pirates admitted that they had used one of the previously captured vessels as their mother ship. However, the status of damage to the mothership and injury of the pirates who were on it is uncertain because the attack was carried out at night. After the Malaysian tanker was able to proceed safely, the crew of the Bunga Mas Lima recovered the remnants of the hijacker's weapons. A few AK-47 assault rifles including one modified AKM rifle and ammunition magazines were retrieved, along with Soviet-made Tokarev TT-33 semi-automatic pistols and other equipment.|$|E
