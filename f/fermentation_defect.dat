40|$|The Std 1 protein modulates the {{expression}} of glucose-regulated genes, but its exact molecular role in this process is unclear. A two-hybrid screen for Std 1 -interacting proteins identified the hydrophilic C-terminal domains of the glucose sensors, Snf 3 and Rgt 2. The homologue of Std 1, Mth 1, behaves differently from Std 1 in this assay by interacting with Snf 3 but not Rgt 2. Genetic interactions between STD 1, MTH 1, SNF 3, and RGT 2 suggest that the glucose signaling is mediated, at least in part, through interactions of the products of these four genes. Mutations in MTH 1 can suppress the raffinose growth defect of a snf 3 mutant {{as well as the}} glucose <b>fermentation</b> <b>defect</b> present in cells lacking both glucose sensors (snf 3 rgt 2). Genetic suppression by mutations in MTH 1 is likely to be due to the increased and unregulated expression of hexose transporter genes. In media lacking glucose or with low levels of glucose, the hexose transporter genes are subject to repression by a mechanism that requires the Std 1 and Mth 1 proteins. An additional mechanism for glucose sensing must exist since a strain lacking all four genes (snf 3 rgt 2 std 1 mth 1) is still able to regulate SUC 2 gene expression in response to changes in glucose concentration. Finally, studies with green fluorescent protein fusions indicate that Std 1 is localized to the cell periphery and the cell nucleus, supporting the idea that it may transduce signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. The STD 1 gene was identified in two very different geneti...|$|E
40|$|Defects in {{commercial}} cheese {{result in a}} downgrading of the final cheese and a consequential economic loss to the cheese producer. Developments of defects in cheese are often not fully understood and therefore not controllable by the producer. This research investigated the underlying factors {{in the development of}} split and secondary <b>fermentation</b> <b>defect</b> and of pinking defects {{in commercial}} Irish cheeses. Split defect in Swiss-type cheese is a common defect associated with eye formation and manifests as slits and cracks visible in the cut cheese loaf (Reinbold, 1972; Daly et al., 2010). No consensus exists as to the definitive causes of the defect and possible factors which may contribute to the defect were reviewed. Models were derived to describe the relationship between moisture, pH, and salt levels and the distance from sample location to the closest external block surface during cheese ripening. Significant gradients within the cheese blocks were observed for all measured parameters in cheeses at 7 day post/after manufacture. No significant pH gradient was found within the blocks on exit from hot-room ripening and at three months post exit from the hot-room. Moisture content reached equilibrium within the blocks between exit from hot-room and 3 months after exit from hot-room while salt and salt-to-moisture levels had not reached equilibrium within the cheese blocks even at three months after exit from hot-room ripening. A characterisation of Swiss-type cheeses produced from a seasonal milk supply was undertaken. Cheeses were sampled on two days per month of the production year, at three different times during the manufacturing day, at internal and external regions of the cheese block and at four ripening time points (7 days post manufacture, post hot-room, 14 days post hot-room and 3 months in a cold room after exit from hot-room). Compositional, biochemical and microbial indices were determined, and the results were analysed as a splitplot with a factorial arrangement of treatments (season, time of day, area) on the main plot and ripening time on the sub-plot. Season (and interactions) had a significant effect on pH and salt-in-moisture levels (SM), mean viable counts of L. helveticus, propionic acid and non-starter lactic acid bacteria, levels of primary and secondary proteolysis and cheese firmness. Levels of proteolysis increased significantly during hot-room ripening but also during cold room storage, signifying continued development of cheese ripening during cold storage (> 8 °C). Rheological parameters (e. g. springiness and cohesiveness) were significantly affected by interactions between ripening and location within cheese blocks. Time of day of manufacture significantly affected mean cheese calcium levels at 7 days post manufacture and mean levels of arginine and mean viable counts of NSLAB. Cheeses produced {{during the middle of the}} production day had the best grading scores and were more consistent compared to cheeses produced early or late during day of manufacture. Cheeses with low levels of S/M and low values of resilience were associated with poor grades at 7 days post manufacture. Chesses which had high elastic index values and low values of springiness in the external areas after exit from hot-room ripening also obtained good commercial grades. Development of a pink colour defect is an intermittent defect in ripened cheese which may or may not contain an added colourant, e. g., annatto. Factors associated with the defect were reviewed. Attempts at extraction and identification of the pink discolouration were unsuccessful. The pink colour partitioned with the water insoluble protein fraction. No significant difference was observed between ripened control and defect cheese for oxygen levels and redox potential or for the results of elemental analysis. A possible relationship between starter activity and defect development was established in cheeses with added coulourant, as lower levels of residual galactose and lactose were observed in defective cheese compared to control cheese free of the defect. Swiss-type cheese without added colourant had significantly higher levels of arginine and significantly lower lactate levels. Flow cell cytometry indicated that levels of bacterial cell viability and metabolic state differed between control and defect cheeses (without added colourant). Pyrosequencing analysis of cheese samples with and without the defect detected the previously unreported bacteria in cheese, Deinococcus thermus (a potential carotenoid producer). Defective Swiss-type cheeses had elevated levels of Deinococcus thermus compared to control cheeses, however the direct cause of pink was not linked to this bacterium alone. Overall, research was undertaken on underlying factors associated with the development of specific defects in commercial cheese, but also characterised the dynamic changes in key microbial and physicochemical parameters during cheese ripening and storage. This will enable the development of processing technologies to enable seasonal manipulation of manufacture protocols to minimise compositional and biochemical variability and to reduce and inhibit the occurrence of specific quality defects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Split and {{secondary}} <b>fermentation</b> <b>defects</b> in Swiss-type cheese varieties are manifested as undesirable slits or cracks {{that may lead}} to downgrading of the cheese. Split defect is associated with an excessive production of gas or an unsuitable cheese body that cannot accommodate gas produced, or a combination of both factors. Secondary fermentation is the apparent production of gas after the desired propionic fermentation of the warm room has taken place. No consensus exists as to the definitive causes of the defects, but possible causes are reviewed under factors that are associated with rheological behaviour (including cheese manufacture, acidification, intact protein content and proteolysis, seasonality of milk supply and ripening or storage temperature and duration) or with overproduction of gas (including milk microflora, propionic acid bacteria (PAB) – in particular strains with high aspartase activity and ability to grow at low temperatures, lactic acid bacteria, interactions between starter bacteria, facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli (FHL) and other sources of gas including butyric acid fermentation). The influence of other parameters such as copper concentration, air incorporation, salt content, rind formation and cheese wrapping materials is also considered. Methods to reduce the prevalence of the split <b>defect</b> {{and secondary}} <b>fermentation</b> include addition of water to improve elastic properties by the removal of unfermented carbohydrate and the use of FHL to control PAB activity to prevent the production of excessive gas...|$|R

40|$|After just simple degassing, dilution, pH {{adjustment}} and direct flow injection, characteristic fingerprint spectra of beer samples {{have been obtained}} by fast (few seconds) electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis in both the negative and positive ion modes. A total of 29 samples belonging to the two main beer types (lagers and ales) and several beer subtypes from USA, Europe and Brazil could be clearly divided into three groups both by simple visual inspection of their ESI(+) -MS and ESI(-) -MS fingerprints {{as well as by}} chemometric treatment of the MS data. Diagnostic ions with contrasting relative abundances in both the positive and negative ion modes allow classification of beers into three major types: P = pale (light) colored (pilsener, pale ale), D = dark colored (bock, stout, porter, mild ale) and M = malt beer. For M beers, samples of a dark and artificially sweetened caramel beer produced in Brazil and known as Malzbiers were used. ESI-MS/MS on these diagnostic beer cations and anions, most of which are characterized as arising from ionization of simple sugars, oligosaccharides, and iso-alpha-acids, yield characteristic tandem mass spectra adding a second and optional MS dimension for improved selectivity for beer characterization by fingerprinting. Direct ESI-MS or ESI-MS/MS analysis can therefore provide fast and reliable fingerprinting characterization of beers, distinguishing between types with different chemical compositions. Other unusual polar components, impurities or additives, as well as <b>fermentation</b> <b>defects</b> or degradation products, could eventually be detected, making the technique promising for beer quality control...|$|R
40|$|Low-temp. {{conditioning}} {{during early}} ripening {{has been shown}} to be effective in controlling late blowing of hard and semi-hard cheeses, avoiding the need for commercially undesirable additives, such as lysozyme. To determine the applicability of the method to Montasio cheese (a Gouda or Emmental type), 2 experiments were carried out, in Oct. 1994 and May 1995, in which 2 batches of 48 experimental Montasio cheeses were conditioned traditionally at 11 °C/ 85 - 90 % RH for 30 or 60 days (Oct. samples) or 15 or 30 days (May samples) at 5 °C/ 85 % RH, and then transferred to traditional ripening stores. 2 batches of 47 cheeses incorporating 2. 5 g/quintal lysozyme served as controls. Analyses covered counts of total bacteria, somatic cells and Clostridium spores, incidence of abnormal fermentation and proteolysis, contents of butyric and propionic acids and sensory scores. Results indicated that conditioning at 5 °C for as little as 15 days controlled abnormal butyric and propionic <b>fermentation,</b> although this <b>defect</b> occurred in the controls. After 30 days at 5 °C, no differences were observed between the experimental and control cheeses, confirming the benefical effect of the technique.

40|$|Butyric acid <b>fermentation,</b> the late-blowing <b>defect</b> in cheese, {{caused by}} the {{outgrowth}} of clostridial spores present in raw milk, can create considerable loss of product, especially {{in the production of}} semihard cheeses like Gouda cheese, but also in grana and Gruyère cheeses. To demonstrate the causative relationship between Clostridium tyrobutyricum and late blowing in cheese, many cheesemaking experiments were performed to provoke this defect by using spores from several strains of the major dairy-related clostridia. A method of PCR amplification of a part of the 16 S rRNA gene in combination with hybridization with species-specific DNA probes was developed to allow the specific detection of clostridial sequences in DNAs extracted from cheeses. The sensitivity was increased by using nested PCR. Late blowing was provoked in experimental cheeses with 28 of the 32 C. tyrobutyricum strains tested, whereas experimental cheeses made with spores from C. beijerinckii, C. butyricum, and C. sporogenes showed no signs of butyric acid fermentation. In all experimental and commercial cheeses with obvious signs of late blowing, DNA from C. tyrobutyricum was detected; in some cheeses, signals for C. beijerinckii were also found. It was concluded that only C. tyrobutyricum strains are able to cause butyric acid fermentation in cheese...|$|R
