5|$|Head of the {{surveillance}} team I Nyoman Gatra later testified in court during trials for the accused that police were initially unaware Sukumaran {{was part of}} the group, because original information obtained from the AFP <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> him by name. Indonesian police assumed Sukumaran was Chan's bodyguard as he was seen to accompany Chan in Bali.|$|E
5|$|In 1525, the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés passed {{within a}} few {{kilometres}} of the ruins of Tikal but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> them in his letters. After Spanish friar Andrés de Avendaño became lost in the Petén forests in early 1696 he described a ruin that {{may well have been}} Tikal.|$|E
5000|$|Bhai Gurdas, who has listed all Guru Nanak's {{prominent}} disciples {{whose names}} were handed down, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> {{the name of}} Bhai Bala Sandhu. (This may be an oversight, for he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Rai Bular either.) ...|$|R
50|$|Note:Stooks Smith {{refers to}} a {{by-election}} in December 1709, won by Patterson but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Abercromby. Leigh Rayment's site <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Patterson, but has James Abercromby as MP from 16 January 1710. Possibly there was an undocumented contested election.|$|R

5|$|In 1708, E. Hatton {{recorded}} the inscription below the clock as Ex hoc Momento pendat Eternitas in his New View of London and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> a figure above it. The date 1715 is {{shown on the}} clock-case in the 1717 volume of Vitruvius Britannicus, so perhaps indicates the clock had been replaced and the inscription changed to Sic transit gloria mundi as shown here.|$|E
5|$|Metallic zinc was {{isolated}} in India by 1300 AD, {{much earlier than}} in the West. Before it {{was isolated}} in Europe, it was imported from India in about 1600 CE. Postlewayt's Universal Dictionary, a contemporary source giving technological information in Europe, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> zinc before 1751 but the element was studied before then.|$|E
5|$|San Martín <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Escalada in {{his first}} battle report, leading initial historians to infer that they stayed within the convent during the battle. However it is {{currently}} considered that they {{took part in the}} battle, as suggested by the royalist battle report and a later report from San Martin which clarifies that only twelve grenadiers stayed in the convent.|$|E
5000|$|Bhai Gurdas, who has listed all Guru Nanak's {{prominent}} disciples (in his 11th Var), <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> {{the name}} of Bhai Bala (this may be an oversight, for he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Rai Bular either). However Bhai Mani Singh's Bhagat Ratanwali, which contains essentially the same list as that by Bhai Gurdas, but with more detail, also <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Bhai Bala. There {{are a number of}} other anomalies, which Dr. Kirpal Singh has explicated in his Punjabi work `Janamsakhi Tradition.' ...|$|R
50|$|Gildas <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> the battle.|$|R
50|$|The other Gospels <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> {{anyone in}} {{parallel}} circumstances {{who could be}} directly linked to the Beloved Disciple. For example, in , Peter runs to the tomb. Matthew, Mark, and Luke <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> {{any one of the}} twelve disciples having witnessed the crucifixion.|$|R
5|$|Significantly, {{the treaty}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> or {{institute}} any social reforms that Madero had vaguely promised on previous occasions. It also left the Porfirian state essentially intact. Additionally, Madero supported the unpopular idea that all land disputes {{were to be}} settled through the courts, staffed by the old judges, a decision that led to outbreaks of sporadic violence, particularly in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Tafforet was {{familiar}} with the fauna of Réunion, where the related hoopoe starling lived. He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the fact that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> {{either of}} these events—or Kohlrautz's part in them—when testifying to American {{investigators}} in May 1945, or in an affidavit he made in August 1954 about his wartime persecutions, and researcher Guy Walters questions their authenticity. Wiesenthal variously reported that Kohlrautz was killed on the Soviet Front in 1944 or in the Battle of Berlin on 19 April 1945.|$|E

500|$|The {{short story}} [...] "Custom Fitting" [...] <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Sector General, but does {{describe}} the Galactic Federation making its first contact with Earth.

5|$|After her retirement, O'Reilly {{continued}} to live in her rooms at the Hay–Adams residence in Washington. She did not involve herself in Mint affairs; though Morgenthau sent her a few letters, they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> business. O'Reilly kept busy by organizing fundraising for Catholic charities. She was not interviewed when the Mint in 1944 investigated how several 1933 double eagles, never officially released, had come onto the market, an omission Burdette finds unusual.|$|E
5|$|As the two grew older, {{the letters}} became fewer and farther between. There {{was also a}} great deal that they kept to themselves. Jefferson said nothing about his {{construction}} of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the most}} {{abundant}} carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves. A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Competition would favor the wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.|$|E
50|$|Ziauddin Barani, another 14th century chronicler, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> {{the second}} {{invasion}} in his Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi. He states that Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan plundered Gujarat, after Karna {{fled to the}} Devagiri. The two generals later returned to Delhi with the wives and daughters of Karna. Barani, however, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Devala Devi's name. Another medieval writer Nizam ud-Din gives a similar account, and mentions the capture of Devala Devi ("Dewal"). But he ignores {{the rest of the}} Ashiqa narrative. Like Isami, he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Kamala Devi at all.|$|R

5|$|In July 2007, the Stuckists held an {{exhibition}} at A Gallery, I Won't Have Sex with You {{as long as}} We're Married, titled after words apparently said to Thomson by his ex-wife, Stella Vine on their wedding night. The show coincided {{with the opening of}} Vine's major show at Modern Art Oxford and was prompted by Thomson's anger that the material promoting her show <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> her time with the Stuckists. Tate chairman Paul Myners visited both shows.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Diefenbaker <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> {{the elder}} Atherton's initial {{approach}} but {{wrote that he}} was in Australia at a parliamentary conference {{at the time of the}} Canoe River crash. An Australian lawyer pointed out the case to Diefenbaker; he thought it interesting but noted that he was not a member of the Law Society of British Columbia. Diefenbaker wrote that he planned to meet Edna in Hawaii on his way back from Australia. Instead she wired him, requesting that he meet her in Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|KSE's lease of the {{warehouse}} was terminated in 1999. KSE subsequently returned the licensed unit, while moving the three unregistered units to an unused car park in Bangkok's Prawet District, which was owned by its parent company. The car park was fenced, but the fence had been breached and nearby residents regularly entered to play football in its empty areas. KSE notified the OAEP of its transfer of the licensed unit, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> the other three, which remained orphan sources.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{of these}} {{children}} were recognised by Belgrano in his will, where {{he said he had}} no children. However, it is thought that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> them in order to protect their mothers, as both children were the result of relations that the moral standards of the society of the day would not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2006, a {{large white}} plume of {{condensing}} steam was observed, leading some media people to assume {{there had been a}} small eruption. However, the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the USGS <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> any significant ash plume. The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004, but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion of lava forming a dome in the crater.|$|E
5|$|Through {{much of the}} show's run, it was {{not stated}} in which Australian city Erinsborough was located. The rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne meant that scripts <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> that Erinsborough was a suburb of the latter city, until 1994. Since the 2000s, it has been {{explicitly}} stated that Erinsborough is a suburb of Melbourne. Since 2016, the show has begun filming more scenes {{in and around the}} city.|$|E
