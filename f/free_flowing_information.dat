40|$|Journalists tend to {{get angry}} when they {{discover}} {{that there is an}} industry dedicated to minimising their capacity to get <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>information</b> from the people they interview. They are surprised and dismayed by the extent of media training and by the tactics trainees are taught in order to 'retain control' during interviews. This paper asserts that journalists shouldn’t just get angry. They should get even. It argues that journalism educators have an important role in preparing reporters to deal with media-trained talent. It discusses the prevalence of media training - who is providing it and who is receiving it - and exposes some of the more dubious tricks of the trade. Also, it begins the discussion about the ways journalists can respond...|$|E
40|$|Advances {{are being}} made {{everyday}} that allow individuals in private and public venues to access information easier and faster. With such <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>information,</b> people need to develop information literacy so they know {{the best place to}} find information, how to evaluate it, and select the most appropriate way to use and present it. With developed information literacy, we can do our jobs faster and more efficiently. One public institution however has chosen to ignore the need for informational skills and information literacy: our public schools. Governmental studies show that schools are lagging behind on information literacy or are not even trying to incorporate informational skills into their curriculum. To help teachers incorporate informational skills into their curriculum I have designed an original information skills model and a sample unit geared to the Indiana State Standards for fifth grade. By combining informational skills and inquiry learning, students will be armed with the critical thinking skills to find and use the information they need to get ahead in today's society, as well as an internal motivation to continuously be learning.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{consider}} the present state of Japan's information society. Currently, computer networks bring us the information of industry, as well as the industrialization of information. Furthermore, the processing of Information and the way we live our lives {{are becoming more and more}} intertwined. Professor Miyazawa of Hitotsubashi University, rather than relying upon Professor Fuch's definition of the service economy, refers to this tendency in Japanese society as the service information society. Thus, while Professor Miyazawa shows the effects of information networks upon industrial structures and market mechanisms, he equally emphasizes the need to deal with other problems in the near future; for example, in the areas of welfare for the elderly, the education system, and health care. Professor Imai of Stanford University defines this phenomenon as the information network society and forecasts that the utilization of <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>information</b> networks will be vital to any effort at solving the above-mentioned problems with which we are confronted. However, work in the area of regional information processing has not advancing very much since 1985. This paper analyzes society from the point of view of the concept of service and information. We reach the conclusion that, under the : current financial crisis, any successful effort to establish regional communication networks and to deal with contemporary societal problems will depend increasingly upon self-organized and self-actuated regional information networks...|$|E

40|$|In theory, {{the concept}} of freedom of access to {{information}} is ideal, particularly since democracy warrants the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> of <b>information.</b> However, in practice this seldom occurs, especially among various classes and groups, and across several geographical boundaries.
