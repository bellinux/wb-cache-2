25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|In a {{statement}} to The New York Times on August 21, 2015, Dre again addressed his abusive past, stating, [...] "Twenty-five years ago I {{was a young man}} drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I've been married for 19 years and every day I'm working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I'm doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again." [...] He went on to apologize to all the women he abused, saying, [...] "I apologize to the women I've hurt.

2500|$|At the bail hearing, the {{prosecution}} argued for denial of bail {{on the basis}} that Singh’s history of arrests made it likely that he would re-offend. In his defense, Singh stated that, [...] "I was targeted not <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> but for my reputation," [...] and further pointed out that he had won five of the six cases previously brought against him.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2008 interview, Bakshi {{referred}} to Crumb as a [...] "hustler" [...] and stated, [...] "He goes {{in so many}} directions that he's hard to pin down. I spoke {{to him on the}} phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that château of his in France.... I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, {{if you want to do}} the same thing over and over. He should have been my best friend <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with Fritz the Cat. I drew a good picture, and we both made out fine." [...] Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.|$|E
