40|$|Foreign Policy Contemporary {{foreign policy}} is {{increasingly}} perceived to be about values rather than interests as traditionally conceived. Once marginal, ethics are today held to {{play a central role}} in foreign policy. This new book goes beyond current debates which locate the limitations to <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in the strategic and economic interests of nation-states. Rather than counter-posing interests and ethics, trying to find ‘hidden agendas’, or emphasizing the double standards at play in <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> this text brings together leading international theorists in order to develop a critical under-standing of the rise of <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> and to analyse the limits of ethical policy-making on its own terms. The book comprises three clear sections that explore: theoretical issues, techniques and tactics of ethical intervention, and the geography/space of ethical interven-tion. The authors deal with the limits of ‘ethical foreign policy ’ both in the light of the internal dynamic of these policies themselves and with regard to the often unintended consequences of policies designed to better the world. Presenting a range of theoretical approaches to the study of <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in the US, UK and Europe, this topical book will be of strong interest to students and researchers of International Relations, Politics, Law and Philosophy.

It combines a conservative point of view on <b>ethical</b> and <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> issues, with more centre-left ideas on economic, asylum, social and environmental issues. Its conservative reformed ideals are reflected in its program of principles: It believes that the state is the swordmaiden of God. It bases its politics directly on the Bible. However, it sees separate duties for the state and the church in public life: the church should spread the Word of God, while the state should merely uphold public morality. The state should respect the religion of its citizens. Other Christian principles, like neighbourly love and stewardship for the Earth, however have given the CU's political program a centre-left orientation.|$|R

40|$|Combining a {{sophisticated}} theoretical analysis with detailed empirical case-studies, this book provides an original {{view of the}} challenges and threats to a stable peace order in Europe. The end of Cold War bipolarity has transformed Europe. Using structural realist theory, Adrian Hyde-Price analyzes the new security agenda confronting Europe in the twenty-first century. Europe, he argues, is not 'primed for peace' as mainstream thinking suggests, rather, it faces new security threats {{and the challenge of}} multipolarity. This critical and original volume looks at European security after the Iraq War, the failure of the EU constitution and the change of government in Germany. Reflecting on the inherently competitive and tragic nature of international politics, it concludes that realism provides the only firm foundations for an <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> and security <b>policy.</b> European Security in the Twenty-First Century will appeal to students and scholars of international relations, European politics and security studies...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is situated within {{the introduction of}} a strong ethical dimension into foreign policy-making in the study of international relations in the post-Cold War era. While the 1990 s gave rise to a wealth of literature on the notion of <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> it has tended to simply focus on a version of realism, which overlooks the role of ethics in international affairs, lacking an empirical analysis of foreign policy decision-making, with relation to ethical values in the post-Cold War period. The purpose of this thesis is to address this gap in the literature by exploring ethical realism as a theoretical framework and, in particular, by looking at US humanitarian interventions in the 1990 s at an empirical level to analyse an <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in practice. This study analyses the concepts of ethical realism and responsible power. The application of ethical realism to the conduct of international affairs involves the assertion that powerful states should have responsibilities and exercise leadership with ethical obligations. This research looks at the foreign policy of the United States and its experiences of dealing with humanitarian interventions during the Clinton administration, focusing on Bosnia and Kosovo, to see whether the United States could thus effectively promote liberal values and make a commitment to moral goals, rather than simply follow considerations of national security against the background {{of the end of the}} Cold War. This thesis argues that the United States, as the only world’s superpower, should not only pursue national interests but also shoulder the responsibility of power. However, as the world still divides itself into separate sovereign states, statespeople are primarily responsible and accountable for their own citizens and national survival. Therefore, a foreign policy with an ethical dimension needs to be conducted in a pragmatic way. ...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Taylor & Francis via the DOI in this record. In this article I argue that the contemporary normative analysis of EU foreign policy is predominantly Kantian. This, I argue, is highly problematic, because {{at the heart of}} Kantian and neo-Kanitan accounts of ethics is a moral universalism that ought not to animate EU foreign policy unless that foreign policy desires to be neo-colonial. I set out why this is the case by developing an account of ethics derived from the writings of Alasdair MacIntyre. MacIntyre’s account of ethics is both critical of Kantian universalism and provides a constructive alternative for evaluating moral behaviour and I use both sets of insights to evaluate neo-Kantianism in EU studies and liberal universalism as a suitable foundation for an <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> of the EU...|$|E
40|$|To {{what extent}} can ethics {{and foreign policy}} be {{conceived}} as possible? Instead of answering within the implied dichotomy of possibility and impossibility, this thesis argues for a reconceptualisation of the dichotomy. Ethics and foreign policy are better understood {{on the basis of}} undecidability: neither simply possible nor impossible, but both at the same time. A deconstructive reading of British (1997 - 2006) and EU (1999 - 2004) foreign policy, both of which make claims to ethics, reveals how the issue is beset by internal contradictions, paradoxes and aporias. The deconstruction is structured around the concepts of subjectivity, responsibility and hospitality, each of which constitutes an important point of undecidability within British and EU representations of their ethical dimension. The subject of ethics and foreign policy is always haunted and inhabited by its object, responsibility is necessarily irresponsible, and hospitality contains an irrepressible hostility. Thus, ethics and foreign policy is best conceived as undecidably im-possible. However, such undecidability cannot be used to justify abandoning the goal of an <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> Rather, a Derridean 'negotiation' is proposed. Negotiation seeks to remain loyal to the dual injunction of deconstruction, an undecidability which is the condition of ethics and politics, and a decision which decides, and closes to certain figures of otherness. It requires a permanent questioning, testing and invention of the promise of ethics and foreign policy. This produces a range of illustrative suggestions for the possible enactment of an ethico-political foreign policy, which would refer to and strive for an ultimately unrealisable <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> This research contributes a fundamental critique and questioning of the possibility of ethics and foreign policy. It provides a revealing exploration of British and EU foreign policy from the period, based around responsibility and hospitality. Finally, the thesis introduces the Derridean notion of negotiation to the discipline, seen as a way of moving through the potential paralysis brought by the undecidability arising from foundational questioning.

Conceptualizing the state as an actor whose decision-makers are making an effort to pursue foreign policy in the interests of distant others, we are able to study the possibilities and pitfalls of ethical foreign policymaking on its own terms. Building on a theoretical framework coupling constructivism and foreign policy analysis (FPA) I generate a typology of two divergent normative directions in Swedish foreign policy tradition; active internationalism and Europeanized liberal internationalism.

An unethical foreign policy, however, may pursue objectives that enhance {{the nation as a}} power, seeking dominance for its own sake, for the honor, glory and wealth of the state or a minority within the state, or spreading its ideology out of missionary fervor. The mainstream wisdom in the United States is that the US foreign policy agendas are virtuous and ethical, since they are oriented mainly towards the protection and enhancement of the American ‘National Interest’. Nevertheless, the orthodox perception among many foreign observers is that the American foreign policy is by no means ethical, since it is oriented exclusively towards the promotion of the Americans’ interests {{at the expense of the}} rest of the world.

40|$|At {{the heart}} of the notion of an <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> is the {{assumption}} that foreign policy can help deliver liberty and security around the globe. Yet, as Conor Gearty has argued, in our contemporary ‘neo-democratic’ world, liberty and security are not the universal goods they are often considered to be. Rather they are selectively granted, and curtailed for those considered a threat to the status quo. Where liberty and security are curtailed, this is often {{in the name of the}} universal freedoms that neo-democracies claim to uphold. When the Blair government was elected in 1997, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook announced that British foreign policy must have an ethical dimension. There has been much debate on whether UK foreign policy under the Blair government can be argued to have been ‘ethical’. The focus of debate has tended to be the UK’s military interventions. Far less attention has been paid to the direct role played by UK authorities, through its intelligence services, in human rights violations under the New Labour and subsequent Coalition governments. This paper seeks to further the debate on the ethics of UK foreign policy since 1997. It does so by offering a detailed account of the UK’s involvement in the CIA’s rendition programme, and shows that the UK was far more involved in rendition and secret detention between 2001 and 2010 than was previously assumed. Threaded through the analysis is an account of the various measures taken by the New Labour subsequent Coalition governments to suppress the evidence of UK involvement. We conclude by offering some reflections on the role human rights organisations, litigators, and investigative journalists are increasingly playing in defending the universalism of rights, for publics that rarely appreciate what is really at stake...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} liberal internationalism at a critical point in its development, as manifested by the single-issue extra-parliamentary groups: the South Africa Conciliation Committee, the LeagueofLiberalsAgainstAggression and Militarism, the Balkan Committee, the British Armenia Committee, the League of Nations Society and the League of Nations Union. They operated in a period ofheightened international tension, beginning as it did with the capitalist inspired war in Southern Africa and culminating with the hopes for a new international order to supersede the 'international anarchy' of the pre- 1914 years. They advocated an <b>ethical</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> where the individual could play {{an important part in}} its advancement. Consequently, the 'scratch crowd' or 'stage army of the good' attracted to such groups serve as an important indicator of public attitudes to British foreign policy and international relations. Enthused with a belief in a world united in peace and co-operation they were primarily a combination of radical parliamentarians, journalists, academics and lawyers such as Lord Bryce, Noel Buxton, Aneurin Williams, 1. A. Hobson, H. N. Brailsford, and Arnold Toynbee. In studying these groups collectively, the development of liberal internationalism from a post-Gladstonian moralist attitude derived from an evangelical religious sentiment, to an institutionalism of an entirely secular character becomes apparent, as does the centrality of the Eastern Question to their understanding of the international system and the policies they advocated for the rights of oppressed peoples to self-determination and the league of Nations. The effective use of insider/outsider strategies enabled the liberal internationalists to manage the interaction ofBritish public opinion, international affairs and foreign policy at a significant juncture in the development of domestic and international politics.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{to what extent}} Indonesia’s transition to democracy has impacted Jakarta’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> particularly regarding the foreign policy-making process, its fundamental doctrine, and <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> strategies in three specific areas: regional cooperation in ASEAN, promotion of political values, and conflict management. The puzzle this thesis addresses is that Indonesia’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in many ways does not conform to expectations generated by theoretical works on democratization and <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> The dissertation argues that Indonesia’s democratisation has affected Jakarta’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> only in a mixed and limited fashion. While Indonesia’s democratisation has shaped ideas that have influenced Indonesia’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> some traditional <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> pillars continue to be relevant. First, notwithstanding Indonesia’s democratic transition, Jakarta remains committed {{to the principle of}} an independent and active (bebas-aktif) <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> As such, maintaining a balanced presence of big powers remains a key explanation for Indonesia’s policies on East Asia cooperation. Second, while democratisation has led to the proliferation of <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> actors, <b>foreign</b> policy-making remains largely unaltered, with the president and the foreign minister serving as the central decision-makers. However, democratisation has changed the substance or style of Indonesian <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> and such a change is discernible in efforts to shape political cooperation in ASEAN, Jakarta’s management of conflict on Ambalat dispute with Malaysia, and its Myanmar policy. Additionally, democracy and human rights now prominently feature in Indonesia’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> strategy towards the wider Asia. Significantly, however, while democracy promotion has been driven by the desire of Indonesia’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> leaders to reflect its newfound identity, human rights promotion has been lacking in Indonesia’s promotion of political values abroad due to domestic considerations. Hence, frameworks focusing on the role of identity and ideas in <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> flowing from democratization offer an important, yet insufficient explanation of Indonesia’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in the cases discussed.
