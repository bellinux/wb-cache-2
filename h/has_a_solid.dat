5|$|The Roksan Xerxes {{transcription}} turntable (often shortened to Xerxes) is {{a record}} player named after the Persian king Xerxes I and produced by London-based Roksan Audio. Designed by Roksan co-founder, Touraj Moghaddam, the Xerxes is a belt-driven turntable that <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> plinth. Launched in 1985, the sound quality of the product positioned it as a strong competitor against the established industry leader, the Linn Sondek LP12. Many reviewers use the Xerxes as a reference turntable.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored fusible plug {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy softens. This version <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E
5|$|Water is a {{chemical}} substance that {{is composed of}} hydrogen and oxygen and is vital for all known forms of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% {{in the air as}} vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.|$|E

25|$|The general {{consensus}} among Phoenix fans {{was for a}} kit featuring yellow and black vertical stripes, however this format did not comply with the A-League template required by Reebok at the time Phoenix was admitted into the League.

When Reebok lifted constraints on kit designs in 2009, Phoenix adopted yellow and black vertical stripes. The Phoenix currently have a four-year contract with adidas, and the 2011–12 kit retains the stripes on the front, but <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> yellow back.

25|$|M. a. athi of the Kenyan {{highlands}} {{is typically}} coloured, but like other tropical races, lacks the rufous nape. Most accepted races are distinguished {{based on the}} colour of the back or underpart plumage, or the amount of streaking on the ear coverts and flanks. High altitude races M. a. nyikae and M. a. nigrescens, which occur above 2,000 meters, have very dark upper part plumages and increased flank streaking. M. a. tropicalis which is found above 1,000 meters <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> rufous wash over the underparts. Of the southern African races, those in the southeast are the largest and darkest (cf. M. a. africana and M. a. rostrata), with a cline towards lightly streaked and pale pinkish plumages in the northwest.|$|E

500|$|Resembling a brain, the irregularly shaped cap may {{be up to}} [...] {{high and}} [...] wide. Initially smooth, it becomes {{progressively}} more wrinkled as it grows and ages.

500|$|With its reddish-brown wooly cap, white gills, {{and hollow}} stipe, Tricholoma vaccinum {{is a fairly}} {{distinct}} mushroom and {{is unlikely to be}} confused with other Tricholoma.

Another lookalike, T.inodermeum, has a less woolly cap texture and flesh that turns bright pinkish red when injured. It associates solely with pine species and prefers calcareous soil. [...] Other brownish Tricholoma species include T.fracticum, T.dryophilum, and T.muricatum. The scaly and fibrous cap surface of T.vaccinum might be confused with Inocybe, but species in this genus can be distinguished by their brown spore prints.|$|E
