60|$|But he, {{with the}} flagon full in his hands, and withal a thirsty look upon his <b>face,</b> <b>shook</b> his head.|$|R
60|$|But Virginia was {{standing}} {{with her back to}} the wall, and Higgins, after one look into her <b>face,</b> <b>shook</b> his head.|$|R
6000|$|A short, squat Indian, good-humored of <b>face,</b> <b>shook</b> {{his black}} head till the silver rings danced in his ears, and replied: [...] "Bad--damn coyotee!" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{no longer}} master of myself, I {{sat down at}} the table and hid my <b>face,</b> <b>shaken</b> by great sobs, to think that this was my return for his kindness.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the earl}} understood, and the shadow on his <b>face</b> <b>shook</b> and lifted, and his teeth gleamed. His triumph might be short-lived, {{but he would}} enjoy it while he could.|$|R
60|$|Charles, though {{filled with}} rising fury, was sober {{enough to know}} in what danger he stood, and forcing a smile to his <b>face,</b> <b>shook</b> hands {{and went out to}} his carriage--alone.|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed at}} first hardly to {{understand}} him, but still regarding {{him with that}} wan <b>face,</b> <b>shook</b> her head slowly and sadly. One might have {{thought that she was}} twenty years older than when Dr Thorne last saw her.|$|R
6000|$|Out of the {{heaviness}} of {{that long}} sleep Nod opened his eyes, to find Thumb's great body stooping over him with anxious <b>face,</b> <b>shaking</b> and pommelling him, and muttering harshly: [...] "Wake, wake, Nugget of clay! Wake, Mulla-slugga! The Valleys! The Valleys, little Ummanodda! Taste, taste! Ummuz, ummuz, UMMUZ!" ...|$|R
60|$|With this {{assurance}} {{they were}} obliged to be content, and an eager and joyful party assembled next morning to begin the journey so long looked forward to. The landlord of the hotel, {{a man with a}} careworn <b>face,</b> <b>shook</b> his head dismally and predicted their return to Albuquerque within twenty-four hours.|$|R
60|$|Presently, however, {{he became}} aware of some kind of commotion among these villagers. He heard whisperings, low, hoarse voices, then the shuffle of rapid feet moving away. All at once a violent hand jerked his gun from its holster. When Duane rose a gaunt man, livid of <b>face,</b> <b>shaking</b> like a leaf, confronted him with his own gun.|$|R
60|$|Dan heard Mrs. Bhaer sigh, and {{he wanted}} to ask for one more trial himself, but his pride would not let him, and he came out with the hard look on his <b>face,</b> <b>shook</b> hands without a word, and drove away with Mr. Bhaer, leaving Nat and Mrs. Jo to look after him with tears in their eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mr Burton and Bluenose {{were already}} {{seated at the}} table. Bax stood near the {{fireplace}} bending down to Mrs Foster, who was looking up in his <b>face,</b> <b>shaking</b> his hand, and thanking him, with tears in her eyes, for having saved her son's life! Bax was much perplexed by {{this view of the}} matter, taken and obstinately held to by the widow.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned to}} Ida, who {{put her hand}} before her <b>face</b> and <b>shook</b> her head.|$|R
60|$|Mr Meagles again {{stroked his}} <b>face</b> and <b>shook</b> his head, {{with an air}} of {{profound}} regret.|$|R
60|$|There wasn't {{the least}} sign of devilry, or out-facingness, or {{insolence}} in that lean shadowy steady head; {{and yet he}} himself was compelled to sidle his glance away, so much the <b>face</b> <b>shook</b> him. He closed his eyes, too, as a cat does after exchanging too direct a scrutiny with human eyes. He put out towards, and withdrew, a groping hand from Mrs Lawford.|$|R
60|$|She made no reply, {{except to}} cover her <b>face</b> with <b>shaking</b> hands. They could not hide the betraying scarlet.|$|R
60|$|To {{his great}} concern Mrs. Blossom put her {{handkerchief}} over her <b>face,</b> and, <b>shaking</b> with suppressed laughter, {{rose from the}} table and left the cabin.|$|R
6000|$|Amaze {{and relief}} {{transformed}} the young man. [...] "Aw, now, I'm--glad--" [...] he exclaimed, {{and he sat}} down, half covering his <b>face</b> with <b>shaking</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|His madness foiled his reason, and {{a puzzled}} look spread over his <b>face</b> as, <b>shaking</b> {{his head with a}} {{decision}} which I had but seldom seen in him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad {{to welcome}} you back, boys!" [...] exclaimed Captain Victor Putnam, a {{pleasant}} smile on his <b>face.</b> He <b>shook</b> hands all around. [...] "Did {{you have a nice}} trip?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly, with livid <b>face</b> and <b>shaking</b> hand, Cole pointed westward. [...] "There! Dene and his band! See, {{under the}} red wall; see the dust, not ten miles away. See them?" ...|$|R
60|$|As he turned, his arm {{was seized}} {{suddenly}} and firmly. He looked round, {{and saw a}} coarse, handsome, showily-dressed girl, looking intently into his <b>face.</b> He <b>shook</b> her angrily off.|$|R
6000|$|My hope {{had been}} that she herself {{would be able to}} supply these little particulars. With a blank <b>face,</b> I <b>shook</b> my head: [...] "We just talked of things in general." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{two minutes}} we were <b>faced,</b> had <b>shaken</b> hands, and had {{finished}} with {{such topics as}} rain, prosperity, health, residence, and destination. Politics might have followed next; but I was not so ill-fated.|$|R
60|$|The men, {{seeing that}} what {{appeared}} to be certain destruction stared them in the <b>face,</b> now <b>shook</b> hands all round; and then, commending their souls to God, sat down and waited for the shock.|$|R
60|$|Neuman was livid of <b>face</b> now and <b>shaking</b> {{all over}} his huge frame.|$|R
60|$|And, {{when the}} fairy looked him {{full in the}} <b>face,</b> he <b>shook</b> from head to foot: however she gave him his share like the rest, and he thought within himself {{that she could not}} have found him out.|$|R
60|$|A {{momentary}} {{ray of hope}} flashed {{across the}} man's <b>face.</b> Then he <b>shook</b> his head.|$|R
6000|$|She {{made him}} sit up, and then Oak began wiping his <b>face</b> and <b>shaking</b> himself like a Samson. [...] "How can I thank 'ee?" [...] {{he said at}} last, gratefully, some of the natural rusty red having {{returned}} to his face.|$|R
60|$|She {{washed his}} <b>face,</b> <b>shook</b> up his conch, {{and talked with}} him. It was {{interesting}} to talk with him--until he learned her name. Oh, yes, Blank was her name, she replied innocently, and Sir George Blank was her brother. Sir George Blank, eh? thundered old Dan Cullen on his death- bed; Sir George Blank, solicitor to the docks at Cardiff, who, {{more than any other}} man, had broken up the Dockers' Union of Cardiff, and was knighted? And she was his sister? Thereupon Dan Cullen sat up on his crazy couch and pronounced anathema upon her and all her breed; and she fled, to return no more, strongly impressed with the ungratefulness of the poor.|$|R
60|$|Twice {{we walked}} up and down and all over the wharf. He flashed his lantern into all the dark corners, into empty barrels and boxes, and then he turned and flashed it right into my <b>face</b> and <b>shook</b> his 'ead at me.|$|R

60|$|Vane, {{who liked}} the man's <b>face</b> and manner, <b>shook</b> hands with him, {{and then looked}} back at Kitty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dreams, dreams, dreams, my simple Colonel," [...] said Bletson, though, {{his pale}} <b>face</b> and <b>shaking</b> limbs belied the assumed courage {{with which he}} spoke. [...] "Old Chaucer, sir, hath told us the real moral on't--He was an old frequenter of the forest of Woodstock, here"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were coming}} to see me, were you, sir?" [...] Bows said, and {{came in with a}} sad <b>face,</b> and <b>shook</b> hands with Arthur. [...] "Plague on that old man!" [...] {{somebody}} thought in the room: and so, perhaps, some one else besides her.|$|R
60|$|His fat {{face was}} wreathed and creased with merriment. But the others, how sick, how heart-sick, were they all! The women cried. The men turned away in that silence which is beyond tears. Monsieur Fardet fell upon his <b>face,</b> and <b>shook</b> with dry sobbings.|$|R
