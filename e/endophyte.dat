5|$|In agriculture, fungi may {{be useful}} if they {{actively}} compete for nutrients and space with pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria or other fungi via the competitive exclusion principle, or if they are parasites of these pathogens. For example, certain species {{may be used to}} eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, mites, weeds, nematodes, and other fungi that cause diseases of important crop plants. This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these fungi in the biological control of these agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic fungi can be used as biopesticides, as they actively kill insects. Examples that have been used as biological insecticides are Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium spp, Hirsutella spp, Paecilomyces (Isaria) spp, and Lecanicillium lecanii. Endophytic fungi of grasses of the genus Neotyphodium, such as N. coenophialum, produce alkaloids that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores. These alkaloids protect grass plants from herbivory, but several <b>endophyte</b> alkaloids can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep. Infecting cultivars of pasture or forage grasses with Neotyphodium endophytes is one approach being used in grass breeding programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only alkaloids that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.|$|E
25|$|A {{member of}} the loline {{alkaloids}} was first isolated from the grass Lolium temulentum and its elemental composition determined in 1892. It was initially named temuline and later renamed norloline. (Reviewed by Schardl et al. (2007).) Studies in the 1950s and 1960s by Russian researchers established the name loline and identified the characteristic 2,7 ether bridge in its molecular structure. Since then the analytical methods for purification {{and analysis of the}} lolines have been refined and several different loline species have been identified in many Lolium and related grasses infected by the Epichloë/Neotyphodium (epichloae) endophytes. Lolines are absent in grass plants that do not harbor the epichloae endophytes, and not all epichloae produce the lolines. Because of the very intimate association of plant and <b>endophyte</b> and difficulties to reproduce the symbiotic conditions in vitro, it was long unknown if the fungus was the producer of the lolines, or if they were synthesized by the plant in response to <b>endophyte</b> infection. In 2001, it was demonstrated that the <b>endophyte</b> Neotyphodium uncinatum produces lolines in some chemically defined growth media, which suggests that the <b>endophyte</b> is also the producer of the lolines in the grass plant. The lolines have also been reported from some plants in several plant families, suggesting a more widespread occurrence of these compounds in nature.|$|E
25|$|Loline bioactivities {{show some}} {{unexpected}} variability with variation in their concentration in grass tissues. For example, the tall fescue <b>endophyte,</b> N. coenophialum, {{has been associated}} with enhanced resistance to the migratory root-endoparasitic nematode, Pratylenchus scribneri. Interestingly, at low concentrations, N-formylloline serves as a chemoattractant for P. scribneri, but acts as a repellant at higher concentrations. However, ergot alkaloids also have repellent and immobilizing effects on P. scribneri, and an <b>endophyte</b> of perennial ryegrass lacking lolines, and genetically engineered to produce no ergot alkaloids, exhibits resistance to this nematode. Therefore, the relative importance of the loline and ergot alkaloids to nematode resistance remains unclear.|$|E

25|$|Fungal {{resistance}} to herbivores represents an environmentally sustainable alternative to pesticides that has experienced reasonable success in agricultural applications. The organic farming industry has embraced mycorrhizal symbionts as one tool for improving yields and protecting plants from damage. Infected crops of soybean, ribwort plantain, cabbage, banana, coffee bean plant and tomato all show markedly {{lower rates of}} herbivore damage compared to uninfected plants. Endophytic fungi show great promise {{as a means of}} indirect biocontrol in large-scale agricultural applications. The potential for biotechnology to improve crop populations through inoculation with modified fungal strains could reduce toxicity to livestock and improve yields of human-consumed foods. The <b>endophyte,</b> either with detrimental genes removed or beneficial new genes added, is used as a surrogate host to transform the crops genetically. An <b>endophyte</b> of ryegrass has been genetically transformed in this way and used successfully to deter herbivores.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{endophytic}} symbioses confer {{protection from}} herbivores – only some species associations act as defense mutualisms. The {{difference between a}} mutualistic <b>endophyte</b> and a pathogenic one can be indistinct and dependent on interactions with other species or environmental conditions. Some fungi which are pathogens {{in the absence of}} herbivores may become beneficial under high levels of insect damage, such as species which kill plant cells in order to make nutrients available for their own growth, thereby altering nutritional content of leaves and making them a less desirable foodstuff. Some endomycorrhizae may provide defense benefits but at the cost of lost reproductive potential by rendering grasses partially sterile with their own fungal reproductive structures taking precedence. This is not unusual among fungi, as non-endophytic plant pathogens have similar conditionally beneficial effects on defense. Some species of <b>endophyte</b> may be beneficial for the plants in other ways (e.g. nutrient and water uptake) but will provide less benefit as a plant receives more damage and not produce defensive chemicals in response. The effect of one fungus on the plant can be altered when multiple strains of fungi are infecting a given individual in combination.|$|E
25|$|The fungal endophytes are {{a diverse}} group of organisms forming {{associations}} almost ubiquitously throughout the plant kingdom. The endophytes which provide indirect defense against herbivores may have come from a number of origins, including mutualistic root <b>endophyte</b> associations and the evolution of entomopathogenic fungi into plant-associated endophytes. The endomycorrhiza, which live in plant roots, are made up of five groups: arbuscular, arbutoid, ericoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizae. The majority of species are from the phylum Glomeromycota with the ericoid species coming from the Ascomycota, while the arbutoid, monotropoid and orchid mycorrhizae are classified as Basidiomycota.

25|$|Studies of fungal {{infection}} consistently reveal that plants with endophytes {{are less likely}} to suffer substantial damage, and herbivores feeding on infected plants are less productive. There are multiple modes through which endophytic fungi reduce insect herbivore damage, including avoidance (deterrence), reduced feeding, reduced development rate, reduced growth and/or population growth, reduced survival and reduced oviposition. Vertebrate herbivores such as birds, rabbits and deer show the same patterns of avoidance and reduced performance. Even below-ground herbivores such as nematodes and root-feeding insects are reduced by <b>endophyte</b> infection. The strongest evidence for anti-herbivore benefits of fungal endophytes come from studies of herbivore populations being extirpated when allowed to feed only on infected plants. Examples of local extinction have been documented in crickets, larval armyworms and flour beetles.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the biotechnology revolution, much research has been also focused on using genetically modified endophytes to improve plant yields and defensive properties. The genetic basis of response to herbivory is being explored in tall fescue, where it appears the production of jasmonic acid {{may play a role in}} downregulation of the host plant’s chemical defense pathways when a fungal <b>endophyte</b> is present. In some cases, fungi that are closely associated with their hosts have transferred genes for secondary metabolite production to the host genome, which could help to explain multiple origins of chemical defenses within the phylogeny of various groups of plants. This represents an important line of inquiry to pursue, especially in regards to understanding the chemical pathways that can be utilized in biotechnological applications.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} the {{symbiosis}} between fungus and plant reaches a point of inseparability; fungal material is transmitted vertically from the maternal parent plant to seeds, forming a near-obligate mutualism. Because seeds are {{an important aspect of}} both fecundity and competitive ability for plants, high germination rates and seedling survival increase lifetime fitness. When fitness of plant and fungus become tightly intertwined, it {{is in the best interest}} of the <b>endophyte</b> to act in a manner beneficial to the plant, pushing it further toward the mutualism end of the continuum. Such effects of seed defense can also occur in dense stands of conspecifics through horizontal transmission of beneficial fungi. Mechanisms of microbial association defense, protecting the seeds rather than the already established plants, can have such drastic impacts on seed survival that they have been recognized to be an important aspect of the larger ‘seed defence theory’.|$|E

25|$|Genetic studies {{agree with}} the biosynthetic routes {{established}} in the precursor-feeding experiments. AFLP-based studies using crosses between strains of the <b>endophyte,</b> Epichloë festucae, that differ in the capacity to produce lolines, show that loline production and protection of the grass, Lolium giganteum, from feeding by the aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, segregate in a Mendelian fashion. The presence of a single locus for loline production was later confirmed by the finding that loline-producing epichloae endophytes contain a gene cluster (LOL cluster) of at least eleven genes. The LOL genes are greatly and coordinately upregulated during loline alkaloid production, and experimental genetic tests involving manipulation of selected LOL genes by RNA interference and gene knockout have directly confirmed the involvement {{of two of the}} LOL genes in loline biosynthesis. These tests and similarities in the peptide sequences of the proteins encoded by these genes to known enzymes indicate that one gene, termed lolC, is likely required for the first step in loline biosynthesis (condensation of L-proline and L-homoserine for NACPP formation), and another gene, lolP —likely encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase—, for oxygenation of one methyl group on the C-1 amine of N-methylloline, which gives the most abundant loline in many grass–endophyte symbiota, N-formylloline.|$|E

In this study, 215 bacterial <b>endophytes,</b> previously isolated from diverse maize genotypes including wild teosintes, traditional landraces and modern varieties, were tested for their ability to antagonize F. graminearum in vitro. Candidate <b>endophytes</b> were then tested for their ability to suppress GER in modern maize in independent greenhouse trials.

2500|$|Lolines are {{produced}} by several grass–endophyte symbioses involving epichloae species, often along with other bioactive metabolites including ergot alkaloids and indole diterpenoids, and the unusual pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid, peramine, which is not found in other biological communities or organisms. The lolines {{are produced}} at levels, however, that can exceed 10mg/g grass tissue (ranging from 2–20,000µg/g), exceeding the concentrations of the other <b>endophyte</b> alkaloids by >1000-fold. Lolines produced in the grasses Lolium pratense (syn.

Higher loline concentrations (100–1000µg/g) {{are present in the}} seeds and in younger leaf tissues, and the lolines display seasonal changes in concentration levels throughout the plant. The periodical appearance of tissues with high loline concentrations, such as flowering stems and seeds, contributes to this seasonal variation. Loline concentrations often increase in grass tissues regrown after defoliation and clipping of plants, suggesting an inducible defense response mechanism, involving both symbiotic partners. However, this increase appears to be due to higher loline levels in younger leaves compared to older leaves, but loline increases resembling inducible plant defenses have also been reported. Variation of loline concentration with the developmental stage of specific grass tissues suggests regulation of in planta loline distributions, providing greater protection of newly grown or embryonic tissues against attacks by insects. Surprisingly, exogenous application of the plant signaling compound, methyl jasmonate—which commonly signals predation by insects—decreases expression of the genes for the lolines. The factors that control loline production vary also among endophyte-infected grass tissues: whereas plant-supplied amino acids that are loline precursors limit accumulation of lolines in many grass tissues, their production in tissues that bear external mycelial growth for fungal reproduction (stromata) is regulated by the expression of loline genes.|$|E

Objectives In this study, we focused on the isolation of bacterial <b>endophytes</b> from three medicinal plants; Zataria multiflora, Achillea willhelmsii and Calendula officinalis L. and screening them for activities against some human bacterial pathogens isolated from nosocomial infections. Methods In this descriptive study random samples from asymptomatic leaves and branches of three medicinal plants namely: Zataria multiflora, Achillea willhelmsii and Calendula officinalis L. were collected from Chaharmahal Va Bakhtiari province of Iran in spring 2013. For isolation of endophytic bacteria, the disinfected portions of the plants were distributed onto the isolation media. To examine endophytic bacterial contents, the bioassays were conducted with using growing colonies in peptone agar (PA) and yeast extract agar (YEA) media, then inactivated them by chloroform. To assay antibacterial activity of endophytic bacterial culture broth, filter-sterilized supernatants were poured in cylinders on each bacterial plate. Results Nine discernible bacterial <b>endophytes</b> were isolated in purification from three medicinal plants. Generally, all isolated <b>endophytes</b> showed acceptable effects against indicator bacteria, however <b>endophytes</b> isolated from Zataria multiflora and Achillea willhelmsii were more effective against Staphylococcus aureus than other <b>endophytes.</b> Conclusions <b>Endophytes</b> of examined medicinal plants could be a good source of antibacterial substances...|$|R
