25|$|The {{canonical}} visitation of the Diocese of Rome is in {{the hands}} of a commission of cardinals. The president of the commission is the vicar, and its members by virtue of their office are prefects of the Congregation of the Council and of Religious Orders. The secretary of this official board is the commissary just mentioned. The first appointee as secretary and commissary was the former vicegerent (vicesgerens). The archives and compendiums of abstracts of the former Congregation of the Apostolic Visitation, which has been suppressed since 1908, belong to the new commission. Every five years, the next falling in 1916, a canonical visitation of Rome is to be held without any express papal command being issued before the visitation. Six paragraphs (12–17) regulate the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> to be observed in the visitation.|$|E

50|$|The {{surgical}} procedure for forming an ileo-anal pouch (jpouch) was pioneered by Sir Alan Parks at St. Mark's Hospital in London {{in the mid}} to late 1970s and <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> were first published in the British Medical Journal in 1978. The pouch was also known as a Parks' Pouch but more commonly is referred to as a 'Jpouch'. The Jpouch was developed {{as an alternative to the}} ileostomy. An ileostomy is where, in the absence of the colon, the small intestine is brought through the abdomen and sewn down forming an opening called a stoma. The stomal opening is where incontinent intestinal waste is emptied into a bag worn by the patient.|$|E

The observation missions are conducted at the official request of the national authorities concerned; the Congress sets up a delegation made of Congress members and members of the Committee of the Regions (some 10-15 people). At the close of the observation mission a preliminary statement by the Congress delegation is made.

50|$|Rules of {{criminal}} or civil procedure govern {{the conduct of}} a lawsuit in the common law adversarial system of dispute resolution. Procedural rules are constrained and informed by separate statutory laws, case laws, and constitutional provisions that define {{the rights of the}} parties to a lawsuit (see especially due process), though the rules generally reflect this legal context on their face. The <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> differ greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and often from court to court even within the same jurisdiction. These rules of the particular procedures are very important for litigants to know, because the litigants are the ones who dictate the timing and progression of the lawsuit. Litigants are responsible to obtain the suited result and the timing of reaching this result. Failure to comply with the procedural rules may result in serious limitations that can affect the ability of one to present claims or defenses at any subsequent trial, or even promote the dismissal of the lawsuit altogether.|$|E
5000|$|Cumulative voting {{satisfies}} the monotonicity criterion, the participation criterion, the consistency criterion, and reversal symmetry. Cumulative voting does not satisfy independence of irrelevant alternatives, later-no-harm criterion nor the Condorcet criterion. It does not satisfy the plurality criterion. The 11th edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised states, [...] "If it is desired to elect by mail, by plurality vote, by preferential voting, or by cumulative voting, {{this must be}} expressly stated, and necessary <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> should be prescribed (see 45)." [...] (Emphasis added). Robert's Rules describes the cumulative voting process. It provides that, [...] "A minority group, by coordinating its effort in voting for only one candidate {{who is a member}} of the group, may be able to secure the election of that candidate as a minority member of the board." [...] (Emphasis added). Thus, cumulative voting, when permitted, is a right to accumulate or stack votes but not a guarantee that this stacking will meet or override other election criteria such as a majority vote or majority present.|$|E
