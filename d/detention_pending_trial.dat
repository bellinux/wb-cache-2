2500|$|In two {{articles}} {{appearing in the}} Pakistani newspaper The Express Tribune, the precise status of Davis's and the American Government's claim of immunity was examined by Najmuddin Shaikh, a former Pakistani diplomat. He wrote {{that the question of}} diplomatic immunity depended on whether Davis was {{on the staff of the}} [...] "consulate" [...] or the [...] "embassy" [...] as the privileges and immunities of each are very different. Shaik wrote that if Davis was on the staff of the [...] "embassy", the question of immunity would depend upon whether Davis was in Mozang Chowrangi in the [...] "course of his duties" [...] and questioned who should decide that. Regarding the law concerning if Davis was on the [...] "consular" [...] staff, a practising lawyer in Islamabad, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, referred to the Vienna Convention of 1963 in The News International, writing: “one needs to read Article 41 (1) which says: Consular officers shall not be liable to arrest or <b>detention</b> <b>pending</b> <b>trial,</b> except in the case of a grave crime and pursuant to a decision by the competent judicial authority. Now having read the law, there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that if a member of US Consulate in Lahore kills someone, he is answerable to a court of law in that jurisdiction, as there is no other crime more heinous or more grave than murder." [...] Pakistani investigators took the position that Davis did not shoot the two men acting in self-defence and the police recommended he face a charge of double murder.|$|E
50|$|The four militants - Vasken Sako Sislian, Kevork Abraham Guzelian, Aram Avedis Basmajian and Hagop Abraham Dzhulfayan - {{were convicted}} on 31 January 1984 to 7 {{years in prison}} (including the years of their stay in <b>detention</b> <b>pending</b> <b>trial).</b> The verdict {{received}} large resentment in Turkey.|$|E
50|$|The next day, Boškoski {{was brought}} {{in front of a}} judge, who ordered his 30-day <b>detention,</b> <b>pending</b> <b>trial</b> on charges for abuse of office and illegal {{financing}} of a political party. Supporters of Boškoski deny the charges and claimed that his arrest was politically motivated by his political opponents.|$|E

5000|$|Banki {{was denied}} bail despite {{multiple}} attempts. He {{was held in}} high and maximum security [...] <b>detention</b> facilities <b>pending</b> <b>trial.</b> Judge John F. Keenan asserted that there was “no combination of conditions would ensure Banki’s appearance in court” and denied bail multiple times despite securing guarantees {{of millions of dollars}} in bond. Nine attorneys and close friends volunteered to put up their homes as collateral on Banki’s behalf for his bail package. But the judge did not see any monetary amount that could satisfy the bail conditions in his opinion.|$|R
50|$|Customers whom Lumumba {{had been}} serving at his {{bar on the}} night of the murder gave him a {{complete}} alibi. After bloodstained fingerprints of Rudy Guede were found on bedding under Kercher's body, Guede was brought from Germany where he had fled. Guede, Knox, and Sollecito were then charged with committing the murder together. On November 30, a panel of three judges endorsed the charges, and ordered Knox and Sollecito held in <b>detention</b> <b>pending</b> a <b>trial.</b> In a formal interview with Mignini, Knox said she had been brainwashed by police interrogators into accusing Lumumba and implicating herself.|$|R
5000|$|Less {{than two}} months after Gaskarov’s arrest, his lawyers asked the Moscow City Court to release him from <b>detention</b> <b>pending</b> <b>trial.</b> Russian Duma deputy Dmitriy Gudkov, human-rights {{advocate}} Lev Ponomarev, and Novaya Gazeta editor-in-chief Dmitriy Muratov vouched for Gaskarov, assuring the court {{that he would not}} flee the country. This request was rejected on the supposed grounds that Gaskarov “did not reside at the address where he was registered, used secrecy to conceal his criminal activity, and possesses the financial capability to leave the Russian Federation.” ...|$|E
50|$|He {{was indicted}} {{by a federal}} grand jury on the {{additional}} charge of conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group (which carries the maximum penalty of 15 years in prison) on June 20. He appeared in court again on July 8, and was ordered by the judge to remain in <b>detention,</b> <b>pending</b> <b>trial.</b> In court, Harroun's lawyer Geremy Kamens claimed he was confused when he claimed to have joined al-Nusra, wanted to avoid extremists, spoke little Arabic, and actually joined the al Nasser (Victory) brigade (an associate of Jabhat al-Nusra which is not classed as a terrorist organisation). However the prosecution successfully argued that the four confessions Harroun had made to journalists were sufficient evidence {{due to the fact that}} they corroborated factual information, stating that the towns Harroun said he had been in were also strongholds of the al-Nusra front. The magistrate also maintained that he saw the confession as legitimate.|$|E
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 August agents of KGB arrested an activist of the {{campaign}} Michail Bashura and handed him over to officers of Soviet district Regional Office of Internal Affairs of Minsk. At the same day they opened a criminal case according to part 2 of article 380 of Criminal Code (forgery, production, use or sale of fake documents, stamps, formsheets). They claimed that Bashura had overstated his income when he went a guarantee for receiving a credit in a bank in 2008. On 9 August his <b>detention</b> <b>pending</b> <b>trial</b> was extended without charge. On 17 August Bashura was charged of commission of a crime according to two parts of article 380: forgery of documents aimed {{to be used by}} the producer and same actions, conducted by previous concert by a group of people. During investigation Bashura was kept under arrest. Human rights activists and Uladzimir Niaklajeu consider this case to be politically motivated.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 April 2011, the German Federal Police [...] arrested 3 Moroccans in {{the western}} German city of Düsseldorf and one in nearby Bochum. The Moroccans were linked with the 2004 Madrid train bombings and 2005 London transit attacks. The arrests were based on {{suspicion}} they were planning a terror attack in the country, they said. Local media reports that officers had seized large amounts of explosives when the three were arrested. The three alleged terrorists were brought to a judge {{the next day and}} they are to remain in <b>detention</b> <b>pending</b> an awaiting <b>trial.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Government of Cameroon {{demonstrated}} weak anti-trafficking {{law enforcement}} efforts {{over the last}} year. The government enacted no relevant legislation during the reporting period, and the country {{does not have a}} law prohibiting all forms of trafficking in persons, as its 2006 draft law against adult trafficking has yet to be passed and enacted. The country’s existing 2005 law against child trafficking and slavery prescribes a penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment for these offenses − a punishment that is sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses. During the reporting period, authorities investigated 26 new cases of human trafficking, as well as 18 other cases of possible trafficking offenses, none of which has resulted in a prosecution. All of the 26 cases involved children, and 10 of the cases were arrests and <b>detentions</b> <b>pending</b> <b>trials.</b> Several factors delay these cases, including the limited number of gendarmes and police officers available in rural areas, poor understanding of trafficking issues among victims who may be illiterate, and the lack of any security units specifically assigned to anti-trafficking details. The remaining 16 cases were alleged trafficking offenders who were caught in the act and arrested, but finally released after the matter was resolved either at the level of security forces, social affairs agencies, or a human rights lawyer’s chambers. To address these cases, officials used the 2005 anti-child trafficking law and the pertinent provisions of the Penal Code. The government reported no trafficking convictions during the reporting period. The government did not investigate traditional leaders in the Northern Region suspected of keeping hereditary servants in conditions of involuntary servitude. Official sources give no indication that the government facilitates or condones trafficking, though there were signs of some officials’ involvement in trafficking. In November 2009, a Bamenda-based lawyer filed a complaint against a commissioner of one of the police districts for complicity in child trafficking. The lawyer claimed that the commissioner opposed the arrest and detention of a woman caught while committing transnational trafficking. The Bamenda High Court took no action on the complaint against the police commissioner during the reporting period.|$|R

40|$|For some years, France has {{searched for}} ways to control abuses in the {{judicial}} system. In the “Affaire d’Outreau,” indictment, <b>detention</b> <b>pending</b> <b>trial</b> and conviction was delivered to innocent men and women, just because of witness evidence, which had not been verified by the investigating judge; the resulting public criticism made the French parliament reorganize the judicial organisation. This case intensified the crisis of confidence (which already existed) French citizens in the justice system. The Minister of Justice has not {{played an important role}} in curbing abuses, but the Superior Council of the Magistrates (CSM) has dealt with disciplinary prosecutions. Thus, the question remains whether it is possible to create a single institution to handle citizen complaints regarding the malfunctioning of judicial institutions, and various issues arise. Should the Mediator (the institution for complaints against executive institutions of the French state, which is the French equivalent of an Ombudsman) or a special Ombudsman for justice organisations, including courts handle these complaints? Should the CSM be given wider powers? France attempted to address these issues through a law on the responsibility of magistrates. However, this effort was a failure because the text was imprecise (so that the Conseil Constitutionnel censored some clauses) and elaborated without consultation. </span...|$|E
40|$|Pretrial {{release is}} the legal process by which {{defendants}} who are accused of criminal offenses are released from <b>detention</b> <b>pending</b> <b>trial.</b> Evaluators are frequently concerned with the qualitative and quantuative importance of defendant and offense variables in the determination of which defendants gain release and, {{for those who are}} released, which defendants will engage in pretrial misconduct. This article presents a method for deriving unbiased parameter estimates, using maximum likelihood techniques m a structural equation paradigm, for the release decision and indicates how these techniques can be extended to the analysis of pretrial misconduct. The Eighth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution protectsaccused defendants by the dictate that &dquo;excessive bail shall not be required. &dquo; In 1951, the Supreme Court decision in Stack v. Boyle defined &dquo;excessive bail&dquo; as anything greater than the amount that would guarantee the appearance of the accused at trial. The Federal Bail Reform Act of 1966 went a step further to ensure that the accused is not detained unjustifiably or discriminated against financially. The act mandates that all defendants (except capital offenders) be eligible for release. As Landes (1974) has demonstrated, legality and reality may differ. Judges also seem to consider the potential for pretrial crime when setting bail conditions. Findings similar to Landes’s, which pertained to New York City, have been reported in other settings (Bynum, 1977; Roth and Wice, 1980; Toborg, 1981; Stryker et al., 1983). These studies imply that judges do not adhere strictly to constitutional dictates and that some defendants may be financially discriminated against...|$|E
