Mann kept the role of Lecktor very short, believing that it was [...] "such a charismatic character that [...] wanted the audience almost not to <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> him". For the role of Will Graham, De Laurentiis had expressed interest in Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman, but Mann, having seen footage of William Petersen's role in To Live and Die in L.A., championed Petersen for the part.|$|E
