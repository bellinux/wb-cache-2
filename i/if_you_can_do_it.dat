60|$|Surely {{the art of}} {{reporting}} speeches is in a strange state of degeneration. We should not object, perhaps, to the reporter's making the speeches much shorter than they are; but we do object to his making all the speeches much worse than they are. And the method which he employs is one which is dangerously unjust. When a statesman or philosopher makes an important speech, there are several courses which the reporter might take without being unreasonable. Perhaps the most reasonable course of all would be not to report the speech at all. Let the world live and love, marry and give in marriage, without that particular speech, as they did (in some desperate way) {{in the days when}} there were no newspapers. A second course would be to report a small part of it; but to get that right. A third course, far better <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> is to understand the main purpose and argument of the speech, and report that in clear and logical language of your own. In short, the three possible methods are, first, to leave the man's speech alone; second, to report what he says or some complete part of what he says; and third, to report what he means. But the present way {{of reporting}} speeches (mainly created, I think, by the scrappy methods of the Daily Mail) is something utterly different from both these ways, and quite senseless and misleading.|$|E

Stephen Colbert describing the show's production, 2009 The show's writing was grounded in improv, employing a [...] "yes to everything" [...] mentality. Much of the humor derived from extended improv games with the show's studio and at-home audience, such as Colbert's poll to name a bridge in Hungary after himself. Many of the writers had improv training and at one point put together [...] "improv evenings" [...] at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre once a month. Writers on The Colbert Report were predominantly male and white; Colbert acknowledged this lack of diversity, but he contended he had hired writers based solely on the quality of their material and had never looked at the names on writing packets submitted for employment. Subjects considered too dark were not even considered for comedic material; for example, the show would poke fun at press coverage of a tragedy, rather than the tragedy itself. Issues discussed on the show were later reported on actual newscasts, in turn allowing the show to comment on its own impact, creating an echo chamber of sorts. This led Colbert to describe his show, [...] "at its purest expression, as a pebble that we throw into the puddle of the news, and then we report on our own ripples." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bitstrips was co-developed by Toronto-based comic artist Jacob Blackstock and {{his high}} school friend, {{journalist}} Jesse Brown; the service was originally envisioned {{as a means to}} allow anyone to create their own comic strip without needing artistic skills. Brown explained that [...] "it's so difficult and time-consuming to tell a story in comic book form, drawing the same characters again and again in these tiny little panels, and just the amount of draftsmanship required. And even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> well, which I never could, it takes years to make a story." [...] Brown stated that the service would be [...] "groundwork for a whole new way to communicate", and went as far as describing the service as being a [...] "YouTube for comics". Blackstock explained that the concept of Bitstrips was influenced by his own use of comics as a form of socialization; a student, Blackstock and his friends drew comics featuring each other and shared them during classes. He felt that Bitstrips was a [...] "medium for self-expression", stating that [...] "It’s not just about you making the comics, but since you and your friends star in these comics, it’s like you’re the medium. The visual nature of comics just speaks so much louder than text."The service was publicly unveiled at South by Southwest 2008. In 2009, the service introduced a version oriented towards the educational market, Bitstrips for Schools, which was initially piloted at a number of schools in Ontario. The service was praised by educators for being engaging to students, especially within language classes. Brown noted that students were using the service to create comics outside of class as well, stating that it was [...] "so gratifying and shocking what people do with your tool to make their own stories in ways that you never would have anticipated. Some of them are just brilliant." ...|$|E
