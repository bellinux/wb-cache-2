5|$|Control is {{the third}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy <b>Jam</b> <b>and</b> Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, <b>Jam</b> <b>and</b> Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control {{becoming one of the}} foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.|$|E

40|$|Soft {{homemade}} <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> jellies can be {{an unfortunate}} occurrence and are often the result of using overripe fruit, fruit lacking the appropriate acidity, using the wrong amount of sugar, increasing the recipe, not bringing the product up to a full rolling boil, using old pectin or not enough pectin, or numerous other causes. Both canned (cooked) <b>and</b> freezer (uncooked) <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> jellies can be remade if the products are too soft. This publication outlines how to remake soft <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> jellies that were cooked using powdered pectin, liquid pectin, and no pectin.

40|$|Abstract—Jamming {{has long}} been a problem in {{wireless}} communications, but with recent advances in adaptive <b>jamming,</b> adaptive anti-jamming, <b>and</b> other advanced physical layer security techniques, it is hard to understand whether we can keep the jammer at bay. In this work, we consider this problem and introduce a game-theoretic framework which gives us a tool to analyze the complex adaptive <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> anti-jamming space. To illustrate the strengths and weaknesses in intelligent <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> anti-jamming techniques, we present a straightforward twoplayer instance and analyze a number of possible <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> anti-jamming techniques.

5|$|Charmbracelet is {{the ninth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, released on December 3, 2002 through MonarC Entertainment and Island Records. The album {{was her first}} release since her breakdown following the release of her film Glitter (2001) and its accompanying soundtrack album, {{both of which were}} critical and commercial failures from the previous year. Critics described Charmbracelet as one of her most personal records, following 1997's Butterfly, Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with several songwriters and producers, including Jermaine Dupri, Jimmy <b>Jam</b> <b>and</b> Terry Lewis, 7 Aurelius and Dre & Vidal.|$|E
5|$|Confessions is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Usher. It was {{released}} on March 23, 2004, by Arista Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2003 to 2004, with its production handled by his longtime collaborator Jermaine Dupri, along with Jimmy <b>Jam</b> <b>and</b> Terry Lewis and Lil Jon, among others. Primarily an R album, Confessions showcases Usher as a crooner through a mixture of ballads and up-tempos, incorporating musical genres of dance-pop, hip hop and crunk. The album's themes generated controversy about Usher's personal relationships; however, the album's primary producer Jermaine Dupri claimed the album reflects Dupri's own personal story.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Jamming {{has long}} been a problem in {{wireless}} communications. Recently, adaptive <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> anti-jamming techniques have been proposed which aim to use feedback to better perform their task. For an anti-jamming receiver this means detecting <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> adapting its protocol appropriately. For a jammer this means using feedback from the legitimate system to design a high-impact, low-power, hard-to-detect attack. In this work we introduce a toolbox to allow users to tests the performance of adaptive <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> anti-jamming on the USRP 2 radio platform. These test provide an important function by letting developers understand how well new protocols work against evolving jamming technologies...|$|R

5|$|The {{game has}} been {{compared}} by the developer as akin to skateboarding games, but where the player controls a goat aimed at doing as much damage as possible around an open world map, without any other larger goals. The game, initially developed as a joke prototype from an internal game <b>jam</b> <b>and</b> shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met with excitement and attention, prompting the studio to build out the game into a releasable state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and glitches to maintain the game's entertainment value.|$|E

5|$|A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was {{eaten by}} miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The {{technician}} {{who did the}} research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional fillings have included {{a wide variety of}} locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, <b>jam</b> <b>and</b> sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.|$|E
5|$|As Schwarzenegger only {{signed on}} for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only {{six and a half}} months were {{available}} for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5 inch replica $25 Talking Turbo-Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured. Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year's other releases, such as Space <b>Jam</b> <b>and</b> 101 Dalmatians. The film's release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo craze, in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 Christmas season lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man.|$|E
5|$|Containing autobiographical themes, a {{majority}} of the album's lyrics came {{as the result of a}} series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to <b>Jam</b> <b>and</b> Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women.|$|E

5|$|Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Janet Jackson, {{released}} on September 19, 1989, by A Records. Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album, Control (1986), Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues. Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy <b>Jam</b> <b>and</b> Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance abuse, in addition to themes of romance. Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim. Jackson came {{to be considered a}} role model for youth because of her socially conscious lyrics.|$|E
