5|$|During its {{development}} the ZNG experienced {{a number of}} problems, including shortages of weapons and ammunition, lack of uniforms, inadequate training and an overall deficiency in trained officers, and poor staff work and command structures (preventing the <b>effective</b> <b>coordination</b> of multiple units). These problems were offset by good morale, clear objectives {{and high levels of}} mobilisation. After the Battle of the Barracks, the ZNG expanded significantly with arms captured from the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija). By the end of October 60 new brigades and independent battalions were established, and on 3 November the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska).|$|E
5|$|To command {{individual}} units, regional ZNG commands {{were established}} in eastern Slavonia, the Banovina–Kordun area, Lika, central and northern Dalmatia, southern Dalmatia and Zagreb in late July and August. Crisis headquarters, which also had command authority of ZNG units, were established down to the municipal level. The command structure was particularly poor, preventing <b>effective</b> <b>coordination</b> between units. Although the many crisis headquarters were entrusted {{with a high level}} of authority, they consisted of politicians with little (if any) military training other than JNA service. Multiple units deployed to a single area often had no authority coordinating their activities. TO command systems were reactivated in some places (such as Zagreb), somewhat improving the situation.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasons for}} D Company's success {{included}} superior radio communications which had allowed Stanley to co-ordinate {{the fire of}} the guns at Nui Dat, {{the weight of the}} artillery which repeatedly broke up the assaulting formations, its timely aerial resupply which prevented them running out of ammunition, and the mobility and firepower of the APCs in the relief force which broke the Viet Cong's will to fight. The battle highlighted the power of modern weapons and the importance of sound small-unit tactics, and has since been cited {{as an example of the}} effect of combined arms, demonstrating the <b>effective</b> <b>coordination</b> of infantry, armour, artillery and aviation. Artillery had been the mainstay of the defence, with D Company supported by 24 guns from the 1st Field Regiment, RAA and A Battery, US 2/35th Artillery Battalion. Indirect fire provided close protection to the infantry, allowing D Company to hold their line and repulse any Viet Cong that succeeded in getting through the barrage. Likely forming-up positions and withdrawal routes had also been heavily engaged throughout the battle. In total 3,198 rounds of 105mm ammunition were fired by the Australian and New Zealand field guns and 242 rounds of 155mm high explosive by the Americans. Ultimately the Viet Cong made the error of attacking within range of the artillery at Nui Dat and had to withstand the fire of three field batteries and one medium battery as a result. Against this, the force that attacked D Company had done so without heavy weapons in support, potentially because they had been detached for an assault on Nui Dat. Long Tan also confirmed the importance of armoured support to infantry, even in dense jungle.|$|E
500|$|In June 1993, {{partly in}} {{response}} to pressure from the United States, the Security Council passed Resolution 836 which authorized NATO forces to provide close air support for UNPROFOR forces upon request. The procedure to request air support was quite difficult, as it involved the [...] "dual key" [...] of both UN and NATO approval. UN approval required contact with the United Nations headquarters in New York City, making <b>effective</b> <b>coordination</b> nearly impossible given the difference in time zones. The UN approval process was later somewhat streamlined when UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delegated the authority to authorize air strikes to his special representative in Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi. [...] Even after this simplification, however, [...] "dual key" [...] remained a problem as all requests first had to be processed through the UN Air Operations Center in Kiseljak then pass up the entire [...] UNPROFOR chain of command to Akashi. After Akashi approved the request, {{he would make a}} request to NATO commanders who then had to pass orders back down their chain of command and coordinate with forces on the ground.|$|E

2500|$|Soviet {{membership}} {{was initially}} freely elected, but {{many members of}} the Socialist Revolutionary Party, anarchists, and other leftists created opposition to the Bolsheviks through the soviets themselves. When {{it became clear that the}} Bolsheviks had little support outside of the industrialized areas of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, they simply barred non-Bolsheviks from membership in the soviets. [...] Not surprisingly, this caused mass domestic tension with many individuals who called for another series of political reform, revolting, and calling for [...] "a third Russian revolution," [...] a movement that received a significant amount of support. The most notable instances of this anti-Bolshevik mentality were expressed in the Tambov rebellion, 1919–1921, and the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921. These movements, which made a wide range of demands and lacked <b>effective</b> <b>coordination,</b> were eventually defeated along with the White Army during the Civil War.|$|E
2500|$|Although it {{considered}} {{creation of a}} separate aviation department to act as the centralized authority for decision-making, both the War and the Navy Departments opposed it, and on October 1, 1917, Congress instead legalized {{the existence of the}} APB and changed its name to the [...] "Aircraft Board", transferring its functions from the Council of National Defense to the secretaries of War and the Navy. Even so, the Aircraft Board in practice had little control over procurement contracts and functioned mostly as an information provider between industrial, governmental, and military entities. Nor did the [...] "Equipment Division" [...] of the Signal Corps exercise such control. Established by the Office of the Chief Signal Officer (OCSO) as one of the operating components of the Aviation Section, its task was to unify and coordinate the various agencies involved but its head was a commissioned former member of the APB who did nothing to create any <b>effective</b> <b>coordination.</b> Moreover, the largely wood and fabric airframe designs of World War I did not lend themselves to being made with the mass production methods of the automotive industry, which used considerable amounts of metallic materials instead, and the priority of mass producing spare parts was neglected. Though individual areas within the aviation industry responded well, the industry as a whole failed. Efforts to mass produce European aircraft under license largely failed because the aircraft, made by hand, were not amenable to the more precise American manufacturing methods. At the same time the Aeronautical Division of the OCSO was renamed the Air Division with continued responsibility for training and operations but with no influence on acquisition or doctrine. In the end the decision-making process in aircraft procurement was badly fragmented and production on a large scale proved impossible.|$|E
