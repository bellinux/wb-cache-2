25|$|The {{peace conference}} opened in May 1697 in William III's palace at Ryswick near The Hague. The Swedes were the {{official}} mediators, {{but it was}} through the private efforts of Boufflers and William Bentinck, the Earl of Portland that the major issues were resolved. William III {{had no intention of}} continuing the war or pressing for Leopold I's claims in the Rhineland or for the Spanish succession: <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> important for Dutch and British security to obtain Louis XIV's recognition of the 1688 revolution.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} game's narrative. Andrea Maderna {{said that it}} gave off an {{emotional}} vibe and had fantastic narrative choices and structure, though the player's role is limited. Laura Kate Dale was disappointed, saying that the narrative would shine more {{in the form of}} a short film as <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> impressive when it was a [...] "five minute convention floor demo than as a two and a half hour long finished product". Eric Swain, of the on-line magazine PopMatters, said that he found himself asking [...] "Why is this a game?", and suggested that it would work better as an audio drama.|$|E
500|$|Overall, Yield {{resembles the}} {{straightforward}} rock {{approach of the}} band's early work. Gossard said, [...] "The songs {{were a little bit}} more structured. I don't know if it was poppier, but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> professional." [...] O'Brien noted that during the Yield sessions, the band made a conscious effort to create more accessible songs. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has [...] "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten." [...] "Given to Fly", the album's first single, was noted for its similarity to Led Zeppelin's [...] "Going to California" [...] from the 1971 album, Led Zeppelin IV.|$|E

500|$|In their {{earliest}} days, the Rolling Stones {{played for}} {{no money in}} the interval of Alexis Korner's gigs at a basement club opposite Ealing Broadway tube station (subsequently called [...] "Ferry's" [...] club). At the time, the group had very little equipment and needed to borrow Korner's gear to play. The group's first appearance, under the name the Rollin' Stones (after one of their favourite Muddy Waters tunes), was at the Marquee Club, a jazz club, in London on 12 July 1962. They would later change their name to [...] "the Rolling Stones" [...] as <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> formal. Victor Bockris states that the band members included Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Ian Stewart on piano, Dick Taylor on bass and Tony Chapman on drums. However, Richards states in his memoir Life that [...] "The drummer that night was Mick Avory--not Tony Chapman, as history has mysteriously handed it down..." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the average}} soldier, {{life at the}} fort was [...] "monotonous". [...] Until the {{permanent}} structures were built, soldiers had to live in tents, which lacked comfort. [...] Aside from a few whiskey peddlers and prostitutes, few civilians lived at the fort. [...] Officers had brought their personal slaves with them, including Captain Swords. [...] The border with Missouri was [...] east of Fort Scott. In Missouri was a grog shop that supplied soldiers, and quite a few courts-martial followed soldiers' going AWOL at the shop. [...] The desertion rate from the fort ranged from 12%-16%, due to boredom, irregular pay, and hatred for military life. [...] As no combat took place near the fort, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> of a frontier village than a military base. [...] Hunting was a popular pastime; according to Captain Swords, [...] "wolf chasing and duck hunting" [...] {{was the only way}} one officer could tolerate the place.|$|E
500|$|Recalling {{the release}} of Sgt. Pepper in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner wrote that [...] "Nothing quite like 'A Day In The Life' had been {{attempted}} before in so-called popular music" [...] {{in terms of the}} song's [...] "use of dynamics and tricks of rhythm, and of space and stereo effect, and its deft intermingling of scenes from dream, reality, and shades in between". Schaffner said that in the context of 1967, the track [...] "was so visually evocative <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> like a film than a mere song". Richard Goldstein of The New York Times called the song [...] "a deadly earnest excursion in emotive music with a chilling lyric... stands {{as one of the most}} important Lennon-McCartney compositions… [...] an historic Pop event". In a contemporary music critics' poll published by Jazz & Pop magazine, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] won in the categories of Best Pop Song and Best Pop Arrangement.|$|E

500|$|SFX Magazine Russell Lewin gave [...] "The Beast Below" [...] {{four out}} of five stars, calling it [...] "immensely satisfying". He {{particularly}} praised the two lead performances and Amy's characterisation as companion, as well as the writing and dialogue. Dan Martin, also of The Guardian, praised the story for testing the characters' relationships rather than being just a visit to the Starship UK to make it better, though he commented that the [...] "anti-vivisection message" [...] seemed to be lost along the way. He praised the way the Doctor was portrayed in terms of his more inhumane instincts in contrast to the Tenth Doctor and rated the episode as [...] "{{four out of}} five". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern said that the episode [...] "neither moved [...] to wave a Save the Starwhale banner nor reach for the nearest harpoon" [...] and made him feel [...] "out of the loop" [...] as <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> directed at children than adults. However, he praised the acting of Smith, Gillan, and Sophie Okonedo, as well as the creation of the Smilers.|$|E
500|$|When South Pacific {{opened in}} London in November 1951, the reviews were mixed. [...] London's Daily Express praised the music but disliked other {{elements}} of that show, writing, [...] "We got a 42nd Street Madame Butterfly, the weakest of all the Hammerstein-Rodgers musicals. The Daily Mail suggested, [...] "The play moved so slowly between its songs that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> like South Soporific." [...] The Times applauded the songs but indicated that [...] "before the end the singing and the dancing have dwindled to almost nothing, while the rather sad little tale is slowly and conventionally wound up." [...] The Manchester Guardian, however, noted the anticipation {{in advance of the}} opening and concluded that [...] "there was no disappointment... the show bounces the audience and well deserves the cheers." [...] Drama critic Kenneth Tynan of The Spectator wrote that South Pacific was [...] "the first musical romance which was seriously involved in an adult subject... I have nothing to do but thank Logan, Rodgers and Hammerstein and climb up from my knees, a little cramped from the effort of typing in such an unusual position." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} the NASA {{scientists}} give Arroway the [...] "cyanide pill" [...] caused some controversy during production {{and when the}} film came out. Gerald D. Griffin, the film's NASA advisor, insisted that NASA has never given any astronaut a cyanide pill [...] "just in case," [...] and that if an astronaut truly wished to commit suicide in space, all {{he or she would}} have to do is cut off their oxygen supply. However, Carl Sagan insisted that NASA did indeed give out cyanide pills and they did it for every mission an astronaut has ever flown. Zemeckis said that because of the two radically different assertions, the truth is unknown, but he left the suicide pill scene in the movie as <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> suspenseful that way and it was also in line with Sagan's beliefs and vision of the film. [...] Along with being NASA Technical Consultant for the project, Griffin had a cameo in the role of [...] "Dynamics" [...] in Mission Control. [...] He had previously been technical advisor for Ron Howard's 1995 film Apollo 13. [...] While working for NASA during the Apollo Program, he had been the actual flight director for that mission, among others, and during the 1980s was the director of the Johnson Space Center.|$|E

500|$|In {{spring of}} 1593, Robert Galbraith, Laird of Culcreuch, {{purchased}} a Commission of Justiciary (or a [...] " [...] Letter of Fire and Sword" [...] used to legally attack and destroy another clan) to pursue Clan Gregor and [...] "their ressetters and assisters". The MacAulays and Colquhouns were suspicious of Galbraith's real intentions and on 3 May 1593, the chiefs {{of the two}} clans complained to the Privy Council that Galbraith of Culcreuch had only purchased the commission under counsel from George Buchanan, and that Galbraith had no intentions of actually harassing the MacGregors. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> likely that the Galbraiths, allied with the Buchanans, would direct their vengeance against the MacAulays and Colquhouns {{under the guise of}} hunting and clearing Clan Gregor from the Lennox. To complicate matters, the Laird of Ardincaple had married the Laird of Culcreuch's widowed mother against his consent and Galbraith had [...] "gevin vp kindnes, and denunceit his euill-will to him with solempne vowis of revenge" [...] (given up kindness, and denounced his evil will to MacAulay with solemn vows of revenge). Due to the influence of the Duke of Lennox, the Letter of Fire and Sword were taken from the Galbraiths and Buchanans. Ardincaple had however been sparing of the entire truth. No mention was made of the bond of manrent between him and the MacGregor chief. According to Ronald Williams, it is unlikely the Privy Council was aware of this bond between. Even so, the Privy Council required securities of Ardincaple not to assist Clan Gregor.|$|E
500|$|The Canadian {{historian}} Elliot Rose {{suggested that}} the reason that Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her [...] "imposing credentials" [...] {{as a member of}} staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy {{in the eyes of many}} readers. He further {{suggested that the}} Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed [...] "the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [...] Graves would be familiar with". Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it [...] "appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age", including [...] "the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. Related to this, the folklorist Jacqueline Simpson suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a [...] "sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument" [...] between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like Montague Summers, who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers. [...] "How refreshing", noted the historian Hilda Ellis Davidson, [...] "and exciting her first book was at that period. A new approach, and such a surprising one." ...|$|E

CSIS director Reid Morden voiced similar concerns, saying <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> like [...] "election year" [...] politics, than an actual threat—and The New York Times pointed out that one day before the announcement, they had been told by the Department of Homeland Security that there were no current risks.|$|E

2500|$|John J. Puccio of DVDTown.com felt Night of the Lepus {{would have}} been better had it been an {{intentionally}} humorous horror spoof, rather than a legitimate attempt at making a horror film with killer rabbits. Stating that it was in the [...] "so-bad-it's-good" [...] category for only two minutes, he found the actors to be [...] "stiff and uninvolved" [...] in delivering their lines, and that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> like an [...] "old television horse opera" [...] than a horror film with more slow-paced filler than action sequences, and the few bits of action ruined by the [...] "corniest possible 'action' music". AMC Film Critic's Christopher Null states that it is famous as [...] "one of the worst films ever made". He heavily criticizes Claxton, feeling that he [...] "just seems wholly incapable of making the movie remotely frightening, or even of making much sense" [...] and that the bad special effects [...] "make the entire film a huge joke". Reviewing the title for Classic-Horror.com, Julia Merriam gave Night of the Lepus credit for attempting to be a [...] "socially-conscious eco-horror", but criticized the slow pacing, bad dialog, poor editing with a heavy reliance on stock footage that {{did not appear to be}} from the same film, and senseless character actions such as entering a rabbit-filled cave just to photograph them. She also criticized the film's obvious use of people in rabbit suits, but concluded its biggest flaw was that [...] "fluffy bunnies just aren't scary".|$|E
2500|$|Jeta Amata, {{who grew}} up in the Niger Delta stated in an {{interview}} that it has been a while since he has wanted to make a film on the Niger Delta. He had written three scripts on it for about eight years; but as the issues kept escalating, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>more</b> difficult to make [...] "but I got to the point where I knew it just has to be now". [...] Black November is fiction based on an actual event, the title being derived from the month in which activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in 1995. Amata had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father and was affected by his death. The recent Niger Delta militancy further triggered Amata's interest to make the film; Jeta Amata had to meet with most of the Niger Delta ex-militants such as Asari Dokubo and Boyloaf to listen to their sides of the story. He stated in an interview: [...] "What I'm doing is what they did, but without weapons." [...] Amata explained that even though the film touched some political points, he is more concerned about the human parts of the story, about the feelings of the people and what they passed through: [...] "We are not trying to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged". [...] The film was majorly funded by a Nigerian business magnate, Captain Hosa Wells Okunbo, who says he does not want to go down in history as [...] "just another rich merchant", he wants to give something back to the region that made him wealthy.|$|E
