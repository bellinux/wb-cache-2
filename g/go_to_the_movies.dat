500|$|Spending is low {{to begin}} with since many {{consumers}} are cutting back and repaying debts incurred during the preceding holiday season, as well as having less free time, Jeremy Kirk of Firstshowing.net, when asked to explain the dearth of good films in January, notes that moviegoers are returning to their work and school routines during the month. C. Robert Cargill of Ain't It Cool News adds that only those over 35, [...] "who have savings accounts and weren't tapped out by Christmas," [...] can afford to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> regularly then.

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the summer}} {{seasonal}} jobs end, just as with the winter dump months, and younger moviegoers begin to return to school. Tuition payments, and retailers' back-to-school sales further cut into movie grosses. [...] "The prevailing wisdom is that people don't <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> in August" [...] due to family vacations, summer camp, among other factors, Vulture complained as it pondered another potentially dreary month in 2008. While an August release can open as successfully as a film earlier in the summer, [...] "t just doesn't have the ability to run five or six weeks so there's a scramble for June and July," [...] Ted Mundorff, head of Landmark Theatres, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in 2014. The type of films that interest younger audiences in the early summer, he elaborates, do not do well after Labor Day.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequences}} on the Grid were wholly shot in 3D, utilizing cameras {{specifically designed}} for it, and employed a 3D technique that combined other special effects techniques. The real-world sequences were filmed in 2D, and eventually altered using the three-dimensional element. Bailey stated {{that it was a}} challenge shooting Tron: Legacy in 3D because the cameras were bigger and heavier, and variations needed to be taken into account. Despite these concerns, he opined that it was a [...] "great reason to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> because it's an experience you just can't recreate on an iPhone or a laptop". In some sequences the image shows a fine mesh pattern and some blurring. That is not interference or a production fault, but indicates that that sequence is a flashback and to simulate an older form of video representation technology. Stunt work on the film was designed and coordinated by 87Eleven, who also designed and trained fight sequences for 300 and Watchmen. Olivia Wilde described it as an honor to train with them.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, McAdams starred {{with her}} The Family Stone co-star Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford in the comedy Morning Glory. She played a {{television}} producer attempting {{to improve the}} poor ratings of a morning television program. The film was billed as a starring vehicle for McAdams. She initially felt she was unsuited to the role saying, [...] "I'm not funny. So I said, 'if you need me to be funny, {{you might want to}} look somewhere else'". The film's director Roger Michell had a number of dinners with McAdams and persuaded her to join the cast. Since working with Keaton, McAdams has described her as a mentor figure. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said McAdams [...] "gives the kind of performance we <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> for" [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt she played [...] "as lovable a lead as anyone since Amy Adams in Junebug" [...] in an otherwise [...] "routine" [...] movie. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was impressed by [...] "her gift for physical comedy", as was Varietys Andrew Barker. While Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt she [...] "plays her role exceptionally well" [...] and is [...] "effortlessly likable", it called on Hollywood to give her parts [...] "worthy" [...] of her talent. [...] "Ms.McAdams has to rely on her dimples to get by. She does, but she could do better." [...] The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $58million worldwide from a production budget of $40million. McAdams later expressed her disappointment that the film failed to find a larger audience.|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we can do in terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E
