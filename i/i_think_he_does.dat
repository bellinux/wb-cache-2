500|$|Usher and will.i.am {{shot the}} video {{the weekend of}} March 6, 2010. The video was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. In an interview with Rap-Up, Mandler said about {{the concept of the}} video: [...] "...The video is a spectacle. It really emphasizes what we love about Usher and the character and the icon that he is, and most importantly, it’s really a video that showcases his superstardom". The video was released on March 30, 2010, on VEVO and AMTV. According to Mandler, the original idea for the video was citing Max Headroom, a fictional artificial intelligence character from 1980s British television and film. The reference is made when Usher is seen on a flickering television {{at the beginning of the}} video. Mandler specified, commenting, [...] "Max Headroom was always in his room," [...] he continued, [...] "this unidentifiable room, '80s shapes. I used that for inspiration." [...] Usher stated that he wanted to do something theatrical and fun, and that while will.i.am. brought the international sound, he wanted to bring the producer into his world, [...] "working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists, but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible." [...] Mandler described the visuals in the clip as [...] "Hitchcock-ian", as well as simply capturing Usher in his element, as he said he wanted the R singer's talent to take over. He further explained, stating, [...] "The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where he does what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> better than anyone else in the world, which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us, the viewer, whether audible or visually, on a journey, not a ride. And, in that, I wanted to create an unpredictability, so one set leads to another and another, and you never know what's gonna happen. Along the way, Usher becomes our guide. We're so focused on him, we don't notice the change. The thing is unfolding little by little, and you can't quite see far enough ahead to know what's gonna come next." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2002, Adam Gilchrist, {{speaking}} at a Carlton (Australian) Football Club luncheon, claimed Muralitharan's action does not comply with the laws of cricket. The Melbourne-based Age newspaper quoted Gilchrist as saying."Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> (chuck), and I say that because, {{if you read the}} laws of the game, there's {{no doubt in my mind}} that he and many others, throughout cricket history have." [...] These comments were made before the doosra controversy, in spite of Muralitharan's action having been cleared by ICC in both 1996 and 1999. For his comment Gilchrist was reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and found guilty of being in breach of ACB rules concerned with [...] "detrimental public comment".|$|E
2500|$|On August 14, 2012, Bowles gave an {{interview}} with The Daily Caller where he asserted {{that he is not}} [...] "backing away" [...] from his praise of Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan. Said Bowles: “I think he's smart. I think he's intellectually curious. I think he is honest, straightforward and sincere. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> have a serious budget out there — it doesn’t mean I agree with it {{by any stretch of the}} imagination. But I'm not going to act like I don't like him or that I don't have some real respect for him." [...] Along with his praise of Ryan he also had criticism of the current government.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, father, this <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not say; {{though it}} is quite probable; {{for the title of}} his aunt is an ancient barony, and those ancient baronies usually became the family name." ...|$|R
2500|$|During an {{interview}} [...] Clarence 'Frogman' Henry, {{one of the}} most popular and respected jazz singers of New Orleans, said: [...] "Jolson? I loved him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> wonders for the blacks and glorified entertainment." ...|$|R
2500|$|In April 2008, Hardwicke, in a turnabout {{from her}} initial underwhelmed {{reaction}} upon first seeing {{a photograph of}} Pattinson, enthused; [...] "The thing that’s great about him is he really does [...] feel like he’s otherworldly. I mean, he doesn’t look like a normal guy. And {{when you read the}} book, you think, ‘Who on the planet can live up to this description?’ But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> He’s just got that chiseled face that photographs exactly like it’s described in the book. When you read about the sculptured cheeks and chiseled jawbone and everything, it’s like, ‘Wow. Did she write this for Rob?" [...] Pattinson, in a detailed interview on how he perceives the character, admitted to having incorporated aspects of Rebel Without a Cause into his portrayal of Edward, assessing; [...] "I guess kind of the thing which I found interesting is that he is essentially the hero of this story but violently denies that he is the hero. Like at every point even when he does heroic things he still thinks that he’s [...] the most ridiculously selfish evil creature around. [...] He refuses to accept Bella’s love for him {{but at the same time}} can’t help but just kind of needs it, which is kind of what the essential storyline is." [...] Appearing at ComicCon in July 2008 while the film was in post-production, Pattinson surmised the Twilight experience as: [...] "bizarre. You kind of know that it is essentially the book. The book has so many obsessive, obsessively loyal fans. It's strange because people just immediately relate you to the character right away rather than you as an actor." [...] Pattinson reprised his role as Edward in all of the Twilight sequels.|$|E

60|$|P.S.--You were {{perfectly}} right about your Uncle Donald's moustache, but I don't {{agree with you}} that it is more his misfortune than his fault. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it on purpose.|$|E
5000|$|... "I trusted Marty {{would choose}} the {{material}} that was most suited for the scene," [...] said De Niro. [...] "He's aware of everything in Chuck's style, in my style. He had to balance all that, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it very well." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>doing</b> {{a record}} with Bruce Springsteen. You know {{he always has}} to do one of those! My two records J.D. has {{produced}} for Nelly so far, he's gonna have some people on them—I won't tell it yet. I don't want to jinx the record.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I by {{no means}} intend that; but I would rather that you should not refer to his {{feelings}} toward me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not quite understand the sort of life that I led while my husband was alive, and that he judged me amiss. Therefore I would have by-gones be by-gones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is he all as {{he should}} be?' asked Miss Cathy, seriously; 'or is he simple: not right? I've {{questioned}} him twice now, and each time he looked so stupid <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not understand me. I can hardly understand him, I'm sure!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, impossible! But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not tell}} many lies," [...] said Nuna apologetically. [...] "I think he {{only does it}} a little. Then he goes on his knees every night before lying down, and every morning when he rises, and speaks to himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{that was}} Marley Bullock. He's abroad somewhere now with nothing a year paid {{quarterly}} to live on. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{a little at}} cards. He'd had {{a good bit of}} money once, but most of it was gone when he came my way." ...|$|E

The Captain is hit pretty bad; but it ain't {{by no means}} desperate accordin' to my way of thinkin'," [...] replied the hopeful Wilkins, who seemed mercifully gifted with an unusual flow of language.|$|R
5000|$|Reminiscing in 1962, Stravinsky {{recalled}} [...] "When I first played Les Noces to Diaghilev ...he wept {{and said}} it was the most beautiful and the most purely Russian creation of our Ballet. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> love Les Noces more than any other work of mine. That is why it is dedicated to him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} you managed him, but liking me has been for him a painful gradual process. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> now," [...] Nanda declared. [...] "He accepts me at last as different--he's trying with me on that basis. He has ended by {{understanding}} that when he talks to me of Granny I can't even imagine her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{knows there}} is {{extensive}} damage; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not {{open his eyes}} to the result, but he will bear it. Never was there a man to whom it came so naturally to live like the fowls of the air, or the lilies of the field, as it does to dear Dick May," [...] said Dr. Spencer, his voice faltering.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he don't quite {{see through}} that. He {{said to me}} a few minutes ago, `Have these men no meat at home, that they come all this long way to get it?' I told him that you had plenty, and then endeavoured to explain your idea of hunting `for fun.' But he shook his head, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not believe you." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, {{in another}} interview, Adams <b>did</b> clarify that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not dislike Williams, stating [...] "I think Robin himself is compassion, {{generosity}} and funny. <b>I</b> like to <b>think</b> that that's who I am, and so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{was the only}} actor I wanted to play me, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a fabulous job." [...] Williams also had actively supported St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for several years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't he, mamma?" [...] And as {{she spoke}} a sad, weary, wobegone smile came over her face,--a smile so sad and piteous that it went to her mother's heart more keenly than would have done any sound of sorrow, any sobs, or wail of grief. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> mean that, mamma. It's no good doubting or fearing any longer. It's all over now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You make me curious; I {{went into}} detail {{because you are}} more {{interested}} than you want to show. Of course, I thought it strange {{that a man who}} spoke good English should relieve his feelings in German when he felt annoyed, and afterward try to convince me that he wasn't a foreigner. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> try and that was the reason he talked so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] said Nick. [...] "I {{have been}} playing piquet with Lamarque {{most of the time}} since I arrived. He is one of the pleasantest men I have met in Louisiana, {{although}} a little taciturn, as you perceive, {{and more than a little}} deaf. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not like Auguste. He seems to have known him in his youth." ...|$|E
60|$|Such is Mannhardt's conclusion. Taken in {{connection}} with his still later essay on Demeter, it really leaves no room for doubt. There, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> 'throw out the child with the bath,' throw the knife after the handle. I do not suppose that Mr. Max Muller ever did quote Mannhardt {{as one of his}} supporters, but such a claim, if really made, would obviously give room for criticism.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't like him? Perhaps you couldn't be {{expected}} to. I didn't when I first came. I had {{just the same}} prejudice as you. He's a very extraordinary man. You saw for yourself that he makes no secret {{of the fact that}} he was in a penitentiary. I do not know that he regrets it or the crimes that led him there. The only complaint he ever made in my hearing was that when he came out his health was impaired. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not know what remorse is. He is completely unmoral. He accepts everything and he accepts himself as well. He's generous and kind." ...|$|E

5000|$|Birighitti {{started his}} career at the AIS before moving to Adelaide United in 2008. He made his first team debut against Queensland Roar on 17 October 2008 helping Adelaide to a 1-0 win.

5000|$|Paak {{was born}} in Oxnard, California in 1986. His mother is half-African American, half Korean.

There was blood in the street. He was arrested, {{and that was the last}} time I saw him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> 14 years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{has also}} been staying at our hotel that Count Sarelli who came one evening to dinner at our house, but he is gone away now. He sat all day in the winter garden reading, and at night he went out with Papa. Miss Naylor says he is unhappy, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not take enough exercise; and O Chris! one day he said to me, 'That is your sister, Mademoiselle, that young lady in the white dress? Does she always wear white dresses?' and I said to him: 'It {{is not always a}} white dress; in the picture, it is green, because the picture is called 'Spring.' But I did not tell him the colours of all your dresses because he looked so tired. Then he said to me: 'She is very charming.' So I tell you this, Chris, because I think you shall like to know. Scruff' has a sore toe; it is because he has eaten too much meat.|$|E
6000|$|It is of death, not life, {{that the}} Escorial preaches, {{and it was}} to eternal death, its pride and gloom, and not life everlasting, that the dark piety of Philip voluntarily, or involuntarily, consecrated the edifice. But it would be doing a wrong {{to one of the}} {{greatest}} achievements of the human will, if one dwelt too much, or too wholly, upon this gloomy ideal. The Escorial has been many times described; I myself forbear with difficulty the attempt to describe it, and I satisfy my longing to set it visibly before the reader by letting an earlier visitor of my name describe it for me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it larger justice than modern observers, because he escapes the cumulative obligation which time has laid upon them to find the subjective rather than the objective fulfilment of its founder's intention in it. At any rate, in March, 1623, James Howell, waiting as secretary of the romantic mission the bursting of the iridescent love-dream which had brought Charles Stuart, Prince of Wales, from England to woo the sister of the Spanish king in Madrid, had leisure to write one of his most delightful [...] "familiar letters" [...] concerning the Escorial to a friend in London.|$|E
6000|$|... "For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert {{me against}} my conscience. And, upon my word, I {{do not think}} Mr. Knightley would be much {{disturbed}} by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and {{if he wanted to}} say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her--his anxiety about her health--his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in love." ...|$|E
