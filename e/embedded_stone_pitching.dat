50|$|The {{section of}} the Etheridge Railway over the Newcastle range and through the Delaney Gorge has more {{earthworks}} {{than the rest of}} the railway. The railway track runs along the north face of the Delaney Gorge and along the bed of the Delaney River for a short distance. The significant elements within this {{section of the}} railway include any <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> bridge piers and abutments, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> culverts, and <b>stone</b> cuttings. A large <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> culvert is located near Native Well, east of Wirra Wirra. A bridge over Starlight Creek, just east of Delaney Gorge, has stone piers and abutments, and a small bridge just east of Wirra Wirra has stone abutments. Bridges constructed with stonework are significant due to their rarity on the Etheridge line.|$|R
50|$|From 1969-71 <b>Stone</b> <b>pitched</b> in {{the minor}} leagues, {{compiling}} a 32-24 record and striking out nearly a batter an inning.|$|R

50|$|Water was {{a problem}} {{throughout}} the Croydon Goldfield and a large dam with a <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> wall was constructed in 1888, by a Mr. Shoemaker (or Schumacher). Even so the Homeward Bound battery could not crush that year.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the stone}} {{is named after}} a Madoc, nothing is known of the Madoc {{referred}} to. The base of stone is surrounded by deeply <b>embedded</b> <b>stones</b> and this may mark the grave itself.|$|R
50|$|The stone-pitched ford crosses Byfield Creek in a north-south {{direction}} at {{a bearing}} of 20?. It has a rectangular frame of timber sleepers fitted together and secured by bolts, presumably iron coach bolts, {{and filled with}} <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> to create a causeway across the creek.|$|R
50|$|Technological {{features}} {{exist in}} the form of different road surfaces used to solve various problems encountered during construction. Surfaces include macadamised surfacing; corduroy surfacing exists in two areas, 560 metres and 765 metres west of Devil's Elbow; <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> exists in a number of places, many in excellent condition.|$|R
50|$|The water {{race is a}} {{rare and}} {{uncommon}} example of its type and is the longest <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> water race recorded in North Queensland. It is unusual in its size, ranging to over 2m in height in places and with a total extent of up to 10 km in length.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{features}} associated with the road, including stone extraction quarries, side cuttings, a system of catch drains and culverts occurring along the entire length of the roadway. Catch drains average about 50-75 centimetres in width and 20-25 centimetres in depth. Some of the drains are <b>stone</b> <b>pitched.</b>|$|R
500|$|Part of the village, {{including}} about [...] of the mound, {{have been}} subject to submergence and river erosion caused by the Ganga river.

60|$|We passed on, {{and emerged}} beyond the village, {{still on the}} {{descending}} great high-road that was mended with loose <b>stones</b> <b>pitched</b> on it. This wasn't good enough. Besides, {{we were out of}} the sun, and the place being at a considerable elevation, it was very cold. So we turned back, to climb quickly uphill into the sun.|$|R
50|$|Most of Gallop Botanical Reserve has open sclerophyll {{vegetation}} {{consisting of}} Melaleuca spp, Eucalypts spp (Bloodwood), Cooktown Ironwood and various grasses. The Cooktown Botanic Gardens, consisting of 3.5 hectares within the Gallop Botanic Reserve, is vegetated with similar species of native trees, but interspersed with the indigenous vegetation are formal lawned areas, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> waterways and planted exotic species.|$|R
50|$|Part of the village, {{including}} about 10 m of the mound, {{have been}} subject to submergence and river erosion caused by the Ganga river. The Nonia tola in the village was in imminent danger of getting submerged. In 2010, protection of the part of the village exposed to erosion was envisaged by way of <b>stone</b> <b>pitching.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle yards, loading banks, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> {{bridges and}} culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes (for refilling the sand-dispensing units {{in front of}} train wheels), water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations and along the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth are significant.|$|R

6000|$|... "Good dog; fetch it!" [...] Blink {{backed into}} the soldiers, who, bending down, {{took her by}} head tail, threw her into the pond, and {{encouraged}} her on with small <b>stones</b> <b>pitched</b> at the hat. Having taken the plunge, the intelligent animal waded boldly to the hat, and endeavoured by barking and making little rushes at it with her nose, to induce it to return to shore.|$|R
50|$|A boiler and a {{compressor}} {{are located in}} association with shafts and workings at {{the western end of}} the place. Adjacent are the remains of two small buildings constructed with flagstone surfaces and <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> wall sections. The purpose of these structures is not evident, although they may have been lock-up stores. The camp comprises the remains of a corrugated iron shed and a stove and fridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle yards, loading banks, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> {{bridges and}} culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes, water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations {{and along the}} Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth all demonstrate the principal characteristics of a railway line that was used for mining and pastoral purposes.|$|R
50|$|A deep, rock-cut ditch {{surrounded}} the castle grounds, which were dry except when the River Ewenny flooded the area during high tide. While the ditch that enclosed the castle's inner bailey filled at high tide, the flow was regulated by an <b>embedded</b> <b>stone</b> wall that blocked rising waters {{so that the}} interior of the castle did not flood.|$|R
50|$|The railway {{stations}} at Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth and {{the route}} of the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth, including surviving railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, loading banks, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> bridges and culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes, water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure, are important surviving evidence of the efforts of the Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company to supply copper ore to its smelters at Chillagoe.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} is complex in design {{in terms of}} contours and fall. Various sections of the <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> wall show evidence of great effort in terms of shaping and fitting locally sourced stone to produce flat wall surfaces. Sections near the Tate River feature early examples of the concreting of stones {{to keep them in}} place as well as large sections blasted out of the bedrock to form the race.|$|R
50|$|A datestone is {{typically}} an <b>embedded</b> <b>stone</b> {{with the date}} of engraving and other information carved into it. They are not considered a very reliable source for dating a house, as instances of old houses being destroyed and rebuilt (with the old date stones intact) have been reported, or may in some cases be the date of a renovation or alteration.|$|R
50|$|A {{natural sand}} deposit on the {{southern}} bank of the creek is encroaching onto the crossing, and plant shoots are growing between the <b>stone</b> <b>pitching.</b> The log at the southern aspect is exposed for only a small portion, less than 50 cm, the remainder being covered by encroaching sand deposits, up to an approximate depth of 20 cm. Sediment deposits currently extend to approximately 4.6m {{from the point of}} the southern sleeper into the fording.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Rustic Bridge" [...] {{was opened}} in 1915 {{and was one}} of Taronga Zoo's {{earliest}} landscape features. It was the main way in which visitors could cross the natural gully that it spans. Early photographs show it as a romantic pathway secluded by plantings. The rustic effect was created by <b>embedding</b> <b>stones</b> in the wall and like the aquarium, its design was reminiscent of Italian grottoes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>pitched</b> {{for four}} MLB teams between 1971 and 1981. In 1980, {{he was the}} AL Cy Young Award winner, and an American League All Star, {{finishing}} {{the season with a}} record of 25-7. He was WGN-TV's color commentator for Chicago Cubs broadcasts between 1983 and 2004, missing a couple of seasons late in his tenure due to health problems. He worked in radio until 2009, when he became the color commentator for Chicago White Sox television broadcasts.|$|R
5000|$|The east (front) facade is five bays wide, {{asymmetrical}} {{but with}} a centrally located front entrance. The windows are in heavy mortise and tenon frames. In the front wall near the north end is a large <b>embedded</b> <b>stone</b> tablet explaining that the house [...] "suffered no injury" [...] when British troops burned Kingston on October 16, 1777, {{and that it was}} home to the van Steenburgh family for two centuries.|$|R
