So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

500|$|The video caused [...] "a veritable stir in {{the music}} world" [...] because [...] "Boutonnat cast [...] {{as a kind of}} provocative Lolita figure". As she wears a {{transparent}} nightgown in the music video, some French television channels censored it. It was first aired on the French television programme Clip Clap in a shortened version. In an interview, Farmer deplored the censorship, saying: [...] " [...] has shocked many people. I find <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> stupid. Jacques Dutronc said [...] "Merde in France" [...] and everyone went into raptures. As for me, I simply say that I enjoyed the controversy".|$|E
500|$|Cuomo remarked, [...] "I {{came out}} of <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> angry. But ironically, it {{inspired}} me to write another song." [...] Jacknife Lee produced the track with the band in early 2008 in what was {{the third and final}} recording session for the album. The many references to popular culture in the song are said to be a [...] "statement of defiance" [...] according to Internet reviewer David Ritter, who later describes it to be an [...] "anti-anthem anthem" [...] that opens up a [...] "broad space for critical exploration {{of what it means to}} be an [...] aging band in the major label system".|$|E

I suppose that's because we'd been away from those characters for two or three years. It's one of our favorite shows, the American Office."

Waring felt that the pair would always have a [...] "spark between them" [...] but any romance between them ends when Cindy discovers that Darren has become a father and is engaged to Nancy. She felt that Cindy [...] "gets over <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> quickly" [...] but Cindy [...] "has her moments with Darren" [...] as Darren is [...] "the only person who [...] lets her guard down in front of.

500|$|The song {{has been}} {{referred}} to as an [...] "indecent behavior anthem" [...] due to its lyrical content. Ken Capobianco of the Boston Globe said that [...] "Say Aah" [...] was one of the [...] "popping tracks" [...] which parent album Ready was built around. Commenting on the song's lyrics, Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy stated that, [...] "Its over-abundance of hooks ('we don't buyyyy no drinks at the bar' being a personal favorite) makes <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> hard to dislike. And the verse from Brooklyn's Fabolous will bring in even the most hardened of fun-haters." [...] Vibe called the song [...] "the official birthday song of the year", claiming that it was better than Jeremih's [...] "Birthday Sex". The song was nominated for [...] "Viewers' Choice" [...] and [...] "Best Collaboration" [...] at the 2010 BET Awards.|$|E

500|$|The band {{continued}} its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for Vitalogy, but {{was surprised that}} virtually no other bands joined in. Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States {{for the next three}} years. Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> much killed us, killed our career." [...] In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young, whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes. Two songs from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: [...] "I Got Id" [...] and [...] "Long Road". These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam {{in the form of the}} 1995 EP, Merkin Ball.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} she was cast as Lana, Kreuk had no idea who the {{character}} was in Superman lore. Her uncle, who owned a comic book shop, filled her in on the details and she learned more from the producers. Kreuk realized that the character in the comics and her character on the show were two different people. As a result, Kreuk learns about the development of Lana as Lana is learning in the show, just as Welling does with Clark Kent. When asked if her being cast as a traditionally red haired character caused outcry from fans, Kreuk believes that whoever did [...] "got over <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> fast". By season three, Kreuk had decided to [...] "invest" [...] herself less in her character, as she felt that her character's ultimate development was entirely {{in the hands of the}} producers. She no longer became frustrated when the producers had Lana doing things that Kreuk felt were out of character, instead trusting that they would find the right direction for the character.|$|E
500|$|Lego Racers {{gameplay}} {{received a}} mixed reaction from critics. Charla called creating and testing cars {{a lot of}} fun, especially because the way a car is built has [...] "a major effect on how it controls", and IGN's reviewer for the PC version found that unlocking new bricks in the circuit mode for use in car customization is addictive. However, Stahl called the game's construction system unfriendly, stating that the player is [...] "better off just sticking {{with one of the}} default vehicles". Imperio said that handling the cars is [...] "surprisingly tight", calling the N64 control scheme intuitive. Conversely, Charla found that most of the cars feel top-heavy, and stated that the racing is awful. IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the power up system, calling <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> cool, as well as stating that the Power Plus bricks add [...] "a new strategy to the game", but Stahl called the system [...] "terribly lame". Reviewers also criticised the game's multiplayer features, with IGN's PC reviewer calling the split screen mode simple, and an Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer stating that the [...] "lack of multiplayer options" [...] hurts Lego Racers replay value.|$|E

500|$|When Howard J. Savage of the Carnegie Foundation issued [...] "Bulletin 33" [...] in January 1930 criticizing {{recruitment}} and subsidization of athletes, Aigler challenged {{the fairness of}} the report. Aigler charged that Savage had [...] "no intention of being fair and accurate" [...] and accused Savage of questionable tactics in sending Michigan's president a report of conditions different from the report in the bulletin. Aigler also accused Savage of removing letters from the files of the athletic department to which he was allowed full access. He also argued that the report reflected eastern bias: [...] "In a number of places in the Bulletin the so-called Western Conference (now the Big Nine) is referred to and, curiously, almost always with a sort of half veiled sneer. The truth apparently is that the Bulletin was written {{from the point of view}} of the Eastern athletic man who has <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> firmly fixed in mind that, athletically, things are pretty raw in the territory generally West of the Alleghenies." [...] Aigler later issued a 31-page report on athletic conditions at Michigan, charging the Carnegie Foundation with [...] "muck-raking." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot on March 15, 2010 in the deserts of Lancaster, California, {{directed}} by Hype Williams.

I met Hype in a freakin' airport...and {{it happened to be}} a week before I wanted to shoot a video. I told him the idea. Of course, I had to let Baby and Slim know and hope they would understand my expensive taste. It all came together." [...] It's just beautiful — the clothes, everything. The ambiance..It's for all the girls that like to play dress-up. They're gonna love this one...we get on the walkie-talkie, like, 'Mayday! Mayday!' It's really fashion and beauty shots, and we're acting like we're doing something important. We wanted to make <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> in the dirt. We wanted to have a very crazy contrast. I didn't want to do everything clean. I like the dirt. All that pink stuff looks even prettier in the dirt." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Yolande Geralds, who also directed the clip for Songz's previous single. [...] "I Invented Sex." [...] The video was filmed on October 7, 2009. Wynter Gordon, DJ Clue as well as Jessica White performing {{the owner of the}} Party make appearances in the video. Stills from the clip were released on the following day, October 8, 2009. A combination video was released for the dual clips of [...] "Say Aah" [...] and [...] "I Invented Sex" [...] and the videos were also released separately. Songz confirmed to MTV News in November 2009 that the latter would be a continuation of the previous. On the video, Songz said that he wanted the video to be [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "adult" [...] in which everyone had fun. He further explained, [...] "The song speaks on more so a club atmosphere, but the video is more lofty — sexy women all over the place, adults having fun. This one lady in particular, she's representing the independent women without taking it over the top. She's got her own. She takes me back to her crib — so we invent sex together." [...] In a review of the video, calling the song itself [...] "ballerific", Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy said, [...] "the video keeps <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> grown in sexy", commenting the choice of button down shirts as attire and commending Fabolous's part, which he said, [...] "has a very plain-spoken feel to it, and because his blue-framed shades are matching his shirt.".|$|E

500|$|Credit {{issues were}} {{becoming}} more critical, however. Around {{the time the}} buyout was made public, Moody's and S both reduced Enron's rating to just one notch above junk status. Were the company's rating to fall below investment-grade, its ability to trade would be severely limited {{if there was a}} reduction or elimination of its credit lines with competitors. In a conference call, S affirmed that, were Enron not to be bought, S would reduce its rating to low BB or high B, ratings noted as being within junk status. Additionally, many traders had limited their involvement with Enron, or stopped doing business altogether, fearing more bad news. Watson again attempted to re-assure, attesting at a presentation to investors that there was [...] "nothing wrong with Enron's business". He also acknowledged that remunerative steps (in the form of more stock options) would have to be taken to redress the animosity of many Enron employees towards management after it was revealed that Lay and other officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock during the months prior to the crisis. The situation was not helped by the disclosure that Lay, his [...] "reputation in tatters", stood to receive a payment of $60 million as a change-of-control fee subsequent to the Dynegy acquisition, while many Enron employees had seen their retirement accounts, which were based largely on Enron stock, ravaged as the price decreased 90% in a year. An official at a company owned by Enron stated [...] "We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 or $900,000. <b>It</b> <b>pretty</b> much wiped out every employee's savings plan." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1996, Björk {{released}} the [...] "often-delayed" [...] remix project Telegram, which contained reworkings of several songs from Post, with her voice re-recorded. Telegram {{has been described}} as [...] "effectively a completely new album". Author Mark Pytlik writes, [...] "Promises of a Post remix album had been circulating since the release of [...] "Army of Me" [...] in April 1995. To compensate, Björk announced the release of a string of 12" [...] remixes beginning in June, limited to only 1,000 copies each. Producers and musicians featured on Telegram include: Dillinja, Eumir Deodato, LFO, and Graham Massey, among others; Björk only remixed [...] "You've Been Flirting Again" [...] herself. The album also contains a new composition, [...] "My Spine", a collaboration with British percussionist Evelyn Glennie. According to CMJ New Music Monthly, musically the album contains [...] "a real and surprising taste for recent trends in dance music". Regarding the release, Björk said: [...] "It's like the core of Post. That's why it's funny to call it a remix album, it's like the opposite. [...] Telegram is more stark, naked. Not trying to make <b>it</b> <b>pretty</b> or peaceable for the ear. Just a record I would buy myself". The singer also declared that the release of Telegram meant {{the end of an era}} consisting of Debut and Post. At the release of the compilation, Björk was already relocating to Spain to produce her next studio album solely by herself. The compilation was well received by music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, [...] "Telegram works as an excellent introduction to techno for alternative pop fans unsure of where to begin exploring." [...] Douglas Wolk of CMJ New Music Monthly felt the music of Telegram was [...] "actually better than Post", describing the tracks as, [...] "well-considered reworkings". The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album three and a half stars, and stated it, [...] "shed new light on the songs". Telegram spent five weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at the 66th spot. In the UK, it peaked at the 59th spot, spending two weeks in the albums chart.|$|E
