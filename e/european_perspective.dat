40|$|With the {{international}} dance community becoming increasingly globalised, how do Western European perceptions of folk/ traditional dance pervade and shape {{the field of}} dance? This paper will discuss Western <b>European</b> <b>perspectives</b> towards traditional and folk dance and investigate the origins of such perspectives, if they do indeed exist. In doing so the reasoning of Western <b>European</b> <b>perspectives</b> will be examined, considered and questioned alongside that of non-Western <b>European</b> <b>perspectives.</b> The thesis is compiled {{from a wide range}} of textual sources that explore Western European world views in relation to non-Western <b>European</b> <b>perspectives</b> to argue that such perspectives do, to a large extent, shape and pervade the wider field of dance...|$|R

500|$|Once Kubrick was {{confident}} in the overall staging of a scene, and felt the actors were prepared, he would then develop the visual aspects, including camera and lighting placement. Walker believes that Kubrick was one of [...] "very few film directors competent to instruct their lighting photographers in the precise effect they want". Baxter believes that although American, Kubrick was heavily influenced by his ancestry and always possessed a <b>European</b> <b>perspective</b> to filmmaking, particularly the Austro-Hungarian empire and his admiration for Johann Ophuls and Richard Strauss.|$|E
500|$|Production {{had begun}} by February 1937, under Balink's {{direction}} {{and with the}} Wongs as cinematographers, only to be interrupted by the relocation of ANIF's offices. Filming had begun by May of that year. Sources conflict as to whether Franken was involved: Biran wrote that Franken had been left {{in charge of the}} studio's documentaries, while the American film scholar Karl G. Heider recorded Franken as co-directing the film. As opposed to The Teng Chun, who aimed his films at lower-class audiences, Balink aimed his film at educated native Indonesians, attempting to show them not from a <b>European</b> <b>perspective</b> but as they viewed themselves. According to Said, this arose as a reaction to [...] failure and resulted in a less ethnological approach. Terang Boelan was shot in black-and-white using highly flammable nitrate film at Cilincing in Batavia, Merak Beach in Banten, and Tanjong Katong in Singapore. The use of nitrate film may have been a factor in the film's later loss.|$|E

The resolution said that under the effective control of the occupying power there had been ethnic cleansing and forced demographic changes in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and Russia bore responsibility for human rights violations.

2500|$|With {{the onset}} of the British Raj, the {{colonization}} of India by the British, there also started a Hindu renaissance in the 19th century, which profoundly changed the understanding of Hinduism in both India and the west. Indology as an academic discipline of studying Indian culture from a <b>European</b> <b>perspective</b> was established in the 19th century, led by scholars such as Max Müller and John Woodroffe. They brought Vedic, Puranic and Tantric literature and philosophy to Europe and the United States. Western orientalist searched for the [...] "essence" [...] of the Indian religions, discerning this in the Vedas, and meanwhile creating the notion of [...] "Hinduism" [...] as a unified body of religious praxis and the popular picture of 'mystical India'. This idea of a Vedic essence was taken over by Hindu reform movements as the Brahmo Samaj, which was supported for a while by the Unitarian Church, together with the ideas of Universalism and Perennialism, the idea that all religions share a common mystic ground. This [...] "Hindu modernism", with proponents like Vivekananda, Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan, became central in the popular understanding of Hinduism.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} {{minimally}} invasive surgery the first laparoscopic surgeons were smiled at and the surgical community {{did not believe in}} this new technology. Today it is the gold standard for most surgeries. Starting with a simple appendectomy, partial kidney resections and partial liver resections, etc. The laparoscopic approach is expanding. The image quality, the possibility of imaging the patient in the surgical position and the guidance of the instruments facilitate this approach.(Efficacy of DynaCT for surgical navigation during complex laparoscopic surgery: an initial experience. Partial resection of the kidney, leaving as much healthy tissue, meaning kidney function to the patient has been described some time ago (Nephron sparing surgery for renal tumors: indications, techniques and outcomes.). The challenges the surgeons face is the loss of natural 3D vision and tactile sensing. Through small ports he/she has to rely on the images provided by the endoscope and is unable to feel the tissue. In a hybrid operating room the anatomy can be updated and imaged in real time. 3D images can be fused and/or overlaid on live fluoroscopy or the endoscope. (Real-time image guidance in laparoscopic liver surgery: first clinical experience with a guidance system based on intraoperative CT imaging.) Crucial anatomy like vessels or a tumor can be avoided and complications reduced. Further investigations are under trial at the moment.
