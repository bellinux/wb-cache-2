40|$|Abstract. Rapid {{expansion}} in the <b>digitization</b> <b>of</b> <b>image</b> and image collections has vastly increased the numbers of images available to scholars and researchers through electronic means. This research review will familiarize the reader with current research applicable {{to the development of}} image retrieval systems and provides additional material for exploring the topic further, both in print and online. The discussion will cover several broad areas, among them classification and indexing systems used for describing image collections and research initiatives into image access focusing on image attributes, users, queries, tasks, and cognitive aspects of searching. Prospects for the future of image access, including an outline of future research initiatives, are discussed. Further research in each of these areas will provide basic data which will inform and enrich image access system design and will hopefully provide a richer, more flexible, and satisfactory environment for searching for and discovering images. Harnessing the true power of the digital image environment will only be possible when image retrieval systems are coherently designed from principles derived from the fullest range of applicable disciplines, rather than from isolated or fragmented perspectives.

Chosen images are displayed at the wedding banquet for the guests to admire and later used as decoration {{in the house of}} newlyweds. This visual phenomenon is interesting in that people actively take part in the creation and consumption of visual commodity and it is connected to marriage, a rite of passage. From the cultural perspective, this bridal photography, dominated by the photo studios, even reversed the passive role of recording to actively changing the wedding culture in Taiwan. By combining services like wedding planning and honeymoon travel package, wedding industry is a combination of artistic work and profitable business. This thesis takes a deeper look into bridal images created in the 21 st century and attempts to analyze the meaning by applying semiotic analysis to specific images.

Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system retrieves the similar images {{from a large}} database for a given input query image. Today, we find various methods for implementation of CBIR which uses low-level image features like color, texture and shape. In this paper, a global image properties based CBIR using a feed-forward backpropagation neural network is proposed. At first, the neural network is trained about the features <b>of</b> <b>images</b> in the database. The image features considered here are color histogram as color descriptor, GLCM (gray level co-occurrence matrix) as texture descriptor and edge histogram as edge descriptor. The training is carried out using backpropagation algorithm. This trained when presented with a query image retrieves and displays the images which are relevant and similar to query from the database.

40|$|Social aggregations of {{fish are}} {{extremely}} common in nature. Pitcher (1983) defines a social aggregation of fish as a shoal, {{with a highly}} polarized shoal constituting a school. The ultimate causes of fish shoaling have been extensively studied and are well established, with the main causes being protection from predators and enhanced foraging ability. The proximate mechanisms by which groups are maintained are less well understood. Several models exist that examine these decision rules. A common theme to these models is {{the existence of a}} region at large nearest-neighbour distances (NND), where an individual will move towards its nearest neighbour, and a region of repulsion at small NND, where the individual will move away from its nearest neighbour. Recent models (Gueron et al., 1996; Couzin and Krause, 2003) suggest that shoaling decisions may not be instantaneous, instead being hierarchical as fish assess {{the presence or absence of}} one or more neighbours in zones of attraction, repulsion and neutrality.
