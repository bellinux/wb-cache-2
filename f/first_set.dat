40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} focused on the process of {{computing}} <b>First</b> <b>Sets.</b> The <b>First</b> <b>Sets</b> are used to build structures which control a syntax analyser (also known as parser). Three methods of creating <b>First</b> <b>Sets</b> were compared in terms of execution time. The first method is known sequential algorithm and the author’s own methods are concurrent computing sets for each non-terminal symbol (called the CEN method) and concurrent computing sets for each production (called the CEP method). These methods have been tested on personal computer. Three programming languages (including the C language) were used in the research. The results and the analysis of calculations allow the author to hypothesise that the problem of computing <b>First</b> <b>Sets</b> is hard to concurrence...|$|R
