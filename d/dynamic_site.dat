50|$|The special {{structure}} {{found in}} the CNS that allows for multiple inputs is the dendritic spine, the highly <b>dynamic</b> <b>site</b> of excitatory synapses. This morphological dynamism {{is due to the}} specific regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which in turn allows for regulation of synapse formation. Dendritic spines exhibit three main morphologies: filopodia, thin spines, and mushroom spines. The filopodia play a role in synaptogenesis through initiation of contact with axons of other neurons. Filopodia of new neurons tend to associate with multiply synapsed axons, while the filopodia of mature neurons tend to sites devoid of other partners. The dynamism of spines allows for the conversion of filopodia into the mushroom spines that are the primary sites of glutamate receptors and synaptic transmission.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{the surface}} ground motion that occurs during an {{earthquake}} in ground sections having different topographic forms has been examined with {{one and two}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>site</b> response analyses. One-dimensional analyses were undertaken using the Equivalent-Linear Earthquake Response Analysis (EERA) program based on the equivalent linear analysis principle and the Deepsoil program which is able to make both equivalent linear and nonlinear analyses and two-dimensional analyses using the Plaxis 8. 2 software. The viscous damping parameters used in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>site</b> response analyses undertaken with the Plaxis 8. 2 software were obtained using the DeepSoil program.

The analysis results showed that the characteristics of the surface ground motion change in relation to the varying local soil conditions and land topography...|$|E

30|$|In {{the seismic}} design and/or {{assessment}} of many critical structures, like {{nuclear power plants}} (NPPs), the seismic input is defined from a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) as a uniform hazard response spectrum (UHRS) at the rock outcrop.

The <b>dynamic</b> <b>site</b> response analysis is usually implemented using an equivalent-linear (EQL) approach through methodologies based either on time-histories or, more recently, random vibration theory (RVT).
