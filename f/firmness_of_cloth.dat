40|$|Tomato fruit {{firmness}} is a polygenetic trait and {{depends on}} firmness components pericarp thickness, <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> epidermis and <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> flash. The accumulation of favourable traits ratio for each component (towards {{the increase of}} expression) the fruit firmness can be increased. This paper deals with aspects <b>of</b> increasing fruit <b>firmness</b> by increasing <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> epidermis and thickness of pericarp. By using genotypes with rin (ripening inhibitor) gene, {{we were able to}} accomplish great <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> fruits, especially <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> flash. The expression of these traits cause the asynchronization of maturing process so the fruits do not over mature or soften. Genetic effects have been evaluated by researching the average values <b>of</b> fruit <b>firmness</b> in six diallel parent lines (D- 150, S- 49, S- 35, H- 52, Kg-z and SP- 109) and progeny (P 1, P 2, F 1, F 2, BC 1 and BC 2) by applying additive dominant model with three and six parameters (Mather and Jinks, 1982). Mean values <b>of</b> fruit <b>firmness</b> for parents and progeny were significantly different. <b>Firmness</b> <b>of</b> fruits is a trait influenced first of all by additive gene since they were found in all researched combinations. Epystatic gene effect was important in inheriting process for all three two-gene interactions. The stabile duplicate type of epystsase was found, which in this case reduces the unfavourable effects of dominant genes of parents with soft fruits. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Firmness</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{important}} factor for determination of tomatoes quality. Distructive measurement <b>of</b> tomato <b>firmness</b> is one <b>of</b> the evaluation methods <b>of</b> fruit <b>firmness.</b> The Universal Instron is most common used machine for measurement of most adeqequate fruit firmness. During destructive measurement <b>of</b> <b>firmness</b> considedation <b>of</b> force or deformation values as a <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> fruits could give incorrect result and taking epicarp strength over deformation values is more accurate to concern the <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> tomato. Two <b>of</b> possible minimum <b>firmness</b> limits were suggested for tomato fruits at the point of retail marketing or using at home. All 100 % marketable fruits should have firmness values above 1. 45 N mm- 1 but the Instron values of the tomato mainly consuming stage at home, should have higher than the 1. 28 N mm- 1. The <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> tomatoes is closely assosiated with acceptability levels of the fruits. Subjective evaluation scores based on finger feel highly and positively correlated 0. 96 and 0. 98 with epicarp strength and firmness values, respectively. A negative and highly significant correlation (- 0. 97) exists between deformation values of subjective evaluatoin scores of Liberto variety, but this correlation slightly lower for Criterium and that was- 0. 89. Cuting the skin of mature green tomatoes did not affect on firmness but removing the skin highly effect on it.

40|$|The {{red color}} of the tomato fruit during {{ripening}} {{is due to the}} presence lycopene, a compound known for its antioxidant property. This compound is influenced by temperature, ethylene and 1 -Methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) treatment. It was believed that ethylene application at chilling temperature could help increase the amount of lycopene content of tomato fruits. In addition, application of 1 -MCP was assumed to reduce the action of ethylene on production of lycopene content and decrease loss <b>of</b> <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> tomato fruit under chilling temperature. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to see the effect of ethylene and 1 -MCP treatment on color and <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> tomato fruit under different storage temperatures. A tomato variety (cv. Rotarno) grown under greenhouse condition harvested at red and breaker stage was stored at 4, 8 and 20 °C to assess color and firmness. Tomato fruits were treated by ethylene (85. 7 ppm) and 1 -MCP (2. 9 ppm) gases starting from the first day of storage throughout the experimentation period. The color and <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> the fruits were measured by pigment analyzer and Zwick respectively. Results showed that there was significant difference in color value of ethylene treated breaker stage tomato. 1 -MCP treatment reduced the color value of tomato fruits stored at 20 °C more than the fruits stored at 4 and 8 °C. However, 1 -MCP treatment helped to reduce loss <b>of</b> <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> the fruits. We conclude that external ethylene application on red tomato fruits stored at chilling temperature generally has no effect on the subsequent accumulation of lycopene or to maintain the loss of accumulated lycopene during chilling storage. However, external ethylene treatment on breaker stage tomatoes helps for red color development. In addition, 1 -MCP treatment helps to reduce loss <b>of</b> <b>firmness</b> <b>of</b> the fruits...|$|R
