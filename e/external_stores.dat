5|$|The F-22 {{is among}} {{only a few}} {{aircraft}} that can supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel-inefficient afterburners; it can intercept targets which subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The Raptor's high operating altitude is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters {{due to a lack}} of aerodynamic drag from <b>external</b> <b>stores.</b> The F-22's structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and composites comprise 39% and 24% of the aircraft's structural weight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The flutter {{analysis}} of a wing with an <b>external</b> <b>store</b> is presented. Because of the <b>external</b> <b>store,</b> the concentrated store mass is combined into the governing equations which are obtained using the extended Hamilton’s principle. Dirac function is used to precisely consider the location and properties of the <b>external</b> <b>store.</b> The k method {{is used to calculate}} the flutter velocity. The effects of store parameters such as store mass and inertia on the flutter velocity are investigated...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work is to study the effect of an <b>external</b> <b>store</b> on a subsonic fighter aircraft. Generally most modern fighter aircrafts are designed with an <b>external</b> <b>store</b> installation. In this study, a subsonic fighter aircraft model has been manufactured using a computer numerical control machine {{for the purpose of}} studying the effect of the aerodynamic interference of the <b>external</b> <b>store</b> on the flow around the aircraft wing. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation was also carried out on the same configuration. Both the CFD and the wind tunnel testing were carried out at a Reynolds number 1. 86 × 10 5 to ensure that the aerodynamic characteristic can certify that the aircraft will not be face any difficulties in its stability and controllability. Both the experiments and the simulation were carried out at the same Reynolds number in order to verify each other. In the CFD simulation, a commercial CFD code was used to simulate the interference and aerodynamic characteristics of the model. Subsequently, the model together with an <b>external</b> <b>store</b> was tested in a low speed wind tunnel with a test section sized 0. 45 m× 0. 45 m. Measured and computed results for the two-dimensional pressure distribution were satisfactorily comparable. There is only a 19 % deviation between pressure distribution measured in wind tunnel testing and the result predicted by the CFD. The result shows that the effect of the external storage is only significant on the lower surface of the wing and almost negligible on the upper surface of the wing. Aerodynamic interference due to the <b>external</b> <b>store</b> was most evident on the lower surface of the wing and almost negligible on the upper surface at a low angle of attack. In addition, the area of influence on the wing surface by the store interference increased as the airspeed increased...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{highlights}} the importance of looking at individual differences in working memory in order to understand complex social perceptual processes such as the construction of mental clique models from pairwise sentiment relations. We found that working memory resources constituted a limiting factor in the integrative perception of sentiment patterns (Experiment 1). Low but not high-resource individuals' performance was enhanced by use of an <b>external</b> memory <b>store</b> (Experiment 2). Finally, participants whose working memory capacity was experimentally reduced showed high correlations between use of the <b>external</b> <b>store</b> and performance. This was not the case for those whose working memory capacity was not manipulated (Experiment 3).

25|$|The first 100 Tempest Vs were {{fitted with}} 20mm (.79in) Hispano Mk.IIs with long barrels which {{projected}} {{ahead of the}} wing leading edges and were covered by short fairings; later production Tempest Vs switched to the short-barrelled Hispano Mk.Vs, with muzzles flush with the leading edges. Early Tempest Vs used Typhoon-style 34 by 11 inch (83.4 by 28cm) five-spoke wheels, but most had smaller 30 by 9 inch (76.2 by 22.9cm) four-spoke wheels.

Later versions of the Islander offer various options, including enlarged bay doors, 3-bladed scimitar propellers, low drag fairings, modern interior, ergonomic leather seating, in-flight entertainment systems, and alternative seat arrangements; underwing hardpoints can also be installed for carrying pod, spray booms and other <b>external</b> <b>stores.</b>|$|E

The lack of the infinite (or dynamically growing) <b>external</b> <b>store</b> (seen at Turing machines) can be understood by replacing its role with Gödel numbering techniques: the fact that each register holds a natural number allows the possibility of representing a complicated thing (e.g. a sequence, or a matrix etc.) by an appropriate huge natural number — unambiguity of both representation and interpretation can be established by number theoretical foundations of these techniques.|$|R
25|$|During early 1943, a {{production}} {{line for the}} Tempest V was established in Hawker's Langley facility, alongside the existing manufacturing line for the Hawker Hurricane.

On 21 June 1943, the first production Tempest V, JN729, rolled off the production line and its maiden flight was conducted by test pilot Bill Humble. Several early production aircraft were used for experimental purposes; a number of these underwent extensive service trials at Boscombe Down including clearances to be fitted with <b>external</b> <b>stores,</b> including 500lb (227kg) and 1,000lb (454kg) bombs and 3in (76.2mm) RP-3 rockets, although few Tempest Vs deployed such ordnance operationally during the War.

25|$|Another Sea Hawk F1, WF157, was {{developed}} into a prototype for the FB 3 standard, the initial fighter bomber variant of the type and later most common of the Sea Hawk variants.

On 13 March 1954, the first production Sea Hawk FB 3, WF280, made its first flight.

Internal weapons carriage eliminates drag from <b>external</b> <b>stores</b> and enables higher performance compared to external carriage, as well as enhancing stealth. Advanced engines and aerodynamics enable the Su-57 to supercruise, sustained supersonic flight without using afterburners. Combined with a high fuel load, the fighter has a supersonic range of over 1,500km, {{more than twice that}} of the Su-27. In the Su-57's design, Sukhoi addressed what it considered to be the F-22's limitations, such as its inability to use thrust vectoring to induce roll and yaw moments and a lack of space for weapons bays between the engines, and complications for stall recovery if thrust vectoring fails.|$|E
