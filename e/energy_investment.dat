25|$|Social insect {{males are}} {{often seen as}} mating machines, with an undiscriminating eagerness to mate. However, males {{encounter}} costs of unsuccessful mating in terms of <b>energy</b> <b>investment.</b> Therefore, P. dominula males are able to recognize female castes and preferentially choose reproductive females to workers, regardless of health or age. Males are able to differentiate castes through perceiving differences in chemical signals and physiological status. While males are able to discriminate between castes, they are not capable of discriminating between health, as males showed a strong preference for gynes, both healthy and parasite-castrated, compared to workers, because males distinguish females by CHC profiles, which are very similar between healthy and unhealthy gynes. Therefore, males {{are not able to}} evaluate the true reproductive potential of the females they encounter.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} fertile {{individuals}} produced by colonies of N. corniger varies widely. Mature colonies with between 50,000 and 400,000 infertile workers generally produce between 5,000 and 25,000 alates. In some years large colonies {{do not produce}} a fertile brood. Alate nymphs develop through five instars and spend between 5 and 8 months within the colony before leaving to mate. When the alates are mature they typically account for 35% of the colony's biomass. More males than females are produced from each colony but because females are heavier (by between 20 and 40%) the <b>energy</b> <b>investment</b> in each sex is similar. Newly formed colonies tend to have multiple queens and kings all {{living in the same}} royal chamber. Slightly older colonies tend to consist of multiple queens (up to 33) but only one king, in these cases the species can be considered polygynous. Over several years the species turns to being monogamous, having only one queen and one king. Being polygynous {{in the early stages of}} the colony is advantageous as it allows the colony to produce many workers in a short period of time and allows the production of female alates more quickly than if they were monogamous from the start.|$|E

25|$|Oftentimes in {{the natural}} history of a species, large body size confers {{reproductive}} advantage. This raises the question in Hemipepsis ustulata: why do smaller wasps persist? Generation after generation, there is a wide size variation among these tarantula hawks. Wasps do not grow after metamorphosis, so smaller animals are at a permanent disadvantage competing against their larger fellows. John Alcock’s studies emphasize the importance of size variation in claiming desirable territories among male Hemipepsis ustulata wasps. It is hypothesized that female provisioning behavior {{may play a role in}} the maintenance of size variation in this species. In tarantula hawks, the size of the offspring is determined by the mother’s decision on how much to invest in each offspring. The size of the tarantula captured by the mother wasp is a function of how big the larva will become when fully grown. The subduing of a larger tarantula requires a greater <b>energy</b> <b>investment</b> and poses a greater risk to the mother wasp. If the offspring is a large male, it would have to be twice as fit as a smaller male offspring in order to repay the investment of the mother wasp. Thus, in some cases, it may be advantageous for the mother wasp to produce many small male offspring. This would enable them to enjoy the same level of fitness as a female, but with fewer, larger progeny.|$|E
25|$|Sanctions {{have reduced}} Iran's access to {{products}} {{needed for the}} oil and energy sectors, have prompted many oil companies to withdraw from Iran, and have also caused a decline in oil production due to reduced access to technologies needed to improve their efficiency. According to Undersecretary of State William Burns, Iran may be annually losing as much as $60 billion in <b>energy</b> <b>investment.</b> Many international companies have also been reluctant {{to do business with}} Iran for fear of losing access to larger Western markets. As well as restricting export markets, the sanctions have reduced Iran's oil income by increasing the costs of repatriating revenues in complicated ways that sidestep the sanctions; Iranian analysts estimate the budget deficit for the 2011/2012 fiscal year, which in Iran ends in late March, at between $30bn to $50bn. The effects of U.S. sanctions include expensive basic goods for Iranian citizens, and an aging and increasingly unsafe civil aircraft fleet. According to the Arms Control Association, the international arms embargo against Iran is slowly reducing Iran's military capabilities, largely due to its dependence on Russian and Chinese military assistance. The only substitute is to find compensatory measures requiring more time and money, and which are less effective. According to at least one analyst (Fareed Zakaria), the market for imports in Iran is dominated by state enterprises and state-friendly enterprises, because the way to get around the sanctions is smuggling, and smuggling requires strong connections with the government. This has weakened Iranian civil society and strengthened the state.|$|E
