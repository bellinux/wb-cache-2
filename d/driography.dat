50|$|Waterless {{printing}} {{was originally}} developed {{and brought to}} market by the 3M company under the trade name <b>Driography</b> in the late 1960s. Results with the product however, were mixed. Several problems were encountered both {{in the development of}} suitable inks for this process and more importantly, in the durability of the <b>driography</b> plate. After several years of R&D and many millions of dollars invested, 3M chose not to pursue further development of the product.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 Toray Industries, a large Japanese company {{specializing in}} {{synthetic}} materials development and manufacturing, purchased the patents for the <b>driography</b> product from 3M. Related patents were also purchased from the Scott Paper Co., {{who were working}} on a similar project.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} one of the newer planographic printing plates, specifically 3 M 2 ̆ 7 s Dry Plate. This plate is part of the system more popularly known as <b>driography.</b> As with many new processes, <b>driography</b> is beset with several problems. These include plate durability, substrate suitability, and toning. This study deals with the problem of toning and a. method for investigating it. In <b>driography,</b> toning is defined as the inking of the non-image background of the plate. Several factors are thought to {{have an effect on the}} amount of toning. Factors such as ink tack, ink temperature, room temperature, humidity, speed, and pressure are included. This investigation specifically researched the relationships between toning and ink tack, inking pressure, and printing speed. A parallel study of these relationships was made on both an IGT Printability Tester and on an ATF Chief 15 press. This was done in an attempt to show that the IGT Printability Tester could print driographically but, under the conditions used, it was a poor predictor of toning. Two methods of recording the effects of toning were used. One method was the recording of absolute densities taken in the non-image areas of the test sheets. The other method was the recording of a. ratio of the density of a solid patch to the density- of a tinted patch. It was hoped that the ratio would eliminate some of the extraneous variables that might affect the amount of toning. It was found, however, that the ratio result tended to record not only the pure toning, but also, the effects of some of the extraneous variables. Several statistical methods v/ere used to analyze the data accumulated. To compare one printing method with another and to compare one recording method with another, a correlation analysis was made and a graphical study done. To determine the reliability of the graphical analysis, a spot check was made using a paired comparison technique. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was made of the data from each printing and recording method to determine the significant factors in the experiment. This experiment showed that ink tack, inking pressure, printing speed, and their interactions all were significant factors in toning. Unfortunately it was impossible to include some other factors in the experiment which are known to have a significant effect on toning. These include such factors as ink temperature, room temperature, and humidity. More work needs to be done in the area of <b>driography,</b> especially in toning. The crucial question is whether this is a plate or an ink problem. As more control is obtained over toning, the use of <b>driography</b> should increase...|$|E
40|$|<b>Driography</b> is a planographic {{printing}} process. A driographic printing plate differs from a conventional offset lithographic plate in that water {{is not required}} to keep the non-image area clean of ink during printing. Water, or fountain solution, is not required during printing because a silicone rubber coating which repels ink is used for the non-image area of a driographic plate. The first driographic plate was introduced in the early 19702 ̆ 7 s by the 3 M Company. The plate was a positive working printing plate and has since been discontinued. <b>Driography</b> has since been researched by a number of companies but only one is presently marketing a driographic plate. The Toray Company, a Japanese based firm, is producing a negative working driographic printing plate. The {{purpose of this study is}} to research Toray 2 ̆ 7 s negative working driographic printing plate. It is hypothesized that as ink tack decreases, toning in the non-image area will increase. In this experiment, ink tack was monitored at the point of impression using a thermocouple device. The thermocouple was used to measure ink temperature on an inking form roller. Temperature/tack curves were developed and used to convert ink temperatures to tack readings. The actual experiment was performed on a duplicator offset printing press. A second technique using ink tack-reducer to alter ink tack was performed as an alternative test to support the initial method results. During the course of the study a number of variables could have altered the test results. These variables were monitored and kept constant during testing. The variable which affected test results most dramatically was the oil content in the ink. It was concluded that the amount of oil content in an ink had more influence on the degree of toning than ink tack did as originally hypothesized...|$|E
