5|$|Historically Bournemouth has {{suffered}} from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011. This, coupled with {{a substantial increase in}} people moving into the area, has led to a sharp rise in the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24. In England this age <b>group</b> <b>accounts</b> for only 7%.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the village}} of Carabane's {{official}} population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most {{of the population is}} Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic <b>group</b> <b>accounts</b> for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée {{at the time of the}} first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.|$|E

25|$|The {{deregulation}} {{activity in}} the underground gas storage arena has attracted independent storage service providers to develop storage facilities. The capacity made available would then be leased to third-party customers such as marketers and electricity generators. It is expected that in the future, this group would take more market share, as more deregulation takes place. Currently in the US, this <b>group</b> <b>accounts</b> for 18 percent of overall storage deliverability and 13 percent of working gas capacity in the US.|$|E
25|$|Those with {{a family}} history in two or more first-degree {{relatives}} (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease and this <b>group</b> <b>accounts</b> for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer. Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases. A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventative measure due to the high risk of malignancy. Colectomy, removal of the colon, may not suffice as a preventative measure {{because of the high}} risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} binding multi-round {{commitments to}} the <b>group</b> <b>account</b> in a repeated voluntary contributions mechanism (VCM) game. Before each five-round interval, subjects in a four-person group {{are given the}} option to commit {{a portion of their}} endowments to the <b>group</b> <b>account</b> for each of the next five rounds. Decision rounds proceed, with each subject's commitment acting as the binding minimum of his group-account allocation for each round.

However, commitments do have implications for reciprocal behavior within groups, leading to higher outcome variances across groups in the multi-round commitments treatment...|$|R

2500|$|Evidence {{emerged in}} early 2002 of Telecom having {{exploited}} an ill-considered, or fraudulently made to order, [...] accounting standard (FRS38) to inflate its year 2001 reported profit by some $263m. This standard required holding companies to incorporate {{profits and losses}} of associate companies into their <b>group</b> <b>accounts</b> by way of [...] "equity accounting" [...] except when the associate is insolvent. Being insolvent has been wrongly taken as substantial evidence that the holding company will no longer share in the associates profits and losses. The associate company Southern Cross Cables paid Telecom $263m in dividends as per (note 2 of) Telecom’s 2001 annual accounts, $US200m as per [...] Southern Cross’s annual accounts. Southern Cross opened for (limited) business in November 2000 and its income from operations to 30 June 2001 was only $US13m ($US55m for the 2002 year). Southern Cross were insolvent {{to the extent of}} $US24m as at 30 June 2000 and this increased to $US280m as at June 2001 {{as a result of the}} dividends and other (net) expenses ($328m in 2002). [...] The dividends were treated as income in Telecom’s accounts there being nothing in FRS 28 to say that they should not be although such inclusion did breach an overall requirement that the accounts present a fair view.|$|E
