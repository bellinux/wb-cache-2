5|$|Polonium was {{administered}} to humans for experimental purposes from 1943 to 1947; it was injected into four <b>hospitalised</b> <b>patients,</b> and orally given to a fifth. Studies such as this were funded by the Manhattan Project and the AEC and conducted at the University of Rochester. The objective was to obtain data on human excretion of polonium to correlate with more extensive data from rats. Patients selected as subjects were chosen because experimenters wanted persons {{who had not been}} exposed to polonium either through work or accident. All subjects had incurable diseases. Excretion of polonium was followed, and an autopsy was conducted at that time on the deceased patient to determine which organs absorbed the polonium. Patients' ages ranged from 'early thirties' to 'early forties'. The experiments were described in Chapter 3 of Biological Studies with Polonium, Radium, and Plutonium, National Nuclear Energy Series, Volume VI-3, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1950.

500|$|Warfarin is {{more slowly}} acting than the common {{anticoagulant}} heparin, {{though it has}} a number of advantages. Heparin must be given by injection, whereas warfarin is available orally. Warfarin has a long half-life and need only be given once a day. Heparin can also cause a prothrombotic condition, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (an antibody-mediated decrease in platelet levels), which increases the risk for thrombosis. It takes several days for warfarin to reach the therapeutic effect since the circulating coagulation factors are not affected by the drug (thrombin has a half-life time of days). Warfarin's long half-life means that it remains effective for several days after it was stopped. [...] Furthermore, if given initially without additional anticoagulant cover, it can increase thrombosis risk (see below). For these main reasons, <b>hospitalised</b> <b>patients</b> are usually given heparin with warfarin initially, the heparin covering the 3–5 day lag period and being withdrawn after a few days.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} oral {{health status of}} Chinese <b>hospitalised</b> {{geriatric}} <b>patients</b> and identify its impacts on their oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). Design: Cross-sectional correlational study. Setting: Geriatric wards of a regional hospital in Hong Kong. Subjects: A consecutive sample of Chinese <b>hospitalised</b> geriatric <b>patients</b> (N = 155) aged ≥ 65 years who were communicable. Measurements: The Brief Oral Health Status Examination (BOHSE) {{was used to evaluate}} oral status. The General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) was used to assess OHRQoL. Results: The oral health status of the Chinese <b>hospitalised</b> geriatric <b>patients</b> was fair, with the more prominent problems being decayed teeth, lack of occluded teeth, coated tongue, excessive tartar, dry and rough red oral tissue and diseased gum. The GOHAI score indicated their compromised OHRQoL. By using hierarchical regression analysis, fewer than eight pairs of occluding teeth (β = - 0. 33, P < 0. 001), unhealthy gum (β = - 0. 26, P = 0. 03) and perceived oral dryness (β = - 0. 18, P = 0. 04) significantly accounted for 17 % of variance in the OHRQoL of Chinese <b>hospitalised</b> geriatric <b>patients.</b> Conclusion: This study suggests that routine screening for dental and gum problems, providing adequate adaptation of denture prosthesis and reducing oral dryness of geriatric patients may be important care to optimise the OHRQoL of Chinese <b>hospitalised</b> geriatric <b>patients.</b> The study needs to be replicated in larger-scale multicentre settings and incorporate the use of more-comprehensive oral assessment indices. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.

50|$|People in at-risk {{groups should}} be treated with antivirals (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as soon as {{possible}} when they first experience flu symptoms. The at-risk groups include pregnant and post partum women, children under two years old, and people with underlying conditions such as respiratory problems. People who are not in an at-risk group who have persistent or rapidly worsening symptoms should also be treated with antivirals. People who have developed pneumonia should be given both antivirals and antibiotics, as in many severe cases of H1N1-caused illness, bacterial infection develops. Antivirals are most useful if given within 48 hours of the start of symptoms and may improve outcomes in <b>hospitalised</b> <b>patients.</b> In those beyond 48 hours who are moderately or severely ill, antivirals may still be beneficial. If oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is unavailable or cannot be used, zanamivir (Relenza) is recommended as a substitute.

40|$|Limited {{data are}} {{available}} regarding the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and VTE prophylaxis use in <b>hospitalised</b> medically ill <b>patients.</b> We analysed data from the global ENDORSE survey to evaluate VTE risk and prophylaxis use in this population according to diagnosis, baseline characteristics, and country. Data on patient characteristics, VTE risk, and prophylaxis use were abstracted from hospital charts. VTE risk and prophylaxis use were evaluated according to the 2004 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify factors associated with use of ACCP-recommended prophylaxis. Data were evaluated for 37, 356 <b>hospitalised</b> medical <b>patients</b> across 32 countries. VTE risk varied according to medical diagnosis, from 31. 2 % of patients with gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary diseases to 100 % of patients with acute heart failure, active non-infectious respiratory disease, or pulmonary infection (global rate, 41. 5 %). Among those at risk for VTE, ACCP-recommended prophylaxis was used in 24. 4 % haemorrhagic stroke patients and 40 - 45 % of cardiopulmonary disease patients (global rate, 39. 5 %). Large differences in prophylaxis use were observed among countries. Markers of disease severity, including central venous catheters, mechanical ventilation and admission to intensive care units, were strongly associated with use of ACCP-recommended prophylaxis. In conclusion, VTE risk varies according to medical diagnosis. Less than 40 % of at-risk <b>hospitalised</b> medical <b>patients</b> receive ACCP-recommended prophylaxis. Prophylaxis use appears {{to be associated with}} disease severity rather than medical diagnosis.
