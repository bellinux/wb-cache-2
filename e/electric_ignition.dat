2500|$|The {{technology}} for creating an automobile emerged in Germany in the 1870 and 1880s: Nicolaus Otto created a four-stroke internal combustion engine, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach modified the Otto engine {{to run at}} higher speeds, and Karl Benz pioneered the <b>electric</b> <b>ignition.</b> The Duryea brothers and Hiram Percy Maxim {{were among the first}} to construct a [...] "horseless carriage" [...] in the US in the mid-1890s, but these early cars proved to be heavy and expensive.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>electric</b> spark <b>ignition</b> was {{probably}} Alessandro Volta's toy electric pistol from the 1780s.|$|R
50|$|In 1914, a six-cylinder Continental joined {{electric}} {{start and}} Bosch dual ignition. Velie production averaged about 5,000 cars a year, peaking at 9,000 in 1920. Beginning in 1916, all Velies were {{powered by a}} six-cylinder engines; in 1926 a straight eight Lycoming engine was also offered. Velie chose to focus production solely on its six-cylinder OHV Model 58 in 1922. In 1924, Velie began installing Westinghouse <b>electric</b> <b>ignitions</b> in their cars. Added to this in 1925 were four-wheel hydraulic brakes and balloon tires, both still novel.|$|R
40|$|Results of the laser-induced spark {{ignition}} of methane and air mixtures are compared to <b>electric</b> spark <b>ignition.</b> Experiments were conducted using a laboratory single cylinder engine. ^ An excimer laser, operating with krypton fluoride gas (λ = 248 nm), with argon fluoride gas (λ = 193 nm) and a NY- 61 Nd:YAG laser (λ = 1064 nm) are focused into a combustion chamber {{to initiate the}} <b>ignition.</b> Conventional <b>electric</b> spark <b>ignition</b> is also used for the basis for comparing the two different ignition methods. A streak camera is used to record the ignition plasma streak image. Pressure vs. time data are recorded. ^ For {{the first time a}} detonation wave and a radial expansion wave have been reported for ignition of methane-air mixtures under internal combustion (IC) engine conditions. Results indicate that only certain wavelengths used for ignition produce a radial expansion wave. Laser ignition results in a 4 - 6 milliseconds decrease in the time for combustion to reach peak pressure. Laser ignition is found to be extremely superior to the <b>electric</b> spark <b>ignition</b> for lean methane-air mixtures. This technology has important implications for natural gas fueled vehicles. ...|$|R
2500|$|Throughout this era, {{development}} of automotive technology was rapid, {{due in part}} to hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included the <b>electric</b> <b>ignition</b> system (by dynamotor on the Arnold in 1898, though Robert Bosch, 1903, tends to get the credit), independent suspension (actually conceived by Bollée in 1873), and four-wheel brakes (by the Arrol-Johnston Company of Scotland in 1909). Leaf springs were widely used for suspension, though many other systems were still in use, with angle steel taking over from armored wood as the frame material of choice. Transmissions and throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety of cruising speeds, though vehicles generally still had discrete speed settings, rather than the infinitely variable system familiar in cars of later eras. Safety glass also made its debut, patented by John Wood in England in 1905. (It would not become standard equipment until 1926, on a Rickenbacker.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Planning for the Star car {{began in}} 1897 {{when the company}} {{acquired}} a 3.5hp Benz car and used it {{as the basis for}} the design of their own car. The early vehicles were heavily influenced by existing car makers and the 1898 3.5 was essentially a single-cylinder 3.5hp Benz and often called the Star-Benz; it had two speeds, chain drive, wire spoke wheels, acetylene lighting, <b>electric</b> <b>ignition,</b> and Clipper pneumatic tires standard, for ₤189. Star then purchased the rights to produce Star-Benz cars in Wolverhampton and began production at the Stewart Street Works. [...] The cars were now being sold under the Star Motor Company name, a registered subsidiary of Star Engineering Limited, who adopted a policy of building as much as possible in-house. The Star-Benz model sold well and around 250 were made. The cars initially sold for £189 but in 1900 they were selling for £168 and the company was producing 20 a week.|$|E
2500|$|The Airplane Engineering Department, {{precursor}} of ASC, was first established under the U.S. Army's Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps in late 1917 at McCook Field. [...] Early on the department's focus was flight testing and training. [...] The department was renamed the Airplane Engineering Division following World War I, it continued its mission of flight testing and training, but also began development and engineering. [...] One early native model, the VCP-1 {{was designed by}} resident engineers, Alfred V. Verville and Virginius E. Clark. [...] Another aircraft tested was the MB-1, eventually used as the standard mail plane. [...] The division also expanded operations to Wilbur Wright Field. [...] The division also pioneered aviation safety {{with the use of}} free-fall parachutes and the development of protective clothing, closed cockpits, heated and pressurized cabins, and oxygen systems. [...] As the stockpile of aircraft and parts grew the division was able to spend more time finding ways to enhance tools and procedures for pilots. [...] Advancements include things like an <b>electric</b> <b>ignition</b> system, anti-knock fuels, navigational aids, improved weather forecasting techniques, stronger propellers, advancements in aerial photography, and the design of landing and wing lights for night flying.|$|E
5000|$|Ignition can be {{achieved}} by a number of different methods; a pyrotechnic charge can be used, a plasma torch can be used, or <b>electric</b> spark <b>ignition</b> may be employed. Some fuel/oxidiser combinations ignite on contact (hypergolic), and non-hypergolic fuels can be [...] "chemically ignited" [...] by priming the fuel lines with hypergolic propellants (popular in Russian engines).|$|R
50|$|In addition, stage lights - for {{the first}} time in America - could be {{completely}} extinguished both in the auditorium and on the stage during the performance through the use of an <b>electric</b> spark <b>ignition</b> system. This facilitated being able to plunge the entire theatre - both stage and auditorium - into complete darkness during a performance of Booth's Hamlet.|$|R

2500|$|The Fw 190, {{designed}} as a rugged interceptor capable of withstanding considerable combat damage and delivering a potent 'punch' from its stable gun platform, was considered ideal for anti-bomber operations. Focke-Wulf redesigned parts of the wing structure to accommodate larger armament. The Fw 190A-6 was the first sub-variant to undergo this change. Its standard armament was increased from four MG 151/20s to two of them with four more in two underwing cannon pods. The aircraft was designated A-6/R1 (Rüstsatz; or field conversion model). The first aircraft were delivered on 20 November 1943. Brief trials saw the twin cannon replaced by the MK 108 30mm autocannon in the outer wing, which then became the A-6/R2. The cannons were blowback-operated, had <b>electric</b> <b>ignition,</b> and were belt fed. The 30mm MK 108 was simple to make and its construction was economical; {{the majority of its}} components consisted of just pressed sheet metal stampings. In the A-6/R4, the GM-1 (nitrous oxide) Boost was added for the BMW 801 engine to increase performance at high altitude. For protection, [...] of armoured glass was added to the canopy. The A-6/R6 was fitted with twin heavy calibre Werfer-Granate 21 (BR 21) unguided, air-to-air rockets, fired from single underwing tubular launchers (one per wing panel). The increased modifications, in particular heavy firepower, made the Fw 190 a potent bomber-killer. The A-7 evolved in November 1943. Two synchronized 13mm (.51 caliber) MG 131 machine guns replaced the twin cowl-mount synchronized 7.92mm (.318 cal) MG 17 machine guns. The A-7/R variants could carry two 30mm MK 108s as well as BR 21 rockets. This increased its potency as a Pulk-Zerstörer (Bomber Formation Destroyer). The A-8/R2 was the most numerous Sturmbock aircraft, some 900 were built by Fiesler at Kassel with 30mm MK 108s installed in their outer wing panel mounts. While formidable bomber-killers, the armour and substantial up-gunning with heavier calibre firepower meant the Fw 190 was now cumbersome to maneuver. Vulnerable to Allied fighters, they had to be escorted by Bf 109s.|$|E

50|$|The steady {{electric}} discharging {{currents in}} a lightning channel cause {{a series of}} incoherent impulses in the whole frequency range, the amplitudes of which decreases approximately with the inverse frequency. In the ELF-range, technical noise from 50 or 60 Hz, natural noise from the magnetosphere, etc. dominates. In the VLF-range, there are the coherent impulses from R- and K-strokes, appearing out of the background noise. Beyond about 100 kHz, the noise amplitude {{becomes more and more}} incoherent. In addition, technical noise from <b>electric</b> motors, <b>ignition</b> systems of motor cars, etc., are superimposed.
