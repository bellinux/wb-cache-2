50|$|<b>Halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{incandescent}} lamps filled with highly pressurized inert gas. This gas {{is combined with}} a small amount of halogen gas (bromine or iodine) which causes tungsten atoms to regenerate by lessening the evaporation of the filament. This leads to a much longer life of <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> than {{incandescent lamps}}. Due to the high pressure and temperature <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> produce, they are relatively small and made out of quartz glass because it has a higher melting point than standard glass. Common uses for <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> are table top heaters.|$|R

25|$|The <b>halogen</b> <b>lamp</b> reduces uneven {{evaporation}} of the filament and eliminates darkening of {{the envelope}} by filling the lamp with a halogen gas at low pressure, rather than an inert gas. The halogen cycle increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten {{from the inside of}} the bulb back onto the filament. The <b>halogen</b> <b>lamp</b> can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. Fiber-optic lamps for optical microscopy is one typical application.|$|E

50|$|The {{three most}} common types of {{incandescent}} lamps are standard incandescent <b>lamps,</b> tungsten <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps,</b> and reflector lamps. Standard incandescent lamps have an efficacy of 10-17 lumens per watts and {{a lifetime of}} 750-2500 hours. Tungsten <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> have an efficacy of 12-22 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000-4000 hours.

25|$|Tungsten-halogen lamps are a {{very common}} light source for {{headlamps}} and other forward illumination functions. Some recent-model vehicles use small halogen bulbs for exterior signalling and marking functions, as well.

25|$|American {{inventor}} James T. Russell {{has been}} credited with inventing the first system to record digital information on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high-power <b>halogen</b> <b>lamp.</b> Russell's patent application was first filed in 1966, and he was granted a patent in 1970. Following litigation, Sony and Philips licensed Russell's patents (then held by a Canadian company, Optical Recording Corp.) in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|LED stage {{lighting}} {{instruments are}} stage lighting instruments that use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{as a light}} source. LED instruments are an alternative to traditional stage lighting instruments which use <b>halogen</b> <b>lamp</b> or high-intensity discharge lamps. Like other LED instruments, they have high light output with lower power consumption. Most LED fixtures use three or more colors (usually red, green, and blue) which can be mixed to hypothetically create any color.|$|E
25|$|<b>Halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{a type of}} {{incandescent}} lamp with improved efficiency over regular {{incandescent lamp}}s. Though not as energy efficient as other alternatives, they are up to 40 percent more efficient than standard incandescent lamps designed for a 2000-hour life. Depending on size, voltage, and designed life, small low-voltage <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> can have 70% higher efficacy than large line-voltage lamps. The high operating temperature of halogen bulbs may be a safety hazard in some applications.|$|R

25|$|Raylite reflectors can {{be added}} to PAR64 and PAR56 lamp {{housings}} to achieve a narrow spot effect. A conventional quartz <b>halogen</b> <b>lamp</b> is used in place of the reflector lamp. A spider or bulb shield may optionally be added, which enhances the parallel nature of the beam and makes it more visible when used with smoke or fog effects. Raylites are generally less rugged than sealed beam bulbs. The lamp can easily shake loose of the lampholder in transit.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{available}} scanners typically use {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) or {{contact image sensor}} (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a <b>halogen</b> <b>lamp</b> and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.|$|E
25|$|An {{incandescent}} light bulb, incandescent lamp or {{incandescent light}} globe is an electric light {{with a wire}} filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a <b>halogen</b> <b>lamp,</b> filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.|$|E

25|$|Technology {{moved forward}} {{in the rest of}} the world. The first <b>halogen</b> <b>lamp</b> for vehicle {{headlamp}} use, the H1, was introduced in 1962 by a European consortium of bulb and headlamp makers. Shortly thereafter, headlamps using the new light source were introduced in Europe. These were effectively prohibited in the US, where standard-size sealed beam headlamps were mandatory and intensity regulations were low. US lawmakers faced pressure to act, both due to lighting effectiveness and vehicle aerodynamics/fuel savings. High beam peak intensity, capped at 140,000 candela per side of the car in Europe, was limited in the United States to 37,500 candela on each side of the car until 1978, when the limit was raised to 75,000. An increase in high beam intensity to take advantage of the higher allowance could not be achieved without a move to halogen technology, and so sealed beam headlamps with internal halogen burners became available for use on 1979 models in the United States. Halogen sealed beams now dominate the sealed beam market, which has declined steeply since replaceable-bulb headlamps were permitted in 1983.|$|E
