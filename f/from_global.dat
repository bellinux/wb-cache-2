5|$|In June 2014 a {{study by}} the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{concluded}} that emperor penguins are at risk <b>from</b> <b>global</b> warming, which is melting the sea ice. This study predicted that by 2100 all 45 colonies of emperor penguins will be declining in numbers, mostly due to loss of habitat. Loss of ice reduces the supply of krill, which is a primary food for emperor penguins.|$|E

5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes <b>from</b> <b>global</b> warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.

The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, <b>from</b> <b>global</b> (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in 2008 when Dontnod Entertainment was formed. Initially called Adrift, the {{original}} concept {{of the game}} was a world flooded <b>from</b> <b>global</b> warming, with a key gameplay mechanic being the player character using jetskis to navigate a coastal city. Later, the team {{became interested in the}} concept of memory as a central theme and redesigned the game accordingly, although game director Jean-Maxime Moris was reluctant to set the game in Paris since the studio was based there. It was originally developed as a role-playing game with Sony publishing it exclusively for the PlayStation 3, starting full development in February 2010. Following creative disagreements between Dontnod and Sony, and the subsequent cancellation of the project in February 2011 because of budget cuts, the project was presented at the 2011 Gamescom trade fair in the hope that it would garner the attention necessary to secure another publishing deal. Capcom purchased the intellectual property in 2012 and provided funding for the project, reimagining it as an action-adventure game for release on multiple platforms.|$|E
5|$|The cratered terrain, {{a rolling}} surface covered by {{numerous}} impact craters and centered on Ariel's south pole, is the moon's {{oldest and most}} geographically extensive geological unit. It is intersected by a network of scarps, canyons (graben), and narrow ridges mainly occurring in Ariel's mid-southern latitudes. The canyons, known as chasmata, probably represent graben formed by extensional faulting, which resulted <b>from</b> <b>global</b> tensional stresses caused by the freezing of water (or aqueous ammonia) in the moon's interior (see below). They are 15–50km wide and trend mainly in an east- or northeasterly direction. The floors of many canyons are convex; rising up by 1–2km. Sometimes the floors are separated from the walls of canyons by grooves (troughs) about 1km wide. The widest graben have grooves running along the crests of their convex floors, which are called valles. The longest canyon is Kachina Chasma, at over 620km in length (the feature extends into the hemisphere of Ariel that Voyager 2 did not see illuminated).|$|E
