5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin <b>deficiency</b> <b>disease</b> pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{essential}} for the normal growth and development of a multicellular organism. Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents, a fetus begins to develop from the nutrients it absorbs. It requires certain vitamins and minerals to be present at certain times. These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things, skin, bone, and muscle. If there is serious deficiency {{in one or more}} of these nutrients, a child may develop a <b>deficiency</b> <b>disease.</b> Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage.|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy about the soundness and relevance of so-called "megavitamin " therapy for various illnesses. In this article {{it is suggested}} that this disagreement is caused to a large extent by the use of two very different approaches to nutrition, which are referred to here as the "nutritional need " and "optimal intake" approaches. It is clear that a re-evaluation of the goals of nutrition is required, as nutritional recommendations deal mainly with the prevention of <b>deficiency</b> <b>diseases</b> and are not concerned with optimal levels of intake. THE NUTRITIONAL NEED APPROACH Originally some <b>deficiency</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as pellagra and beri-beri, were thought to be infections. Typically, classical infectious diseases are all-or-none diseases: either a person has pneumonia or they do not. <b>Deficiency</b> <b>diseases</b> were thought to be of a simila...|$|R

25|$|As a result, it {{is likely}} that the deaths of Burke and Wills {{resulted}} in part from a vitamin <b>deficiency</b> <b>disease</b> called beriberi. Evidence to this effect is further provided by King's account, which revealed that Burke complained of leg and back pain shortly before his death. However, other research suggests that scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) and environmental factors also contributed to their deaths.|$|E
25|$|Soaking the maize in limewater is {{important}} because it makes available the B vitamin niacin and the amino acid tryptophan. When maize was brought to Europe, Africa and Asia from the New World, this crucial step was often omitted. Those whose diet consisted mostly of corn meal often became sick— {{because of the lack of}} niacin and tryptophan— with the <b>deficiency</b> <b>disease</b> pellagra, which was common in Spain, Northern Italy, and the southern United States.|$|E

50|$|Death due {{to disease}} is called death by natural causes. There are four main types of disease: {{infectious}} <b>diseases,</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>diseases,</b> genetic diseases (both hereditary and non-hereditary), and physiological diseases.

The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections.|$|R
25|$|Medication and {{supplemental}} niacin {{are primarily}} {{used to treat}} high blood cholesterol and pellagra (niacin deficiency). Insufficient niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. The lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic <b>deficiency</b> <b>disease,</b> which {{is caused by a}} lack of five crucial vitamins (niacin, vitamin C, thiamin, vitamin D, and vitamin A) and is usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition. Niacin is provided in the diet from a variety of whole and processed foods, with highest contents in fortified packaged foods and meat from various animal sources. Some countries require its addition to grains.|$|E

500|$|Rogers stocked his {{ships with}} limes {{to fend off}} scurvy, a {{practice}} not universally accepted at that time. [...] After reaching the Pacific Ocean, the ships' provisions of limes were exhausted and seven men died of the vitamin <b>deficiency</b> <b>disease.</b> Dampier was able to guide the ships to little-known Juan Fernandez Island to replenish supplies of fresh produce. On 1 February 1709, as they neared the island, the sailors spotted a fire ashore and feared {{that it might be}} a shore party from a Spanish vessel. The next morning Rogers sent a party ashore and discovered that the fire was from Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who had been stranded there four years previously. Selkirk was to become an inspiration for the classic novel Robinson Crusoe, written by Rogers' friend, Daniel Defoe. Rogers found Selkirk to be [...] "wild-looking" [...] and [...] "wearing goatskins", noting in his journal, [...] "He had with him his clothes and bedding, with a firelock, some powder, bullets and tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible and books." [...] Selkirk, who {{had been part of the}} ship's crew that abandoned Dampier after losing confidence in his leadership, was now more than willing to join a flotilla that included his old commodore as ship's pilot. Selkirk served as a mate aboard the Duke, and was later given command of one of the prize ships taken by the expedition.|$|E

50|$|The {{objective}} of supplementation with trace minerals {{is to avoid}} a variety of <b>deficiency</b> <b>diseases.</b> Trace minerals carry out key functions in relation to many metabolic processes, most notably as catalysts for enzymes and hormones, and are essential for optimum health, growth and productivity. For example, supplementary minerals help ensure good growth, bone development, feathering in birds, hoof, skin and hair quality in mammals, enzyme structure and functions, and appetite. Deficiency of trace minerals affect many metabolic processes and so may be manifested by different symptoms, such as poor growth and appetite, reproductive failures, impaired immune responses, and general ill-thrift. From the 1950s to the 1990s most trace mineral supplementation of animal diets was {{in the form of}} inorganic minerals, and these largely eradicated associated <b>deficiency</b> <b>diseases</b> in farm animals.|$|R

2500|$|Pellagra {{is common}} in Africa, Indonesia, and China. In {{affluent}} societies, a majority of patients with clinical pellagra are poor, homeless, alcohol-dependent, or psychiatric patients who refuse food. [...] Pellagra was common among prisoners of Soviet labor camps (the Gulag). [...] In addition, pellagra, as a micronutrient <b>deficiency</b> <b>disease,</b> frequently affects populations of refugees and other displaced people due to their unique, long-term residential circumstances and dependence on food aid. Refugees typically rely on limited sources of niacin provided to them, such as groundnuts; the instability in the nutritional content and distribution of food aid can {{be the cause of}} pellagra in displaced populations. In the 2000s, there were outbreaks in countries such as Angola, Zimbabwe and Nepal. In Angola specifically, recent reports show a similar incidence of pellagra since 2002 with clinical pellagra in 0.3% of women and 0.2% of children and niacin deficiency in 29.4% of women and 6% of children related to high untreated corn consumption.|$|E
