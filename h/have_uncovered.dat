5|$|Excavations {{near the}} arch resumed between 1994 and 1996, {{directed}} by Ronny Reich and Yaacov Billig. These <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> {{much of the}} debris from {{the collapse of the}} arch. The remains include both stairs from the staircase and stones from its rounded handrails. Some of these are still visible where they were found, at the Jerusalem Archaeological Park now occupying the site.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} frescoes on the church's interior walls date from the 18th century. These include images of the Mother of God, Jesus Christ and John the Baptist, all painted {{as part of the}} church's first reconstruction.

5|$|The {{researches}} of John Harvey <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> {{the names}} of many English medieval architects, and by tracing stylistic characteristics, it has sometimes proved possible to track their careers from one building to another. Leading architects were highly paid - especially those employed in the King's works - and they can often be identified from regular payments in cathedral accounts.|$|E

Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> few surviving remains of the Tahitian Dog. In 1960, a few canine teeth were uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a jawbone at another site on the same island.|$|E
5|$|Fannin {{had begun}} {{evacuating}} Presidio La Bahía on March 19. The estimated 320 troops were low {{on food and}} water, and the breakdown of a wagon allowed Urrea's men to overtake them at Coleto Creek, ending in Fannin's surrender on March 20. Peter Kerr, who had served with Fannin and {{claimed to have been}} held prisoner, arrived at DeWees on March 25. Houston announced Fannin's surrender, but would later claim to <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> evidence that Kerr was a spy for the Mexicans.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, Launceston {{is owned}} by the duchy of Cornwall and {{operated}} by English Heritage as a tourist attraction. Much of the castle defences remain, including the motte, keep and high tower which overlook the castle's former deer park to the south. The gatehouses and some of the curtain wall have survived, and archaeologists <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> the foundations of various buildings in the bailey, including the great hall.|$|E

5|$|The present château, {{designed}} on {{a triangular}} plan, has five conical towers and a watchtower capped by slate roofs. Archaeologists <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> {{traces of the}} older buildings on the site {{dating back to the}} 11th century. The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries of the building, which hung in the master bedroom, were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} of research, the Hrant Dink Foundation {{published}} a book, some 400 pages long, describing the current situation of seized assets and properties of the Armenian community. With the help of government deed and title records, {{the members of the}} Hrant Dink foundation <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> the title records of all the properties owned by various foundations and have produced the book replete with photographs, charts, maps, and other illustrations which describe the seized properties and assets and its current status. The Hrant Dink foundation states that 661 properties in Istanbul alone were confiscated by the Turkish government, leaving only 580 of the 1,328 properties owned by the 53 Armenian foundations (schools, churches, hospitals, etc.). The current circumstances of the remaining 87 could not be determined. Out of the 661 confiscated properties, 143 (21.6%) have been returned to the Armenian foundation.|$|E
5|$|Differing {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} regarding {{the origins of the}} Vijayanagara empire. Many historians propose that Harihara I and Bukka I, the founders of the empire, were Kannadigas and commanders in the army of the Hoysala Empire stationed in the Tungabhadra region to ward off Muslim invasions from the Northern India. Others claim that they were Telugu people, first associated with the Kakatiya Kingdom, who took control of the northern parts of the Hoysala Empire during its decline. Irrespective of their origin, historians agree the founders were supported and inspired by Vidyaranya, a saint at the Sringeri monastery to fight the Muslim invasion of South India. Writings by foreign travelers during the late medieval era combined with recent excavations in the Vijayanagara principality <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> much-needed information about the empire's history, fortifications, scientific developments and architectural innovations.|$|E

5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the election, there was some {{violence}} and several incidents involving prominent opposition and media figures. In February, there was a grenade attack in Kigali which killed two people. Rwandan prosecutors blamed Kayumba Nyamwasa, a dissident General who had become a critic of Kagame. Nywamwasa fled to Johannesburg, South Africa, and in June he survived a shooting in the city. Nyamwasa alleged that it was an assassination attempt, a charge Rwanda denied. Days later, journalist Jean-Léonard Rugambage, who claimed to <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> the regime's responsibility in the attempted murder, was shot dead. In July, {{the vice president of the}} Democratic Green Party, André Kagwa Rwisereka, was beheaded in Butare. There is no concrete evidence linking Kagame with the attacks, but it was sufficient for the United Nations to demand an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Sinification of the Yue and Dian tribes {{was brought}} about by a {{combination}} of Han imperial military power, regular Han Chinese settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees. The military invasions and an influx Han Chinese immigrants created a culture that merged Han Chinese traditions with indigenous elements. Archaeological digs in the area reveal the extent of Han Chinese influence. Han dynasty tombs in Guangzhou, Guangdong show that the native tools and ceramics were gradually replaced by those modeled after Chinese styles by the Western Han. Excavations from the period <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> bronze mirrors, stoves, wells, incense burners, tripods, and lanterns manufactured {{in the style of the}} Han.|$|E
5|$|The annual {{incidence}} of clinically recognized PanNETs is low (about 5 per one million person-years) and {{is dominated by}} the non-functioning types. Somewhere between 45% and 90% of PanNETs are thought to be of the non-functioning types. Studies of autopsies <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> small PanNETs rather frequently, suggesting that the prevalence of tumors that remain inert and asymptomatic may be relatively high. Overall PanNETs are thought to account for about 1 to 2% of all pancreatic tumors. The definition and classification of PanNETs has changed over time, affecting what is known about their epidemiology and clinical relevance.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{historian}} Doukas, {{on the morning}} of 29 May 1453, the small postern called Kerkoporta was left open by accident, allowing the first fifty or so Ottoman troops to enter the city. The Ottomans raised their banner atop the Inner Wall and opened fire on the Greek defenders of the peribolos below. This spread panic, beginning the rout of the defenders and leading to the fall of the city. In 1864, the remains of a postern located on the Outer Wall {{at the end of the}} Theodosian Walls, between tower 96 and the so-called Palace of the Porphyrogenitus, were discovered and identified with the Kerkoporta by the Greek scholar A.G. Paspates. Later historians, like van Millingen and Steven Runciman have accepted this theory as well. However, excavations at the site <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> no evidence of a corresponding gate in the Inner Wall (now vanished) in that area, and it may be that Doukas' story is either invention or derived from an earlier legend concerning the Xylokerkos Gate, which several earlier scholars also equated with the Kerkoporta.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancient history}} of the island is unknown in either Hindu or Buddhist records. Archeological studies <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> many remains that suggest the small island had a rich {{cultural}} past, with evidence of human settlement by possibly the 2nd century BC. The regional history is first recorded in the Gupta Empire era, but these do not explicitly mention these caves. This has made the origins and the century in which Elephanta caves were built a subject of a historic dispute. They have been variously dated, mostly between from late 5th to late 8th century AD, largely based on the dating of other cave temples in the Deccan region. Colonial era historians suggested that the caves were built by the Rashtrakutas in 7th century or after, a hypothesis primarily based on some similarities with the Ellora Caves. This theory has been discredited by later findings.|$|E
5|$|While the Material Defender recovers in the Red Acropolis {{station on}} Mars, the {{director}} of the team informs him that they have been investigating PTMC, and <b>have</b> <b>uncovered</b> a conspiracy: one of her acquaintances in the PTMC was killed by a robot, and when she contacted PTMC about it, they denied having ever employed such acquaintance, even though he had worked with them for years. The Red Acropolis had tried to notify the Collective Earth Defense (CED), a large police group, of the PTMC's actions, but they took no action, not daring to interfere with such a powerful corporation. The director also tells the Material Defender that, while he was clearing the mines during the events of Descent II, PTMC executive Samuel Dravis was actually testing and modifying the virus and deliberately tried to kill him by overloading the warp drive on his ship. After some persuasion and offers from the director, including a new ship and an AI assistant known as the Guide-Bot, the Material Defender accepts to help the Red Acropolis stop the virus.|$|E
