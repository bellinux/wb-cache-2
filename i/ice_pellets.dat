25|$|Dry ice is {{also useful}} for the de-gassing of {{flammable}} vapours from storage tanks— the sublimation of dry <b>ice</b> <b>pellets</b> inside an emptied and vented tank causes an outrush of CO2 that carries with it the flammable vapours.|$|E

Some areas in southeastern Ontario and southern Quebec saw in excess of 50cm (20inches) of snow with Ottawa receiving the highest amount with 48cm (19inches). Several areas across Ontario reported thundersnow with locally <b>ice</b> <b>pellets</b> and freezing rain closer to the Highway 401 corridor The storm also affected much of Atlantic Canada and New England with extensive freezing rain across most of New Brunswick although northern sections of the province received from 25cm (10inches) {{to as much as}} 50cm (20inches) in Campbellton. Heavy snow fell on some areas that already had close-to-record-breaking amounts of snow for that winter.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{mechanical}} uses of dry ice is blast cleaning. Dry <b>ice</b> <b>pellets</b> are shot from a nozzle with compressed air, combining {{the power of the}} speed of the pellets with the action of the sublimation. This can remove residues from industrial equipment. Examples of materials removed include ink, glue, oil, paint, mold and rubber. Dry ice blasting can replace sandblasting, steam blasting, water blasting or solvent blasting. The primary environmental residue of dry ice blasting is the sublimed CO2, thus making it a useful technique where residues from other blasting techniques are undesirable. Recently, blast cleaning has been introduced as a method of removing smoke damage from structures after fires.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{scattering}} {{is purely}} a microwave propagation mode and is best observed around 10GHz, but extends {{down to a}} few gigahertz—the limit being {{the size of the}} scattering particle size vs. wavelength. This mode scatters signals mostly forwards and backwards when using horizontal polarization and side-scattering with vertical polarization. Forward-scattering typically yields propagation ranges of 800km. Scattering from snowflakes and <b>ice</b> <b>pellets</b> also occurs, but scattering from ice without watery surface is less effective. The most common application for this phenomenon is microwave rain radar, but rain scatter propagation can be a nuisance causing unwanted signals to intermittently propagate where they are not anticipated or desired. Similar reflections may also occur from insects though at lower altitudes and shorter range. Rain also causes attenuation of point-to-point and satellite microwave links. Attenuation values up to 30dB have been observed on 30GHz during heavy tropical rain.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>pellet</b> {{injection}} experiment {{has been}} carried out in the TPE-RX, reversed field pinch (RFP) device. Significant plasma electron density (ne) increase has been observed after the D 2 <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> injection into plasma with standard and pulsed poloidal current drive (PPCD) operation [1, 2]. The pellet is injected into the plasma after 5 ms from the PPCD start. Due to the pellet injection, in the PPCD plasma the ne becomes three times higher than in the standard plasma. The high ne can be constantly maintained till the end of PPCD period (more than 15 ms). The toroidal asymmetry of D-alpha emission is included into the discussion about particle confinement by using the toroidal D-alpha line intensity monitor system. Two chords CO 2 /HeNe laser interferometer gives the radial electron density profile and the total number of particles, N. The estimation of the ratio of the N/I shows that the particle confinement is improved in the combination of the PPCD discharge and the pellet injection. Here, I indicates total D-alpha line intensity. The ratio N/...|$|R

40|$|Electron heating regime using with {{radio-frequency}} {{waves in}} the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) has been investigated in helical magnetic configuration. Mode-conversion scenario {{was applied to the}} LHD plasmas. When the wave frequency is change to be lower than that in the standard ICRF heating (minority ion heating) condition, the resonance layers are moved away to the peripheral region of plasma. Two-ion hybrid resonance (mode-conversion) layers still locate inside of plasma and fast waves launched by the ICRF antenna are converted to the ion Bernstein waves at these layers. The plasma is successfully sustained by mode-conversion heating only. The measured high-energy ion component shows no ion tail, which is observed in the minority ion heating case. Position of mode-conversion layer is closely related with the ratio of hydrogen ions to helium ions. Hydrogen <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> injection was tested to supply the hydrogen ions in the plasma core region. The plasma, which collapsed without the repetitive <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> injection was sustained during mode-conversion heating assisted by the repetitive pellet injection. Feasibility of steady state operation using mode-conversion heating is assessed. The plasma duration more than 80 sec. is achieved so far. The experimental result was compared by using 1 D full wave simulation code. The electron absorption profile was slightly different when the hydrogen ion ratio was changed...|$|R
25|$|Solidifying: Solidifiers are {{composed}} of tiny, floating, dry <b>ice</b> <b>pellets,</b> and hydrophobic polymers that both adsorb and absorb. They clean up oil spills by changing the physical state of spilled oil from liquid to a solid, semi-solid or a rubber-like material that floats on water. Solidifiers are insoluble in water, therefore {{the removal of the}} solidified oil is easy and the oil will not leach out. Solidifiers have been proven to be relatively non-toxic to aquatic and wild life and have been proven to suppress harmful vapors commonly associated with hydrocarbons such as Benzene, Xylene, Methyl Ethyl, Acetone and Naphtha. The reaction time for solidification of oil is controlled by the surface area or size of the polymer or dry pellets as well as the viscosity and thickness of the oil layer. Some solidifier product manufactures claim the solidified oil can be thawed and used if frozen with dry ice or disposed of in landfills, recycled as an additive in asphalt or rubber products, or burned as a low ash fuel. A solidifier called C.I.Agent (manufactured by C.I.Agent Solutions of Louisville, Kentucky) is being used by BP in granular form, as well as in Marine and Sheen Booms at Dauphin Island and Fort Morgan, Alabama, to aid in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill cleanup.|$|E
500|$|Hail {{is a form}} {{of solid}} precipitation. It is {{distinct}} from <b>ice</b> <b>pellets</b> (American sleet), though the two are often confused.

40|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>pellet</b> {{injection}} {{experiments were}} {{carried out in the}} JIPP T-IIU tokamak in order to study thermal (cooling) transport just after injection. The cut-off problem of ECE signals due to the rise in density has been resolved by careful measurements of temperature profile at a high time resolution (Delta t= 2 ms) during its decay phase. The phenomenon of ultra-fast cooling (so-called pre-cooling) has been identified using the two different methods of ECE and soft X-ray(SXR) measurements. In the outer region (r > r_inv) of the plasma the cooling propagation velocity is comparable to or slightly greater than the pellet velocity, while in the central region (r < r_inv) the propagation velocity is significantly greater than the <b>pellet</b> velocity. <b>Ice</b> <b>pellet</b> were injected into various kinds of JIPP T-IIU plasmas, the current and sawtooth phase of which had different values, including a no-sawtooth plasma. The existence of the sawtooth oscillation and arrival of a pellet near the inversion radius r_inv of the sawtooth oscillations {{have turned out to be}} necessary conditions for the pre-cooling, and even just after the sawtooth crash the pre-cooling may start around the q= 1 surface, not at the plasma center. Simultaneous measurements of electron temperature and density profiles indicate that the central temperature always decreases before the central density increases. Some anomalous transport might be induced by pellet injection at the central region. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{progress}} {{in studies of}} transient or perturbative plasma transport in tokamak and helical plasmas is reviewed. Perturbative transport study involves monitoring temporal evolutions of plasma perturbations induced by various perturbation sources: typically, sawtooth oscillations, modulated ECH power, modulated gas puff rate, impurity or <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> injection, and fast ramp-up of the plasma current. In tokamaks, the incremental particle diffusion coefficient and electron thermal diffusivity obtained through a transient transport study technique are typically larger {{by a factor of}} two to five than those obtained by steady state power balance. This indicates that the relationship between the flux and the parameter gradients is in nonlinear or offset -linear. A reversal of electron temperature perturbations delta T_e is induced in ohmically heated tokamak plasmas by edge cooling using impurity or <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> injection and edge heating employing fast current ramp-up. This {{can be explained by the}} sudden change in electron heat diffusivity in the plasma core region and near the edge. This strong nonlocal or non-diffusive behaviour is not yet clarified. This delta T_e-reversal is never ob- served in W 7 -AS stellarator. Theoretical models are being developed. A model including both ion and electron temperature gradient-driven turbulence qualitatively ex plains the plasma responses for applied perturbations observed in some tokamak plasmas, without any artificial nonlocal transport effects. In the near future, detailed comparative studies between perturbative transport experiments and theoretical models would elucidate complex behaviours in turbulent transport in a toroidal plasma...|$|R
500|$|Unlike <b>ice</b> <b>pellets,</b> hailstones are layered {{and can be}} {{irregular}} and clumped together. [...] Hail {{is composed}} of transparent ice or alternating layers of transparent and translucent ice at least [...] thick, which are deposited upon the hailstone as it travels through the cloud, suspended aloft by air with strong upward motion until its weight overcomes the updraft and falls to the ground. Although the diameter of hail is varied, in the United States, the average observation of damaging hail is between 2.5cm (1in) and golf ball-sized (1.75in).|$|E
500|$|The same low {{pressure}} systems {{that caused the}} tornado outbreak also spawned a significant snowstorm from the Central Plains to the western Great Lakes where winter storm warnings were issued. Between 10 and 15inches (25–38cm) of snow fell from eastern Iowa to southern Wisconsin and Northern Illinois, with local amounts ranging from 18 to 21inches (45–53cm) in southeastern Wisconsin. [...] In Michigan, up to 14inches (35cm) of snow fell north of Grand Rapids. Environment Canada also issued freezing rain and winter storm warnings for Southern Ontario, where some areas north of Lake Erie received close to 1inch (25mm) of freezing rain. In Toronto, two waves of moderate to heavy snow accompanied by thunder and lightning, along with <b>ice</b> <b>pellets,</b> brought up to 14inches (35cm) of accumulated winter precipitation on February 6 and 7. Other areas from Windsor to Ottawa, as well as southwestern Nova Scotia, received from 4 to 20inches (10–50cm) of snow.|$|E
500|$|Stratiform (a broad {{shield of}} {{precipitation}} {{with a relatively}} similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur {{as a consequence of}} slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts. Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as <b>ice</b> <b>pellets</b> and snow, is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result. Hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds [...] above ground level.|$|E
5000|$|Both areas {{receive more}} than 500 in of {{snowfall}} per year, due to lake-effect enhancement from the Great Salt Lake, making them the second snowiest ski {{areas in the}} United States (after {{the ones in the}} Cascades). In contrast to the humid and wet conditions in the Cascades near the Pacific Ocean, the arid condition of the Great Basin produces very dry and powdery snow, making Snowbird and Alta top global destinations for powder-skiing aficionados. Another benefit of being East of the great salt lake is that salt from the lake provides the condensation nuclei that creates <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> snow that doesn't pack like normal snowflakes. Loose powder for days after a snowfall is common. On very windy days the salt is lifted thousands of feet and has been known to coat the windshield of airplanes flying into Salt Lake City.|$|R

2500|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to dry ice can cause severe skin damage through frostbite, and the fog produced may also hinder attempts {{to withdraw from}} contact in a safe manner. Because it sublimes into large quantities of carbon dioxide gas, which could pose a danger of hypercapnia, dry ice should only be exposed to open air in a well-ventilated environment. For this reason, dry ice is assigned the S-phrase [...] {{in the context of}} laboratory safety. Industrial dry ice may contain contaminants that make it unsafe for direct contact with foodstuffs.

5000|$|Freezing rain often causes {{major power}} outages by forming glaze ice. When the {{freezing}} rain or drizzle is light and not prolonged, the ice formed is thin. It usually causes only minor damage, relieving trees of their dead branches etc. When large quantities accumulate, however, {{it is one}} of the most dangerous types of winter hazard. [...] When the ice layer exceeds approximately 0.25 in , tree limbs with branches heavily coated in ice can break off under the enormous weight and fall onto power lines. Windy conditions and lightning, when present, will exacerbate the damage. Power lines coated with ice become extremely heavy, causing support poles, insulators and lines to break. The ice that forms on roadways makes vehicle travel dangerous. Unlike snow, wet ice provides almost no traction, and vehicles will slide even on gentle slopes. Because freezing rain does not hit the ground as an <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> (called [...] "sleet") but still as a rain droplet, it conforms to the shape of the ground, or object such as a tree branch or car. This makes one thick layer of ice, often called [...] "glaze".|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{very high}} poloidal beta was {{achieved}} by the Pulsed Poloidal Current Drive (PPCD) in Toroidal Pinch Experiment-RX (TPE-RX, which had been operated to March 2007 from April 1998). The electron density and temperature increased, hence, the poloidal beta was improved to 30 % from 5 % during PPCD (poloidal beta is almost equal to total beta in the reversed-field pinch). D-alpha emission decreased during the PPCD and {{the ratio of the}} total number of particles to the D-alpha emission increased ten-fold at the end of the PPCD indicating the considerable improvement of the particle confinement time. Fast magnetic fluctuation levels in the edge region of TPE-RX were measured using a newly developed complex edge probe installed inside vacuum vessel and sensitive to fast magnetic fluctuation. During the PPCD operation, the magnetic fluctuation associated with the dynamo effect is reduced, and improved confinement is reached, which results in this high beta value. Unique neutral beam injection (NBI) system suitable for the RFP machine was developed to control plasma parameters. In the case of high power NB injection to the improved confinement plasma which was attained by PPCD operation with an <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> injection, the meaningful increments in the soft X-ray signal and the plasma current were found. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{two major}} topics of Large Helical Device (LHD) towards fusion {{relevant}} conditions, high-density operation and high-ion-temperature operation, are reported. Super dense core plasma {{was obtained by}} the combination of repetitive hydrogen <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> injection and high power neutral beam injection (NBI) heating. A very peaked density profile with the highest central density of 1. 1 × 1021 m- 3 was produced showing that the particle transport was suppressed {{very well in the}} plasma core. The spatial density profile varies as the position of magnetic axis (Rax), and the steepest profile is obtained at Rax = 3. 95 m. The highest central ion temperature of 5. 6 keV was obtained in hydrogen plasma at electron density of 1. 6 × 1019 m- 3 by NBI, where a peaked ion-temperature profile with internal ion energy transport barrier was observed. The profile of electron temperature did not change much and was broad even when the ion temperature had a peaked profile. The central ion temperature is higher than the electron temperature, which is a new operation regime of LHD. High central ion temperature accompanied strong toroidal rotation and an extreme hollow profile of carbon ions (impurity hole). These steep temperature profiles were obtained so far at around Rax = 3. 6 m. The compatibility between particle and energy confinement is a new issue of LHD to explore a new operation regime for attractive fusion reactor...|$|R

30|$|The {{technique}} of injecting fuel {{into the center}} of a nuclear fusion reactor or into a Tokamak device has remained a challenging problem in the realistic applications of nuclear fusion energy. The confinement time and the density peak position of the Plasma are key performance parameters for a thermonuclear reactor or device [1, 2]. It has been known that the density peak is tightly related to the injection method. The main existing injection methods include normal injection, <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> injection, and supersonic molecular beam injection. The normal injection method has the disadvantages of low efficiency and difficulty in forming the density peaks. Though the pellet injection method has many advantages, the relevant techniques for the whole injection system are rather complicated, which results in too expensive running costs [1, 3, 4, 5]. The supersonic molecular beam injection as first proposed by Yao et al. [6] is a new method for injecting the fuel and has been successfully applied in HL- 1  M, HT- 7, EAST, and HL- 2 A of China [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. This method has also been accepted as a candidate mode for fuel injection in the international thermonuclear fusion reactor by the relevant experts [9]. In this approach, the supersonic molecular beam is formed through the Laval nozzle throat by making use of the pressure difference [3]. In this work, we study the relation between the Laval nozzle throat size and the Mach numbers and the density peaks of the injected molecular beams. Our results agree well with those previously obtained by other methods [12, 13].|$|R
40|$|The {{equation}} of radiation transport describes the emission and absorption of a spectral {{line in a}} plasma. An apparent decrease in the emission intensity is demonstrated for an optically thick line, which is confirmed with the Balmer- line observed for hydrogen <b>ice</b> <b>pellet</b> injection into the LHD plasma. The effective decrease in the spontaneous transition probability is {{expressed in terms of}} an escape factor, and is incorporated into the collisionalradiative model for neutral helium. For the glow discharge plasma in the LHD, a substantial decrease in the effective A coefficient of the 11 S － 31 P line results in an increase in the upper-level population, leading to a very strong emission of the 21 S － 31 P line; this resolves the last puzzle in the observed spectra. An emission line intensity is proportional to the ionization flux or the recombination flux of the ion species concerned. From the measured line intensities of ionized and neutral helium in the decaying phase of the LHD plasma, densities of the ions, and thus the electron density are estimated, which are in accordance with the electron densities determined by the interferometer. Under the condition of fixed atom and ion densities, starting from a high electron temperature where the plasma is ionizing and an emission line is strong, with a decrease in temperature the line intensity decreases. It takes the minimum at a temperature of ionization balance, and then it increases again in a recombining plasma. This feature interprets various observations. The above conclusion is a substantial generalization of the conventional belief that an emission intensity takes its maximum at the temperature at which the atom and ion densities are approximately equal; this latter statement is valid only under the condition of an ionization balance plasma. ...|$|R
