40|$|National {{legislation}} such as South African Schools Act, No. 84 of 1996 introduced important reforms impacting {{on school}} and parent communication. It mandated {{the establishment of}} school governing bodies in all schools to ensure that parents participate in their schools and to open an effective way of communication between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> parents. However, the literature study established that in some schools, mostly the historically disadvantaged black schools, communication between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> parents is still very poor and mostly ineffective. This study examined {{the role of the}} school principals in managing effective communication between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> parents at schools to ensure that effective partnerships between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> parents are achieved. A qualitative investigation in two public secondary schools in the Umbumbulu Circuit, KwaZulu-Natal was done. Data were gathered by means of in-depth interviews with the principals of each school, and focus group interviews with the <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> parents of each school and document analysis. The findings revealed the following: relationship between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> parents is still very poor in some schools, the communication between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> parents is still ineffective, there is still a lack of parental involvement in some schools, and most schools do not have policies on effective management of communication and comprehensive programmes on parental involvement. The study recommends that principals need to be empowered to effectively manage communication in their schools to ensure effective partnerships between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> parents, and schools should design their own training programmes conducted by principals or specialists for parents on the importance of parental involvement in the education of their children.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to see whether work of special <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> rehabilitators in the regular school has {{a positive influence on}} peer relationship among students with delayed cognitive development. The accent was on friendship quality, social competence and antisocial behavior. The research comprised 150 students with slow cognitive development, 52 of who have support of special <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> rehabilitators in regular education, while the remaining 98 students are without support. Friendship quality was evaluated applying Friendship Quality Questionnaire. School Social Behavior Scale was used in order to evaluate social competence and antisocial behavior. Differences among the groups were examined by t-test from SPSS 14 Windows software package. The results have shown that students with slow cognitive development having support from special <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> rehabilitators evaluate their friendship more qualitative. Students with delayed cognitive development attending schools without special <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> rehabilitators engaged demonstrate better level of the social competence. As far as antisocial behavior concerns, no differences were found.

40|$|Thesis (MA (Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. A {{healthy and}} {{positive}} relationship between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners is an important aspect in the establishment and sustainability of a nurturing and enabling school environment. However, research pertaining to South African schools shows that schools currently face many challenges that threaten relationships in schools and adversely affect the general well-being of the individuals concerned. The situation is problematic in every school context, but even more so in schools where risk factors are present in a concentrated form, {{as is the case}} in schools of skills. The researcher has been involved as a school counsellor at various schools of skills in the Western Cape for the past three years and has noticed that schools of skills are often exposed to various risk factors that influence the daily interaction between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners and also impede the fostering of a healthy relationship between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners. It is therefore logical that the relationship between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners in schools of skills is influenced by the particular circumstances and that the relevant risk factors could be contributing to the current situation in schools of skills. Limited research about the relationship between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners in the context of schools of skills impedes the situation even more. This research study aims to make a contribution to the solution of the identified problem by investigating ways in which the relationships between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners can be improved within the context of schools of skills in the Western Cape. A literature study and empirical investigation were undertaken to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners in schools of skills and the way the respective parties experience it (the relationship). Therefore, the nature of the structure of this research study is qualitative phenomenological because it incorporates an investigation into the social relationships that connect <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners. The research study was done in four schools of skills in the Western Cape that is representative of the different settlement contexts in South Africa, namely urban, semi-urban and rural. The participants in the four various schools include <b>educators</b> (n= 42) <b>and</b> learners (n= 122). The collection of data took place in four phases and the following qualitative data collection methods were used: qualitative open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured individual interviews for educators as well as collages and semi-structured focus group interviews for learners. Thematic analysis of the respective data sets showed that the relationships between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners can be improved by considering the contextual challenges both <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners are confronted with. Besides considering the contextual challenges it is also important to create spaces where relationships can be improved and learners can feel safe. This seems to be mainly the responsibility of the <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> can be done by setting clear boundaries and upholding healthy discipline. It was further demonstrated that the relationship between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners in schools of skills can be improved by acting towards each other in such a way that mutual respect, mutual trust, the provision of care and support and open communication can be established as relationship-improving interaction patterns. In the light of the study’s findings, specific guidelines are provided to the educator at the school of skills and clear recommendations are made to the Department of Education with the aim of improving classroom relationships in schools of skills. In conclusion, recommendations are also made about further research to improve relationships between <b>educators</b> <b>and</b> learners in schools of skills. Master...|$|R

He was the second of four {{children}} born to Paul Steenstrup Koht (1844–1892), an <b>educator</b> <b>and</b> politician, and Betty Giæver (1845–1936), a part-time teacher with a penchant for singing, languages and drawing. Betty's antecedents were mixed: she was maternally descended from Northern Germany, yet on her father's side she was of Norwegian origin—a distinguished forebear on that side was her great-grandfather, the civil servant Jens Holmboe from Tromsø. Through the offspring of his maternal grand-uncle, Halvdan Koht was a third cousin of the parliamentarian Ola Krogseng Giæver. In Paul Koht's lineage, Kjeld Stub was a distant ancestor. The name Koht stems from German immigrants to Norway in the 17th century.|$|E
