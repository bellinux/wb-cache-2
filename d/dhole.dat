5|$|Mulder and Scully {{arrive at}} the port {{and talk to the}} owner of the dog Dr. Ian Detweiler (Andrew Robinson), a cryptozoologist. Detweiler says the dog is a Wanshang <b>Dhole,</b> a species thought to be extinct. The two agents soon receive news of the other attack and, after investigating, Mulder {{believes}} the <b>Dhole</b> has near-human intelligence. Mulder and Scully visit Berquist, who tells them that the breed they are looking for is extinct. Meanwhile, a dog catcher is chasing a stray through a warehouse when a man enters the building. He promptly transforms into the murderous <b>dhole</b> and attacks the catcher. Mulder and Scully soon {{arrive at the}} scene, followed by Berquist. She finds a paw print with five toes, one more than regular canines.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Detweiler {{arrives at}} a vet's office to get tranquilizers and leaves. The vet goes to the back and is {{attacked}} by the <b>Dhole</b> but he locks the room before it can cause any harm. The dog catchers arrive and open fire on the wrong dog. While the vet tries to operate on the hurt dog Scully enters the building and begins to hear screaming in the back room. She discovers that the vet has been attacked. After Scully leaves, the hurt animal transforms into the <b>dhole,</b> revealing that the dog can mimic any shape.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} Berquist's motives, noting {{that she was}} the reason Mulder decided to look into this investigation. Mulder, however, begins to suspect Detweiler after learning that he had been at the vet's office; Mulder believes that he is the <b>dhole</b> and is tranquilizing himself in an attempt to stop murdering. Mulder asks Cahn to confront Detweiler, but Cahn is attacked and severely injured by the <b>Dhole</b> and placed in the hospital. Mulder then visits Berquist and says he thinks she has not been honest with him. Berquist reveals that she first suspected Detweiler when she saw him. She also says that he will try to finish off Cahn. Mulder worriedly tells Scully, who remains skeptical.|$|E
50|$|The Sumatran <b>dholes</b> {{are native}} to Sumatra, Java, and peninsular Malaysia. Though their range are highly fragmented, the Indonesian <b>dholes</b> are {{confirmed}} {{to live in}} multiple protected areas of Sumatra and Java. In 2014, camera trap videos in the tropical forests of the Kerinci Seblat National Park in Sumatra revealed the continued presence of <b>dholes</b> in the area. The <b>dholes</b> have been extirpated from most of its range in Malaysia, although they probably still persist in Taman Negara and Belum-Temengor. The <b>dholes</b> are completely extinct from Singapore. Sumatran <b>dholes</b> live in scrublands, grasslands, plains, tropical forests and rainforests.|$|R
25|$|There are {{numerous}} records of leopards being treed by <b>dholes.</b> <b>Dholes</b> sometimes drive tiger, leopards, and bears (see below) from their kills. <b>Dholes</b> were {{once thought to}} be a major factor in reducing Asiatic cheetah populations, though this is doubtful, as cheetahs live in open areas as opposed to forested areas favoured by <b>dholes.</b>|$|R
50|$|As of 2005, {{the origin}} of Sumatran <b>dholes</b> is unclear, as they show greater {{relatedness}} to Ussuri <b>dholes</b> rather than with those in nearby Malaysia. In the absence of further data, it is speculated that the <b>dholes</b> in Indonesia could have been introduced to the Sunda Islands by humans.|$|R
5|$|The wolf-like canids, (genus Canis, Cuon and Lycaon) {{including}} the dog (Canis lupus familiaris), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red wolf (Canis rufus), eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), coyote (Canis latrans), golden jackal (Canis aureus), Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), <b>dhole</b> (Cuon alpinus), and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus).|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the dire wolf, North America was invaded by the genus Xenocyon (ancestor of the Asian <b>dhole</b> and the African hunting dog) that was as large as the dire wolf and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare, and it is assumed that they could not compete with the newly derived dire wolf. Stable isotope analysis provides evidence that the dire wolf, Smilodon, and the American lion competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores included the extinct North American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), the modern cougar (Puma concolor), the Pleistocene coyote (Canis latrans), and the Pleistocene gray wolf that was more massive and robust than today. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate several killings blamed on an Asian dog called the Wanshang <b>Dhole,</b> thought to be extinct. Mulder and Scully join an obstinate Sheriff, a seemingly eccentric hunter, and a reclusive canine expert to find it. However, there is more mystery to the expert than meets the eye.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dholes</b> {{are listed}} as {{endangered}} species due to low densities. However, threats such as poaching, illegal hunting and fur trade no longer pose significant threats to <b>dholes.</b> The species is highly protected in many countries, such as in Cambodia. The <b>dholes</b> in certain regions are mostly threatened by lack of prey and habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{animals are}} Asian {{elephant}} (Elephas maximus), western hoolock gibbon (Hylobates hoolock), Phayre's leaf monkey (Trachypithecus phayrei), capped leaf monkey (Trachypithecus pileatus), <b>dholes</b> (Cuon alpinus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), sambar (Cervus unicolor), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), rock python (Python molurus), etc. Among these, elephants, clouded leopards and <b>dholes</b> are critically endangered species of Bangladesh. Although elephants and gibbons are fairly common, <b>dholes</b> and sambars are very rare.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dholes</b> {{appear to}} be related to (or perhaps {{identical}} with) Cthulhu-mythos author Brian Lumley's chthonians and their vermiform god, Shudde M'ell. Like <b>dholes,</b> chthonians are huge, worm-like creatures covered in viscous slime who live deep underground.|$|R
5|$|Wolf and coyote {{packs and}} the solitary cougar {{are the most}} likely predators, {{although}} brown and black bears also prey on elk. Coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves, though they can sometimes take a winter-weakened adult. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Yellowstone National Park, bears are the most significant predators of calves. Major predators in Asia include the wolf, <b>dhole,</b> brown bear, Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and snow leopard. Eurasian lynx and wild boar sometimes prey on Asian elk calves. Historically, tigers in the Lake Baikal region fed on Manchurian wapiti, and continue {{to do so in the}} Amur region.|$|E
5|$|Pack-hunting of langurs is {{recorded}} in India. Packs of between 5 and 18 jackals scavenging on the carcasses of large ungulates {{is recorded}} in India and Israel. Packs of 8â€“12 jackals consisting {{of more than}} one family have been observed in the summer periods in Transcaucasia. In India, the Montagu's harrier and the Pallid harrier roost in their hundreds in grasslands during their winter migration. Jackals stalk close to these roosting harriers and then rush at them, attempting to catch one before the harriers can take off or gain sufficient height to escape. In some regions of Bangladesh and India, jackals subsist by scavenging on carrion and garbage, and will cache extra food by burying it. Golden jackals cause damage to melon, peanut, grape, coffee, maize, and sugarcane crops. They sometimes prey on lambs, weak sheep, kids, goats, and poultry. The jackal will scavenge off the kills made by the lion, tiger, leopard, <b>dhole,</b> and gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{animals that}} are found in Karnataka include the elephant, the tiger, the leopard, the gaur, the sambar deer, the chital or spotted deer, the muntjac, the bonnet macaque, the slender loris, the common palm civet, the small Indian civet, the sloth bear, the <b>dhole,</b> the striped hyena and the golden jackal. Some of the birds found here are the great hornbill, the Malabar pied hornbill, the Ceylon frogmouth, herons, ducks, kites, eagles, falcons, quails, partridges, lapwings, sandpipers, pigeons, doves, parakeets, cuckoos, owls, nightjars, swifts, kingfishers, bee-eaters and munias. Some species of trees found in Karnataka are Callophyllum tomentosa, Callophyllum wightianum, Garcina cambogia, Garcina morealla, Alstonia scholaris, , Artocarpus hirsutus, Artocarpus lacoocha, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Grewia tilaefolia, Santalum album, Shorea talura, Emblica officinalis, Vitex altissima and Wrightia tinctoria. Wildlife in Karnataka is {{threatened}} by poaching, habitat destruction, human-wildlife conflict and pollution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dholes</b> produce {{whistles}} {{resembling the}} calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, {{though it is}} thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries. In contrast to wolves, <b>dholes</b> do not howl or bark. <b>Dholes</b> have a complex body language. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful <b>dholes</b> open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening <b>dholes</b> pucker their lips forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When afraid, they pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears flat against the skull.|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} of <b>dholes</b> in Myanmar {{was confirmed by}} camera-trapping in 11 areas, and alongside leopards, have apparently replaced tigers as the country's top predators. In 2015, <b>dholes</b> and tigers were recorded by camera-traps {{for the first time}} in the hill forests of Karen State.|$|R
5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the <b>dhole</b> (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E
5|$|From the 1850s, {{the fossil}} remains of extinct large wolves were being {{found in the}} United States, {{and it was not}} {{immediately}} clear that these all belonged to one species. The first specimen of what would later become associated with Canis dirus was found in mid-1854 in the bed of the Ohio River near Evansville, Indiana. The fossilized jawbone with cheek-teeth was obtained by the geologist Joseph Granville Norwood from an Evansville collector, Francis A. Linck. The paleontologist Joseph Leidy determined that the specimen represented an extinct species of wolf and reported it under the name of Canis primaevus. Norwood's letters to Leidy are preserved along with the type specimen (the first of a species that has a written description) at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. In 1857, while exploring the Niobrara River valley in Nebraska, Leidy found the vertebrae of an extinct Canis species that he reported the following year under the name C.dirus. The name C.primaevus (Leidy 1854) was later renamed Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869) when Leidy found out that the name C.primaevus had previously been used by the British naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson for the <b>dhole.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between {{the male and female}} of a species apart from their sex organs is called sexual dimorphism, and in this regard little variance exists among the canids. A study of dire wolf remains dated 15,360â€“14,310YBP and taken from one pit that focused on skull length, canine tooth size, and lower molar length showed little dimorphism, {{similar to that of the}} gray wolf, indicating that dire wolves lived in monogamous pairs. Their large size and highly carnivorous dentition supports the proposal that the dire wolf was a predator that fed on large prey. To kill ungulates larger than themselves, the African wild dog, the <b>dhole,</b> and the gray wolf depend on their jaws as they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with prey, and they work together as a pack consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring from the current and previous years. It can be assumed that dire wolves lived in packs of relatives that were led by an alpha pair. Large and social carnivores would have been successful at defending carcasses of prey trapped in the tar pits from smaller solitary predators, and thus the most likely to become trapped themselves. The many C.d.guildayi and Smilodon remains found in the tar pits suggests that both were social predators.|$|E

50|$|The <b>dholes</b> {{are also}} {{vulnerable}} to diseases from {{areas where they}} share the same habitats with other canids like wolves and golden jackals.

25|$|The <b>dhole</b> {{only rarely}} takes {{domestic}} livestock. Certain people, {{such as the}} Kurumbas and some Mon Khmer-speaking tribes will appropriate <b>dhole</b> kills; some Indian villagers welcome the <b>dhole</b> because of this appropriation of <b>dhole</b> kills. Dholes were persecuted throughout India for bounties until they were given protection by the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Methods used for <b>dhole</b> hunting included poisoning, snaring, shooting and clubbing at den sites. Native Indian people killed dholes primarily to protect livestock, while British sporthunters during the British Raj did so under the conviction that dholes were responsible for drops in game populations. Persecution of dholes still occurs {{with varying degrees of}} intensity according to region. Bounties paid for dholes used to be 25 rupees, though this was reduced to 20 in 1926 after the number of presented <b>dhole</b> carcasses became too numerous to maintain the established reward. In Indochina, dholes suffer heavily from nonselective hunting techniques such as snaring.|$|E
25|$|Japanese author Uchida Roan wrote çŠ¬ç‰©èªž (Inu monogatari; A dog's tale) in 1901 as a nationalistic {{critique}} of the declining popularity of indigenous dog breeds, which he asserted were descended from the <b>dhole.</b> A fictional version of the <b>Dhole,</b> imbued with supernatural abilities, appears in the Season 6 episode of The X-Files titled Alpha.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dhole</b> is {{a highly}} social animal, living in large clans without rigid {{dominance}} hierarchies and containing multiple breeding females. Such clans usually consist of 12 individuals, but groups of over 40 are known. It is a diurnal pack hunter which preferentially targets medium and large sized ungulates. In tropical forests, the <b>dhole</b> competes with tigers and leopards, targeting somewhat different prey species, but still with substantial dietary overlap.|$|E

25|$|Though usually {{antagonistic}} toward wolves, {{they may}} hunt and feed alongside one another. There {{is at least}} one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of <b>dholes</b> in Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary. They infrequently associate in mixed groups with golden jackals. Domestic dogs may kill <b>dholes,</b> though they will feed alongside them on occasion.|$|R
50|$|Predators include tigers, leopards, <b>dholes</b> and {{sometimes}} the Burmese python, and the clouded leopard.|$|R
25|$|On some occasions, dholes may attack tigers. When {{confronted by}} dholes, tigers will seek refuge in trees or stand {{with their backs}} to a tree or bush, where they may be mobbed for lengthy periods before finally {{attempting}} escape. Escaping tigers are usually killed, while tigers which stand their ground have a greater chance of survival. Tigers are dangerous opponents for dholes, as they have sufficient strength to kill a <b>dhole</b> with a single paw strike. <b>Dhole</b> packs may steal leopard kills, while leopards may kill dholes if they encounter them singly or in pairs. Since leopards are smaller than tigers and more likely hunt dholes, <b>dhole</b> packs tend to react more aggressively toward them than they do towards tigers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dhole</b> packs may attack sloth bears, {{though they}} are not a usual prey item. When attacking them, dholes try to prevent the bear from {{retreating}} into caves. In one case, a golden jackal (a species much smaller and less powerful than a sloth bear and not generally a pack hunter as is the <b>dhole)</b> was seen to aggressively displace an adult bear which passively loped away from the snapping canid, indicating the sloth bear does not regard other carnivores as competition.|$|E

The number of observations ranged from 1341 in the most popular zone to 71 in the least popular. Comparisons between data for mornings vs. afternoon and feeding days vs. non-feeding days showed no obvious differences in utilization of the zones. Two frequently used pathways through the enclosure were found. Finally, the results showed that the <b>dholes</b> have a tendency to share space with each other...|$|R
