40|$|In {{this paper}} we use an {{equilibrium}} model to derive the monetary policy maker's optimal response function, {{taking into account}} the interaction between individual firms and households and their participation in markets for goods and services. The theoretical formulation is used to set up a social optimization problem, where the main goal of society is to minimize inflation and output fluctuations around their steady-state values. The model presents a theoretical justification for the <b>inflexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> to move upward or downward, as a result of firms' inability to perfectly observe demand and supply shocks. This price stickiness arises solely as a consequence of uncertainty and imperfect competition, and, in the absence of policy intervention, this uncertainty can result in a more volatile economy. The proposed model not only allows us to show how monetary policy can have real effects in the short run {{as a result of the}} presence of asymmetric information in the economy, but it also serves a theoretical rationale for an activist role of central banks in macroeconomic stabilization. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An inverse system {{framework}} is followed {{in this paper}} to analyse the process <b>of</b> <b>price</b> formation in the Sydney Fish Market for the quota species of Australia’s South East Fishery.

40|$|THE LIQUIDITY TRAP-that awkward {{condition}} in which monetary policy loses its grip because the nominal interest rate is essentially zero, in which the quantity of money becomes irrelevant because money and bonds are essentially perfect substitutes-played {{a central role in}} the early years of macroeconomics as a discipline. John Hicks, in introducing both the IS-LM model and the liquidity trap, identified the assumption that monetary policy is ineffective, rather than the assumed downward <b>inflexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices,</b> as the central difference between Mr. Keynes and the classics. ' It has often been pointed out that the Alice in Wonderland character of early Keynesianism-with its paradoxes of thrift, widows ' cruses, and so on-depended on the explicit or implicit assumption of an accommodative monetary policy; it has less often been pointed out that in the late 1930 s and early 1940 s it seemed quite natural to assume that money was irrelevant at the margin. After all, at the end of the 1930 s interest rates were hard up against the zero constraint; the average rate on U. S. Treasury bills during 1940 was 0. 014 percent. Since then, however, the liquidity trap has steadily receded both as a memory and as a subject of economic research. In part, this is because in the generally inflationary decades after World War II nominal interest rates have stayed comfortably above zero, and therefore central banks have no longer found themselves "pushing on a string. " Also, the experience of the 1930 s itself has been reinterpreted, most notably b...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the possibility for}} RE generation and embedded generation in general, to acquire {{a significant part of}} the total electricity production in the light of the present regimes in electricity trading, which governs both electrical energy itself and the use of the transmission and distribution networks. Particular reference is given to the UK’s NETA model and its effect on embedded small-scale generators. The paper investigates the reasons behind the <b>inflexibility</b> <b>of</b> the established <b>pricing</b> regimes and the obstacles to new pricing concepts to accommodate increased levels of embedded generation. The various developments in the recent creation of the electricity related markets such as the green certificates ones are discussed in relation to the possible commercial gains that can be acquired by RE and CHP generators by participating in the trading process. The paper concludes that participation of embedded generation in markets of green certificates, ancillary services and others is essential for competition with traditional forms of generation to occur on equitable terms, and for enhanced deployment of renewables to take place, given the nature of the existing electricity trading arrangements...|$|R
40|$|As {{president}} of the Bank, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the Thirty-Third Annual Policy Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This conference concerns measurement of the economy’s potential output. The concept of potential output is straightforward to define—the economy’s maximum sustained level of output— but difficult to measure. Inclusion of the term sustained suggests {{that the concept of}} potential growth is closely tied to inflation—a low, stable inflation rate is essential if an economy is to attain maximum economic growth and, hence, remain through time at or near its potential level of output. In macroeconomic stabilization theory and practice, the concept of potential growth has a long history. Early analyses focused on the output gap. Fortunately, belief in an exploitable long-run tradeoff between the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation was rejected by economists decades ago. Today’s classical and New Keynesian models suggest that, given enough time for adjustment and a benign pattern of shocks, the economy will adjust in the long run toward its potential level of output. The speed of such adjustment depends on the relative flexibility or <b>inflexibility</b> <b>of</b> wages, <b>prices,</b> and expectations—aptly summarized by Keynes’s quip that “In the long run, we are all dead. ” But, taken literally, Keynes’s call to action, as we now recognize, can be quite dangerous when near-term preliminary data contain significant uncertainty and measure-ment error, as demonstrated by the papers o...|$|R
