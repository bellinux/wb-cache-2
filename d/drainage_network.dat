Following the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana, the city began to dredge its rivers and improve its <b>drainage</b> <b>network.</b> The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission is in charge of cleaning up the Pasig River and tributaries for transportation, recreation and tourism purposes.

Today many of these channels are managed by the Witham First, Third and Fourth District Internal Drainage Boards and Upper Witham Internal Drainage Board. These four internal drainage boards reduce the flood risk to the surrounding properties, land and environment.|$|E
5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface <b>drainage</b> <b>network</b> and the internal karst drainage system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E

It has been compared with the much larger Nile river on Earth. This feature is connected to Ligeia Mare. Later, a paper ("Liquid-filled Canyons on Titan") published on Geophysical Research Letters on 9 August 2016 reported about the May 2013 Cassini RADAR altimeter observation of Vid Flumina channels, defined as a <b>drainage</b> <b>network</b> connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are {{at the same level}} as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea {{but there are a few}} isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.|$|E

500|$|In 1878 a Thames pleasure-steamer, the , {{collided}} with the collier Bywell Castle and sank, causing over 650 deaths. The accident took place close to the outfalls and questions were raised in the British press over whether the sewage was responsible {{for some of the}} deaths. In the 1880s further fears over possible health concerns because of the outfalls led to the MBW purifying sewage at Crossness and Beckton, rather than dumping the untreated waste into the river, and a series of six sludge boats were ordered to ship effluent into the North Sea for dumping. The first boat commissioned was named the SS Bazalgette, which remained in service until December 1998, when the dumping stopped, and an incinerator was used to dispose of the waste. The sewers were expanded in the late 19th century and again in the early 20th century.

500|$|The city {{is located}} in {{an area in which}} the Pampero and the Sudestada winds pass by. Being located in the Pampas, the weather is {{variable}} due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms. The Pampero wind brings in cold, dry air from the south while warm humid tropical air produces sultry nortes (a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, hot, and humid weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves). Often, the passage of the Pampero winds occurs as a cold front passes through, leading to strong gusts from the south or southeast, a decrease in humidity and temperature, and an increase in the atmospheric pressure. When the cold Pampero winds meet with warm humid air from the north, thunderstorms are produced. The Sudestada winds are formed when a high pressure system located in southern Argentina interacts with a low pressure system over Uruguay and southern Brazil. When Sudestadas form, they bring long periods of precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. These are common during the winter months. Because the Sudestada brings the highest wind speeds (particularly when these winds are combined with the astronomical tides), the Sudestada is responsible for floods that occur in low-lying areas. Its geomorphology along with inadequate <b>drainage</b> <b>network</b> and infrastructure, a flat landscape, and low elevations (much of Buenos Aires lies between [...] above sea level) makes Buenos Aires highly vulnerable to flooding, particularly during heavy rainfall. Flooding impacts the neighbourhoods La Boca and Barracas which are in the southern parts of the city, more low-lying and inhabited by poor people (of low socioeconomic status).|$|E

2500|$|Flooding is {{the most}} {{prominent}} natural hazard in Argentina, and along with the littoral provinces, Buenos Aires is a very high risk area. Across the country, an according to 1998 statistics from Swiss-Re, Argentina ranks 18th {{in the world in}} potential flood losses, in excess of US$3 billion in 1998. [...] Argentina is also one of 14 countries whose potential losses from floods are greater than 1 percent of GDP. Specifically in Buenos Aires, flooding occurs on average about twice per year. These floods are due to two causes: the condition of the <b>drainage</b> <b>network,</b> and strong winds from the southeast, (sudestadas), which produce a rise of the Rio de la Plata high above its average. Its waters then spill over the land, flooding the coastal areas inhabited by the poor. From the topographical standpoint, the City of Buenos Aires and its suburbs are located in a periphery of rolling grasslands, characterized by its limited slope toward the Rio de la Plata. The area was originally carved by small watercourses that either drain into the Rio de la Plata or in the two most important bodies of water in the area: the Reconquista and Matanza-Riachuelo. All of the watercourses have the special characteristics of a plain region: short water courses with little permanent flow, irregular routes, and broad flood valleys. The layout of the watercourses defines flood-prone areas, where flooding of the following tributary areas often occurs. The Maldonado (covering 5,050 hectares in Buenos Aires), Medrano, (covering 2,050 ha in Buenos Aires and 4,600 in total); White-Vega (covering 1,777 ha); and Cildáñez are important basins covering Buneos Aires.|$|E

One of the most innovative elements in this work is the choice of the parameters to quantify the organization level of the studied features. The fractal dimension has been selected to measure the hierarchical structure of the <b>drainage</b> <b>networks,</b> while the Balanced Entropy Index (BEI) has been the chosen parameter to quantify the heterogeneity of the particle-size distribution from textural data.
