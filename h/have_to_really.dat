500|$|Scenes were filmed {{primarily}} in Portland, Oregon. Stunt {{work was done}} mainly by the cast. The fight sequence between Gigandet and Pattinson's characters in a ballet studio, which was filmed {{during the first week}} of production, involved a substantial amount of wire work because the vampires in the story have superhuman strength and speed. Gigandet incorporated mixed martial arts fighting moves in this sequence, which involved chicken and honey as substitutes for flesh. Bella, the protagonist, is unconscious during these events, and since the novel is told from her point of view, such action sequences are illustrative and unique to the film. Pattinson noted that maintaining one's center of gravity is difficult when doing wire work [...] "because you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> fight against it as well as letting it do what it needs to do." [...] Lefèvre found the experience disorienting since forward motion was out of her control.|$|E
500|$|Army {{engineers}} {{determined by}} 5:30p.m. {{on the first}} day that no one remained alive in the damaged section of the building. In the days after the crash, news reports emerged that up to 800 people had died. Army soldiers from Fort Belvoir were the first teams to survey the interior of the crash site and noted the presence of human remains. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Urban Search and Rescue teams, including Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue assisted the search for remains, working through the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS). Kevin Rimrodt, a Navy photographer surveying the Navy Command Center after the attacks, remarked that [...] "there were so many bodies, I'd almost step on them. So I'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> take care to look backwards as I'm backing up in the dark, looking with a flashlight, making sure I'm not stepping on somebody". Debris from the Pentagon was taken to the Pentagon's north parking lot for more detailed search for remains and evidence.|$|E

50|$|A good {{ride over}} fences will look easy, with the horse jumping from the correct takeoff spot, easily fitting the strides {{in between the}} jumps (as opposed <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> stretch out or collect its stride), and cleanly making the flying changes required. Refusals, knocked rails, or rubs over fences incur a severe drop (faults) in the rider's score.|$|R
500|$|... “I didn't {{write my}} raps down {{for my first}} four albums — like at all, I did it from the head {{straight}} to the booth. But on this last album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I wrote it. I really put myself in the zone that my life was dependent {{on the success of}} this album. With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter what anybody says about me, they won’t — I can write something that can make someone that hates me the most <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|Christian Louboutin {{said that}} he would {{dedicate}} his time to creating some [...] "scene-stealing designs for the single's video", out of his appreciation for the song. According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writing of}} the album did not start until a year after La Dispute's debut album, Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, was released. Part {{of the reason for}} the delay was the band's {{continuous}} touring and promotion of the debut across the United States and Canada, with rare tour and festival appearances in Europe and Australia. When commenting on the delay between the band's album releases, singer Jordan Dreyer said he {{and the rest of the}} band members require [...] "an absurdly long gestation period with these types of things and then we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> sit down and be as meticulous as we all want to be". The band decided to use lyrical elements that they had intended to use in the first album but that were not included because they did not seem fully developed at the time. While writing La Dispute, the band had very specific goals; they projected the album to have 14 tracks and knew exactly what they wanted from each song.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the core}} of Primary Nursing is an {{empowered}} staff led by empowering leaders. [...] "It Nursing not only put a relationship focus on the nurses' role, it also {{had the effect of}} decentralizing power and empowering the individual at the bedside... Nurse managers and directors and vice presidents <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> make a considerable shift in their job focus -- from control to development." ...|$|R
5000|$|Boogaloo {{can be seen}} as [...] "the first Nuyorican music" [...] (René López), and {{has been}} called [...] "the {{greatest}} potential that Cuban rhythms <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> cross over in terms of music" [...] (Izzy Sanabria). Styles like doo wop also left a sizable influence, through Tony Pabón (of Pete Rodríguez Band), Bobby Marín, King Nando, Johnny Colón and his vocalists Tony Rojas and Tito Ramos.|$|R
5000|$|I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> {{research}} {{and get into}} the mind of somebody with a disability like that. So I spent a few days at a home for mentally retarded teens.

500|$|On December 17, 2014, Smith {{confirmed}} she {{and eight}} other Wildrose members — Rob Anderson, Gary Bikman, Rod Fox, Jason Hale, Bruce McAllister, Blake Pedersen, Bruce Rowe and Jeff Wilson — would cross {{the floor to}} the Progressive Conservative caucus, with Smith saying [...] "Under Premier Prentice’s strong leadership, I believe {{we can work together}} to lead Alberta with a renewed focus on the values and principles that we share." [...] The action followed several days of rumours and a PC caucus meeting in which that party agreed to accept the Wildrose members. Smith said that several conversations with Prentice revealed that they shared much common ground, particularly on fiscal issues. Ultimately, she concluded that it made little sense for her to continue in opposition. [...] "If you’re going to be the official Opposition leader," [...] she said, [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> want to take down the government and really take down the premier. I don't want to take down this premier. I want this premier to succeed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nash's {{screenplay}} changed {{virtually all}} of the sung recitative to spoken dialogue, as in the 1942 stage revival. For example, in the original opera Porgy sings the line [...] "If there weren't no Crown, Bess, if there was only just you and Porgy, what then?", upon which Bess launches into the duet I Loves You Porgy. In the film the line is spoken. The recitatives themselves did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> be rewritten, because they do not rhyme, while the words in all the songs do.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the negativism surrounding the album, Aguilera claimed that Bionic was ahead of its time. [...] "I can proudly say it was ahead of its time, to be honest", Aguilera told Billboard. [...] "It wasn't so commercialised. You <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> be a music lover, be a true fan of music {{and the love of}} being open <b>to</b> <b>really</b> appreciate that record. It's just a special piece in my body of work that will forever live on." [...] She also added: [...] "The older the record gets the more people will come to appreciate it actually and check it out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Due to not {{receiving}} domestic theatrical distribution, few critics reviewed the film. From BZ Film: There are movies that can simply {{be put into}} “forgettable” category. ESCAPEE falls right in there. Supposedly ESCAPEE was based on true events {{that took place in}} one of the producer's hometown of Alexandria, Louisiana. Maybe so, however this doesn’t make this film any different, as one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> think hard and work even harder to make a serial killer movie worth watching.|$|R

She {{has stated that}} she {{has no plans to}} marry again, commenting [...] "Some people are not meant to be married and I am not meant to. I’m sure it is wonderful for lots of people." [...] In a 2011 interview with Piers Morgan, she explained that she never loved the men she married and commented: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> be committed to them. And I'm justI don't have that commitment. I'm committed to my family." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Donnie or Marie" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode 4.6 out of 5 stars and [...] "could barely move" [...] {{after watching the}} episode. [...] "There's still a sense of not really having any clue who killed Rosie, which may be extremely obnoxious to some and perfectly riveting to others. But that noir tone has never changed, The characters have remained true to themselves flaws and all, and the case, while at times long winded, in these last few episodes has felt like it's moved somewhere, giving us something to grasp onto and feel as if the answers are within our reach." [...] The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated this episode a B, calling it a [...] "suspenseful cliffhanger" [...] and comparing the cross-editing to the previous episode [...] "Bulldog" [...] by stating: [...] "The difference is that last week cut between an absorbing dramatic scene and an energetic detective scene while [...] "Donny Or Marie" [...] cuts between two thrilling mysteries surfing each other's wakes. Instead of falling through the dramatic pauses, the momentum carries {{all the way through}} the finale." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline was pleased to see an episode dedicated to the murder investigation. He stated: [...] "I've been saying throughout this season that The Killing would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> step up its game in the last few episodes to make the last 11 episodes seem like they were worth the trouble, and while 'Donnie or Marie' is certainly a strong one, it's not so revelatory or dramatic that it forgives the failings of the season that precedes it. If every episode of the season was this good, The Killing would have been a much better series. But even then, it would need to really end with a glorified bang to justify the buildup." ...|$|E
2500|$|G-Unit member Tony Yayo has {{alleged that}} Ghostface had a ghostwriter for his {{critically}} acclaimed album Supreme Clientele. In {{an interview with}} Spin magazine, Yayo claimed that Far Rockaway native Lord Superb, who guested on the album, wrote a majority, if not all, of the lyrics. In an interview with hiphopdx.com Raekwon, who also appears on the album, responded saying: [...] "He [...] know damn well he [...] ain’t write that fuckin’ album.
