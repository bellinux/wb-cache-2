40|$|International audienceNitric oxide (NO) {{has been}} implicated in alcohol {{drinking}} behavior using NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors that are nonselective of the different isoforms of NOS. In the brain, there are two constitutive isoforms of NOS, neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS). We used an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide directed against nNOS in ethanol dependent male Wistar rats to examine the specific contribution of nNOS in the control of ethanol intake. Rats were subjected to a free-choice situation water/ethanol (10 % v/v) after chronic ethanol <b>intoxication</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> of ethanol vapor. During the free-choice situation, rats were twice daily for 4 days intracerebroventricularly injected with either saline, or end-capped phosphorothioate-protected antisense or mismatch oligodeoxynucleotide (25 microg/ 4 microl per injection), or acamprosate (1 mg/kg body weight) as reference product for its anticraving properties. Our {{results showed that the}} antisense treatment, but not the mismatch treatment, reduced both ethanol intake and ethanol preference during treatment and posttreatment periods (by 25 - 30 %) without alteration of the body weight gain. The antisense treatment, but not the mismatch treatment, also down-regulated nNOS mRNA levels (by 30 %) and NOS activity in the hippocampus. The anticraving drug, acamprosate reduced both ethanol intake (by 58 %) and ethanol preference. All these results suggest that nNOS is involved in the regulation of alcohol dependence...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} {{to define the}} {{mechanism}} of heavy metal <b>intoxication</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation,</b> morphologic observations were made on rat lungs after nasal instillation of iron colloid particles {{of positive and negative}} electric charges. Histochemical observation was also made on the liver and spleen of these animals. The instilled iron colloid particles reach the alveolar cavity easily, {{as can be seen in}} the tissue sections stained by Prussian blue reaction. Alveolar macrophages do take up them avidly both of positive and negative charges, though much less the positive particles than negative ones. In contrast, the alveolar epithelial cells take up solely positive particles by phagocytosis but not negative ones. Electron microscope observation revealed that the positive particles are ingested by Type I epithelial cells by pinocytosis and by Type II cells by phagocytosis as well. Then the iron colloid particles are transferred into the basement membrane by exocytosis. Travelling through the basement membrane they are again taken up by capillary endothelial cells by phagocytosis. Some particles were found in the intercellular clefts of capillary endothelial cells but not any iron colloid particles in the intercellular spaces of epithelial cells and in the capillary lumen. However, the liver and spleen tissues of the animals given iron colloid showed a strong positive iron reaction. On the basis of these observations, the mechanism of acute intoxication by inhaling heavy metal dusts like lead fume is discussed from the view point of selective uptake of alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial cells for the particles of the positive electric cha'rge. </p...|$|E
40|$|ALTHOUGH {{the effects}} of {{inhalation}} of toxic fumes and gases, such as carbon dioxide, found in caves and wells, carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide from smoke and fire, were undoubtedly known already in prehistoric times, these substances were never used voluntarily to produce an abnormal mental state of <b>intoxication</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> There is though one ancient exception: the priestesses of Apollo, the Pythia in Delphi and the Sybilla in Cumae reportedly inhaled mephitic and intoxicating vapours arising from a cavern, and {{under the influence of}} these fumes uttered their famous oracles. Lately a new substance has been added to the list of those used to produce intoxication—gasoline. The Noxious Agent: Gasoline or benzine, as it is called in Europe, is one of the volatile narcotic substances of the hydrocarbons, to which also belong ether, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, chloral hydrate, chloroform and petroleum. It must be considered a toxic substance, since under certain conditions it can endanger the well-being of or even kill an animal organism solely through the chemical or physical-chemical interactions between the substance and the cells of the organism. Gasoline, as one of the substances which has the property of dissolving many organic materials, including fat, which is a component of many vital human tissues, can be expected to have an injurious eifect when brought in contact with the living organism. Belonging to the group of organic solvents, it is, like all organic solvents, capable of producing some degree of narcotic effect. The greater the fat solubility in comparison to the water solubility, the more potent the narcotic properties of the compound. Thus the alcohols are weak anaesthetics, the hydrocarbons and th...|$|E
40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) {{are known}} to be {{non-volatile}} and thus to have low potential for atmospheric contamination or <b>intoxication</b> of humans <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> However ILs have the potential to contaminate soil and water as they might be water soluble and can be sorbed onto solids. The investigation of possible natural ways of reducing the concentration of ILs in the environment is of high importane, especially because the requirement for biodegradable chemicals increases, together with pressure for reduction of incineration and landfill waste. It was found that the upper concentration threshold for primary biodegradation of 1 -methyl- 3 -octylimidazolium chloride is 0. 2 mM. At higher concentrations the dehydrogenase activity of the cells dropped markedly, indicating that the IL inhibits cell activity. This concentration is in good agreement with the minimal inhibitory concentration of the same compound found for a series of bacteria and fungi by this research group. The sorption of 1 -methyl- 3 -octylimidazolium chloride was found to be significant, and the sorption coefficient was determined to be 98. 2 L kg- 1...|$|R
40|$|Cadmium, a {{transition}} metal, is highly toxic to reproductive tissues causing organ damage and functional deficiency in both males (Blottner et al., 1999; Foote, 1999; Leoni et al., 2002) and females (Wier et al., 1990; De Swapan et al., 1993; Bires et al., 1995; Hen Chow & Cheng, 2003; Nampoothiri et al., 2007; Zhang & Jia, 2007; Thompson et al., 2008). Toxic effects indicate that environmental cadmium exposure may significantly threatens the reproductive performance and, therefore, population survival.

40|$|The {{salicylate}} trap method, {{combined with}} microdialysis, {{has been used}} to validate whether reactive oxygen species, particularly hydroxyl radicals, ((*) OH), are generated in the hippocampus of male Wistar rats after acute intraperitoneal administration of either ethanol, 2 and 3 g/kg, or acetaldehyde, 200 mg, or during the initial stages of ethanol withdrawal after chronic ethanol intoxication. Salicylate (5 mM) was infused into the hippocampus via the microdialysis probe and the products of its metabolism by hydroxyl radical, particularly 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (2, 3 -DHBA) as well as 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (2, 5 -DHBA) assayed by HPLC (High Pressure Liquid Chromatography). Acetaldehyde, 200 mg/kg, and the higher acute dose of ethanol, 3 g/kg, induced transitory increases in 2, 3 -DHBA and 2, 5 -DHBA microdialysate content. At the cessation of four weeks of chronic ethanol <b>intoxication,</b> (<b>by</b> the vapour <b>inhalation</b> method), the mean blood alcohol level was 1. 90 g/l. Significant increases of microdialysate 2, 3 -DHBA and 2, 5 -DHBA levels were assayed 3 h after alcohol withdrawal which were sustained for a further 5 and 1 h 40 min respectively. Oral administration of Acamprosate, 400 mg/kg/day, during the chronic ethanol intoxication procedure prevented the increased formation of 2, 3 - and 2, 5 -DHBA by comparison to rats chronically ethanol intoxicated alone...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{dynamics}} of diethyllead excretion in rabbit urine {{according to the}} dose and method of administration of tetraethyllead were studied. Investigations were made on male rabbits which were given two doses of tetraethyllead (12 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg) using intravenous and intragastric methods. Rabbits were also exposed for five hours to tetraethyllead at a concentration of 200 pg/m 3 in the air. The results show {{the relation of the}} diethyllead excretion in rabbit urine to the dose and method of administration. A method for determining diethyllead (Et 2 Pb+ 2) in urine published recently showed that this compound is a specific indicator not only for assessing acute intoxication ' but also for evaluating occupational exposure to tetraethyllead (Et 4 Pb). 2 Yamamura et al, 3 using the method of Yamamuchi eta 1, 4 also identified the presence of Et 2 Pb` 2 in human urine after an acute <b>intoxication</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> The results of previous studies indicate that there is a correlation between the magnitude of exposure to Et 4 Pb and the level of Et 2 Pb+ 2 excretion in human urine. 2 Bolanowska and Garczyinski examined the metab-olism of Et 4 Pb in rabbits and suggested that the metabolism of this compound proceeds through the formation of Et 2 Pb+ 2 as an intermediate metabolite. 5 Arai etal confirmed this suggestion and showed that Et 2 Pb` 2 is the predominant metabolite excreted in rabbit urine. 6 7 The aim of the current work was to establish the {{dynamics of}} Et 2 Pb + 2 excretion in rabbit urine according to the dose and method of administering Et 4 Pb. For comparison, the dynamics of Et 2 Pb 42 excretion in the urine of subjects occupationally exposed to Et 4 Pb were also examined. Materials and method...|$|E

40|$|Harmful benthic microalgae blooms are an {{emerging}} phenomenon causing health and economic concern, especially in tourist areas. This {{is the case}} of the Mediterranean Sea, where Ostreopsis ovata blooms occur in summer, with increasing regularity. Ostreopsis species produce palytoxin (PTX) and analogues, and a number of deaths directly associated with the ingestion of PTX contaminated seafood have been reported. PTX {{is considered one of the}} most toxic molecules occurring in nature and can provoke severe and sometimes lethal intoxications in humans. So far in temperate areas, O. ovata blooms were reported to cause <b>intoxications</b> of humans <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> and irritations <b>by</b> contact. In addition, invertebrate mass mortalities have been reported, possibly linked to O. ovata blooms, although other causes cannot be ruled out, such as oxygen depletion or high seawater temperature. In order to improve our knowledge about the direct toxicity of this species on invertebrate and vertebrate marine organisms, we performed an ecotoxicological screening to investigate the toxic effects of different concentrations of O. ovata (cultured in the laboratory and sampled in the field during blooms) on crustaceans and fish as model organisms. Artemia salina, Tigriopus fulvus, and Amphibalanus amphitrite larvae and juveniles of the sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax were used as model species. Toxic effects associated with cultured O. ovata cells were investigated using a crossed design: testing two different temperatures (20 and 25 C), four different cell concentrations, and four treatments (untreated O. ovata culture, filtered and resuspended algal cells, growth medium devoid of algal cells, and sonicated algal cells). The results indicate that the toxicity of cultured O. ovata is related to the presence of living O. ovata cells, and that this effect is amplified by temperature. Furthermore, both tests with laboratory cultured algae and field sampled cells pointed out that A. salina is the most sensitive species even at concentrations below the Environmental Alarm Threshold set by the Italian Ministry of Health. Some possible explanations of such sensitivity are discussed, taking into account evidence of O. ovata cells ingestion and the activity of its toxins on the Naþ/Kþ-ATPase...|$|R
