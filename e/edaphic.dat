5|$|Plants {{depend on}} certain <b>edaphic</b> (soil) and climatic factors in their {{environment}} but can modify these factors too. For example, they can change their environment's albedo, increase runoff interception, stabilise mineral soils and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants compete with other organisms in their ecosystem for resources. They interact with their neighbours {{at a variety of}} spatial scales in groups, populations and communities that collectively constitute vegetation. Regions with characteristic vegetation types and dominant plants as well as similar abiotic and biotic factors, climate, and geography make up biomes like tundra or tropical rainforest.|$|E
25|$|Fellfield {{describes}} vegetation with abundant {{bare ground}} {{and less than}} 50% plant cover. Fellfield may occur {{as a result of}} harsh climatic and/or <b>edaphic</b> factors, or recent deglaciation which has exposed bare ground.|$|E

25|$|The {{ecological}} {{requirements of}} many of the species, are those of the laurel forest and like most of their counterpart laurifolia in the world, they are vigorous species with a great ability to populate their preferred habitats. The geographical isolation and special <b>edaphic</b> conditions helped to preserve it too.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas where}} soils are {{waterlogged}} for {{all or part}} of the year, or are very infertile, sandy or acidic, they take over from climate as the predominant factor in determining the distribution of plants and animals. Such communities are said to be <b>edaphic,</b> and are found on grey dambo soils, black floodplain soils and Kalahari sands.|$|E
25|$|Kannur {{district}} is very rich in vegetation. Natural vegetation, except in some coastal regions, consists of forests. But, {{in spite of}} generally favourable climatic conditions, vegetation is not uniform. In restricted regions, with their own micro climate or special <b>edaphic</b> features, plant formations assume different characters. Thus, plant communities, ranging from psammophytes and mangroves to evergreen forests are seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{ecoregion}} harbors rich biodiversity, {{with several}} distinct plant communities, including temperate rain forests, moist inland forests, oak forests and savannas, high elevation forests, and alpine grasslands. Thirty conifer species inhabit the region, including seven endemic species, making the region {{one of the}} richest coniferous forest regions of the world in species diversity. The region also has several <b>edaphic</b> plant communities (adapted to specific soil types), notably those of the region's serpentine outcrops.|$|E
25|$|A large {{concentration}} of diverse coniferous species of trees exists in these mountains. Thirty conifer species (or more, {{depending on where}} one delineates the region) inhabit the area, including two endemic species, the Brewer's spruce and the Port Orford cedar, making the Klamath Mountains {{one of the richest}} coniferous forest regions of {{the world in terms of}} concentrated species diversity. The region also has several <b>edaphic</b> plant communities, adapted to specific soil types, notably serpentine outcrops.|$|E
25|$|The {{root system}} of white spruce is highly {{variable}} and adaptable (Wagg 1964, 1967), {{responding to a}} variety of <b>edaphic</b> factors, especially soil moisture, soil fertility, and mechanical impedance. On soils that limit rooting depth, the root system is plate-like, but it is a common misconception to assume that white spruce is genetically constrained to develop plate-like root systems irrespective of soil conditions (Sutton 1969). In the nursery, or naturally in the forest, white spruce usually develops several long “running” roots just below the ground surface (Mullin 1957).|$|E
25|$|Although {{widespread}} tolerance {{seems to}} be the norm for ectomycorrhizal fungi, adaptive metal tolerance has been suggested for a few fungi such as Pisolithus tinctorius, P. albus and species in the genus Suillus. Fungal ecotypes specialized to high levels of heavy metals {{have been found to be}} adapted to high levels of Al, Zn, Cd and Cu. Interestingly, a reduced number of species is known to be adapted to different metals with different ecotypes arising recurrently. This suggests that some species are more prone to adapt to chemically inhospitable <b>edaphic</b> environments. Suillus luteus and S. bovinus are good examples, with known ecotypes adapted to Zn, Cd and Cu. These differentiated populations accumulate lower heavy metal concentrations in their mycelia and in a slower fashion compared to sensitive ecotypes. More specifically, the accumulation of heavy metals in the fungal tissue is prevented through a mechanism that efficiently exports metals to the outside of the cell. When compared to non-mycorrhizal fine roots, ectomycorrhizae may contain very high concentrations of trace elements, including toxic metals (cadmium, silver) or chlorine.|$|E

500|$|This {{species is}} {{restricted}} to siliceous sandplain soils and will not grow in [...] calcareous soils such as the limestone plains of the Nullarbor, or even siliceous dunes with limestone at little depth. This restriction explains the disjunctions east of Israelite Bay: the species occurs only in those few locations where the existence of cliff-top dunes of deep siliceous sand provide suitable habitat. Provided the soil is siliceous and fairly dry, A.cuneatus tolerates a range of <b>edaphic</b> conditions: it grows in both lateritic sand and sands of marine origin, and it tolerates pH levels ranging from 3.8 to 6.6.|$|E

2500|$|The {{biodiversity}} of Tasmania is {{of exceptional}} biological and paleoecological interest. A state of Australia, it {{is a large}} South Pacific archipelago of one large main island {{and a range of}} smaller islands. The terrain includes a variety of reefs, atolls, [...] many small islands, and a variety of topographical and <b>edaphic</b> regions on the largest island, all of which promote the development of unusually concentrated biodiversity. During long periods geographically and genetically isolated, it is known for its unique flora and fauna. The region's climate is oceanic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{forest is}} {{characterized}} by a relatively flat landscape with alluvial plains dissected by undulating hills or high terraces. [...] The biota of the southwest Amazon moist forest is very rich because of these dramatic <b>edaphic</b> and topographical variations at both the local and regional levels. This ecoregion has the highest number of both mammals and birds recorded for the Amazonian biogeographic realm: 257 with 11 endemic species for mammals and 782 and 17 endemics for birds. The inaccessibility of this region, along with few roads, has kept most of the habitat intact.

2500|$|What is {{distinctive}} {{about this}} region is {{the diversity of}} habitats created by <b>edaphic,</b> topographic and climatic variability. Habitat heterogeneity, along with a complex geological and climatic history {{has led to a}} high cumulative biotic richness. Endemism and overall richness is high in vascular plants, invertebrates and vertebrate animals. This is the Amazon Basin’s center of diversity for palms. The rare palm Itaya amicorum is found on the upper Javari River. This ecoregion has the highest number of mammals recorded for the Amazonian biogeographic realm: 257 with 11 endemics. Bird richness is also highest here with 782 species and 17 endemics. In {{the southern part of the}} Tambopata Reserve, one area that is [...] holds the record for bird species: 554. On the white sand areas in the north, plants endemic to this soil type include Jacqueshuberia loretensis, Ambelania occidentalis, Spathelia terminalioides, and Hirtella revillae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Edaphic</b> is {{a nature}} related to soil. <b>Edaphic</b> qualities may {{characterize}} the soil itself, including drainage, texture, or chemical properties such as soil pH. <b>Edaphic</b> may also characterize organisms, such as plant communities, where it specifies {{their relationships with}} soil. <b>Edaphic</b> endemics are plants or animals endemic to areas of a specific soil type.|$|E

5000|$|Aripo savannah is a {{tropical}} savanna ecosystem {{in the northeast}} of Trinidad. It is a rare example of savannas formed due to <b>edaphic</b> factors, i.e. the growth of trees is restricted not by climate but by a shallow layer of clay. This impervious hardpan clay layer restricts the growth of roots and magnifies both seasonal flooding and seasonal drought. These factors combined with regular exposure to the uninterrupted tropical sun make the savannas a hostile environment for most plants and animals. Although the <b>edaphic</b> layer is distinct, the Aripo savannas is ecologically similar to other tropical hypersesonal savannas, such as those found within Gran Sabana in Venezuela or Cerrado in Brazil. [...] In fact, some of the dominant grassland species are shared between all three savannas.|$|E
