Each stage begins with the stage's gang beating up Hiroshi in front of Nekketsu High School and Kunio chasing after his attackers. Unlike Renegade, Kunio and the game's bosses are identified by name in-game, whereas the characters in Renegade are simply identified by the <b>generic</b> <b>identifier</b> [...] "1P" [...] or [...] "2P" [...] (depending on who is playing) and [...] "BOSS" [...] (it {{was not until the}} NES version that bosses in Renegade were given names). The bosses of Kunio-kun are as followed: Riki (りき), Shinji (しんじ), Misuzu (みすず) and Sabu (さぶ). The game ends with Hiroshi and several students of Nekketsu High School greeting Kunio outside Sabu's hideout, with Hiroshi giving Kunio a firm handshake. The game begins a new cycle, this time skipping the pre-stage introductions. Like Renegade, each character has a catch-phrase said by them in digitized voice, but spoken in Japanese.|$|E

GIN can forward a query with an (1) latency stretch with high probability and achieve high performance. In {{the absence of a}} complete distance map, its heuristic algorithms for self configuration are scalable and efficient. Routing tables are maintained using soft-state mechanisms for fault tolerance and adapting to performance updates of network distances.

The following paper describes the basic operating principles of the current BIRAL ASAS(TM) (Aerosol Size and Shape) system which measures the optically determined particle properties, on a particle by particle basis, and uses the information to describe {{the size and shape}} characteristics of the aerosol. Furthermore, recent development of the existing technology to also encompass fluorescence detection is described, which significantly increases the detection ability of the ASAS(TM) aerosol Suite. This operational improvement is a major advancement in the field of airborne biological agent detection and allows for near generic detection and warning.

However, the high volume of data generated by item-level tracking poses challenges to the applications {{as well as to}} backend databases. This paper addresses the problem of efficiently modeling identifier collections occurring in RFID-based item-tracking applications and databases. Specifically, 1) a bitmap datatype is introduced to compactly represent a collection of identifiers, and 2) a set of bitmap access and manipulation routines is provided. The proposed bitmap datatype can model a collection of <b>generic</b> <b>identifiers,</b> including 64 -bit, 96 -bit, and 256 -bit Electronic Product Codes ™ (EPCs), and {{it can be used to}} represent both transient and persistent identifier collections. Persistent identifier collections can be stored in a table as a column of bitmap datatype. An efficient primary B+tree–based storage scheme is proposed for such columns. The bitmap datatype can be easily implemented by leveraging the DBMS bitmap index implementation, which typically manages bitmaps of table row identifiers. This paper presents the bitmap datatype and related functionality, illustrates its usage in supportin...|$|R
40|$|Implementing {{access control}} {{efficiently}} and effectively {{in an open}} and distributed grid environment is a challenging problem. One {{reason for this is}} that users requesting access to remote resources may be unknown to the authorization service that controls access to the requested resources. Hence, it seems inevitable that pre-defined mappings of principals in one domain to those in the domain containing the resources are needed. A second problem in such environments is that verifying the authenticity of user credentials or attributes can be difficult. In this paper, we propose the concept of role signatures to solve these problems by exploiting the hierarchical structure of a virtual organization within a grid environment. Our approach makes use of a hierarchical identity-based signature scheme whereby verification keys are defined by <b>generic</b> role <b>identifiers</b> defined within a hierarchical namespace. We show that individual member organizations of a virtual organization are not required to agree on principal mappings beforehand to enforce access control to resources. Moreover, user authentication and credential verification is unified in our approach and can be achieved through a single role signature. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of information objects {{has always been}} important with library collections with indexes having been created in the most ancient times. Since the digital age, many specialised and <b>generic</b> persistent <b>identifier</b> (PID) systems {{have been used to}} identify digital objects. Just as many ancient indexes have died over time, so too PID systems have had a lifecycle from inception to active phase to paralysis, and eventually a fall into oblivion. Where the indexes within the Great Library at Alexandria finally succumbed to fire, technology change has been the destroyer of more recent digital indexes. We distil four PID system design principles from observations over the years that we think should be implemented by PID system architects to ensure that their systems survive change. The principles: describe how to ensure identifiers’ system and organisation independence; codify the delivery of essential PID system functions; mandate a separation of PID functions from data delivery mechanisms; and require generation of policies detailing how change is handled. In addition to suggesting specific items for each principle, we propose that a platform-independent model (PIM) be established for persistent identifiers – of any sort and with any resolver technology – in order to enable transition between present and future systems and the preservation of the identifiers’ functioning. We detail our PID system—the PID Service—that implements the proposed principles and a data model to some extent and we describe an implementation case study of an organisation’s implementation of PID systems that implement the Pillars further but still not completely. Penultimately, we describe in a Future Work section, an opportunity for the use of both the Pillars and the PIM; that of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Permanent Identifier Community Group who is seeking to “set up and maintain a secure permanent, URL re-direction service for the web”...|$|R
40|$|We {{believe that}} the task of {{developing}} large systems requires a formal approach. The complexity of these systems demands techniques and tool support to simplify the task of formal development. Often large systems are a combination of sub-components {{that can be seen}} as modules. Event-B is a formal methodology that allows the development of distributed systems. Despite several benefits of using Event-B, modularisation and reuse of existing models are not fully supported. We propose three techniques supporting the reuse of models and their respective proof obligations in order to develop specifications of large systems: composition, generic instantiation and decomposition. Such techniques are studied and tool support is defined as plug-ins by taking advantage of the extensibility features of the Event-B toolset (Rodin platform). Composition allows the combination of different sub-components and refinement is possible. A shared event approach is followed where sub-components events are composed, communicating via common parameters and without variable sharing. By reusing sub-components, proof obligations required for a valid composition are expressed and we show that composition is monotonic. A tool is developed reinforcing the conditions that allow the monotonicity and generating the respective proof obligations. Generic Instantiation allows a generic model (a machine or a refinement chain) to be instantiated into a suitable development. Generic model proof obligations are reused, avoiding re-proof and its refinement comes for free. An instantiation constructor is developed where the <b>generic</b> free <b>identifiers</b> (variables and constants) are renamed and carrier sets are replaced to fit the instance. Decomposition allows the splitting of a model into several sub-components in a shared event or shared variable style. Both styles are monotonic and sub-components can be further refined independently, allowing team development. Proof obligations of the original model are split into the different sub-components which usually results in simpler and easier to discharge proof obligations. Decomposition is supported by a practical tool permitting the use of both styles. We expect to close the gap between the use of formal methods in academia and industry. In this thesis we address the important aspect of having tools supporting well-studied formal techniques that are easy to use by model developers.
