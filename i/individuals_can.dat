5|$|Archaea show {{high levels}} of {{horizontal}} gene transfer between lineages. Some researchers suggest that <b>individuals</b> <b>can</b> be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. A second concern is to what extent such species designations have practical meaning.|$|E
5|$|As {{the species}} has no fixed nest sites that <b>individuals</b> <b>can</b> use to locate their own partner or chick, emperor {{penguins}} {{must rely on}} vocal calls alone for identification. They use {{a complex set of}} calls that are critical to individual recognition between parents, offspring, and mates, displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguins. Vocalizing emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.|$|E

The key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity (since the low number of <b>individuals</b> <b>can</b> be expected to result in inbreeding depression), maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the kakapo population, and maintain public awareness and support.|$|E

5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected <b>individuals</b> <b>can</b> eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have {{the highest levels of}} the protein that causes this reaction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Individuals</b> <b>can</b> {{choose to}} resign, {{sometimes}} to avoid expulsion: three members voluntarily left the Privy Council in the 20th century: Jonathan Aitken, on 25 June 1997 following allegations of perjury; John Profumo, who resigned on 26 June 1963; and John Stonehouse, who resigned on 17 August 1976. On 4 February 2013, Chris Huhne {{announced that he}} would voluntarily leave the Privy Council after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice.|$|E

An existentialist work, the book argues that <b>individuals</b> <b>can</b> find purpose even among great suffering, and that this sense of purpose sustains them. Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in Night (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E

5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid may have {{originated}} in Europe and Asia {{but it is}} now one of the most widely distributed species of aphids. It is found throughout temperate areas of Western Europe, Asia and North America and in the cooler parts of Africa, the Middle East and South America. In the warmer parts of its range, apterous <b>individuals</b> <b>can</b> survive the winter and they may continue to reproduce asexually all year round.|$|E
5|$|The female {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the male, but may be identified by her slightly paler upperparts, a browner eyestripe and a more washed-out tone to the flanks and lower belly. In the eastern form, S.e.asiatica, some males have buff underparts like the female, and birds with this appearance are difficult to sex in the field. Young birds resemble the female, although their plumage is duller and they have paler legs. <b>Individuals</b> <b>can</b> be reliably sexed as female from about 12days old by their paler and buffer flanks, or, in some white-breasted subspecies, by the creamier hue of their underparts.|$|E

Lengths greater than 150cm (59in) are frequently observed in long hair contests. Xie Qiuping had the longest documented hair in the world, measuring 5.627 m (18ft 5.54 in) in May 2004.|$|E
5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory hypothesizes that {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, one study found that activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to oneself and others, or hyper-systemizing, which hypothesizes that autistic <b>individuals</b> <b>can</b> systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two major}} {{reproductive}} strategies of teleosts; semelparity and iteroparity. In the former, an individual breeds once after reaching maturity and then dies. This is because the physiological changes that come with reproduction eventually lead to death. Salmon of the genus Oncorhynchus are well known for this feature; they hatch in fresh water and then migrate to the sea for up to four years before travelling back to their place of birth where they spawn and die. Semelparity is also known to occur in some eels and smelts. The majority of teleost species have iteroparity, where mature <b>individuals</b> <b>can</b> breed multiple times during their lives.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, sales {{took place}} in the {{daffodil}} fields prior to harvesting the bulbs, but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting. In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs, some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While <b>individuals</b> <b>can</b> visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.|$|E
5|$|Whole colonies can {{reproduce}} asexually, forming two colonies {{with the}} same genotype. The possible mechanisms include fission, bailout and fragmentation. Fission occurs in some corals, especially among the family Fungiidae, where the colony splits into two or more colonies during early developmental stages. Bailout occurs when a single polyp abandons the colony and settles on a different substrate {{to create a new}} colony. Fragmentation involves individuals broken from the colony during storms or other disruptions. The separated <b>individuals</b> <b>can</b> start new colonies.|$|E
