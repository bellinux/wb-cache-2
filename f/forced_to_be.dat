5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E
5|$|September 15, 1999– Hurricane Floyd {{parallels}} {{the shore of}} the Delmarva Peninsula as a tropical storm. Chestertown, reports a maximum rainfall total of 14inches (350mm), with other locales reporting similar values. Extreme river flooding causes moderate damage to bridges and roads, resulting in a damage toll of $7.9million (1999USD, $10million 2008USD) throughout the state. In addition, over 250,000 residents are without electricity because of high winds blowing down power lines. More than 28people are <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rescued by boat as a result of severe flooding. Nine other people were from an apartment building near Great Mills. Two people are injured and one person is killed by carbon monoxide after losing power and running a generator inside their home. Also, a 12‑year-old boy is caught in flood waters and is swept a half mile (800m) down a drainage ditch before being rescued and treated for hypothermia.|$|E

5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Cage {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Samoa Joe. The added stipulation to this bout was if Joe lost, he {{would be forced to}} retire from professional wrestling forever. Frank Trigg provided commentary for this match. The match was primarily technical, with each combatant switching through various holds and submission maneuvers. One such submission was the Figure-Four Leglock, which Angle applied to Joe. Angle was forced to release the hold when Joe grabbed the bottom rope. Joe then applied a Boston Crab, before switching to an STF, which Angle countered into an Ankle Lock. Following the hold being broken, Angle performed his signature Olympic Slam maneuver on Joe for a near-fall. Later, Joe applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission on Angle, which was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released when Angle grabbed the bottom rope. The match finally came to a conclusion when Joe lifted up Angle and slammed him to the mat back-first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then covered for the pinfall at 17 minutes and 45 seconds to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Despite Brueys hopes, Nelson was {{determined}} to press home his attack at once and ordered his ships to advance, only pausing to fit springs on their anchor cables, which {{would allow them to}} easily direct their broadsides in cramped, shallow coastal waters. Without an accurate chart of the bay, Nelson was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cautious in his advance, and ordered Captain Samuel Hood in Zealous to take soundings as he advanced to establish the depth of the bay. At 18:20, as the British ships HMS Goliath and Zealous rounded the northern shoal, the leading French ships Guerrier and Conquérant opened fire. As he approached the French line, Captain Thomas Foley in Goliath noticed that Brueys had made a serious error in the distribution of his forces. Rather than place his lead ship Guerrier close to the northern shoal, the French admiral had left a gap, widened by the order for the French fleet to only anchor by the bow which meant that they drifted significantly, between Guerrier and the shoals. Sailing directly through this gap, Foley raked Guerrier and engaged the second ship of the French line, Conquérant. Zealous also passed through the gap and attacked Guerrier, and was followed by HMS Orion, HMS Theseus and HMS Audacious, all of which opened up a fierce fire on the first four French ships against their unprepared port sides.|$|E

After a brief hiatus, Hardy returned on the August 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, {{where he and}} Matt made an agreement that if Matt would lose his second match against Carter for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, then Jeff would become his personal assistant. Matt was unsuccessful, and Jeff was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Carter's assistant. On the September 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, after refusing to hit Spud, then hitting Carter with a Twist of Fate, Hardy quit as Carter's personal assistant, therefore also (storyline) quitting TNA. On the September 30 episode of Impact Wrestling, TNA President Dixie Carter announced that Hardy would be the special guest referee in the three-way dance TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Carter, his brother Matt, and Drew Galloway at Bound for Glory. At the event, Hardy turned on Carter by hitting him with a steel chair with Matt hitting the Twist of Fate, thus giving Matt his first TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy made an appearance on January 5, 2016 episode of Impact Wrestling on its live Pop TV debut backstage and ringside to support his brother Matt in the semi-finals and finals of the TNA World Title Series, which Matt had later lost.|$|E
