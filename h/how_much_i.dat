Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years.

On 9 October 1733, Swift wrote: [...] "Now, you may please to remember <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>I</b> complained of Motts suffering some friend of his (I suppose it was Mr Took a Clergy-man now dead) not onely to blot out some things that he thought might give offence, but to insert a good deal of trash contrary to the Author's manner and Style, and Intention." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>I</b> like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E

Chauvel thus, on 2 August 1917, became the first Australian to permanently command a corps.
