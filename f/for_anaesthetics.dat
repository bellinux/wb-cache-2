50|$|Stereoisomers that {{represent}} mirror images {{of each other}} are termed enantiomers or optical isomers (for example, the isomers of R-(+)- and S-(−)-etomidate).Physicochemical effects of enantiomers are always identical in an achiral environment (for example in the lipid bilayer). However, in vivo enantiomers of many general anaesthetics (e.g. isoflurane, thiopental, etomidate) can differ greatly in their anaesthetic potency despite the similar oil/gas partition coefficients. For example, the R-(+) isomer of etomidate is 10 times more potent anaesthetic than its S-(-) isomer. This means that optical isomers partition identically into lipid, but have differential effects on ion channels and synaptic transmission. This objection provides a compelling evidence that the primary target <b>for</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> is not the achiral lipid bilayer itself but rather stereoselective binding sites on membrane proteins that provide a chiral environment for specific anaesthetic-protein docking interactions.|$|E

50|$|These {{observations}} were {{important because they}} demonstrated that general anaesthetics may also interact with hydrophobic protein sites of certain proteins, rather than affect membrane proteins indirectly through nonspecific interactions with lipid bilayer as mediator. It was shown that anaesthetics alter the functions of many cytoplasmic signalling proteins, including protein kinase C, however, the proteins considered the most likely molecular targets of anaesthetics are ion channels. According to this theory general anaesthetics are much more selective than {{in the frame of}} lipid hypothesis and they bind directly only to small number of targets in CNS mostly ligand(neurotransmitter)-gated ion channels in synapse and G-protein coupled receptors altering their ion flux. Particularly Cys-loop receptors are plausible targets for general anaesthetics that bind at the interface between the subunits. The Cys-loop receptor superfamily includes inhibitory receptors (GABA A, GABA C, glycine receptors) and excitatory receptors (acetylcholine receptor and 5-HT3 serotonin receptor). General anaesthetics can inhibit the channel functions of excitatory receptors or potentiate functions of inhibitory receptors, respectively. Although protein targets <b>for</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> have been partly identified the exact nature of general anaesthetic-protein interactions still remains a mystery.|$|E

Knysna hospital is a training facility for family medicine registrars and this article aims to evaluate if sufficient learning opportunities exist in Knysna hospital’s theatre to teach family medicine registrars procedural skills. METHODS:A descriptive study was undertaken of the number and type of procedures performed in Knysna hospital theatre for a one year period, and compared with the required skills,as stipulated in the national training outcomes, for the discipline. RESULTS:Three thousand seven hundred and forty one procedures were performed during the study period. Anaesthesia was the most common procedure, followed by caesarean section. There were adequate opportunities for teaching most core skills. CONCLUSIONS: There were sufficient opportunities for a registrar to be taught all the core skills that are exclusive to theatre.

In the present study, we expressed the wild-type HSA domain 3 (wtHSAd 3), a peptide with two known anaesthetic binding sites in a yeast expression system. We also expressed a site-directed mutant of domain 3 (Y 411 Wd 3). The stability and secondary {{structure of the}} constructed fragments were determined by HX (hydrogen–tritium exchange) and CD spectroscopy. The binding of two general anaesthetics, 2 -bromo- 2 -chloro- 1, 1, 1 -trifluoroethane and propofol, to wtHSAd 3 and Y 411 Wd 3 was determined using isothermal titration calorimetry, HX and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching. Although the expressed fragments are less stable than intact wtHSA as indicated by both CD and HX, they retain the secondary structure and anaesthetic-binding characteristics of an intact HSA molecule, but with fewer binding sites. Y 411 Wd 3 had decreased affinity for propofol but not for 2 -bromo- 2 -chloro- 1, 1, 1 -trifluoroethane, consistent with steric hindrance.

We have investigated if tyrosine kinase is involved in the intracellular signal system used by propofol to cause anaesthesia. We used primary cell cultured neurones from newborn rats, pre-incubated with or without a tyrosine kinase inhibitor before propofol stimulation. The effect of propofol on tyrosine phosphorylation and changes in [Ca 2 +](i) were investigated. Propofol (3 mu g mL(- 1), 16. 8 mu M) increased intracellular calcium levels by 122 +/- 34 % (mean +/- SEM) when applied to neurones in calcium free medium. This rise in [Ca 2 +](i) was lowered by 68 % when the cells were pre-incubated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A before exposure to propofol (P < 0. 05). Propofol caused an increase (33 +/- 10 %) in tyrosine phosphorylation, with maximum at 120 s, of the beta -subunit of the GABA(A) -receptor.

40|$|By {{increasing}} {{the knowledge of}} physiological responses in different fish species and improving handling protocols by making them more species specific, one can potentially increase production in aquaculture. Bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis is central in Asian aquaculture, but knowledge regarding physiology, and lack of species specific protocol <b>for</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> are limited. Hence the choice of this species as study species. The present study examined the stress response in bighead carp by measuring plasma cortisol and glucose in fish after temporary water level reduction. High plasma cortisol (226 nmol- 1) and glucose (3. 4 mmol- 1) levels in control fish, and lack of significant changes in in cortisol and glucose levels after exposure to a stressor indicate that control fish were stressed. This {{may be due to}} the fish not being fully acclimatized after the change in environment, thus, more than 24 hours of acclimatization is recommended for bighead carp. There is also a possibility that the anaesthetic MS- 222 may have induced the stress response. Further studies must be conducted to determine the stress profile of bighead carp. One way to avoid handling related stress is to subject fish to temporary anaesthesia. Accordingly, efficacy of three anaesthetics, MS- 222, Benzoak and Aqui-S, were evaluated for for bighead carp fingerlings. Induction time, recovery time, and tolerance to prolonged exposure were tested for each of the sedatives. The observations in this study show that of the tested anesthetic agents and concentrations, 75 mgL- 1 MS- 222 gave the most satisfactory results for bighead carp. Induction and recovery times were short, and there was a good safety margin. In rural areas of developing countries piscicidal plants are used for traditional ethnical fishing. Such plants may be of interest for aquaculture and fish management since they have known biological effects which can potentially have qualities for the development of future commercial use. A pilot study was conducted to observe piscicidal effects from the plant mauwa Engelhardia spicata, when applied in rivers (by local fishermen) and under controlled exposure in aquariums. The plant extract proved to be toxic to fish. The extract caused bleeding from the gills, which is most likely a non-reversible damage. Based upon this it is believed that the use of mauwa plant extracts for fishing in river systems may have detrimental ecological consequences. </p...|$|E
40|$|Postoperative {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (PONV) are common complications after general anaesthesia, which influence the postoperative recovery {{as well as}} the time to discharge in an ambulatory setting. Additional factors like pain, edema, poor oral intake and psychological side effects may also influence the postoperative course. In this prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study the clinical efficacy of 8 mg dexamethasone versus 1, 25 mg droperidol was investigated for the prevention of PONV, postoperative pain, edema and postoperative recovery. 150 patients scheduled for the removal of 2 to 4 third molars receiving standardized general anaesthesia were enrolled in this investigation. 30 minutes, 4, 8, and 24 hours postoperatively pain and nausea were assessed using visual analogue scales. In addition, anxiety and state of tension using the Erlanger anxiety and tension-scale, emetic episodes, retching {{as well as the}} use of antiemetic and analgesic medication were evaluated. On the following day patients’ satisfaction was measured using the Quality of Recovery-Score, side effects were documented and the postoperative swelling was clinically and sonograhically examined. 147 patients were included in the analysis. Patients’ characteristics were comparable in all three groups. The predicted risk for PONV using Apfel’s simplified score was about 36 % for all groups. The need <b>for</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> and the duration of anaesthesia and operation were also similar. After induction of anaesthesia patients receiving droperidol had a significantly increased heart rate compared with placebo and after dexamethasone a significantly higher blood pressure, both without any clinical consequences. The incidence of PONV was 62 % in the placebo group, 55 % after droperidol and 42 % after dexamethasone (differences were not significant). Late PONV occurred significantly more often with droperidol compared to dexamethasone use. In turn, the use of antiemetic drugs was significantly higher in the placebo group. Following dexamethasone patients showed lower pain levels and had a significantly reduced need for analgesic medication from 8 to 24 hours postoperative. Dexamethasone significantly facilitated the early tolerance of food and an earlier mobilization. Patients from the dexamethasone group had less sedation and mood swings. Anxiety and state of tension were significantly improved after dexamethasone. Other side effects were not detected in any group. Patients from the dexamethasone group could fall asleep significantly better even though the quality of sleep was equal between the groups. The clinical and sonographical examination of facial edema showed a significantly reduced swelling as well as less trismus for patients receiving dexamethasone. Sensory disturbances did not differ between the groups. Furthermore patients’ satisfaction and quality of recovery were significantly improved by dexamethasone. This study provides evidence that a single prophylactic dose of dexamethasone has a good clinical efficacy in the prevention of common complications after removal of wisdom teeth in general anaesthesia. In combination with a low NNT, a favourable price and no evidence of relevant side effects dexamethasone treatment may be recommended for patients scheduled for this intervention...|$|E
