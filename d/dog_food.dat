They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small rodents, reptiles, other amphibians, birds, and even bats and a range of invertebrates, they also eat plants, <b>dog</b> <b>food,</b> and household refuse.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned <b>dog</b> <b>food.</b> Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
50|$|Less {{expensive}} <b>dog</b> <b>foods</b> generally include less meat, {{and more}} animal by-products and grain fillers. Proponents {{of a natural}} diet criticize {{the use of such}} ingredients, and point out that regulations allow for packaging that might lead a consumer to believe that they are buying natural food, when, in reality, the food might be composed mostly of ingredients such as those listed above. More expensive <b>dog</b> <b>foods</b> may be made of ingredients suitable for organic products or free range meats. Lamb meal is a popular ingredient.

Some species are completely herbivorous, feeding on flowers, fruit, and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of leaf, and the shoots of young plants. Others are more predatory and include in their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, scale insects, and aphids. Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings, and fungi. In captivity, many species have been successfully reared on a diet of ground, commercial dry <b>dog</b> <b>food,</b> supplemented with lettuce and aphids.|$|E

While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions {{to help pay for the}} cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from people seeking the RNC's address, while Western Union was caught off guard by Nixon's request that listeners wire the RNC, and had no extra help on hand.

5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to <b>dog</b> <b>food</b> and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{remains very}} popular in the UK, with {{multiple}} winner at Cruft's, {{and is in the}} top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth and in advertising by companies such as Cesar <b>dog</b> <b>food</b> and Scottish whisky Black & White. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. The breed can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents.|$|E

40|$|The {{nutritive value}} of <b>dog</b> <b>foods</b> {{declared}} {{by the manufacturer}} as nutritionally complete and balanced can be best assessed by feeding trials with dogs. A protocol of a feeding trial has been developed and tested with working dogs fed two different commercial complete and balanced diets for 8 weeks. The parameters used for evaluating the effect of diets were general health status, body and hair coat condition, change of body weight, haematological parameters (white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cell (RBC) count, haemoglobin, packed cell volume), and biochemical parameters in blood serum (alanine aminotransferase, urea, albumin). The trial protocol proved to be appropriate to monitor the dogs' nutritional status and to reveal differences between diets. This method of evaluation is recommended for use in supporting the nutritional claims (labelling) of <b>dog</b> <b>foods.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The {{teeth of}} V.salvadorii do not {{resemble}} those of other monitor species, which are typically blunt, peglike, and face slightly rearward. Their upper teeth are long and fang-like, standing vertical from the jawbone, designed to hook into fast-moving or feathered prey such as birds, bats, and rodents. Their lower teeth are housed in a fleshy sheath. In the wild, V. salvadorii is the top predator in New Guinea, feeding on birds, eggs, small mammals, and carrion. Natives have reported that it can take down pigs, deer, and hunting dogs, and hauls its prey into the canopy to consume it. Captive specimens {{have been known to}} eat fish, frogs, rodents, chickens, and <b>dog</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
5|$|The walrus and {{polar bear}} hunts were filmed in July 1932 at Herald Island in the Chukchi Sea. Walrus {{carcasses}} {{were used as}} <b>dog</b> <b>food</b> and to attract polar bears. Additional polar bear hunting was filmed in March 1933 off Cape Lisburne. The bowhead whale hunt was filmed from late April to July 1933 in two locations: Off Point Hope, Alaska, and off Cape Serdtse-Kamen on the Chukchi Peninsula. The whale hunting shoot took nearly three months because the whales kept fleeing every time they spotted boats. As depicted in the film, the Inupiat also hunted polar bears by roping and drowning them, but little of this footage {{made it into the}} picture.|$|E
5|$|Electricians had power {{restored}} to the Freeport area by {{the day after the}} storm, and had power {{restored to}} most of the western portion of the island within three weeks after the hurricane. Work crews quickly removed road debris and tree limbs, and by the day after the passage of Wilma most roads were cleared. The passage of the hurricane left 1,000–4,000people and hundreds of animals homeless. In response, the Grand Bahama Humane Society distributed about 340kg (750lb) of <b>dog</b> <b>food</b> and treated or euthanized injured animals, depending on their condition. The earlier effects of Wilma on Mexico left many tourist areas in that country closed, leading to a 10% increase in tourism in the Bahamas in December 2005. By about three weeks after the hurricane, the airport on Grand Bahama Island was reopened, and all but one resort were also reopened; the remaining resort was reopened about two months after the hurricane.|$|E

Claude is seen flying upward out of the scene. A moment later, we see Claude with his claws stuck into the ceiling, shaking like a leaf. Frisky downs his dinner in a flash of a second and runs off. Claude becomes disgusted with the dog and begins murmuring in his kitty voice.|$|R

5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats <b>dog</b> <b>food</b> from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E

Uncooked chicken, beef and rabbit meat contained approximately 30 mmol kg- 1 of Cr. Ox-heart and ox-liver had Cr concentrations f 22. 5 and 2. 3 mmol kg- 1, respectively. Canned <b>dog</b> <b>foods</b> had Cr concentrations f 0. 5 to 2 mmol kg- 1. Dried meat samples had Cr concentrations f 90 to 100 mmol kg- 1 dry weight. In contrast, the Cr concentration f dried rendered meat meal was 3 mmol kg- 1 dry weight or less. Dry <b>dog</b> <b>foods</b> con-tained 0. 5 to 4 mmol kg- 1 dry weight of Cr.
