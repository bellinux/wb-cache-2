5|$|The shapeshifter was {{an enigmatic}} and mysterious {{character}} in the StarCraft Universe. Very {{little is known about}} this creature, beyond the fact that the shapeshifter was in fact a Xel'Naga, and was by its own admission several thousand years old. In each case that the shapeshifter has appeared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> role the creature has assumed the form of a Terran Male. The Shapeshifter's allegiance was to the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, and accordingly its actions were to further Amon's own goals.|$|E
5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next decade and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.|$|E

25|$|Most current {{studies of}} bilingual lexical access {{are based on}} the {{comprehension}} of isolated words without considering whether contextual information affects lexical access in bilinguals. However, in everyday communication, words are most often encountered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> context and not in isolation (e.g. in a newspaper article). Research done by Déprez (1994) has shown that mixed utterances in children are not limited to the lexical level but also in the areas of morphology, syntax, and pronunciation. Researchers also began to investigate the cognitive nature of bilingual lexical access in context by examining word recognition in sentences.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} link {{sequence}} read abundance to {{expression of a}} particular gene, transcript sequences are aligned to a reference genome, or de novo aligned to one another if no reference is available. The key challenges for alignment software include sufficient speed to permit billions of short sequences to be aligned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> timeframe, flexibility to recognise and deal with intron splicing of eukaryotic mRNA, and correct assignment of reads that map to multiple locations. Software advances have greatly addressed these issues, and increases in sequencing read length are further reducing multimapping reads. A list of currently available high-throughput sequence aligners is maintained by the EBI.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} study (published May 1, 2013), it is {{suggested}} that the inflammation of the hypothalamus may be connected to our overall aging bodies. They focused on the activation of the protein complex NF-κB in mice test subjects, which showed increased activation as mice test subjects aged in the study. This activation not only affects aging, but affects a hormone known as GnRH, which has shown new anti-aging properties when injected into mice outside the hypothalamus, while causing the opposite effect when injected into the hypothalamus. It'll be some time before this can be applied to humans <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> way, as more studies on this pathway are necessary to understand the mechanics of GnRH's anti-aging properties.|$|E
25|$|Rader {{found that}} the Live Traffic paper was in a {{situation}} much more similar to the uncatalogued thesis in In re Bayer than the publicly disseminated posters in In re Klopfenstein. Rader concluded that the pre-publication Live Traffic paper could not be considered catalogued or indexed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> way and {{was not intended to}} be disseminated to the public. Rader concluded that, without additional information about the structure of SRI's FTP server, genuine issues of fact should have prevented the Delaware District Court from rendering summary judgment on the patent invalidity issues. The Federal Circuit thus vacated and remanded the Delaware District Court's determination of invalidity based on the Live Traffic paper.|$|E

25|$|While not overtly political, {{the film}} {{documents}} {{that the federal}} government of the United States under the Presidency of George W. Bush joined the auto-industry suit against California in 2002. This pushed California to abandon its ZEV mandate regulation. The film notes that Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card had recently been head of the American Automobile Manufacturers Alliance in California and then joined the White House with Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and other federal officials who were former executives or board members of oil and auto companies. By failing to increase mileage standards <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> way since the 1970s and now interfering in California, the federal government had again served short-term industry interests at the expense of long-range leadership on issues of oil dependency and cleaner cars.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{a seminal}} case {{applying}} this principle is R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Venables (1997). In this case, the Home Secretary had {{taken into account}} public opinion when deciding upon the tariff of 15 years for holding in custody two boys detained at Her Majesty's pleasure for having murdered James Bulger, a two-year-old child, {{when they were both}} ten years old. Lord Steyn held that the public petitions considered were worthless and incapable of informing the Home Secretary <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> way of the true state of public opinion in respect of the tariff. Hence, the reliance on the public petition in coming up with its decision was an irrelevant consideration which justified the setting-aside of the Home Secretary's decision.|$|E
25|$|Back at St Mary's the {{following}} week, the Saints hosted current champions Manchester City in the return {{game of the}} opening match of the season. The game began relatively quickly, and within seven minutes the hosts had scored as Jason Puncheon took advantage of a mistake by Gareth Barry to cross in for Jay Rodriguez; the effort was saved, but Puncheon followed it up {{from the edge of}} the area to put Southampton 1–0 up. The home side continued the pressure on the visitors, and in the 22nd minute Steven Davis made it two when Joe Hart failed to catch a shot from Rickie Lambert with the midfielder running into the box for the tap-in. Rodriguez almost scored a third for Southampton, volleying narrowly wide, but City replied before the break with a counter-attack goal from Edin Džeko set up by Pablo Zabaleta. The half ended with a strong penalty call for Southampton, and after the break the Saints continued to play for a third goal; it came quickly, as Barry's bad fortunes continued when he turned Lambert's cross into his own net despite very little pressure on the ball to make it 3–1 to the 16th-placed side. Despite a change in personnel and tactics, City were unable to get back into the game <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> way, giving Southampton their first win since 12 January to move up to 15th.|$|E
