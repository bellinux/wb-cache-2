Freight trains are very efficient, with economy of scale and <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> However, their use can be reduced by lack of flexibility, if there is need of transshipment {{at both ends of the}} trip due to lack of tracks to the points of pick-up and delivery.

25|$|Because of ammonia's {{vaporization}} properties, it is {{a useful}} refrigerant. It was commonly used prior to the popularisation of chlorofluorocarbons (Freons). Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and low cost. It suffers from the disadvantage of toxicity, which restricts its domestic and small-scale use. Along with its use in modern vapor-compression refrigeration it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in absorption refrigerators. The Kalina cycle, which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants, depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia–water mixture. Ammonia coolant is also used in the S1 radiator aboard the International Space Station in two loops which are used to regulate the internal temperature and enable temperature dependent experiments.|$|E

30|$|The {{choice of}} whether to use DIV or DRCP depends on the {{spectral}} efficiency constraints. In the transmit power-dominated regime, DIV has a <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> than DRCP when the minimum spectral efficiencies are small, while DRCP has a <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> when the minimum spectral efficiencies are large. This is because DIV requires more time slots per transmission round, and hence a higher transmit power, especially when the spectral efficiency constraint is high. In the circuit power-dominated regime, the transmit power used is maximum or binary; hence, the number of time slots are not considered. Therefore, DIV shows a <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> for any spectral efficiency constraints. However, in both cases, the success rate for DIV drops faster than that for DRCP.|$|R

500|$|Fast and energetic, the {{porbeagle}} can {{be found}} singly or in groups. Its fusiform body, narrow caudal peduncle with lateral keels, and crescent-shaped tail are adaptations for efficiently sustaining speed, which have also been independently evolved by tunas, billfishes, and several other groups of active fishes. It and the salmon shark are the thickest-bodied members of their family (length-depth ratio approaching 4.5), and consequently have the stiffest swimming style: they oscillate their tails while holding their bodies mostly rigid, which confers propulsive power with <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> but {{at the cost of}} maneuverability. The large gill surface area of the porbeagle allows more oxygen to be delivered to its tissues. It also has a short band of aerobic [...] "red muscle" [...] along each side, which can contract independently of the regular [...] "white muscle" [...] at a lower energy cost, enhancing the shark's stamina.|$|E

30|$|The current normal {{representation}} in Fig.  4 will {{change in a}} future scenario as new and renovated buildings have <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> which in general will lower the consumption of electricity for heating and cooling, and thereby shift the normal operating consumption towards zero.

The irradiance scale in Fig.  4 can be considered as the percentage from 0 to 100 % of rated PV power, as PV penetration increase in the future, the normal operating irradiance is shifted towards the right.|$|R
