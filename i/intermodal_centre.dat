This update 1 paper provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, through revised results for the period 1997 - 2003. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, it also provides some information about the financial situation of a few vital sectors in each port. A global indication concerning the financial health of the companies studied is also provided, using the NBB bankruptcy prediction model. In addition, it includes figures with respect to the ongoing growth of several cargo traffic segments and provides an overall picture of social developments in the Flemish maritime ports. The indirect effects of these port activities are estimated in terms of value added and employment. Annual account data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects were estimated on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. In the Flemish maritime ports, direct VA came to almost 11. 5 billion euro and total VA - the sum of direct and indirect VA - to 22 billion euro in 2003. In the same year direct and total employment reached respectively 105, 000 and 239, 000 full-time equivalents, while direct investment reached 2. 5 billion euro. The ongoing developments in the maritime ports sector in the Hamburg - Le Havre range continue to affect the port operations: concentration of capital, privatisation of port logistic services, expansion and dispersion of foreign trade, internationalisation of production and consumption patterns, increase in containerised shipments, etc. Production, trade and transport are no longer considered as individual and isolated activities, but are integrated within a single system, while economies of scale continue. Therefore, ports are becoming real logistic centres: ports able to add value to the goods passing through the port area have a major advantage in a climate of increasing international competition. Flemish ports are following this trend, and that is also reflected in the analysis presented in this report. branch survey, maritime cluster, subcontracting, indirect effects, transport intermodality, public investments. ...|$|R

This update paper provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports and the Li 8 ge port complex in the period 2000 - 2005, with an emphasis on 2005. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information about the financial situation in each port. A global indication concerning the financial health of the companies studied is also provided. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. 2005 was a year of steady growth for most Flemish maritime ports, in terms of quantity of cargo handled and value added, although there was a slight deceleration in comparison to the previous year. The employment situation was, by contrast, somewhat mixed, while investment soared, far exceeding the pace recorded since 2000. The current changes in world trade patterns are having a substantial impact on the operations of the Flemish and Li 8 ge ports, situated at the heart of one of the wealthiest and busiest trading regions of the world. To cope with the accelerating internationalisation of port competition and the tremendous growth of containerised seaborne transport, the ports concerned need to constantly adapt their infrastructures, through innovation and investment. As major logistic centres, they have to face the challenge of responding to increasing demand in terms of capacity, while adding as much value as possible to the goods passing through them. Accessibility and seamless connections with the hinterland are key to their success and durability. This has become absolutely vital in a climate of growing regional and international competition, accentuated by the booming Asian economies. The port of Li 8 ge is striving to turn a threat into an opportunity. In the wake of the Cockerill Sambre blast furnace closure, the Li 8 ge port complex is undergoing a major restructuring. Cargo figures were down sharply in 2005, while the economic situation of the area was dominated by stagnation or decline in terms of value added, employment and investment. However, this fall could be shortlived since the revival expected from the development of value-added logistics will also generate increased activity, traffic and demand for manpower.

But the employment situation was more mixed, and private investment dropped. The ongoing developments in the maritime ports sector and in the world economy are having a dramatic impact on the operations of the Flemish ports, which have to deal with the global trend of increasing international competition, expansion and dispersion of foreign trade, capital concentration, privatisation and vertical integration of port logistic services, increase in containerised shipments, and so forth. At the same time, as major logistic centres, they have to face a dual challenge: increasing demand in terms of capacity, and the necessity to add climate of increasing regional and international competition, not only within the Hamburg - Le Havre range but also from Asian markets. The port of Li 8 ge, still the second largest inland port in Europe, is striving to turn a threat into an opportunity. Although the Cockerill Sambre blast furnaces are being closed, that is creating new space and the overall Li 8 ge port complex is being restructured. In spite of this climate of uncertainty, the main goal of the Autonomous Port of Li 8 ge is to establish itself as a major logistic centre in the region, able to attract new businesses.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 20 th Annual South African Transport Conference 16 - 20 July 2001 "Meeting the transport challenges in Southern Africa", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: Increasing importance {{has been placed on}} the development of <b>intermodal</b> transport <b>centres.</b> Planning for these facilities could prove especially useful in middle-income countries, such as South Africa or Chile, where a sizeable proportion of the urban population depends on public transport; indeed, an effective network of transfer centres could provide better access to many working class residents living on the urban periphery. Many issues central to the development of these centres are discussed in the paper: definition of a transport centre; government’s role in establishing a network of centres; operational concerns; and impacts on surrounding land uses. In San Francisco, local transport policy has identified issues central to the establishment of a centre (e. g. safety, comfort, reliability, connectivity, access to other modes); however, planners there have only recently come to realize the role that transport centres can play in facilitating economic growth and providing better access to non-motorised modes, such as walking and bicycling. This paper concludes that many cities in middle-income countries {{are in a position to}} establish effective transport centre criteria, based on local transport objectives,needs and resources. At a minimum, these transport centres should improve interchange, shorten travel times and expand service coverage. In addition, they should strategically encourage the desirable development of surrounding land uses. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

[ [...] . ] In terms of maritime cargo traffic, 2007 was another excellent year for all the Flemish maritime ports, driven by the expansion of world trade. Direct value added rose in all the ports in Flanders. Both maritime and non-maritime branches as a whole expanded. The ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge enjoyed particularly high growth in direct value added of their maritime branches, unlike the ports of Ostend and Ghent where growth was higher in the non-maritime branches. Direct employment also rose, albeit in less spectacularly: the more moderate growth of the biggest Flemish port - Antwerp - set the tone for the overall result. In this favourable economic environment, investment increased in the Flemish ports as a whole, after falling in 2006. The ports of Antwerp, Ostend and Ghent recorded very high levels of investment in 2007, although not reaching Antwerp's peak of 2005. The rise was more marked in the maritime branches, especially in the ports of Antwerp and Ostende, but the non-maritime branches also recorded strong expansion. With the completion of the Albert II dock, investment in the port of Zeebrugge levelled out, even though there are some other projects in progress. The volume of cargo handled in the port of Li 8 ge again increased in 2007. Direct value added recorded strong growth and employment picked up. Both these variables improved on the previous year's figures, thanks mainly to the metalworking and energy sectors. Investment doubled. A major factor behind this increase was the construction of a new bioethanol plant in Wanze. Despite these good results, the threat of declining activity in the ArcelorMittal factories in Li 8 ge has prompted the local port to pursue its strategy of diversifying traffic. Preparatory work on the land for the Trilogiport project began at the end of 2008. The volume of cargo handled at the port of Brussels rose in 2007. Despite the restrictions on the land available for port-related activities, both value added and employment in the port of Brussels increased. There was a notable fall in investment in the non-maritime branches with the completion of the water purification plant. However, the port authority is continuing with its infrastructure renovation work.

This update paper provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Li 8 ge port complex and the port of Brussels in the period 2003 - 2008, with an emphasis on 2008. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information about social balance and the financial situation in these ports as a whole. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. In terms of maritime cargo traffic, 2008 was another good year for all the Flemish sea ports, despite the downturn recorded during the last quarter of the year. Except for Ghent, direct value added rose in all the ports in Flanders. Maritime branches as a whole expanded, but the non-maritime branches of trade and industry contracted. The ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend enjoyed growth in both maritime and nonmaritime branches, while in Antwerp and Ghent, the non-maritime branches declined. In Antwerp, however, the growth in direct value added in the maritime branches was particularly high, unlike the port of Ghent. Direct employment rose slightly during the year 2008. Again, direct employment in the maritime branches as a whole increased, whereas it declined in trade and industry. Nonetheless, a rise in employment was reported in all the Flemish ports apart from Antwerp. After the growth of 2007, investment declined marginally in the Flemish ports across the board. The ports of Antwerp, Ostend and Ghent recorded higher investment in 2008. Thanks to the port of Antwerp's shipowners, the rise was concentrated in the maritime branches, whereas the non-maritime branches as a whole declined, due to the downturn in the Antwerp region. In the other ports, investment in the non-maritime branches expanded. The volume of cargo handled in the port of Li 8 ge increased again in 2008. Direct value added and employment registered strong growth. Due to the metalworking and energy sectors, employment improved on the previous year's figures. Fuel production and the chemicals industry accounted for the growth in value added. Investment rose strongly, too. A major factor behind this increase was the construction of a new bioethanol plant in Wanze and a waste treatment plant in Herstal. At the end of the year, ArcelorMittal decided to shut down blast furnace n 06 in Seraing, a decision that will have an impact on the activity in the port of Li 8 ge. The volume of cargo handled at the port of Brussels rose again in 2008. Value added in this port increased and employment remained steady. After falling back in 2007, investment picked up thanks to the infrastructure renovation work undertaken by the port authority on the former Carcoke site. This report provides a comprehensive account of these issues, giving details for each economic sector, although the comments are confined to the main changes that occurred in 200...|$|R

This update paper 1 provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Li 8 ge port complex and the port of Brussels in the period 2001 - 2006, with an emphasis on 2006. The port of Brussels has been included in the analysis for the first time. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information about the financial situation in each port except for Brussels. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. In terms of quantity of cargo handled, 2006 was an excellent year for the Flemish maritime ports as a whole, driven by the world trade expansion. Direct value added rose in all Flemish port, except for Antwerp. Direct employment also increased, mainly in the maritime branches as a result of seaborne traffic growth. Investment on the other hand, took a downward plunge after the exceptionally high amounts in 2005. This was mainly due to a number of shipping companies and - to a lesser extent - the completion of the Deurganckdok in Antwerp. The current changes in world trade patterns have a substantial impact on the activities in the Flemish ports. To cope with the accelerating internationalisation of port competition and the tremendous growth of containerised seaborne transport, the ports need to constantly adapt their infrastructures, through innovation and investment. As major logistic centres, they have to face the challenge of responding to increasing demand in terms of capacity, while adding as much value as possible to the goods passing through them. To face this challenge, they try to focus on particular branches or aspects for which they believe they hold all the winning cards. This has become absolutely vital in a climate of growing regional and international competition, accentuated by the booming Asian economies. All figures indicate that the situation is improving for the port of Li 8 ge. The growth of value added, investment and quantity of cargo handled exceeds last year's figures. Employment still decreases but to a lesser extent. Moreover, the future is looking even brighter as the TriLogiPort project should begin to make progress, the blast furnace 6 of Arcelor in Seraing has been reopened, a new bioethanol plant is being built in Wanze and several works developing the infrastructure are being carried out. The last few years, the quantity of cargo handled at the port of Brussels has stabilised. In terms of land available for port related activities, the port of Brussels has reached its limits. As a result, the extension of the infrastructure is one of the main priorities, all the more because the port authority has set ambitious goals for the near future.

40|$|AbstractThe {{persistent}} {{growth of}} freight traffic congestion {{and air pollution}} in urban areas and the increase of imbalance and inefficiency in land use development drive public authorities and users to find alternative logistics solutions to ease the freight traffic problem. <b>Intermodal</b> freight logistics <b>centres</b> {{play an important role}} in achieving socio-economic and environmental sustainability by enhancing an optimal integration of different modes to provide an efficient and cost-effective use of the transport system through customer-oriented, door-to-door services while favouring competition among transport operators. An efficient logistics centre structure may lead to a significant profit and return on investment as well as a significantly increased competitive advantage in the market place by meeting strategic commercial objectives, where determination of the location is a key factor in enhancing the efficiency of urban freight transport systems and initializing relative sufficient supply chain activities. Hence, public authorities should consider the importance of this topic by any given decision in terms of strong economical, social and environmental implications before announcing an area as a logistics centre. The objective of this study is to explore the applicability of the way for the development of a conceptual model based on a combination of the fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and artificial neural networks (ANN) methods in the process of decision-making in order to select the most appropriate location. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the concept of proposed model...|$|R
