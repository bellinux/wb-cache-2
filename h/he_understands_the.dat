5|$|In {{the second}} and third acts, Ruth seduces a young man named Larry Winston and steals him away from his fiancée. She takes Larry to New York's Chinatown, where she gets him hooked on cocaine and steals an emerald from an idol. She meets another young man, Ned Maddox, whom she seduces and kills for {{insurance}} money, framing another man for the murder. In the final act, Ruth's death and revival is revealed to be a dream John was having. Upon waking <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> importance of the soul; he embraces religion and destroys his life-restoration device.|$|E
25|$|Kishore dwells {{into the}} {{character}} of Sivadas a sorry father for not sparing time to his family, when it mattered most and tries to understand his son's problem step by step. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> fact that Autism is not a disease to brood over, it just needs the extra affection and care rather than feeling sympathetic. Over {{a period of time}} the bonding between the teacher and the student blossoms like a bright sunflower. Does the father succeed in lodging a room in his son's imagination, what happens forms the rest of the play.|$|E
25|$|After World War II ended, and the Republic of China {{took over}} Taiwan, Lee {{enrolled}} in the National Taiwan University, where in 1948 he earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural science. Lee joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) for two stints, in September 1946 and October or November 1947, both times briefly. Lee began the New Democracy Association with four others. This group was absorbed by the CPC, and Lee officially left the party in September 1948. In a 2002 interview Lee himself {{admitted that he had}} been a Communist. In that same interview Lee said that he has strongly opposed Communism for a long time because <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> theory well and knows that it is doomed to fail. Lee stated that he joined the Communists out of hatred for the KMT.|$|E

25|$|A {{banker and}} {{financier}} by training and {{extensive experience in}} the United States, Aziz's credentials are extremely high and {{considered one of the}} successful finance minister of Pakistan. His credential records {{are similar to those of}} the successful US treasury secretaries such as Bob Rubin and Nicholas F. Brady who did well under Clinton and Reagan administrations. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> rôle of banking, finance, investment and consumer credit in economic growth of a nation. Aziz presided the strong banking sector, unprecedented investment and growth finance sectors in Pakistan to underpin its economy. He strengthened capital availability, an essential and increasingly important economic input, in addition to labour and land improvements. With higher education budget up 15-fold and overall education spending up 36% in two years, he focused on education to improve the availability of skilled labour to fill new jobs.|$|E
25|$|That Heidegger did {{not write}} this second part of Being and Time, and that the existential {{analytic}} was {{left behind in the}} course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of individual experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the collective human adventure that <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> Western philosophical tradition to be. And this would in turn raise the question of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger's account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time. There are also recent critiques in this regard that were directed at Heidegger's focus on time instead of primarily thinking about being in relation to place and space, and to the notion of dwelling, with connections too to architectural theory as impacted by phenomenology.|$|E
25|$|Curtain {{provides}} {{additional details}} on Hastings's family: He and Dulcie have {{two sons and}} two daughters. One son joins the Royal Navy, while the other and his wife manage the ranch after Dulcie's death. Hastings's daughter Grace {{is married to a}} British officer stationed in India. His other daughter, Judith, appears as a character in Curtain. Judith is Hastings's youngest child and his favourite, albeit the child whom <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> least. She marries Dr. John Franklin, a medical researcher, and moves to Africa with him. In Curtains postscript Poirot suggests that Hastings should consider a second marriage with Elizabeth Litchfield, the younger sister of a woman who was manipulated into killing her abusive father by the novel's antagonist. Poirot notes that Elizabeth must be reassured that she is not tainted by her sister's actions and that Hastings is still not unattractive to women. Age is not specifically discussed for Hastings after the first book; he is said to be 30 in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, which would leave him at least 60 years old in the earliest setting for Curtain. That novel was published in 1975, though written during the war; it has no ties to a specific time, unlike most of the Poirot stories, and {{there is no mention of}} the war or of changes in automobiles or telephones that might set the decade from late 1940s to mid 1970s.|$|E

500|$|On Matul, Dr. David Menard (Richard Johnson) {{has been}} running the {{hospital}} whilst researching [...] voodoo rites. His wife Paola (Olga Karlatos) wishes to leave the island, but Menard insists on staying until <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon. At the hospital, patients are dying of a strange illness, and the islanders are frightened by reports of people rising from the dead. Menard begins shooting corpses {{to stop them from}} reanimating. Paola is attacked at home by a zombie and dragged out through a smashed door to her death, her eye impaled on splintered wood.|$|E

His campaign spokesman responded that [...] "Al had a long career as a satirist. But <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> difference between what you say as a satirist and what you do as a senator.

500|$|... "t's not {{forcing the}} issue {{to suggest that the}} Holocaust hovers over Barton Fink", writes biographer Ronald Bergan. Others see a more {{specific}} message in the film, particularly Barton's obliviousness to Charlie's homicidal tendencies. Critic Roger Ebert wrote in his 1991 review that the Coens intended to create an allegory for the rise of Nazism. [...] "They paint Fink as an ineffectual and impotent left-wing intellectual, who sells out while telling himself he is doing the right thing, who thinks <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> 'common man' but does not understand that, for many common men, fascism had a seductive appeal". However, he goes on to say: [...] "It {{would be a mistake to}} insist too much on this aspect of the movie...." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2007, Late of the Pier {{formally}} met renowned DJ Erol Alkan {{after seeing}} him play a {{set at the}} Liars Club. Alkan called them [...] "THE most exciting band around" [...] and offered the band members help in the recording process of Fantasy Black Channel. They accepted and made him producer for the album because of the immediate rapport that developed between the two parties. Dawson has explained the choice of producer by suggesting that Alkan is famous for playing broad genres of music and that <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> properties and crossover of dance and guitar music. Alkan fully embraced the band members' ideas and immediately understood what {{they were trying to}} achieve. [...] "Bathroom Gurgle" [...] was recorded by the new collaboration and was released as a limited edition single in September 2007.|$|E
500|$|Puzzles {{in a given}} {{section of}} the island are {{presented}} in a non-linear fashion, and with the open world nature of the game, the player may encounter puzzle panels that {{they have yet to}} learn the symbolic language for. As such, players are not required to finish a puzzle once they start, and can leave and wander to any other area to solve the puzzles there, potentially gaining insight on the new symbolic language or inspiration for difficult solutions. Blow has stated that there is more to the game than these mazes, in response to concerns from players; to Blow, [...] "the point is the magic that happens in the player's mind when <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> subtle things that the mazes are saying - because the mazes aren't just puzzles, they are lines of communication that aggregate, become more complex and eventually say surprising things".|$|E

500|$|Favre spoke {{publicly}} {{for the first}} time about his potential comeback in a July 14, 2008, interview with Greta Van Susteren on the Fox News Channel's On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. In the interview, Favre said he was [...] "guilty of retiring early", that he was [...] "never fully committed" [...] to retirement, and that he was pressured by the Packers to make a decision before the NFL Draft and the start of the free agent signing period. Favre disputed the notion that {{he does not want to}} play for Green Bay and said that while <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> organization has decided to move on, they should now allow him to do the same. He made clear that he would not return to the Packers as a backup and reiterated his desire to be released rather than traded, which would allow him the freedom to play for a competitive team. Favre also accused the Packers of being dishonest, wishing the team would have been straightforward with him and the public.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Matt Rush, who had {{attended}} the concert in July, {{noted that the}} original concert was much longer than the broadcast, due to the time taken by Gaga for changing her costumes. Rush complimented Bennett's performance saying [...] "At 88, the remarkable Tony Bennett ... can still deliver the goods, and his solo rendition of 'How Do You Keep the Music Playing?' is the soaring highlight of [...] Bennett's rapport with Gaga seems genuine, {{and they have a}} sweet, unforced musical chemistry in these selections from their current album of standards." [...] Brad Oswald from the Winnipeg Free Press was impressed by the duos vocal delivery, saying that [...] "the 88-year-old crooner and the 28-year-old pop diva meld voices seamlessly as they serve up swinging duet versions of such standards". New York Daily News TV Critic David Hinckley, who awarded the concert with four out of five stars, was surprised by Lady Gaga being a [...] "multifaceted singer, not just a dance diva" [...] and stated that Gaga handled the fashion side of the event. He finished the review [...] declaring [...] "The singing in general is solid. Bennett can still hit some remarkable notes, and more important, <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Max is an {{anthropomorphic}} [...] "hyperkinetic, three-foot rabbity thing" [...] {{with white}} fur, but prefers {{being called a}} lagomorph. Max retains few characteristics consistent with a rabbit, with permanently rigid ears set in an excited posture and a huge jaw normally stuck in a crazed grin. Unhinged, uninhibited and near psychotic, Max enjoys violence and tends to prefer the aggressive way of solving problems, seeing the world {{as little more than}} a vessel for his [...] "pinball-like stream of consciousness". This creates a seeming disregard for self-preservation; Max will revel in dangerous situations with little impression that <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> risks he faces. As a result, Max is usually enthusiastic to engage in any activity, including being used by Sam as a cable cutter or an impromptu bludgeon. Despite this, Max possesses a sharp mind and an observational nature, and enjoys interpreting new experiences in as unpredictable manner as possible. However, Max has a distaste for long stories and occasionally loses focus during lengthy scenes of plot exposition; by his own admission, Max possesses a particularly short attention span. Despite his seemingly heartless personality, he believes strongly in protecting Sam. However, Max can still act violently towards his friend, stating that when he dies he will take Sam with him. Moreover, Max is extremely possessive of Sam and their status as partners and best friends. Max traditionally carries a Luger pistol, but as he wears no clothes, other characters often make comments as to where Max keeps it on his person. Purcell considers Max to be representative of pure id, the uncoordinated instinctual trends of the human psyche.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opens in}} the [...] "red reality" [...] (where Hannah {{is alive and}} Rex is not from the car accident), and Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) is jogging around Los Angeles. When Michael gets home, he talks to his wife Hannah (Laura Allen), who is in Oregon looking at a university. Later in the [...] "green reality" [...] (where Rex is alive and Hannah is not), Michael and Rex (Dylan Minnette) are stuck in traffic, and Michael is later called into work. His partner in the [...] "green reality", Isaiah [...] "Bird" [...] Freeman (Steve Harris) talks to Michael, then Michael goes for {{a run at the}} Griffith Park. He goes {{to the top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the city, while a dog appears from behind a bush and barks at him. Michael notices human flesh in him, and goes to investigate, where he finds a corpse sitting against a tree. Michael goes to the police station, and shows Captain Harper similar cases starting in 1999. In each case, a killer, nicknamed Gemini (Salvator Xuereb), vertically slashed the victim's wrists and carved a Roman numeral in their chests. The murders have taken place all across the United States, but everyone believes that Gemini is dead after an FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro (Megan Dodds) had shot him. Michael wants to cover the area as much as they can and Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) agrees, telling Michael to pick up the profiler that the FBI has sent. Michael goes to Brentwood and meets with FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro. They discuss his history and she admits that she has been focused solely on the [...] "Gemini Killer" [...] for the last 12 years. Michael confirms that they did not find one on the body, so she figures that it is a copycat. Michael goes to the crime scene, while Bird is already there. The partners go over the hillside and find the dog. They take him to Dr. Banks (Chris McGarry) and have him check his stomach, where he finds a United States two-dollar bill in it. When Michael takes the evidence to Harper and Santoro, Santoro insists that it only means that someone with classified information to the case is involved. She suggests they check anyone who has recently laid off law enforcement officers with psych problems. Bird and Santoro create a database if the killer is alive. Santoro lets Harper decide and she tells the detectives to pull the files on law officers. As Santoro leaves, Michael approaches her and says that <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> implications if the man she shot was Gemini. Meanwhile, the killer prepares a set of medical tools, a wad of two-dollar bills, and a syringe.|$|E
