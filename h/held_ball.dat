25|$|The USA team faced Australia in the semifinals. The Australian team started strong, {{opening up}} a lead as large as nine {{points in the first}} half. The USA team fought back, and were within a single point 33–32 at halftime. The USA team {{appeared}} to cruise in the second half, {{opening up a}} 13-point lead {{by the end of the}} third quarter, and extending the lead to 17 points with just over seven minutes to go in the game. Then the Australian team scored ten consecutive points to cut the lead to seven. Bria Hartley made a three-point lead to push the lead back to double-digits, but the team from Australia, led by Marianna Tolo, continued to chip away, and scored 14 of the next 16 points to take a two-point lead with just over a minute remaining. After hitting a free throw to cut the lead to a single point, the USA team forced a 24-second violation and got the ball back. Crystal Bradford missed a shot but put back her own rebound to give the USA a slim one-point lead. Tolo missed a shot which would have given the Aussies the lead, and Odyssey Sims wrested the rebound away from the Australians, but the refs signaled a <b>held</b> <b>ball.</b> The possession arrow was in favor of the Australians, so they had one more shot at a basket. Tolo missed, and this time Sims secured the rebound cleanly, and ran out the clock for a 79–78 win for the USA team.|$|E
500|$|Ball {{was born}} on April 22, 1881 in Grand Haven, Michigan. After his Major League career ended, {{he went on to}} coach the Baltimore Orioles (who were a minor league team at the time). It was there that he was {{assigned}} to train Babe Ruth, who had just come out of St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys. Ball described Ruth as [...] "the dumbest and yet the strongest player" [...] he had ever coached. The two remained good friends after Ruth broke into the Majors and even played a friendly game of bowling against one another in 1923 (with Ball edging out Ruth, winning four out of the seven games played). Ruth <b>held</b> <b>Ball</b> in great respect, and because of their close friendship in baseball, he eventually became a fan of the New York Yankees. In the 1950s, an annual bowling tournament held at the Newfield Alleys near Bridgeport, Connecticut was named after Ball in order to honor the city's famous inhabitant. On February 12, 1952, at the age of 71, his health severely deteriorated due to a heart ailment and he was rushed to Bridgeport Hospital, where he was placed on the danger list and visitors were prohibited from seeing him. Five years later, he died on October 15, 1957 and was interred at Mountain Grove Cemetery, Bridgeport.|$|E

50|$|In the NBA, WNBA or {{competitions}} {{operated by}} the Euroleague Basketball Company, a jump ball occurs {{at the start of}} the game (called the opening tip or tip off), the start of any extra period, to settle special situations where penalties cancel out and neither team is previously entitled to the ball, and to settle any <b>held</b> <b>balls.</b> <b>Held</b> <b>balls</b> occur when two opposing players both lay equal claim to the ball, and after trying to wrestle it from each other, end up in a stalemate. A jump ball may also be called if there are different calls by two or more referees.|$|R
50|$|Thursday nights were {{reserved}} for functions other than pictures and various committees <b>held</b> <b>balls</b> and concerts at the Hall.

50|$|The center {{jump ball}} {{that was used}} to restart a game after every {{successful}} field goal was eliminated in 1938, in favor of the ball being given to the non-scoring team from behind the end line where the goal was scored, in order to make play more continuous. The jump ball was still used to start the game and every period, and to restart the game after a <b>held</b> <b>ball.</b> However, the NBA stopped using the jump ball to start the second through fourth quarters in 1975, instead using a quarter-possession system where the loser of the jump ball takes the ball from the other end to start the second and third periods, while the winner of that jump ball takes the ball to start the fourth period {{from the other end of}} the court.|$|E
5000|$|Sample Millergram:Q32: A juggler {{comes to}} a {{footbridge}} of rather flimsy design. He has in hand four balls. The maximum load {{is no more than}} the juggler himself and one ball. Can he get across the bridge by juggling the balls, always having at most one ball in the hand (and three in the air)?A: No. A falling ball exerts a force on the hand greater than its own weight. Rather, a [...] "thrown" [...] ball exerts greater force than a [...] "held" [...] one. That is, the additional force equal and opposite to that imparted to a flung ball, in addition to the juggler's mass, would exceed the bridge's tolerance (the bridge can tolerate a juggler and <b>held</b> <b>ball,</b> but not the additional downward force associated with forcing a ball [...] "up").|$|E

50|$|In 1954 and 2004, the Society <b>held</b> <b>balls</b> at the Dorchester Hotel to {{celebrate}} the Treaty of Friendship between England and Sweden, probably the oldest trade treaty in Britain’s history.

50|$|The 1974-75 squad {{was only}} the second team in Georgetown mens {{basketball}} history {{to play in the}} NCAA Tournament, {{and it was the first}} Georgetown men's basketball team to be invited to either the NCAA Tournament or the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) since the 1969-70 team's appearance in the 1970 NIT. Playing in the tournaments Mideast Region, the Hoyas met Central Michigan in the first round. Junior Hoya forward Bill Lynn scored 14 points and had 11 rebounds in the game. With six seconds left to play, the score was tied 75-75 when a <b>held</b> <b>ball</b> forced a jump ball. Georgetowns Ed Hopkins grabbed the tip and passed it to Derrick Jackson, who threw it to Jonathan Smith. Smith dribbled toward the basket and put up a long shot as time expired that missed. Central Michigan guard Leonard Drake undercut Smith as he shot, but an official off the ball called an offensive foul on Smith. Drake made both of his resulting free throws with no time remaining to give the Chippewas a 77-75 win and knock Georgetown out of the tournament. John Thompson objected strenuously, and game films later supported the view that it was Drake who had fouled Smith in the act of shooting.|$|E
