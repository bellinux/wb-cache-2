40|$|Sir Richard Clarke, known {{always as}} Otto, {{was a highly}} unusual and {{controversial}} Treasury civil servant responsible {{for a wide range}} of new initiatives in Whitehall between 1945 and 1970. A Cambridge Wrangler, a pre-war chess champion and originator of the <b>Financial</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Index</b> he entered Whitehall in war time more literate and numerate than most of his contemporaries. He regarded Keynes with whom he worked as his model. He was one of a new breed of post-war forceful civil servants, and one of the few capable of original thought. This biographical article tries to assess Otto’s contribution, especially in the period 1945 - 52, compared with that of his contemporaries, in working out the new economic and financial strategy needed for post-war recovery. It also glances at his later career as the main architect of the P. E. S.

40|$|The {{predictability}} of {{long time}} series of stock index levels and stock prices is investigated using both statistical and trading rule methodologies. The trading rule analysis uses a double moving-average rule {{and the methods}} of Brock, Lakonishok and LeBaron. Results are obtained for the FTA, FTSE- 100, DJIA and S&P- 500 indices, prices for twelve UK stocks and indices derived from these stock prices. Statistical analysis shows that the index and price series are not random walks. The trading rule analysis generally confirms this conclusion. However, small transaction costs would eliminate the profitability of the moving-average rule. Standard ARMA-ARCH models are estimated for time series of returns and bootstrap methods are used to decide if the models can explain the observed trading statistics. The models provide a reasonable description but there is evidence from the trading rule methodology that standard models sometimes fail to describe {{the dynamics of the}} indices and prices. Several comparisons are made: between an index and the stock prices that define the index, between spot levels and futures prices for indices, and between UK and US indices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{establish}} the determinants of stock market returns for the UK market and to forecast the real capital gain for the <b>Financial</b> <b>Times</b> All-share <b>index</b> using monthly data for the period 1980 - 1994. Three models are used: (a) a model based on Fama's approach including expectations' variables for the growth of GDP and inflation; (b) a model where short-run and long-run impacts are separately treated and (c) an ARCH model where volatility in returns is modelled using conditional variance. One-period ahead forecasts from the general autoregressive-distributed lag model and ARCH model are compared with actuals for the post-sample period (December 1992 to November 1993) and we find that the latter model has a higher predictive power than the former. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: <b>Financial</b> <b>time</b> series {{were usually}} large in size, {{unstructured}} and of high dimensionality. Since, the illustration of <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series shape was typically {{characterized by a}} few number of important points. These important points moved in zigzag directions which could form technical patterns. However, these important points exhibited in different resolutions and difficult to determine. Approach: In this study, we proposed novel methods of <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series <b>indexing</b> by considering their zigzag movement. The methods consist of two major algorithms: first, the identification of important points, namely the Zigzag-Perceptually Important Points (ZIPs) identification method and next, the indexing method namely Zigzag based M-ary Tree (ZM-Tree) to structure and organize the important points. Results: The errors of the tree building and retrieving compared to the original time series increased when the important points increased. The dimensionality reduction using ZM-Tree based on tree pruning and number of retrieved points techniques performed better {{when the number of}} important points increased. Conclusion: Our proposed techniques illustrated mostly acceptable performance in tree operations and dimensionality reduction comparing to existing similar technique like Specialize Binary Tree (SB-Tree) ...|$|R

There is no evidence of reversion in the UK stock market. Persistence only exists in high frequency data and is less strong in more recent times. Moreover, it is a portfolio phenomenon and is related to firm size. There is a possibility that persistence/reversion is also industry-related. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1996. ...|$|R

The criteria used for prediction are the one step ahead forecast of volatility and the one day Value at Risk (VaR). The main findings are that the INLA approximations are fairly accurate and relatively robust to the choice of prior distribution on the persistence parameter.

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to evaluate the predictable components in stock indices using a boosting-based classification technique, and we use this method to examine causality among the three main stock market indices in the world during periods of large positive and negative price changes. The empirical evidence seems to indicate that the Standard & Poors 500 index contains incremental information that is not present in either the FTSE 100 <b>index</b> (<b>Financial</b> <b>Times</b> Stock Exchange <b>Index)</b> or the Nikkei 225 index, and {{that could be used to}} enhance the predictability of the large positive and negative returns in the three main stock market indices in the world. This in turn would suggest a causality relationship running from the Standard & Poors 500 index to both the FTSE 100 and the Nikkei 225 indices. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} out-of-sample {{performance}} of monthly returns forecasts for two indices, namely the Dow Jones (DJ) and the <b>Financial</b> <b>Times</b> (FT) <b>indices.</b> A linear and a nonlinear {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) model are used to generate the out-of-sample competing forecasts for monthly returns. Stationary transformations of dividends and trading volume are considered as fundamental explanatory variables in the linear model and the input variables in the ANN model. The comparison of out-of-sample forecasts is done {{on the basis of}} forecast accuracy, using the Diebold and Mariano test [J. Bus. Econ. Stat. 13 (1995) 253. ], and forecast encompassing, using the Clements and Hendry approach [J. Forecast. 5 (1998) 559. ]. The results suggest that the out-of-sample ANN forecasts are significantly more accurate than linear forecasts of both indices. Furthermore, the ANN forecasts can explain the forecast errors of the linear model for both indices, while the linear model cannot explain the forecast errors of the ANN in either of the two indices. Overall, the results indicate that the inclusion of nonlinear terms in the relation between stock returns and fundamentals is important in out-of-sample forecasting. This conclusion is consistent with the view that the relation between stock returns and fundamentals is nonlinear. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to build a model that will assist managers in determining the factors that influence decisions on Capital Structure. Therefore, the determinants of the Capital Structure decisions of 100 UK non-financial companies listed in the <b>Financial</b> <b>Times</b> All-Share <b>Index</b> covering the period from 1993 to 2006 has been critically analyzed. The data stream provided for this study included both, accounting data on firms and the market value of equity. SL'Ctheories in literature review were considered. Multiple Regressions Analysis was performed on the gearing being a dependent variable against a set of independent variables used as Proxies. The independent variables used are Firm Size, Asset Tangibility, Profitability, Growth Opportunities and Volatility of Earnings. Both dependent variable and independent variables were determined by computing the average over five years from 1993 and 2006. In this research, it was observed that the Firm Size, Asset Tangibility, and Volatility of Earnings are positively correlated with gearing. On the other side, Profitability and Growth Opportunities is negatively correlated with gearing. The signs of these correlations signify that the previous empirical papers and theories reviewed provide sufficient explanation on the capital structure of UK companies. The p-value of the model is significant which implies that the independent variables explain the model...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{based on}} Renormalization Group (RG) to analyze time series forecasting was proposed in cond-mat/ 0110285. In this paper we explicitly code and test it. We choose in particular some <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series (stocks, <b>indexes</b> and commodities) with daily data and compute {{one step ahead}} forecasts. We then construct some indicators to evaluate performances. The algorithm is supposed to prescribe the future development of the time series by using the self-similarity property intrinsically present in RG approach. This property could be potentially very attractive {{for the purpose of}} building winning trading systems. We discuss some relevant points along this direction. Although current performances have to be improved the algorithm seems quite reactive to various combinations of input parameters and different past values sequences. This makes it a potentially good candidate to detect sharp market movements. We finally mention current drawbacks and sketch how to improve them. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new stylized fact for options whose {{underlying}} asset is a stock index. Extracting implied volatility time series from call and put options on the Deutscher Aktien <b>index</b> (DAX) and <b>financial</b> <b>times</b> stock exchange <b>index</b> (FTSE), we show that the persistence of these volatilities depends on the moneyness of the options used for its computation. Using a functional autoregressive model, we show that this effect is statistically significant. Surprisingly, we show that the diffusion-based stochastic volatility models are not consistent with this stylized fact. Finally, we argue that adding jumps to a diffusion-based volatility model help recovering this volatility pattern. This suggests that the persistence of implied volatilities {{can be related to}} the tails of the underlying volatility process: this corroborates the intuition that the liquidity of the options across moneynesses introduces an additional risk factor to the one usually considered. implied volatility, stylized fact, stocahstic volatility models, volatility surface dynamics, autoregressive models,...|$|R
40|$|The problem {{considered}} is {{the selection}} of a portfolio of international assets, particularly the forecasting of the inputs to a selection algorithm. Four models of the asset return generating process are considered, two of which ignore the international nature of the universe of assets, two which exploit it in different ways. Several estimation methods are considered for each component: expected return, variance and covariance of returns. The combinations of model and estimation method are first evaluated in terms of their forecasting performance for the components mentioned for the individual assets. The universe used is the components of the <b>Financial</b> <b>Times</b> Eurotrack 100 <b>Index.</b> Significant {{differences were found between the}} forecasting accuracy of the methods considered for each component. In the final stage of the analysis, a comparison of the returns on portfolios chosen using each combination showed a significant difference.

40|$|AbstractInternal audit is an {{activity}} of strategic importance {{when it comes}} to the management and control processes within a company, especially in the current post-crisis period. By using diverse procedures and work techniques, the internal audit function offers a comprehensive analysis and a complete overview of on-going activities – an image achieved by examining work methods used within the company, its organizational structure and its processes. Therefore, internal audit is considered to bring added value to the business and offers assurance that the internal control system is operational. As a result, internal audit also conveys transparency when linked with the company's corporate governance compliance. This paper sheds light on the practices of internal audit by observing work methods, the positioning and organizational structure and the processes regarding the internal audit function, when applied in 40 listed companies in the FTSE 100 index, London Stock Exchange. This study plans to answer key questions like “Is the internal audit function efficient in Great Britain's most important companies?” but also “How does internal audit help achieve proposed objectives?”. By firstly approaching the notion of internal audit from a theoretical point of view, we’ve outlined its conceptual frame, as well as facts regarding its purpose, scope and organizational matters. Later, and most significantly, we investigated internal audit in practice, by trying to present our findings in a logic and coherent sequence. Hence, we’ve analysed internal audit practices at 40 listed companies on the London Stock Exchange <b>Financial</b> <b>Times</b> 100 <b>index</b> (FTSE 100). Our results are synthesized by using a predefined frame containing key aspects regarding internal audit. This study does not plan to represent a thorough investigation of aspects on the topic of internal audit practices because it is based solely on data collected from the 40 companies. Thus, our results are limited, and if we had picked different companies, our results might have been slightly altered. Either way, our conclusions confirm the fact that most companies have implemented and use a worthy internal audit function...|$|R
