5|$|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's operas {{comprise}} 22 musical dramas in {{a variety}} of genres. They range from the small-scale, <b>derivative</b> <b>works</b> of his youth to the full-fledged operas of his maturity. Three of the works were abandoned before completion and were not performed until many years after the composer's death. His mature works are all considered classics and have never been out of the repertory of the world's opera houses.|$|E

She has done so for every comic since Xkcd #658, published on 4 November 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the books and films has ensured that the Harry Potter {{franchise}} continues to expand, with numerous <b>derivative</b> <b>works,</b> a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J.K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among many other developments. Most recently, themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} presented {{was whether}} {{the owner of a}} legal <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> infringes the rights of the successor copyright owner, by continued distribution and publication of the <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> during the renewal term of the pre-existing work. The Court held that the assignment was an unfulfilled contingency that died with the author; the successor can prevent continued use of the <b>derivative</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R

50|$|The musical West Side Story, is a <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> {{based on}} Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, because it uses {{numerous}} expressive elements {{from the earlier}} work. However, Shakespeare's drama Romeo and Juliet is also a <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> that draws heavily from Pyramus and Thisbe and other sources. Nevertheless, no legal rule prevents a <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> from being based on a work that is itself a <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> based on a still earlier work — at least, {{so long as the}} last work borrows expressive elements from the second work that are original with the second work rather than taken from the earliest work. The key is whether the copied elements are original and expressive (not merely conventional or mise en scène); if that is so, the second or <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> is independently subject to copyright protection, and if that is not, the second work (if unauthorized) may infringe the first, but it is not independently copyrightable.|$|R
5|$|Internet {{censorship}} in Hong Kong operates {{under different}} principles and regulations {{from those of}} mainland China. In November 2015, the newly established Innovation and Technology Bureau pushed for the legislation of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2014, more popularly known as the Internet Article 23, which would severely limit the legality of <b>derivative</b> <b>works</b> and other activities previously permitted on the Internet. Supporters of the bill {{point to the fact}} that Hong Kong is lagging behind in the protection of intellectual property rights, but detractors state that creative work on the Internet should be exempt from legislation, and the ordinance would severely violate human rights.|$|E
5|$|Since first {{coming to}} wide {{notice in the}} late 1990s, the Harry Potter book series by J. K. Rowling has engendered a number of legal disputes. Rowling, her various {{publishers}} and Time Warner, {{the owner of the}} rights to the Harry Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyrights, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other <b>derivative</b> <b>works,</b> sparking efforts to ban or contain them. While these legal proceedings have countered a number of cases of outright piracy, other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen episodes {{from the}} season three, which lapsed {{into the public}} domain after CBS {{neglected}} to file copyright renewals on the episodes in 1989, are available on discount DVDs. The 2007 lawsuit CBS Operations Inc v. Reel Funds International Inc. ruled that the episodes in question were <b>derivative</b> <b>works</b> based on the copyrighted episodes even though the episodes themselves were not under copyright and granted CBS indirect copyright over the public domain episodes; the ruling enjoined Reel Funds International, a public domain distributor, from selling DVDs with those episodes within {{the jurisdiction of the}} United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.|$|E

5000|$|The {{statutory}} definition is incomplete {{and the concept}} of <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> must be understood with reference to explanatory case law. Three major copyright law issues arise concerning derivative works: (1) what acts are sufficient to cause a copyright-protected <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> to come into existence; (2) what acts constitute copyright infringement of a copyright in a copyright-protected work; and (3) in what circumstances is a person otherwise liable for infringement of copyright in a copyright-protected <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> excused from liability by an affirmative defense, such as first sale or fair use? ...|$|R
5|$|Mesopotamian {{religion}} recognizes {{literally thousands}} of deities, and distinct iconographies have been identified for about a dozen. Less frequently, gods are identified by a written label or dedication; such labels would only have been intended for the literate elites. In creating a religious object, the sculptor was not free to create novel images: the representation of deities, their attributes and context were as much part of the religion as the rituals and the mythology. Indeed, innovation and deviation from an accepted canon {{could be considered a}} cultic offense. The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques and seals suggests that detailed iconographies could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual tradition for such <b>derivative</b> <b>works</b> but have now been lost. It appears, though, that the Burney Relief was the product of such a tradition, not its source, since its composition is unique.|$|E
5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, in any manner or form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how <b>derivative</b> <b>works</b> should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{difference}} between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter allows the work to be linked with (in {{the case of a}} library, [...] "used by") a non-(L)GPLed program, regardless of whether it is free software or proprietary software. The non-(L)GPLed program can then be distributed under any terms if it is not a <b>derivative</b> <b>work.</b> If it is a <b>derivative</b> <b>work,</b> then the program's terms must allow for [...] "modification for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications." [...] Whether a work that uses an LGPL program is a <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> or not is a legal issue. A standalone executable that dynamically links to a library through a [...]so, [...]dll, or similar medium is generally accepted as not being a <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> as defined by the LGPL. It would fall under the definition of a [...] "work that uses the Library". Paragraph 5 of the LGPL version 2.1 states: ...|$|R

25|$|In the past, Firefox was {{licensed}} solely {{under the}} MPL, then version 1.1, which the Free Software Foundation {{criticized for being}} weak copyleft, as the license permitted, in limited ways, proprietary <b>derivative</b> <b>works.</b> Additionally, code only licensed under MPL 1.1 could not legally be linked with code under the GPL. To address these concerns, Mozilla re-licensed most of Firefox under the tri-license scheme of MPL 1.1, GPL 2.0, or LGPL 2.1. Since the re-licensing, developers were free to choose the license under which they received most of the code, to suit their intended use: GPL or LGPL linking and <b>derivative</b> <b>works</b> when one of those licenses is chosen, or MPL use (including the possibility of proprietary <b>derivative</b> <b>works)</b> if they chose the MPL. However, on January 3, 2012, Mozilla released the GPL-compatible MPL 2.0, and {{with the release of}} Firefox 13 on June 5, 2012, Mozilla used it to replace the tri-licensing scheme.|$|E
25|$|The law {{contains}} a non-exhaustive list of objective forms, which includes oral realizations.

Among the examples of <b>derivative</b> <b>works</b> listed in the law are translations, abstracts, reviews, dramatizations, and arrangements.
