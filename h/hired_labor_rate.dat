50|$|Roemer's {{early work}} {{was an attempt}} to state the main themes of Marxian {{economics}} using the tools of general equilibrium and game theory. In Roemer (1982), he proposed a model of agents who were differentiated by their endowments, and had to choose occupations—involving either selling <b>labor,</b> <b>hiring</b> <b>labor,</b> or working on one's own capital stock. In optimizing with respect to market prices, agents choose one of five class positions, each consisting of various combinations of these three activities. This gives rise to a class structure, whose agricultural nomenclature would be landlords (who only <b>hire</b> <b>labor),</b> rich peasants (who <b>hire</b> <b>labor</b> and work themselves on their fields), middle peasants (who only work for themselves and do not participate in the labor market), poor peasants (who work on their own plot and sell labor), and landless laborers (who only sell labor). Independently of this taxonomy, individuals are either exploiters or exploited, depending upon whether they consume goods embodying more or less labor than they expend. The central result, the Class Exploitation Correspondence Principle (CECP), states that individuals who optimize by <b>hiring</b> <b>labor</b> are necessarily exploiters, and those who optimize by selling labor are exploited. Thus, a classical Marxian principle, taken as an observed fact in Marx's writings, emerges here as a theorem. Microfoundations are provided for the relationship between exploitation and class.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the second}} paper {{from a series of}} {{articles}} on governing of different types of transactions in Bulgarian farming applying the framework of New Institutional and Transaction Cost Economics. It is based on a large scale microeconomic data from 194 typical commercial farms of different sizes and types from all regions of the country. This study concentrates on factors and modes for organization of labor supply in Bulgarian farms. Structure of kind of labor (permanent, seasonal, irregular, others), and type of labor use (in production, in administration, in management, for protection, others), and labor source (own <b>labor,</b> family <b>labor,</b> <b>hired</b> <b>labor,</b> cooperative members, others) in farms of different types and sizes has been determined. Microeconomic factors responsible for various organizational and contract choices for labor supply (own cultivation, using of family <b>labor,</b> <b>hiring</b> of workers, cooperation etc.) have been specified. Dominant governing modes have been explained by comparative advantages for saving on transacting costs (for finding partners, contracting, monitoring of <b>hired</b> <b>labor,</b> conflict resolutions, renewal of contracts etc). Limits of farm extension (optimization) through effective alternative (to outside labor supply) modes for “internal” service, and inputs, and land supply have been determined. Transaction costs economizing framework has been used through analysis of: types of wage formation (time based, output based, mixed) for different categories of labor; reasons for <b>hiring</b> <b>labor</b> (extension of business, support of own labor, support of family labor, replace of family labor, others); ways of application of <b>hired</b> <b>labor</b> (in production, in administration, in management, in protection, others); personality of different types of <b>hired</b> <b>labor</b> (relatives; close friends; known before hiring; unknown before first hiring; same persons every time; from universities, agricultural schools etc; others); frequency of experiencing problems leading to suspension of labor contracts; main reasons for conflicts with <b>hired</b> <b>labor</b> (lack of qualification; lack of desire for hard work; lack of entrepreneurial spirit; cheating, stealing etc); kind of contracts with different types of labor (informal, written) and extend of specifications of contract obligations; ways of income formation (fixed monthly wages, daily based, output based, based on final year results, others) of different categories of labor in crop, livestock, services and management. Relative level of farms transaction costs associated with labor supply (for finding needed labor, negotiation and contracting, for directing and monitoring of <b>hired</b> <b>labor,</b> for contract enforcement and disputing etc.) has been determined. Besides high governing costs associated with labor contracts other factors restricting farm enlargement of Bulgarian farms as present stage are: high enforcement costs of contracts in general, and enormous credit supply and marketing costs.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence on}} the effects of agricultural productivity on wage <b>rates,</b> <b>labor</b> supply to market oriented activities, and labor allocation between own farming and wage labor in agriculture. To guide the empirical work, this paper develops a general equilibrium model that underscores the role of reallocation of family labor engaged in the production of non-marketed services at home (`home production'). The model predicts positive effects of a favorable agricultural productivity shock on wages and income, but the effect on <b>hired</b> <b>labor</b> is ambiguous; it depends on the strength of reallocation of labor from home to market production by labor surplus and deficit households. Taking rainfall variations as a measure of shock to agricultural productivity, and using subdistrict level panel data from Bangladesh, this paper finds significant positive effects of a favorable rainfall shock on agricultural wages, labor supply to market work, and per capita household expenditure. The share of <b>hired</b> <b>labor</b> in contrast declines substantially in response to a favorable productivity shock, which is consistent with a case where labor-deficit households respond more than the labor-surplus ones in reallocating labor from home production...|$|R

40|$|Sub-Saharan Africa is {{the only}} {{developing}} {{region of the world}} where agricultural output has been trailing population growth {{for most of the last}} three decades. Farming systems in the region are inherently risky because they are fundamentally dependent on the vagaries of weather. In addition, it is a region of crises; poverty, civil strife, and HIV/AIDS. Attention must therefore be focused on improving the production of crops that could thrive under these circumstances. Because of its tolerance of extreme drought and low input use conditions, cassava is perhaps the best candidate in this regard. And cassava is a basic food staple and a major source of farm income for the people of the region. The use of <b>hired</b> <b>labor</b> is important for its production growth because cassava root yield responds positively to the application of <b>hired</b> <b>labor.</b> This article, based on farm-level information collected from six major cassava-producing countries of Africa, within the framework of the Collaborative Study of Cassava in Africa, identifies strategic variables affecting the <b>hired</b> <b>labor</b> use decisions of producing households. The characteristics of the household head (age and number of years of formal education), the size of the household farm, good market access, and population pressure are found to motivate households to apply <b>hired</b> <b>labor</b> in cassava production. These observations underscore the need for investing in people-education-and in infrastructure-market access-as possible tools for improving food production in the region. The positive effect of farm size also suggests that some kind of land reform, which would put more farmland at the disposal of farm households, could be favorable to improving cassava production.

40|$|Although {{there is}} growing {{evidence}} of the increasing role of nonfarm activities in rural livelihoods, there is still relatively little empirical evidence regarding {{the factors that influence}} smallholder farmers to diversify into nonfarm activities. This study analyses the factors that influence household labor allocation decisions and demand for farm labor in Uganda. Data were collected from 660 households in three banana-based production zones with divergent production constraints and opportunities. The determinants of demand for <b>hired</b> <b>labor</b> were estimated with the Tobit model. Linear regression was used to estimate reduced-form equations for the time-allocation decisions of household members. Our findings show that household members respond positively to increases in wages, suggesting that they respond to economic incentives. Increased wage rates negatively affect the use of <b>hired</b> <b>labor,</b> but household size has no effect on the use of <b>hired</b> <b>labor,</b> indicating that the economic rationing of <b>labor</b> <b>hiring</b> {{has more to do with}} the market wage than family size or composition. Education and road access have positive effects on the amount of time allocated to off-farm activities. Access to off-farm opportunities, however, takes away the most productive labor from farm production.
