5|$|Originally, {{when the}} Wii U console was first {{shown at the}} E3 2011 in Los Angeles, Namco {{announced}} that they would develop a Tekken game for the Wii U, which was untitled at the time. However, at E3 2012, {{it was announced that}} Tekken Tag Tournament 2 would come to the Wii U, which was already <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Tekken Tag Tournament 2: Wii U Edition is amongst the first third-party Wii U games that is available in both retail and as a downloadable format for the Nintendo eShop. In Japan, the downloadable version is available for a slightly lower price than the retail format.|$|E
500|$|Work on {{the album}} was {{interrupted}} by the recording of [...] "Spectre", which Radiohead wrote for the James Bond film of the same name. The song was rejected, according to Greenwood, for being [...] "too dark". Godrich said: [...] "That fucking James Bond movie threw us a massive curveball. It was a real waste of energy. We stopped doing {{what we were doing}} and had to concentrate on that for a while since we were told it was something that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition ... It caused a stop right {{when we were in the}} middle of [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Keith Phipps, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, praised the episode, rated it an A−, and {{described}} Hutchison's role as [...] "the part that would launch [...] as a go-to character actor for creep parts". Phipps felt the climactic {{scene in which}} Tooms infiltrates Scully's home is [...] "the scene that makes the episode", noting that there was [...] "a real sense of peril" [...] despite it being clear that Scully, a lead character, was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> harm. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, note that the episode's premise {{is the first in}} the series [...] "not to rely upon accepted urban legends". It conveys its [...] "absurd" [...] plot through suggestion, leaving any special-effects sequences of Tooms' abilities until the audience is [...] "already suitably adjusted to the absurdity". However, Shearman and Pearson found the monologue likening the crimes committed by Tooms to the Holocaust, given by the retired detective Briggs, to be [...] "not only unnecessary but tasteless to boot". They rated the episode four stars out of five. Mumtaj Begum, writing for Malaysia's The Star, described [...] "Squeeze" [...] as [...] "the episode that really sold The X-Files idea to the masses", and called it [...] "simply brilliant".|$|E

500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> my room and have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E

2500|$|Marilyn Manson {{said that}} his Antichrist Superstar CD, which came out in 1996, was {{an answer to the}} Nostrandamus prophecy in which he said that [...] "The 3rd. Antichrist was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the earth in the year 1996".|$|E

5000|$|Wilson is {{responsible}} for night-shift arraignments in Brooklyn, a position that requires him to set bail for defendants, during which he says he takes a defendant's immigration status into account: [...] "It's {{got to be a}} factor — if a person's an illegal immigrant, how likely is it that he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> court?" ...|$|R
2500|$|He quickly grew {{disillusioned with}} the {{political}} system. [...] "Energy systems are notorious for their long gestation periods, often twenty years or longer, [...] {{there had to be}} a pay-off in a product within five to seven years in order to justify the public money being put in. There are political cycles involving re-election, so the politicians didn't want to put money into systems that were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition in some other generation. You sent out the plans, and they hacked and cut at them." [...] When the contract ran out, he decided to quit and strike out on his own.|$|E
2500|$|... “The Left {{as it is}} {{at present}} is {{certainly}} not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> power. There {{is not even a}} ghost of a chance of that. We {{will continue to be a}} part of the Opposition. If you want to achieve the objective that you have declared, then you should try to adopt tactics that would avoid or minimise the division of anti-BJP votes to the extent possible. This strategy should be adopted in all states other than in those states where the BJP is still not a major factor at all, where we would continue to have our main conflict with the Congress." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 2008 {{nomination}} of Sarah Palin for Vice President of the United States, senior pastor Ed Kalnins' preaching was scrutinized by the media. His sermons were {{available on the}} church website. USA Today reported the Huffington Post assertion that [...] "Kalnins has preached that critics of President Bush will be banished to hell; questioned whether {{people who voted for}} Sen. John Kerry in 2004 would be accepted into heaven; and preached that the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Iraq were part of a world war over Christianity". Kalnins preached [...] "I believe that Alaska is one of the refuge states... in the Last Days, {{and hundreds of thousands of}} people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> this state to seek refuge.

5000|$|Prior {{to moving}} to Vancouver, Korey had already {{appeared}} in some ads. She then decided in late 2002 {{to move to}} Hollywood, but was [...] "stopped at the border because she couldn't prove she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> Canada. She couldn't go home though so she called her friend and got on a flight to Vancouver and she's been there ever since." ...|$|R

2500|$|Season six {{opened to}} much hype and curiosity. The A.V. Club asked, [...] "I'm {{guessing}} {{that one of}} the biggest fears of Lost fans as we ride out this sixth and final season—bumps and all—is that we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the end and find a big nothing in return for all we've invested in these characters. We don't just need answers, we need justifications. Why has whatever happened, happened? Who has called this particular meeting to order, and does it really matter who showed up?" [...] The episodes [...] "Dr. Linus", [...] "Ab Aeterno", [...] "Happily Ever After", and [...] "The Candidate" [...] opened to highly positive critical reception while the third-to-last episode [...] "Across the Sea" [...] was the episode with the most negative reception. The time spent at the Others' temple was criticized. E! Online described the show as [...] "lightning in a bottle" [...] and picked it as [...] "Top TV Drama of 2010." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1985, {{there was}} a {{considerable}} amount of conflicts between band members. Lead singer Joey Ramone {{went so far as to}} withdraw from the writing process despite being a vital part of it on previous records. Joey recalled, [...] "I'd had it with the Ramones. 'Mental Hell' is about that. Part of it came from breaking up with [...] Angela. The other part of it was that I had really had it with the band." [...] In later interviews, however, Joey stated that it was not the conflict that made him stop writing, but rather he had [...] "ideas on the backburner." [...] Bassist Dee Dee Ramone said lead guitarist Johnny Ramone was the reason for much of the stress, supposedly not wanting to do songs Joey would write for multiple reasons. Dee Dee related: [...] "Joey will present a great tune and Johnny won't do it because it's this or it's that. 'I'm not going to play minor chords. I'm not going to play lead. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> England.' For God's sake! That's why Joey gotta do his solo album." ...|$|E

5000|$|What I {{remember}} about that 1973 tour {{is that we}} arrived in America and we did 53,000 at Atlanta and then 55,000 at the following concert in Tampa, Florida — it was quite clear that if people were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> along <b>to</b> see us in those kind of numbers we weren’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have problems doing concerts that would fulfil the demand. It was phenomenal though — the audience reaction was just so with us, y’know.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] she said, [...] "I {{wish you}} would go now and send ma to me. I don't {{want to talk about}} it any more. My head aches as if it would split. Poor ma! She little thought when I married you that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> this." ...|$|E

5000|$|From {{a letter}} to his mother, Helen Pancake, that Pancake wrote in Charlottesville, where he was {{studying}} writing: I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> West Virginia when this is over. There's something ancient and deeply-rooted in my soul. I like to think that I have left my ghost up one of those hollows, and I'll never really be able to leave for good until I find it. And I don't want to look for it, because I might find it and have to leave.|$|R
5000|$|The husband {{told her}} that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back <b>to</b> Africa since his country Gambia, by then led by Yahya Jammeh had passed a law to kill all gays in Gambia. Him being a gay, a fact that Stella Nyanzi never knew, he was not to return to Africa but rather seek asylum in United Kingdom. That was the last of her with her husband. She finally gave birth to healthy boys who are {{currently}} 10 years and have never seen their Dad.|$|R
