According to Matt Gelb of The Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] "Bold best describes what Rubén Amaro Jr. has done so far in putting together the 2014 Phillies and <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> appropriate that the word ends with the letters O-L-D." [...] The team wanted to re-sign Carlos Ruiz (or find another catcher) and sign a right-handed-hitting corner outfielder and a middle-of-the-rotation starter to supplement Cole Hamels and Cliff Lee after the departure of Roy Halladay and the discovery of medical problems in Cuban Miguel Alfredo González, signed by the Phillies the previous summer.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the film to}} its predecessor, Dr. No, Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, said that From Russia with Love [...] "didn't seem quite so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving." [...] He {{went on to say}} that [...] "...the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. But <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most of us feel we might be doing..." [...] The critic thought that overall, [...] "the nonsense is all very amiable and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers".|$|E
500|$|Through late 1967 {{and early}} 1968, Barrett's {{behaviour}} became increasingly erratic and unpredictable, {{partly as a}} consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, most prominently LSD. There is also much speculation that he suffered from schizophrenia. Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and socially withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganized speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings, and periods of catatonia. Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for a long weekend and, according to several friends including Rick Wright, came back [...] "a completely different person." [...] One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, empty, dead-eyed stare. He was unable to recognize old friends that he had known for years, and often did not know where he was. At one point, while {{on a tour of the}} city of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, [...] "Gee, <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> nice to be in Las Vegas!" [...] Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Syd's reply to Boone's questions was a [...] "blank and totally mute stare," [...] according to Nick Mason, [...] "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day." [...] Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Although surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts of the song competently, during a group interview afterwards, when asked two questions by Clark, Barrett's answers were terse, almost to the point of rudeness (though, Clark noted, they had been flying non-stop from London to Los Angeles). During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and occasionally was unable to hold his pick. Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed Mandrax tranquilliser tablets and an entire tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which subsequently melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting, making him look like [...] "a guttered candle". Nick Mason later disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that [...] "Syd would never waste good mandies".|$|E

2500|$|The series {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Anime News Network's Nick Creamer gave a series a 4 out 5 stars, saying that [...] "After watching {{half a dozen}} premiers that just wouldn't stop with the exposition, <b>it</b> <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> nice to watch a show that actually has confidence in its own storytelling. Iron-Blooded Orphans hits the ground running, establishing its world in the natural conversations of its many characters." [...] He criticized that [...] "Mari Okada's an inconsistent writer, but definitely a talented one, and given {{the focus of a}} traditional Gundam-style opening, her gift for illustrating character shines through." [...] Zac Bertschy gave the series a 4.5 for the first episode, saying [...] "Iron-Blooded Orphans has a lot of moving parts, but it's only deceptively complex; this episode starts out confusing (due to the relatively haphazard way they introduce all the various factions and the sizable cast) but as it goes on it all becomes very clear". He also adds [...] "Instantly likable characters, desperate battles, a broad science fiction story about a colony struggling for independence, giant robots and even a Char-like smooth-talking pretty boy weirdo who's working with the bad guys; what's not to love?" ...|$|E
