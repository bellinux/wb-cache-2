The weighted Kappa factor showed fair agreement between the observational and <b>direct</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> for the arm (0. 39) and back (0. 47). The weighted Kappa factor for these methods was poor for the neck (0) and wrist (0) but the observed proportional agreement (P-o) was 0. 78 for the neck and 0. 83 for the wrist. The weighted Kappa factor between questionnaire and direct measurement showed poor or slight agreement (0) for different body segments in both cycle times.

The research was conducted through simultaneous measurement of 131 I radioactivity in the stack of the 131 I radioisotope production facility, Serpong, and outdoor in house courtyards around SNA in normal condition (no accident) based on the variations of the distance and wind direction. Direct measurements were carried out with a portable in-situ NaI(Tl) detector at outdoor, and with a LaBr 3 detector in the stack.

The {{aim of the}} study is to investigate whether <b>direct</b> stenosis <b>measurement</b> and plaque ultrasound image analysis could potentially be used for more accurate diagnostic investigation. Method and material: Eighty-seven patients with cardiovascular disease had a carotid duplex ultrasound scan and velocity and B-mode measurements data were recorded for <b>direct</b> diameter <b>measurement</b> evaluation. Forty patients were scanned for quantitative plaque analysis and association of several parameters with symptoms was investigated. Results: For the degree of stenosis, ECST method indicated greater agreement among <b>direct</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>methods</b> with velocity criteria, however in cases of mild stenosis difference was reported. ECST <b>method</b> <b>measurements</b> showed considerably better agreement with MRA stenosis calculations compared with other methods. Intima-media grey scale level was associated with plaque echogenicity but the correlation was not significant, however there was an association with blood cholesterol levels. Percentages of plaque area with grey scale value less than 35 and 40 showed good accuracy in identifying symptomatic patients. As far as fibrous cap is concerned, a thickness less than 300 μm was well correlated with symptomatic disease, however no association was noted for its echogenicity.
