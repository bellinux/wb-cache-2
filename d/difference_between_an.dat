5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} a polytope belongs to affine {{geometry}}, which is more general than Euclidean. But Euclidean geometry distinguish regular polytopes.

25|$|While Clausius {{based his}} {{definition}} on a reversible process, {{there are also}} irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the second law of thermodynamics, entropy of an isolated system always increases. The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> isolated system and closed system is that heat may not flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 and 2008, {{people in}} {{southern}} Kalinga around Binuluan spoke of an 'eruption' at Sugo-oc in 1986 or 1987.

When speaking in English, the locals {{there at the}} time called this an 'eruption'. Gentle questioning of locals over months led to the conclusion that there are difficulties in communicating the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> eruption and an earthquake.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> Absolute and Limited Monarchy, {{based on}} Fortescue's c.1471 manuscript, was {{published}} in 1714 by a descendant, John Fortescue Aland. In the Cotton library there is a manuscript of this work, and its title indicates that it was addressed to Henry VI. However, many passages show plainly that {{it was written in}} favour of Edward IV. A revised edition of this work, with a historical and biographical introduction, {{was published in}} 1885 by Charles Plummer under the title The Governance of England.|$|E
25|$|Lord Diplock {{rejected}} this argument, {{and instead}} upheld {{the validity of}} a presumption of trafficking where possession of a quantity of prohibited drugs higher than the minimum specified in section 15 of the MDA has been proved. Where the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> offence and some lesser offence was the particular purpose with which that unlawful act was committed, there was nothing unfair about requiring the accused to prove his actual purpose. This was because the accused alone is armed {{with the knowledge of}} the purpose of the illegal act.|$|E
25|$|Fedora {{uses the}} RPM package {{management}} system, using DNF {{as a tool}} to manage the RPM packages. DNF uses libsolv, an external dependency resolver. Flatpak is also supported by default, and support for Ubuntu's snaps can also be added. Fedora uses Delta RPM when updating installed packages to provide Delta update. A Delta RPM contains the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> old and new version of a package. This means that only the changes between the installed package and the new one are downloaded reducing network traffic and bandwidth consumption.|$|E

25|$|Units of Finnish Defence Forces have {{a single}} Colour. The Colours are either active or traditional. An active Colour belongs to a brigade or an {{equivalent}} unit in the FDF. A traditional Colour belongs to a battalion or a regiment that has formerly been separate but {{is now part of}} a brigade. The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> active and traditional Colour is the way of presenting them. The active Colour has always a guard of two officers, while a traditional Colour is borne without one. The military oath is always given {{in the presence of the}} active Colour of the unit.|$|E
25|$|Rømer then {{applies the}} same logic to {{observations}} around the first quadrature (pointG), when Earth is moving towards Jupiter. The time <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> immersion seen from pointF and the next immersion seen from pointG should be 3½minutes shorter than the true orbital period of Io. Hence, {{there should be a}} difference of about 7minutes between the periods of Io measured at the first quadrature and those measured at the second quadrature. In practice, no difference is observed at all, from which Rømer concludes that the speed of light must be very much greater than one Earth-diameter per second.|$|E
25|$|Women {{were also}} {{distinct}} {{because of the}} titles by which they were addressed in the army, although these tended to be no different from their male counterparts. They wore the same rank insignia as their male counterparts. Many members of the ATS were respected by the units they were attached to despite their different insignia. The only major <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> ATS member and a male member of the Regular Army was discipline: a woman {{was not allowed to}} be court marshalled unless she herself chose to be. The women in the service were also under the authority of the women officers of the ATS, instead of the male officers they served directly under. This meant any disciplinary action was entirely {{in the hands of the}} ATS, removing male influence from the process.|$|E

25|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{have become increasingly}} prominent for reef management. MPAs promote responsible fishery management and habitat protection. Much like national parks and wildlife refuges, and to varying degrees, MPAs restrict potentially damaging activities. MPAs encompass both social and biological objectives, including reef restoration, aesthetics, biodiversity, and economic benefits. However, {{there are very few}} MPAs that have actually made a substantial difference. Research in Indonesia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea shows that there is no significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> MPA site and an unprotected site. Conflicts surrounding MPAs involve lack of participation, clashing views of the government and fisheries, effectiveness of the area, and funding. In some situations, as in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, MPAs can also provide revenue, potentially equal to the income they would have generated without controls, as Kiribati did for its Phoenix Islands.|$|E

500|$|The {{physics of}} quantum {{mechanics}} was thereby reduced to the mathematics of Hilbert spaces and linear operators acting on them. For example, the uncertainty principle, according to which {{the determination of the}} position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa, is translated into the non-commutativity of the two corresponding operators. This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schrödinger.
