5|$|Eugenides {{and several}} critics {{compared}} Cal's condition to mythical creatures {{described by the}} ancient Greeks. The author alluded his protagonist's nature and heritage to the Minotaur, the half-man and half-bull creature. Cal's father is conceived after his grandparents' attendance of a theatric play entitled The Minotaur. The puzzle of Cal's <b>genetic</b> <b>identity</b> is akin to the creature's labyrinth, and the thread that leads out of the maze is held here by his paternal grandmother, a former silk farmer. Frances Bartkowski, a scholar of English, named Callie in her puberty as a chimera. The mythical monster is an analogy for a complex personality, a mixture of body parts from various animals that each represents a human aspect or characteristic. Similarly, adolescent Callie is an amalgamation of her genes, neither male nor female, neither adult nor child, and yet all {{of them at the}} same time.|$|E

40|$|Seven {{crayfish}} {{species from}} three genera of the subfamily Cambarinae were electrophoretically examined for genetic variation {{at a total}} of twenty-six loci. Polymorphism was detected primarily at three loci: Ao- 2, Lap, and Pgi. The average heterozygosities over-all loci for each species {{were found to be}} very low when compared to most other invertebrate species that have been examined electrophoretically. With the exception of Cambarus bartoni, the interpopulation <b>genetic</b> <b>identities</b> are high within any given species. The average interspecific identities are somewhat lower and the average intergeneric identities are lower still. Populations, species and genera conform to the expected taxonomic progression. The two samples of ~ bartoni show high genetic similarity at only 50 percent of the loci compared. Locus by locus identity comparisons among species yield U-shaped distributions of <b>genetic</b> <b>identities.</b> Construction of a phylogenetic dendrogram using species mean genetic distances values shows that species grouping is in agreement with morphological taxonomy {{with the exception of the}} high similarity between Orconectespropinquus and Procambarus pictus. This high similarity suggests the possibility of a regulatory change between the two species. It appears that the low heterozygosities, high interpopulation <b>genetic</b> <b>identities,</b> and taxonomic mispositioning can all be explained on the basis of low mutation rates...|$|R

25|$|In 2015, {{during an}} attempt to {{understand}} the <b>genetic</b> <b>identity</b> of the rapidly expanding jackal populations in Europe, an international team of researchers examined 15 microsatellite markers and a 406 base-pair fragment of the mtDNA control region from the tissue samples of 97 specimens throughout Europe and Asia Minor. The results showed that European jackals have much lower haplotype diversity than those in Israel (where they have admixed with dogs, grey wolves and African wolves), and that they mostly descend from populations originating from the Caucasus. The highest level of haplotype diversity was found in Peloponnesian jackals, which may represent a relict population of Europe's original golden jackals prior to their extirpation elsewhere. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the genetics of Baltic jackals, as all Baltic states class the animal as an artificially introduced invasive species subject to extermination. It was found that jackals in Estonia originate from the south-eastern European population, whereas those in Lithuania are of Caucasian origin; this was concluded to render the hypothesis of an artificial introduction unlikely, and that their presence in both states was consistent with the natural northward expansion of both southeastern and eastern European populations.|$|E

Polystichum lonchitis, circumboreal in distribution, is highly divergent allozymically from the other five species; <b>genetic</b> <b>identities</b> between P. lonchitis and the other species range from 0. 187 with P. acrostichoides to 0. 378 with P. munitum.

An enzyme electrophoretic study, including 13 loci, was conducted to assess genetic diversity within and divergence among species of the alliance. Nei's <b>genetic</b> <b>identities</b> (distances) between genera nd/of subgenera range from 0. 490 (0. 714) to 0. 980 (0. 013), and pairwise comparisons of all populations how relatively high <b>genetic</b> <b>identities,</b> {{with a mean of}} 0. 804. The high identities further support the genetic cohesiveness of the alliance and its single origin on the Macaronesian islands. Species in the alliance alsQ show about 50 % higher total genetic diversity (Hw) than the mean for other oceanic endemics. There is greater divergence between endemics or species on older islands compared to those on younger islands, which suggests that time is a factor for divergence at allozyme loci. Furthermore, populations on older islands have higher total genetic diversities and lower identities than conspecific populations on younger islands...|$|R

2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that, in transhumanist thought, humans attempt to {{substitute}} themselves for God. The 2002 Vatican statement Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God, stated that [...] "changing the <b>genetic</b> <b>identity</b> of man as a human person through the production of an infrahuman being is radically immoral", implying, that [...] "man has full right of disposal over his own biological nature". The statement also argues that creation of a superhuman or spiritually superior being is [...] "unthinkable", since true improvement can come only through religious experience and [...] "realizing more fully the image of God". Christian theologians and lay activists of several churches and denominations have expressed similar objections to transhumanism and claimed that Christians attain in the afterlife what radical transhumanism promises, such as indefinite life extension or the abolition of suffering. In this view, transhumanism is just another representative of {{the long line of}} utopian movements which seek to create [...] "heaven on earth". On the other hand, religious thinkers allied with transhumanist goals such as the theologians Ronald Cole-Turner and Ted Peters hold that the doctrine of [...] "co-creation" [...] provides an obligation to use genetic engineering to improve human biology.|$|E
