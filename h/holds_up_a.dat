5|$|Thirteen {{years before}} the present, Robert Fassl (W. Earl Brown) sits in his van. He later {{approaches}} a home and claims {{to be there to}} repair the cable. As Fassl <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> piece of paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He looks up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E
25|$|Returning outside, Kruvajan and Gorobec meet Katia Vajda. She {{tells them}} that {{she lives with her}} father and brother Constantine in a nearby castle that the villagers all believe is haunted. Struck by her {{haunting}} beauty and sadness, Gorobec instantly becomes smitten with Katia. The two men then leave her and drive to an inn. Meanwhile Asa is brought back to life by Kruvajan's blood. She contacts Javuto telepathically and orders him to rise from his grave. He does so and goes to Prince Vajda's castle, where Vajda <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> crucifix to ward the reanimated corpse away. However, Vajda is so terrified by the visit that he becomes paralyzed with fear. Katia and Constantin send a servant to fetch Dr. Kruvajan, but the servant is killed before he can reach the inn. It is the evil Javuto who arrives to bring Kruvajan to the castle. Javuto leads Kruvajan to Asa's crypt, and Kruvajan watches in horror as her coffin explodes. From its ruins, the witch hypnotizes Kruvajan and says she needs a few more drops of his blood, offering him eternal life (and a night of pleasure) in return. Asa then kisses him, turning him into her servant. By Asa's command, Kruvajan enters Vajda's room and murders him.|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} {{imagery of}} The Cross of France {{has been compared}} to Eugène Delacroix's painting Liberty Leading the People, in which a woman personifying Liberty <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> flag against the background of a burning city. [...] Delacroix's Liberty leads a group of Parisians who have taken up arms, while the subject of The Cross of France stands alone. Brooks used this romantic image of a figure in heroic isolation in both the 1912 portrait of D'Annunzio and her 1914 self-portrait; the subjects are wrapped in dark cloaks and isolated against seascapes.|$|E

500|$|... 11B-X-1371 is {{an early}} 2015 viral video sent to GadgetZZ.com, the Swedish tech blog that publicized it. The {{black-and-white}} segment is two minutes in length; its title came from the plaintext of a base64 string written on the DVD. It depicts a person wearing {{what appears to be}} a plague doctor costume walking and standing around in a dilapidated abandoned building, with a forest visible through former window openings in the wall behind it. Accompanied by a soundtrack of loud, discordant buzzing noise, the masked figure <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> hand with an irregularly blinking light. The film did not have any credits or claims to authorship.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{close-up}} shot of Hamasaki, {{similar to the one}} in [...] "Vogue". Two children are seen in the distance, both of whom were in the [...] "Vogue" [...] music video". Hamasaki <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> fishbowl with a goldfish inside, where it is then digitally edited with textile layers and gradients. As Hamasaki continues singing the song, she is then {{standing in the middle of}} the post-apocalyptic world from [...] "Vogue". Both the children look into the distance, with inter cut scenes of Hamasaki singing and different fish swimming in the fish bowl. As the children look into the distance, a storm starts in the sky. The kids drop the picture book in the [...] "Vogue" [...] video, and run of into the distance. The final scene has Hamasaki singing on the front cover of the book.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, a mysterious, Halloween themed {{green and}} purple costumed, and {{psychotic}} supervillain named Green Goblin breaks into an Oscorp laboratory {{late at night}} and steals several pieces of equipment, including a glider. With the equipment, Goblin flies off and attacks a group of thieves who are working for the crime lord the [...] "Big Man." [...] He uses some stolen money as incentive for them if they work for him and they accept. Now armed with personal terrorists, he crashes and <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> black tie dinner party orchestrated by the [...] "Big Man" [...] in his alter ego as philanthropist L. Thompson Lincoln. Lincoln is unimpressed and sics his guards on the Goblin and his terrorists, but they are defeated easily. Air Force Colonel John Jameson tries to fight them, too, but is also taken down.|$|E

500|$|Robert Patrick makes a cameo {{appearance}} in Wayne's World (1992) as the T-1000 {{character in a}} scene where he pulls Wayne's car over, <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> photo of John Connor and asks, [...] "Have you seen this boy?", to which Wayne, being presumably a fan of The Terminator franchise and knowing T-1000 as a time-travelling assassin, screams in panic and drives away from him. Patrick also makes a cameo appearance as the T-1000 in Last Action Hero (1993), when he is seen walking by Schwarzenegger as he enters Los Angeles Police Department headquarters. In the same film, actor Sylvester Stallone is featured as the Terminator on a Terminator2 poster instead of Schwarzenegger. In Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), a caricature of Saddam Hussein is frozen, shattered, and reformed in a direct parody of the T-1000 from the final scene of Terminator2.|$|E
500|$|The clips {{differ from}} one another in terms of Lennon's attire {{and the nature of}} Ono's role as, in author Robert Rodriguez's description, [...] "an onstage focal point around which all {{activity}} was staged"; in addition, Lennon's vocal was treated with echo for the 19 February broadcast. In the [...] "knitting" [...] clip, Lennon is wearing a black polo-neck jumper as Ono sits beside his piano, blindfolded, and knitting throughout. In [...] "cue card", Lennon wears a flower-pattern shirt under a denim jacket, while Ono <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> series of cryptically worded cue cards, the messages on which include [...] "Smile", [...] "Hope" [...] and [...] "Peace", as she speaks into a microphone. Although Ono appears to have a more active role, she is again blindfolded and the words she speaks cannot be heard. Rodriguez describes both clips as [...] "terrifically engaging, providing suitably dynamic visuals to a powerful song", yet he considers that the [...] "cue card" [...] performance [...] "captures much more of the ambience, with frequent shots of White's stellar work and the studio dancers".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ugly" [...] {{was directed by}} Toby Tremlett and filmed on 1 November 2005. It {{is set in a}} warehouse in New York City that is used for people who are taking part in an audition. It begins with a yellow taxi driving on a New York City road with apartment complexes. As the song begins, Buena sings her verse while looking into a mirror, and other people in the warehouse begin to hold up signs of the song's lyrics. During the chorus, they begin to showcase their talents such as dancing and juggling. Buchanan's chorus features her sitting on a staircase; during this part, a child <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> sign reading [...] "short" [...] while a woman carries a sign saying [...] "loneliness". As Range sings the bridge, she is leaning on a wall in the warehouse while more people begin dancing. When Sugababes sing the chorus again, they dance with the people who also begin to show other talents, including instrumentation and magic tricks. As the video ends, a row of people hold up signs containing one word from the song's lyrics, [...] "people are all the same".|$|E

500|$|Ray drags {{the case}} {{to the top of the}} stairs and meets Eddie. Gerald lays Sabrina down on the sofa, places a cushion over her face and shoots her. Gerald turns off the music as the {{doorbell}} is heard. Answering the door, Gerald sees a man (Novak) who <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> sign reading [...] "Hello, my name is Paul. I am deaf & dumb." [...] The reverse of the sign reads [...] "Do you need any cleaning products today?" [...] Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says [...] "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." [...] He looks to the fake painting, and says [...] "I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone." [...] He takes down the painting and walks out, as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool.|$|E
500|$|The video commences with Till {{arguing with}} his girlfriend through a phone call. As soon as Swift, as the protagonist, notices, they begin to {{communicate}} by holding up signs through their bedroom windows. Till closes his curtains, and Swift <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> sign saying, [...] "I love you". As the song's chorus approaches, Swift starts to sing and dance {{in front of a}} mirror, changing to different clothing multiple times. Afterward, Swift is sitting in a bench while reading a book. Till arrives and the two converse. Then, Swift, as the antagonist, arrives in a red convertible car and Till gets in it; Swift, the antagonist, kisses him and gives a hostile look towards the protagonist. Suddenly, she is seen cheerleading at a football game while Swift's other persona is in the bleachers, performing in the school band. After scoring the winning touchdown, Till moves toward his girlfriend and finds her flirting with a teammate, resulting in a heated argument which results in their breakup. Meanwhile, Swift, the protagonist stares in amazement. Back in their bedroom windows, they again communicate through signs, Till asked Swift, the protagonist, if she was attending prom and she responded, [...] "no, studying". Swift, however, notices Till has a dejected expression as he leaves and changes her mind. Shortly after, Swift is seen entering prom with a white dress, no longer looking like a nerd, while all her peers stare in amazement. When Till spots her, he walks towards her and Swift, the antagonist in a red dress, attempts to impede him, but he ignores her. Ending the video, Till and Swift reveal folded signs saying [...] "I love you" [...] and kiss. To date, the video has over 770 million views on YouTube, making it the most viewed country song on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|The film's plot survives {{because of}} Universal's {{publication}} of the details in Moving Picture News. The official description is as follows, [...] "Charity, through excessive organization, often defeats its own purpose. William Weldon, a telegraph lineman, {{is the father of}} a large family, and finds it a hard struggle to make ends meet on his small wages. By a fall from a telegraph pole one afternoon he sustains injuries which force a lay-off for several weeks. His family is left destitute and, after a time, seek aid from various charity organizations. In each case the organization promises to make a full investigation and do what they can, but by the time all the red tape and rules are complied with, the family would starve. In the meantime, Marx, a gentleman thief who has a secret retreat in the same building in which the Weldon family live, meets the invalid daughter, Alice Weldon. She tells him of the family's condition and Marx endeavors to aid her, although at the time he is out of ready cash himself. Taking desperate measures, he <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> doctor and forces him to attend to Weldon. Then, in company with the female leader of the gang, he attends the charity ball. There he makes a haul — plucking jewelry and trinkets from every one with whom he comes in contact. He pawns the stolen articles and uses the money to help the Weldons. After the family has recovered, through Marx's aid, the charity organizations finally send a few dollars and a skimpy supply of food. Marx decides to reform — in fact, his reformation has been intended for some time, and his last [...] "job" [...] was only the outcome of his desire to do a worthy charity. He goes to the police, declares himself, and surrenders. Marx is sentenced, and while sitting in his cell a vision of Alice appeared before him, repaying him for his sacrifice and charity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{keeping with}} Dante's desires to satirize the {{original}} film, the sequel has some meta-references and self-referential humor. These include a cameo appearance by film critic Leonard Maltin. He <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{copy of the}} original Gremlins home video and denounces it, {{just as he had}} in reality; however, his rant is cut short when gremlins pounce on him.

Very little work of the poets of Vandal North Africa survives, but what does is found in the Latin Anthology; apart from their names, {{little is known about the}} poets themselves, not even when they were writing. Their work drew on earlier Roman traditions. Modern scholars generally hold the view that the Vandals allowed the Romans in North Africa to carry on with their way of life with only occasional interference.|$|E

2500|$|The next scene finds Marte, Belona, Dragón and Belona's {{soldiers}} {{at the foot}} of a mountain. Marte is still jealous and distracted. Belona and Dragón try to humor him. Meanwhile, Amor is sneaking around in disguise, spying on Marte. He is eventually discovered hiding in the bushes and interrogated by Marte, who fails to recognize him, but is suspicious of his riddles about love. When Marte orders the soldiers to capture him, Amor escapes into a cleft in the mountain. The cleft then opens revealing the Prison of Jealousy. Shackled inside, is Desengaño (Disillusion), an old man [...] dressed in animal skins. Marte and Dragón fearfully enter the grotto and find the masked personifications of Fear, Suspicion, Envy, Anger, and Bitterness. Desengaño and the masked figures warn Marte that when love is pursued it turns into disillusion. Desengaño <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> magic mirror in which Marte sees Venus and Adonis embracing. Unable to face the truth, Marte runs away. There is a sudden earthquake, and the allegorical figures, the vision in the mirror, and the grotto all disappear.|$|E
2500|$|Howard and Harold {{were some}} of the first {{supporting}} characters to be created for the show. Series creator Chris Savino stated in an interview with Geeks OUT that he made the McBrides gay because [...] "The Loud House is about family and we decided very early that we would try to represent all kinds of modern family." [...] Howard and Harold's sexual orientation is intentionally never mentioned on the program, and they are portrayed as any other couple would be. They do not exhibit stereotypical mannerisms of gay men, such as exaggerated effeminacy and flamboyance. According to Shoma Chaudhury's Catch News, Howard and Harold were created with the goal of [...] "introducing children to LGBT characters who are both 'normal' and likeable." [...] Amanda Cordner of Viacom International, which produces the show, called the casual inclusion of Howard and Harold part of The Loud Houses [...] "genius" [...] and called the program [...] "an accurate reflection of modern life; it <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> mirror so kids can see themselves... is increasingly normal, and that's the brilliance of it." [...] A study conducted by Nickelodeon's EVP of consumer insights, Sujata Luther, in October 2016 used the characters {{as an example of how}} Nickelodeon [...] "is continuously shaping its shows and digital services to meet the changing face of its viewers." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge" [...] {{features}} several {{references to}} popular culture. In the episode, Otto meets Becky at Woodstock 1999, {{where he is}} on fire and the fire is {{put out by the}} water in her water bottle. This was a reference to a controversy about the high cost of water at the festival, and Otto on fire references the large number of fires that occurred. Otto <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> boombox and blares Poison's [...] "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" [...] whilst proposing to Becky. When Otto plays air guitar, it is completely accurate fingering: John Achenbach, a storyboard artist on the show, is an accomplished guitarist and provided demonstrations for the animators. When Krusty interviews Marge, it is a television static image of her face with an impersonator's lips in place of hers; this was an homage to a recurring skit from the show Late Night with Conan O'Brien in which Robert Smigel's lips would be placed on Bill Clinton's, or other celebrities. The idea was created by former The Simpsons writer Brent Forrester, who, {{in the early days of}} Late Night, sent the joke to Conan O'Brien, also a former The Simpsons writer. Patty and Selma's line [...] "the bitterness is strong in this one," [...] is a reference to Darth Vader's line [...] "the Force is strong in this one" [...] from the film [...] (1977).|$|E
