The inexperienced owner of the aircraft, Levine, had plans to fly it back to America with a French pilot, Maurice Droughin. After disagreements with Droughin and lawyers left the aircraft guarded and grounded, Levine took off to England claiming he was just testing the engine. (Chamberlain claimed that Levine bribed the guards.) Boll followed Levine to England by boat, talking Levine into letting <b>her</b> <b>be</b> a passenger.|$|E
25|$|Schell {{also served}} as a writer, {{producer}} and director for a variety of films, including the problematic documentary film Marlene (1984), with the unwilling participation of Marlene Dietrich. It was nominated for an Oscar, received the New York Film Critics Award and the German Film Award. Originally, Dietrich, then 83 years of age, had agreed to allow Schell to interview and film her in the privacy of her apartment. However, after he began filming, she changed her mind and refused to allow any actual video footage of <b>her</b> <b>be</b> shown. During a videotaped interview, Schell described the difficulties he had while making the film.|$|E

25|$|Li {{was then}} stunned by lucky loser Madison Keys {{in the first}} round of the Mutua Madrid Open the {{following}} week, her first early tournament exit of the season. Li returned to the Internazionali d'Italia as the defending finalist. After a first round bye, she defeated Zheng Jie in straight sets then squared off with former doubles partner Jelena Janković, who defeated Li in a marathon match in which Li's inconsistency proved to <b>her</b> <b>be</b> undoing, committing 62 unforced errors. As one of the favourites, Li's quest for a second Grand Slam title began when she played Anabel Medina Garrigues in the opening round of Roland Garros, winning in two sets. Her struggles on clay continued, however, as she fell victim to Bethanie Mattek-Sands, ranked 67th, in a rain-interrupted second round match – losing in three sets, bringing her disappointing clay court season to a close.|$|E

She became aware that she could {{have a positive impact on}} others and that helped <b>her</b> <b>be</b> more comfortable with her prominence.

500|$|During {{the second}} week of October 1997, David Duchovny was {{scheduled}} to be away from Vancouver for promotional purposes for the movie Playing God. As a result, the producers delayed shooting of the episode [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] and developed a Scully-centric episode to take its place in the queue. With the episode scheduled to air during December, Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz decided to craft a Christmas episode and put Dana Scully into a situation similar to that of Scrooge in the 1951 film Scrooge, starring Alastair Sim. After failing to write an episode paralleling that story, the writers decided instead to feature Scully being visited by earlier versions of herself, resulting in the flashback sequences appearing in the episode. They also decided to have <b>her</b> <b>be</b> taken on an emotional journey by her descendant.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea to have}} Scully {{abducted}} originated when Gillian Anderson {{became pregnant}} {{in the middle of}} the first season. While initially upset, those in charge of the show never considered dropping the actress from the show. Ideas such as having Scully give birth to an alien baby were dismissed and ultimately the writers decided to work around the pregnancy by closing the X-Files, separating Mulder and Scully, and eventually having <b>her</b> <b>be</b> abducted. This permitted the producers to have an explanation for Scully's absence (she appears in only two scenes in [...] "Ascension" [...] and not at all in the next episode, [...] "3"). Series creator Chris Carter commented that both the censors and the producers were reluctant on showing Scully in the trunk, but he [...] "fought for that image" [...] as he considered it conveyed the sense of danger to the character. Carter added the scenes of the experiment were meant to be ambiguous on whether Scully was abducted by aliens, the military, or both.|$|E
500|$|Her {{interest}} in acting sparked from watching her brother perform {{in a school}} production of The King and I when she was six. During rehearsals, she pleaded with his teachers to let <b>her</b> <b>be</b> in the play. They let her join the chorus. While enrolled in Woldingham School as a teen, she was heavily involved in theatre. She was the student head of the drama department there, performing in plays and musicals, conducting workshops with younger students, and helping put on productions. When she was 16, she attended a production of HenryV starring Kenneth Branagh. His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief {{that she wanted to}} pursue a career in acting. She wrote a letter to Branagh asking him for advice. [...] "I explained that my parents didn't want me to act, but that I felt it was my vocation in life," [...] she said. Branagh's sister replied: [...] "Kenneth says that if you feel such a strong need to be an actress, you must be an actress." ...|$|E

500|$|Underwood {{was created}} to give Carter a [...] "strong female antagonist", and Butters noted that [...] "we said, wouldn’t it be great {{to have one of}} those people who is living right there with <b>her</b> <b>be</b> {{actually}} a bad guy?" [...] In late January 2015, Butters and Fazekas revealed that Underwood is a product of the precursor to the Black Widow program. Regan did not know the character was a Black Widow when auditioning, but quickly learned after being cast, as the showrunners wanted her to change her then current red hair, in order to avoid being [...] "a tip to the audience, because of Natasha [...] They didn’t want to imply that every Black Widow had red hair and they didn’t want the audience to see it coming." [...] Regan trained with a Tae Kwan Do expert and studied Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow choreography from the films in preparation for the character's fight scenes, while Ottobre-Melton referenced her Black Widow status by using the colors red and black. Underwood's initial [...] "small-town girl from Iowa" [...] persona was based on Judy Garland's Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E
500|$|Twilight was in {{development}} for approximately {{three years at}} Paramount Pictures's MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written. For example, the script transformed Bella into a star athlete. Stephenie Meyer stated {{that there was some}} debate in allowing the movie to be made because of the negative or positive outcome of the movie compared to the book, '"They could have put that [...] movie out, called it something else, and no one would have known it was Twilight!" [...] The idea of seeing a scene converted correctly, specifically the meadow scene, convinced Meyer to sell the rights. In seeing the script, she was frightened that she had made the wrong decision. When Summit Entertainment reinvented itself as a full-service studio in April 2007, it successfully acquired the rights to the novel. Erik Feig, President of Production at Summit Entertainment, guaranteed a close adaptation to the book. The company perceived the film as an opportunity to launch a franchise based on the success of Meyer's book and its sequels. Meyer felt that Summit was open to letting <b>her</b> <b>be</b> a part of the film. Catherine Hardwicke was hired to direct the film, and soon afterward, Melissa Rosenberg was selected to be the film's structural base as the writer of the film.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{credited}} as Phylicia Ayers-Allen, Rashad eventually {{adopted the}} surname of her third husband, sportscaster Ahmad Rashad, who she married during the show's third season. During the wedding ceremony, Rashad was [...] "given away" [...] to Ahmad by television husband Cosby, by whom {{the couple had}} first been introduced. Cosby assured Rashad {{that she would be}} allowed to remain on the show should she and Ahmad decide to have a baby, joking, [...] "We'll just add another Huxtable". Rashad became pregnant with their child during season three. To avoid having to add an infant to the main cast, extreme tactics were used to conceal the actress' pregnancy onscreen, such as confining Clair to bed or having <b>her</b> <b>be</b> out of town for several episodes at a time. Scooped out, the bed's mattress was specially constructed to prevent Rashad's growing stomach from being visible underneath the covers but ultimately resulted in the actress suffering a pinched nerve in her back. Rashad would also hide behind props such as kitchen tables, counters and jackets. In the episode [...] "Vanessa's Rich", Rashad uses a large teddy bear to hide her pregnancy while seated on the living room sofa, but the toy's origin and purpose within the episode remains unexplained. After giving birth to daughter Condola Rashad in 1986, Rashad managed to lose the weight she had gained while pregnant by the time season four premiered. Rashad's sister, actress Debbie Allen, appeared in an episode of The Cosby Show as Clair's personal trainer.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have <b>her</b> <b>be</b> unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E
