5|$|Before {{taking the}} role, Capaldi {{said that he}} had to seriously {{consider}} the increased visibility that would come with the part. He {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not <b>go</b> <b>because</b> he was unsure if he would get the part and did not wish to be part of a large group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E
5|$|During lunch, Mark (Paul Schneider) tells Leslie that he {{is going}} to propose to Ann (Rashida Jones). Ann {{suggests}} that Leslie get some sleep, but she plans on consuming Sweetums bars to stay awake for another 24 hours. As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is falling asleep. With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses to let him <b>go</b> <b>because</b> Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is so boring that the telethon actually starts to lose money.|$|E
5|$|The book {{opens with}} a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing {{the loss of his}} farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent {{relationship}} with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom <b>go</b> <b>because</b> he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E

6000|$|Among {{these was}} the Swiss family Morel. Andre <b>went,</b> <b>because</b> {{he did not}} wish to remain {{comparatively}} idle in the colony during the long months of winter. Elise went for the purpose of keeping house--perhaps we should say keeping hut--for Andre. Fred Jenkins <b>went</b> <b>because</b> he wanted to learn more about Indian ways and customs, as well as to perfect himself in the art of hunting the buffalo--that was all! ...|$|R

5|$|While there, Nico {{settles into}} camp life; Percy and Blackjack save a sea monster Percy nicknames Bessie; and Artemis's {{lieutenant}} Zoë Nightshade has mysterious dreams about the goddess being in grave danger. Percy has similar dreams about Annabeth saving Luke from being {{crushed by the}} ceiling of some cave and holding it up for him. Both are unable to act, however, until the Oracle (a shriveled mummy) somehow leaves the attic where it was kept and delivers the Huntress a prophecy. Chiron and Zoë organize a quest, but Percy is forbidden from going because the Hunters refuse to travel with a boy. He successfully sneaks away from camp on Blackjack, though he is almost stopped by Mr. D (Dionysus) who agrees to let him <b>go</b> <b>because</b> {{there is a good}} chance that Percy will get killed while on the quest.|$|E
25|$|Antenor, who {{had given}} {{hospitality}} to Menelaus and Odysseus when they asked {{for the return of}} Helen, and who had advocated so, was spared, along with his family. Aeneas took his father on his back and fled, and, according to Apollodorus, was allowed to <b>go</b> <b>because</b> of his piety.|$|E
25|$|MacKenzie joined The Daily Telegraph as {{an online}} {{columnist}} in 2013, however he was {{dropped by the}} newspaper after one column, with Roy Greenslade reporting in The Guardian that he was let <b>go</b> <b>because</b> of upset among staff on the Telegraph sports desk at his role in reporting on the Hillsborough disaster, in particular from football columnist and ex-Liverpool player Alan Hansen, who played at Hillsborough.|$|E

25|$|Motivation for the United States {{to engage}} the Soviet Union in a Space Race {{can be traced to}} the then {{on-going}} Cold War. Landing on the Moon was viewed as a national and technological accomplishment that would generate world-wide acclaim. But going to the Moon would be risky and expensive, as exemplified by President John F. Kennedy famously stating in a 1962 speech that the United States chose to <b>go</b> <b>because</b> it was hard.|$|E
25|$|In March 1937, when Cancel Miranda {{was seven}} years old,his mother and father {{traveled}} to the City of Ponce {{to participate in a}} march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. (He and his sisters couldn't <b>go</b> <b>because</b> they were sick with measles).The march, which was scheduled for March 30 (Palm Sunday), was organized to commemorate the ending of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873, and to protest the incarceration by the U.S. Government of Nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos on sedition charges.|$|E
25|$|On September 5, 2006, Redstone removed Freston as President and CEO of Viacom and {{replaced}} him with director and former Viacom counsel Philippe Dauman. Redstone also brought back former CFO Tom Dooley. This was surprising to many, as Freston {{had been seen}} by many as Redstone's heir apparent, and Redstone had touted that Freston would run the company after he retired. Redstone publicly stated that he let Freston <b>go</b> <b>because</b> of Viacom's lack of aggressiveness in the digital/online arena, lack of contact with investors, and a lackluster upfront (coupled with falling viewership) at MTV Networks.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fourth}} show, Charlie Dominici was let <b>go</b> <b>because</b> {{the band was}} {{starting}} to feel the limitations of his voice based upon the vocal style they wanted. The band was looking for a singer with a style more like Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate, and Dominici's stage presence was not what they wanted for a front man. Shortly after, however, the band Marillion asked Dream Theater to open for them at a gig at the Ritz in New York, so Dominici was given the opportunity to perform one last time. It would be another two years before Dream Theater had a replacement vocalist.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen {{scored a}} third-place podium finish {{in his first}} race with McLaren, the 2002 Australian Grand Prix. Although McLaren {{suffered}} many engine failures in 2002, Räikkönen scored 24 points and four podiums, and held his own against teammate David Coulthard. Räikkönen came close to winning his first Grand Prix in France but went off track at the Adelaide hairpin {{with a handful of}} laps to <b>go,</b> <b>because</b> of oil from the blown engine of Allan McNish's Toyota on the circuit. He finished the race second. He finished the season in sixth place, one place behind his team mate. Together they achieved a solid third place for McLaren in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E
25|$|Gandin {{repeatedly}} requested {{help from}} the Ministry of War in Brindisi, {{but he did not}} get any reply. He {{even went so far as}} sending a Red Cross emissary to the Ministry, but the mission broke down off the coast of Apulia and when it arrived three days later at the Italian High Command in Brindisi, it was already too late. In addition, 300 planes loyal to Badoglio were located at Lecce, near the southernmost point of Italy, well within range of Cephalonia, and were ready to intervene. But the Allies would not let them <b>go</b> <b>because</b> they feared they could have defected to the German side. Furthermore, two Italian torpedo boats, already on their way to Cephalonia, were ordered back to port by the Allies for the same reasons.|$|E

25|$|The Ducks {{began their}} Cup {{defense against the}} Los Angeles Kings for a two-game set in London, England, without Niedermayer and Selanne (who were still pondering retirement) and an injured Pahlsson and Giguere, {{splitting}} the series. Highly touted prospect Bobby Ryan scored his first career NHL goal during the series. However, Ryan played only 23 games with the big club during the season, primarily playing in the AHL. On October 10, against the Boston Bruins, the Ducks raised their Pacific Division, Western Conference and Stanley Cup championship banners. It was a rough start overall for the Ducks, however, as they made minor trades to try and stay alive in the West. Burke said he would eventually let goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov <b>go</b> <b>because</b> he felt he deserved to have a starting position in the NHL. Burke ultimately made good on his promise and placed Bryzgalov on waivers, where he {{was picked up by}} the Phoenix Coyotes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, she {{published}} an autobiography where she detailed how she met Constanzo and the group, her experiences {{when she was}} allegedly taken hostage by Constanzo, her mistreatment by authorities, and her versions of the story. Aldrete claimed she visited Constanzo in Mexico City and was then taken hostage after Constanzo decided to not let her <b>go</b> <b>because</b> he believed that {{she would go to}} the police and tell them where they were hiding. She claimed that Constanzo {{and the rest of the}} group were unaware of the killings that occurred in Matamoros until they found out that the police was looking for them, but went into hiding nonetheless because they feared for their lives. She detailed her alleged mistreatments in jail, and how she underwent beatings, psychological torture, rape, and an unfair trial. Her version of Constanzo's death was different than the official one; she stated that Constanzo was executed by the police when they raided the apartment. She also questioned the police's decision to burn down the shack in Santa Elena, since it was crucial for the investigation and probably contained the fingerprints of the murderers.|$|E

500|$|There {{was this}} one time where I {{had to take a}} blind lady across the street and I’d never done that before. I took her hand which is so {{obviously}} wrong! You don’t take a stranger’s hand! Like a 45-year-old woman! But once you take someone’s hand you can’t just let <b>go</b> <b>because</b> then you’re admitting your own awkwardness. I just held her hand {{and in the middle of}} the street she turns around and is like, ‘Do you mind if we don’t hold hands.’ ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2004, Usher {{broke up}} with Chilli due to [...] "irreconcilable {{differences}} and because they found {{it almost impossible to}} make compromises." [...] Usher said in an interview: [...] "It's unfortunate when you have to let a situation <b>go</b> <b>because</b> it's not working", which added reference to the breakup. It was later revealed that Chilli in fact {{broke up with}} Usher because of cheating, and the media said otherwise because of the lyrics in the song, which was not based on their relationship. Dupri, however, confessed that his personal life is the real story of the album. Usher said he took inspiration collectively by looking at his friends' personal situations.|$|E
500|$|Valbuena {{spent two}} years playing on the club's under-18 team playing {{alongside}} the likes of Rio Mavuba and Marouane Chamakh. Valbuena appeared in only three matches with the reserve team before being released from the club after failing to impress Jean-Louis Garcia, the reserve team manager. It has been commonly stated that Valbuena was let go by the club due to his small size; however, former club player and trainer Philippe Lucas explained that Valbuena was let <b>go</b> <b>because</b> he struggled to [...] "transform his game {{from that of a}} young player to that of a professional" [...] and that [...] "his game needed to be faster and he needed to avoid confrontations".|$|E
