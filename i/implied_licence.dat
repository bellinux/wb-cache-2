6000|$|A great {{pleasure}} to me is your good and generous letter just received--with its luxurious <b>implied</b> <b>licence</b> for me of seeking this aid to prompt response; {{at a time when}} a pressure of complications (this is the complicated time of the year even in my small green garden) defeats too much and too often the genial impulse. But so far as compunction started and guided your pen, I really rub my eyes for vision of where it may--save as most misguidedly--have come in. You were so far from having distilled any indigestible drop for me on that pleasant ultimissimo Sunday, that I parted from you with a taste, in my mouth, absolutely saccharine--sated with sweetness, or with sweet reasonableness, so to speak; and aching, or wincing, in no single fibre. Extravagant and licentious, almost, your delicacy of fear of the contrary; so much so, in fact, that I didn't remember we had even spoken of the heavy lucubrations in question, or that you had had any time or opportunity, since their [...] "inception," [...] to look at one. However your fond mistake is all to the good, since it has brought me your charming letter and so appreciative remarks you therein make. My actual attitude about the Lucubrations is almost only, and quite inevitably, that they make, to me, for weariness; by reason of their number and extent--I've now but a couple more to write. This staleness of sensibility, in connection with them, blocks out for the hour every aspect but that of their being all done, and of their perhaps helping the Edition to sell two or three copies more! They will have represented much labour to this latter end--though in that they will have differed indeed from no other of their fellow-manifestations (in general) whatever; and the resemblance will be even increased if the two or three copies don't, {{in the form of an}} extra figure or two, mingle with my withered laurels. They are, in general, a sort of plea for Criticism, for Discrimination, for Appreciation on other than infantile lines--as against the so almost universal Anglo-Saxon absence of these things; which tends so, in our general trade, it seems to me, to break the heart. However, I am afraid I'm too sick of the mere doing of them, and of the general strain of the effort to avoid the deadly danger of repetition, to say much to the purpose about them. They ought, collected together, none the less, to form a sort of comprehensive manual or vade-mecum for aspirants in our arduous profession. Still, it will be long before I shall want to collect them together for that purpose and furnish them with a final Preface. I've done with prefaces for ever. As for the Edition itself, it has racked me a little that I've had to leave out so many things that would have helped to make for rather a more vivid completeness. I don't at all regret the things, pretty numerous, that I've omitted from deep-seated preference and design; but I do a little those that are crowded out by want of space and by the rigour of the 23 vols., and 23 only, which were the condition of my being able to arrange the matter with the Scribners at all. Twenty-three do seem a fairly blatant array--and yet I rather surmise that there may have to be a couple of supplementary volumes for certain too marked omissions; such being, on the whole, detrimental to an all professedly comprehensive presentation of one's stuff. Only these, I pray God, without Prefaces! And I have even, in addition, a dim vague view of re-introducing, with a good deal of titivation and cancellation, the too-diffuse but, I somehow feel, tolerably full and good [...] "Bostonians" [...] of nearly a quarter of a century ago; that production never having, even to my much-disciplined patience, received any sort of justice. But it will take, doubtless, a great deal of artful re-doing--and I haven't, now, had the courage or time for anything so formidable as touching and re-touching it. I feel at the same time how the series suffers commercially from its having been dropped so completely out. Basta pure--basta! ...|$|E

40|$|Copyright <b>licences</b> can be <b>implied</b> {{when the}} doing of a {{restricted}} act is covered neither by the express licence of the copyright owner, nor {{by one of}} the statutory limitations and exceptions. The manner in which copyright <b>licences</b> are <b>implied,</b> therefore, holds the key to broadening the scope of permissible acts. In contrast to the rigidity of statutory limitations and exceptions, <b>implied</b> <b>licences</b> are more malleable in being able to respond to a diverse set of circumstances, as the need arises. Thus, <b>implied</b> <b>licences</b> can serve as a flexible and targeted mechanism to balance competing interests, including those of copyright owners and content users, especially in todayâs dynamic technological environment. However, implication as a process is contentious, and there are no established rules for <b>implying</b> a <b>licence.</b> Implication of a copyright licence is even more complicated because the conceptualisation of a copyright licence is unsatisfactory. The resulting uncertainty has prevented <b>implied</b> <b>licences</b> from being embraced more readily by the courts. The objective of this thesis is, therefore, firstly, to reconceptualise a copyright licence that is broad enough to accommodate the diverse circumstances in which copyright licences arise, and certain enough to assist in finding their constituents; secondly, to propose frameworks for <b>implying</b> copyright <b>licences</b> in a methodical and transparent manner, based on three sources: the consent of the copyright owner; an established custom; and state intervention to achieve public policy goals. The frameworks are also customised differently for implied bare and <b>implied</b> contractual <b>licences.</b> The thesis demonstrates the robustness of these frameworks by rationalising them with the existing case law. Underscoring the contemporary relevance of <b>implied</b> <b>licences,</b> in conclusion, the thesis tests and validates the frameworks in relation to three essential and ubiquitous functions on the internet â browsing, hyperlinking and indexing...|$|R
5000|$|A less-obvious {{problem in}} {{comparing}} RELs {{is when they}} have a differing baseline. The baseline defines the conditions <b>implied</b> by the <b>licence</b> when there are no explicit statements included. Some RELs take the [...] "Everything not permitted is forbidden" [...] approach, others (such as ccREL) use the Berne Convention as their baseline.|$|R
50|$|In January 1996, Mrs Justice Arden {{ruled that}} clients cannot take {{creative}} work pitched to them speculatively without a prior agreement, {{but that in}} Hook Advertising's enthusiasm to win the Rabbit deal it had effectively traded its rights to the logo and made such a preliminary deal. This ruling replaced the legal precedent set in 1928 in the Hycolite case (Drabble (Harold) Ltd v. Hycolite Manufacturing Co. 1928 44 TLR 264) that {{the conduct of the}} parties may <b>imply</b> a <b>licence</b> to use a copyright work without the need for it to be in writing. Despite the legal battle, there was also an out of court settlement in which Hook Advertising received more than £1 million.|$|R

5000|$|It {{seems to}} me that when one is {{considering}} machinery which is not the subject of any patent protection, it is unnecessary and may be misleading to introduce the concept of an <b>implied</b> <b>licence.</b> The owner of a car must be entitled to do whatever is necessary to keep it in running order and to effect whatever repairs may be necessary in the most economical way possible. To derive this entitlement from an <b>implied</b> <b>licence</b> granted by the original manufacturer {{seems to me}} quite artificial. It is a right inherent in the ownership of the car itself.There is an inconsistency between marketing cars and thereby creating whatever rights attach to their ownership {{on the one hand and}} acting to restrain the free exercise of those rights on the other. The law does not countenance such inconsistencies.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, {{the common}} law {{doctrine}} of exhaustion provides that a purchaser of a patented product benefits from an <b>implied</b> <b>licence</b> to use, repair, and resell that product.

5000|$|The {{court held}} that {{although}} a person has an <b>implied</b> <b>licence</b> to enter a property, this licence can only be actioned in a reasonable manner. Entering a property at 1.30am in the morning, most people would find an unreasonable hour. That meant that the Traffic officer was trespassing at the time, making the breath test illegal, resulting in the court overturning the conviction.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{separate}} opinion, Lord Templeman {{pointed out}} that an <b>implied</b> <b>licence</b> might be negatived by express language, under principles of freedom of contract, {{but that was not}} so when non-derogation instead is involved: [...] "The right cannot be withheld by the manufacturer of the car by contract with the first purchaser and cannot be withheld from any subsequent owner." [...] That is, the nature of property makes the right inherent and not a matter of freedom of contract.|$|E

50|$|This {{method of}} debate had the {{advantage}} of not raising anti-Semitic feelings too strongly; and it likewise enabled Charles II, on his return, to avoid taking any action on the petition of the merchants of London asking him to revoke Cromwell's concession. He had been assisted by several Jews of royalist sympathies, such as Mendes da Costa and Augustine Coronel-Chacon, during his exile. In 1664 a further attempt was made by the Earl of Berkshire and Mr Ricaut to bring about the expulsion of the Jews, but the King-in-Council assured the latter of the continuance of former favour. Similar appeals to prejudice were made in 1673, when Jews, for meeting in Duke's Place for a religious service, were indicted on a charge of rioting, and in 1685, when thirty-seven were arrested on the Royal Exchange; but the proceedings in both cases were put a stop to by direction of the Privy Council. The status of the Jews was still very indeterminate. In 1684, it was contended by the East India Company that they were alien infidels, and perpetual enemies to the English crown. Even the Attorney-General declared that they resided in England only under an <b>implied</b> <b>licence.</b> As a matter of fact, the majority of them were still aliens and liable to all the disabilities that condition carried with it.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} selected {{legal issues}} of copyright law {{in respect of}} the internet. The thesis focuses on Malaysian and UK Copyright law concerning; accessing web pages; linking; framing and caching. Since the internet is in use globally, law at an international, regional and national level have been examined {{in order to find}} solutions to these selective issues. At the regional level, European Union law is analysed. The Information Society Directive covers two of the selected issues (accessing web pages and caching). However there are still gaps in the Information Society Directive regarding the two other issues of framing and linking. In UK Copyright law, since the UK has implemented the Information Society Directive, a new section has been added to the Amendment Act, which covers accessing web pages and caching, but the UK Statutes do not expressly cover framing and linking. However, linking may be allowed under the general rule of <b>implied</b> <b>licence.</b> The Malaysian Copyright (Amendment) Act of 1997 has provided for the internet where a new section has been created that is the right to control the communication of copyright works to the public. However, there is no specific legislative provision on transient copies (accessing web page and caching) under this Act. However, accessing web pages may be covered under another provision which permits copies to be made in any form or version. Caching however is provided for under another provision. In the USA, provision on safe harbour provides the ISP with protection against action of infringement. The US Copyright law covers all the selected issues except framing. The conclusion reached in this thesis is that Malaysian law provides legislative solutions only for some of the selected copyright issues in respect of the internet but, in general, it is still inadequate and needs to be improved.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{random access}} memory, cache, and out- and in-line linking as selected {{new forms of}} copyright infringement involving protected digital content. It examines the legality of transient and incidental copies in random access memory and cache client or local caching and proxy server or forward caching, and discusses the legality {{of different types of}} linking: surface and deep links and in-line linking, through critical analysis of the United Kingdom law, before and after the latest amendments in 2003 to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, in addition to the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002. A brief discussion regarding the position of some European countries before and after the implementations of several European Union Directives related to copyright infringement concerning internet is also presented. The thesis considers several arguments related to the copyright holders’ exclusive rights, such as issuing copies of the work to the public, performing, showing or playing the work in public or communicating the work to the public.   However, it focuses mainly on the reproduction right. Several traditional defences to infringement of copyright are presented, especially fair dealing and <b>implied</b> <b>licence.</b>   Also considered are different potential technological solutions, such as date bombs, metering technology, link removal request policy or password protection, and non-technological solutions, such as licensing or obtaining an agreement to link, as means of avoiding those new forms of copyright infringement. It is concluded {{that it is important to}} amend some pieces of the United Kingdom legislation, especially section 28 A of the United Kingdom Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and the United Kingdom Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002, as well as some pieces of the Directive 2001 / 29 /EC of the European parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of Certain Aspects of Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society, and the Directive 2000 / 31 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (Directive on electronic commerce).

40|$|The “exhaustion rule” is {{a rather}} {{ambiguous}} legal construct. The question whether this rule still applies in the digital age may refer to two things: The right to distribute a purchased data carrier further, just as a book may be resold {{without the consent of}} the copyright holder (“first-sale doctrine”); or (the traditional view at least in the case of software, but also under patent law) {{the extent to which the}} protected subject matter may be used by the purchaser even without an explicit licensing agreement (“implied licence”). The question about the redistribution right, however, is only meaningful in the first of three periods within the digital age, during which physical carriers actually were (and still are) sold. In the second period already, when recorded carriers are not sold anymore but copies are produced via download through users, the circumstances change. Whether or not the first-sale doctrine applies in this period as well is disputed even today. At the latest in the third period, however, in which downloads are replaced by mere streaming, the first-sale doctrine becomes pointless. In this period the other aspect of the “exhaustion rule” comes into play. In fact, in the case of streaming the key question is what the user is allowed to do. This question concerns the user’s own activities, but also (and even more relevantly) whether or not the user – as contractual partner of the right holder – is allowed to assign his or her own users’ rights to a third party. This issue has been discussed broadly in relation to software, but hardly at all regarding works other than software. This paper discusses possible doctrinal approaches to deal with such questions and particularly challenges certain traditional perceptions of copyright law by emphasising the potential of the <b>implied</b> <b>licence</b> to explain transferability of users’ rights. Beyond that it critically evaluates the necessity and desirability of extending the concept of “exhaustion” to the digital world. Finally, it suggests that the discussion is of decreasing practical relevance in view of changing business methods and that consumer protection law rather than copyright law might provide more appropriate protection of users’ interests...|$|E
