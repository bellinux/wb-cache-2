25|$|Raw wheat can {{be ground}} into flour or, using hard durum wheat only, can be ground into semolina; germinated and dried {{creating}} malt; crushed or cut into cracked wheat; parboiled (or steamed), dried, crushed and de-branned into bulgur {{also known as}} groats. If the raw wheat is broken into parts at the mill, as is usually done, the outer husk or bran can be used several ways. Wheat is a major ingredient in such foods as bread, porridge, crackers, biscuits, Muesli, pancakes, pies, pastries, cakes, cookies, muffins, rolls, doughnuts, gravy, beer, vodka, boza (a <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage),</b> and breakfast cereals.|$|E
25|$|While {{the art of}} wine making {{reached the}} Hellenic {{peninsula}} by about 2000 BC, the first alcoholic beverage to obtain widespread popularity {{in what is now}} Greece was mead, a <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> made from honey and water. However, by 1700 BC, wine making was commonplace. During the next thousand years wine drinking assumed the same function so commonly found around the world: It was incorporated into religious rituals. It became important in hospitality, used for medicinal purposes, and became an integral part of daily meals. As a beverage, it was drunk in many ways: warm and chilled, pure and mixed with water, plain and spiced. Alcohol, specifically wine, was considered so important to the Greeks that consumption was considered a defining characteristic of the Hellenic culture between their society {{and the rest of the}} world; those who did not drink were considered barbarians.|$|E

30|$|Incidence of {{methanol}} {{contamination of}} traditionally <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> is increasing globally {{resulting in the}} death of several persons. The source of methanol contamination has not been clearly established in most countries. While there were speculations that unscrupulous vendors might have deliberately spiked the beverages with methanol, {{it is more likely that}} the methanol might have been produced by contaminating microbes during traditional ethanol fermentation, which is often inoculated spontaneously by mixed microbes, with a potential to produce mixed alcohols. Methanol production in traditionally <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> can be linked to the activities of pectinase producing yeast, fungi and bacteria. This study assessed some traditional <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> and found that some beverages are prone to methanol contamination including cachaca, cholai, agave, arak, plum and grape wines. Possible microbial role in the production of methanol and other volatile congeners in these <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> were discussed. The study concluded by suggesting that contaminated alcoholic beverages be converted for fuel use rather than out rightly banning the age—long traditional alcohol fermentation.|$|R
30|$|Limitations of {{our study}} are small number of sample size, {{consumption}} of low amount of beverage, and utilization of fresh <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages.</b> Although our results are applied for 300  mL consumption, higher consumption levels could change blood alcohol and urine EtG and EtS concentration. Lutmer et al. (Lutmer et al. 2009) indicated {{that in order to}} obtain 20  mg/dL blood ethanol level, about 5 - 6  L energy drink, with similar ethanol concentration to <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages,</b> should be consumed. On the other hand, fermentation is an ongoing process that causes more ethanol formation especially if the process or/and storage time gets prolonged. We used fresh traditional <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> in the presented study; however, it is possible that homemade or awaited beverages could have distinct ethanol concentrations which are likely to affect the blood alcohol results.|$|R

A Gift to Young Housewives by Elena Molokhovets, the best-selling Russian cookbook of the 19th century, first published in 1861, contains nine recipes for borscht, some of which are based on kvass, a traditional Slavic <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> made from rye bread.

500|$|The {{earliest}} known chemical {{evidence of}} barley beer dates to circa 3500–3100 BC {{from the site}} of Godin Tepe in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran. Some of the earliest Sumerian writings contain references to beer; examples include a prayer to the goddess Ninkasi, known as [...] "The Hymn to Ninkasi", which served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people, and the ancient advice (Fill your belly. Day and night make merry) to Gilgamesh, recorded in the Epic of Gilgamesh, by the ale-wife Siduri may, at least in part, have referred to the consumption of beer. The Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in Ebla, Syria, show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC. A <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC. Unlike sake, mould was not used to saccharify the rice (amylolytic fermentation); the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting.|$|E
2500|$|Kvass is a {{traditional}} Slavic <b>fermented</b> <b>beverage</b> commonly made from rye bread, [...] known in many Eastern European countries and especially in Ukraine and Russia as black bread. The colour of the bread used contributes to the colour of the resulting drink. It is classified as a non-alcoholic drink by Russian standards, as the alcohol content from fermentation is typically low (0.5–1.0%). It may be flavoured with fruits such as strawberries and raisins, or with herbs such as mint.|$|E

The aim of the study was production of <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> from goat milk using two different thickening starter cultures.

It was found that the process of fermentation of milk inoculated with cultures containing yeast was longer than the inoculated culture without yeast. During the cooling storage less increase of the acidity of the beverage with the yeast was observed. Colour and texture in both <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages</b> have changed significantly during storage. Drinks without yeast were characterised by lower hardness and consistency.

30|$|Traditional {{beverages}} such as şalgam, boza, kımız and kefir {{are frequently}} being consumed in Turkey.

30|$|At {{the present}} study, it is {{demonstrated}} that consumption of 300  mL of traditional <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages,</b> Şalgam, Boza, Kımız, and Kefir {{did not affect}} blood alcohol levels. Furthermore, this consumption does not cause any effect on concentrations of ethanol metabolites in urine. Our findings suggest that blood ethanol and urine ethanol metabolites should be analyzed in order to eliminate false positive results, in alleged false positive cases. However, further studies are needed with larger sample sizes and with different amounts of consumption of <b>fermented</b> <b>beverages.</b>|$|R
