5|$|In the 1980s, a {{minority}} of the club's supporters had {{a reputation as one of}} Britain's most prominent casuals groups, the Aberdeen Soccer Casuals. The rise of the Aberdeen Casuals coincided with the most successful period in the club's history, and has been chronicled in more than one published account. Whilst numbers have steadily declined with the introduction of Football Banning Orders preventing hooligans from travelling to games, the Aberdeen Casuals still appear at big fixtures often away <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> in the UEFA Europa League. There were clashes at both fixtures against FC Groningen in 2014, as well as 13 arrests after violent clashes with Dundee United fans at a game in December 2015.|$|E

5|$|The Sounds' home opener, {{scheduled}} for April 25, was rained out and pushed back to April 26. After playing their first ten games away <b>from</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> with tractors and grading machines still preparing {{the field on}} game day, the Sounds played their first home game at Herschel Greer Stadium on April 26, 1978. The 12–4victory against the Savannah Braves was witnessed by a sellout crowd of 8,156 spectators. Southern League president Billy Hitchcock was on hand to witness the event, and Conway Twitty threw out the first pitch.|$|E
5|$|The club's widest victory {{margin in}} the league was 12–0, a {{scoreline}} which they achieved once in the Football Alliance, against Nottingham Forest in 1899, and twice in the Second Division, against Walsall Town Swifts in 1892 and Doncaster Rovers in 1903. They have lost a league match by an eight-goal margin on eight occasions: twice in the Football Alliance and five times in the First Division, all away <b>from</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> once at home, beaten 8–0 by AFC Bournemouth in the Championship in 2014. Their record FA Cup win was 10–0 against Druids in the fourth qualifying round of the 1899 competition; their record FA Cup defeat was 7–0 at home to Liverpool in the 2006 quarter final.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Community Shield match, both teams played {{each other in the}} league at Chelsea's home ground, Stamford Bridge. Drogba scored the only goal of the game, which marked Arsenal's first league defeat against their opponents in ten years. Chelsea also beat Arsenal away <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> went on to retain the Premier League. Whereas Arsenal's league form was {{indifferent}} and the team finished fourth (outside of the top two for the first time under Wenger), their performances in the UEFA Champions League were appreciable. They became the first London team to participate in a European Cup final, though lost 2–1 to Barcelona in the Stade de France, Paris.|$|E

William was subsequently posted to France where, promoted to major, he was killed near Amiens in 1918. Marion settled in Southsea and sent Walter to The Portsmouth Grammar School, before moving him in 1918 to board at Cirencester Grammar School, believing that he would benefit from living away <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> hoping to encourage a career in farming. He did not enjoy an easy relationship with his mother, often staying with friends during holidays in preference to returning home.|$|E
5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{have won}} two European honours: the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970 and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1994. They also reached {{the final of}} the UEFA Cup in 2000, and became the first London team to appear in a UEFA Champions League final in 2006. Despite having never won the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal have set {{numerous}} records in the competition. Between 1998–99 and the current season, 2016–17, they participated in nineteen successive seasons, a record only surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid. Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten consecutive clean sheets in the run-in to Arsenal's first UEFA Champions League final and the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal. Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away <b>from</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro.|$|E
5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus had to {{deal with}} the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were {{currently}} at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Author Hiromu Arakawa {{integrated}} several {{social problems}} into the plot, {{such as the}} way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers {{after the death of}} their mother, Trisha. She also looks at how the brothers help {{people all over the country}} to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character. Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.|$|E

5|$|Dortmund {{were drawn}} against Copenhagen of Denmark {{in the third}} round and won the first leg 1–0 away from home with Heiko Herrlich scoring in injury time. The second leg {{produced}} the same result, this time, Jan-Derek Sørensen scored in the 89th minute to secure Dortmund a place in the fourth round. In the fourth round, Dortmund were drawn against Lille of France, who had also joined the UEFA Cup, after finishing third in their Champions League group. Dortmund played the first leg away <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> got an away goal, after a 1–1 draw. Dortmund had opened the scoring in the 67th minute when Ewerthon scored after a rebound, though the lead only lasted five minutes as Salaheddine Bassir scored a half-volley on 72 minutes to tie the game 1–1, going into the second leg in Dortmund. In a rain-soaked second leg at the Westfalenstadion, the match finished in a 0–0 draw, meaning Borussia went through to the quarter–finals on the away goals rule.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the year}} manager George Graham had started to {{assemble}} a squad with a blend of youth and experience. Having already signed defenders Steve Bould and Lee Dixon, he set about trimming the squad letting Steve Williams and Kenny Sansom leave. Arsenal were not considered favourites for the league title {{at the start of}} the season, but a 5–1 win away at Wimbledon on the opening day led to talk over their chances. They continued their fine start to the campaign, particularly away <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> led the table from the Christmas period. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of Liverpool, but a series of draws and surprising defeats allowed the gap to be closed. By the time Arsenal faced Liverpool on the final day, they were faced with an improbable challenge – winning by a two-goal margin against the defending champions to claim the title. Graham's cautious approach paid dividends as Arsenal led after the break, and deep into stoppage time midfielder Michael Thomas scored the all-important second goal.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the family}} has to create budget cuts in their daily routine, such as Homer having {{to give up on}} buying beer and Marge having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly lottery ticket. Bart must get his hair cut at a local barber school, Lisa can no longer get her volumes of Encyclopedia Generica, and Maggie's clothes have to last a little bit longer. They {{eventually}} save up enough money for the operation, which is a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the morale of the family suffers and they take their annoyance out on Santa's Little Helper. Feeling unwanted, he runs away <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken to the dog pound, and adopted by Mr. Burns, who trains him to be one of his vicious attack hounds. After a long brainwashing process, consisting of the Ludovico technique, Santa's Little Helper is turned into a bloodthirsty killer.|$|E

5|$|Lords {{was born}} Nora Louise Kuzma in Steubenville, Ohio. Her parents {{divorced}} {{when she was}} 7-years-old due to her father's abusive behavior, and she moved {{with her mother and}} three sisters to her great-grandmother's house. When she was 10, she was raped by a sixteen-year-old acquaintance. At the age of 12, Kuzma moved with her mother and sisters to Lawndale, California, along with her mother's boyfriend Roger, who was a cocaine dealer. She began attending Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California. At 14, she became pregnant by her high school boyfriend. Searching for a job in order to get money for an abortion, Kuzma was introduced to Roger's friend Lynn for whom she started working as a babysitter. Lynn offered to help her solve her job problems by getting her a fake driver's license ID. Her new ID, with the name of Kristie Elizabeth Nussman, stated she was 22 rather than 15. She ran away <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> ended up on the streets of Hollywood where she landed a job as a nude model. After appearing in a nude centerfold in Penthouse magazine (she was only 15 when the photos were taken), Kuzma became nationally known as Traci Lords. From there she appeared in numerous adult films and magazines until authorities discovered she had been a minor and started an extensive investigation of all her co-workers.|$|E
5|$|The 2001–02 {{season was}} the 104th season of {{competitive}} football played by Arsenal. Having ended the previous season as FA Cup finalists and league runners-up to Manchester United, the club went one better in this campaign, by completing the domestic double – their second {{in four years}} and third overall. Arsenal won the Premier League by a seven-point margin, were unbeaten away <b>from</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> managed the unique feat of scoring in every league game. They lost only {{three times in the}} division, all of which at home. At the Millennium Stadium, Arsenal beat Chelsea 2–0 to win the 2002 FA Cup Final. In Europe however, they fared poorly as they were eliminated in the second group stage of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fictional world called Ephinea. Ephinea is divided into three countries: Windor, Stratha, and Fendel. Asbel Lhant, Hubert Lhant, and Cheria Barnes are {{children}} from Lhant, a village of Windor. One day, the three befriend an amnesiac girl from outside their village who they name Sophie. That same day, Lhant is visited by Richard, the prince of Windor, who befriends the four of them. Richard returns to Barona, Windor's capital city, and invites them to sneak into his castle via a secret passage. There, the four are mortally wounded by an unknown monster but are saved when Sophie sacrifices herself. Asbel regains consciousness in Lhant and is told about Sophie's death and Hubert's political adoption into the Oswell family to secure Asbel's future as the Lord of Lhant.
