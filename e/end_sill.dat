Extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the effect sills or end sills on the hydraulic jumps in rectangular basins but not yet in radial basins. The complete design of stilling basins needs the accurate estimation of the depth ratio of the formed hydraulic jump in the basin. In the present paper, a theoretical model is developed to predict the depth ratio of the radial hydraulic jump when a basin is ended with a sill. Both the momentum and continuity equation in one dimension are applied to the control volume where the basin begins and ends. Also, the energy equation is used to develop a theoretical model to evaluate the energy loss by the radial hydraulic jump when a sill exists {{at the end of the}} basin. An experimental program is conducted to collect experimental data to enable verification of the developed theoretical models. Good agreement between theoretical and experimental results is obtained.

40|$|In dams {{with low}} {{tailwater}} levels, the hydraulic jump may not {{occur on the}} protected apron. This {{could result in a}} severe local scour on the downstream river bed which could endanger the safety of the dam. A traditional solution is to place crushed rock in the scour hole to prevent further scour; however, this method is not a permanent solution. The focus of this research is to investigate the effect, on the scour profile, of installing a secondary stilling basin downstream of the primary basin. This results in a dual stilling basin. The primary stilling basin is the original inadequate basin while the secondary stilling basin provides for the additional energy dissipation required to prevent excessive scouring in the river bed. In this research, the physical model of the Shand Dam was used as a case study. A 1 : 49 scale model of the Shand Dam was constructed in a 4. 9 m long by 3. 0 m wide by 0. 8 m deep basin in the Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory (B 03, Essex Hall) at the University of Windsor. Experimental work was carried out for various flows and <b>end</b> <b>sill</b> configurations in the secondary stilling basin. It was observed that within a few minutes a scour hole formed close to the structure; this {{is referred to as the}} short-term scour. A long-term scour formed farther from structure and increased by time. All the scour tests were conducted for half an hour to study short-term and long-term scour. Scour depths were measured at 56 points. From the scour profiles the best <b>end</b> <b>sill</b> slope to get minimum scour far from the structure was determined. Velocities were measured at selected locations at 0. 2, 0. 5 and 0. 8 of the depth within the secondary stilling basin and above the <b>end</b> <b>sill.</b> Pressure values at different points on the secondary stilling basin were recorded with a data acquisition system.

This novel work {{was an attempt to}} increase energy dissipation on stepped spillways since it not include stilling basin and have less cost compared with traditional spillways. So, in this paper, to investigate the increasing of energy dissipation of flow over stepped spillways of different step shapes, a twelve physical plywood models have been built. Experiments have been carried out for different types of step shapes: - plain steps, steps have half cut, inclined <b>end</b> <b>sill</b> steps normal to downstream slopes of stepped face, and steps have a rough surface using crushed gravel. Three downstream slopes of stepped face (è = 30 o, 50 o, and 70 o) were tested with spillway having constant number of steps and constant height. In total, 144 experiments were done, the hydraulic parameters of flow over the models were measured and the energy dissipation of flow was calculated. Experimental results showed that the energy dissipation of flow on inclined <b>end</b> <b>sill,</b> and rough steps are more than the plain one. While the experiments results on the cutting steps showed that the energy dissipation are less than the plain one. With decreasing the downstream slopes of the stepped spillway face, the energy dissipation is increased. In addition, when compared with traditional spillways the case of rough steps and steps with inclined <b>end</b> <b>sill</b> can be used to increase the relative energy dissipation on plain steps by about 19 % and about 18 % respectively for small angle of spillway face since the stepped spillways more effective than traditional spillways by 10 %. Therefore, double that means that the affectivity of stepped spillway was approximately. On the other side, the energy dissipation increased at low discharges by 0. 1 % when using the cutting steps but decreased by 13 % with larger discharges. In summary, the flow energy dissipation decreases with increasing the flow rate, and the roughed step spillway surface is more effective compared to the other spillway surfaces at low or high flow rate. According to the flow types, the range of Nappe, Transition, and Skimming will increase for all the forms of steps that used compare with plain step...|$|E
