60|$|Mr. Burke had {{arranged}} {{a sort of}} <b>gang-plank</b> with a railing {{if any of them}} wanted to go on shore--that is, step on terra firma--during the voyage. But Samuel Rolands, the mover, heedful of his special prize, urged upon them not to get out any oftener than could be helped, because when they wished to use the <b>gang-plank</b> he would be obliged to stop.|$|E
60|$|When Daughtry sauntered {{along the}} main deck {{a few minutes later}} and paused for a gossip with the customs officer and a {{quartermaster}} {{at the head of the}} <b>gang-plank,</b> Captain Duncan little dreamed that his casual glance was resting on his steward for the last time. He watched him go down the <b>gang-plank</b> empty-handed, with no dog at his heels, and stroll off along the wharf under the electric lights.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll come back, dear Jees Uck, {{before the}} first snow flies," [...] he promised her, between the last kisses at the <b>gang-plank.</b>|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a {{birdseye}} view of {{the waterfront}} in Shanghai, ca. 1900. Large, floating docks are shown to the left, with small skiffs anchored to their side. These docks {{are connected to the}} landing at right by side-railed <b>gang-planks.</b> Goods are stacked on the landing in the foreground, while large, siloh- and warehouse-style buildings are visible in the distance...|$|R
5000|$|Its {{form was}} {{described}} by Lucy S. Furman in December 1894 [...] "The Floatin Bethel was made this way. There was two stories. The lower one was one long room, like a church, with the pulpit at one end, and benches set in rows all the way back, and big doors openin out on both sides, so s the <b>gang-planks</b> could be laid right to em for the people to get in easy, and the devil would nt have any room to talk about religious folks holdin theirselves so up and above others. The top story had a hall down the middle, and sleepin-rooms on each side. We eat in the hall, and {{had one of the}} little rooms for a cook-room. Then there was a realnice little steeple on top." ...|$|R
60|$|It is a weary {{way from}} Vannes to Bordeaux. Coastwise ships {{are hard to}} find, and winds blow north when all brave hearts would fain be {{speeding}} south. A full month has passed from the day when Nigel received his letter before he stood upon the quay-side of the Garonne amid the stacked barrels of Gascon wine and helped to lead Pommers down the <b>gang-planks.</b> Not Aylward himself had a worse opinion of the sea than the great yellow horse, and he whinnied with joy as he thrust his muzzle into his master's outstretched hand, and stamped his ringing hoofs upon the good firm cobblestones. Beside him, slapping his tawny shoulder in encouragement, was the lean spare form of Back Simon who had remained ever under Nigel's pennon.|$|R
60|$|The <b>gang-plank</b> {{being on}} the port side, Dag Daughtry paddled around to the {{starboard}} and brought the canoe to a stop under a certain open port.|$|E
60|$|It was now half-past nine. Lodloe arose {{and looked}} out over the pier. He could see nothing of the young mother. The freight was all on board, and they were hauling up the forward <b>gang-plank.</b> One or two belated {{passengers}} were hurrying along the pier; the bell was ringing; now the passengers were on board, the aft <b>gang-plank</b> was hauled in, the hawsers were cast off from the posts, the pilot's bell jingled, the wheels began to revolve, and the great steamboat slowly moved from its pier.|$|E
6000|$|He {{passed up}} the <b>gang-plank</b> to the village, {{and with no}} more prelude than a Salvation Army picket in a Portsmouth slum, cried: [...] "Oh, my brothers!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course I will, dear. Now take {{me up the}} <b>gang-plank</b> {{and into}} the cabin. Once aboard the lugger and the maid is--and I am free, I mean.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{took her}} by the {{shoulder}} and hurried her on deck, over the bulwark, down the <b>gang-plank,</b> and so on to the place where I had left Euphemia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I will, dear. Now take {{me up the}} <b>gang-plank</b> {{and into}} the cabin. Once aboard the lugger and the maid is--and I am free, I mean." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>gang-plank</b> was hauled in, and the Aurora swung {{out from}} the bank. Weedon Scott waved a last good-bye. Then he turned and bent over White Fang, {{standing}} by his side.|$|E
60|$|And {{with a final}} {{kick the}} {{stowaway}} was run off the <b>gang-plank,</b> to fall in a heap on the dock, too weak from the confinement and want of proper food to stand.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he dropped}} his chin {{on his chest and}} slept. When half a dozen men started to carry him up the <b>gang-plank,</b> he awoke, reached for the grip, and clung to it like a {{drowning}} man.|$|E
6000|$|... "The dog {{accompanied}} {{me through}} Austria, Switzerland, and France to Havre, from which port we sailed. I took leave {{of him on}} the <b>gang-plank.</b> He licked my hands, and I caressed and stroked him. People might have thought that my actions denoted insanity, but every one was so greatly occupied in these last moments before departure, that perhaps I was not noticed. Just as I left him and hastened on board, a sailor fell overboard from the <b>gang-plank.</b> He was quickly rescued, but could not imagine why he had fallen. I believe, however, that he was tripped up by the snake part of my friend as he convulsively rushed away." ...|$|E
60|$|Arrived at the dock, he had {{no trouble}} in getting the stateroom key, since he had the proper tickets, and, after caring for the baggage, it was only {{necessary}} to wait near the <b>gang-plank</b> until his employer should appear.|$|E
60|$|At last it came, and its hoarse boom thrilled {{the heart}} of many a homesick man like myself. We had not much to put aboard, and when I climbed the <b>gang-plank</b> {{it was with a}} feeling of {{fortunate}} escape.|$|E
6000|$|A big {{stevedore}} {{carried her}} down two decks {{to where the}} <b>gang-plank</b> was thrown across. Captain Lige himself was at the other end. His face lighted, Pushing the people aside, he rushed across, snatched the lady from the negro's arms, crying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... " [...] He's {{got to come}} pretty soon, or else his stateroom won't do {{him much}} good," [...] Joe said {{to himself as he}} stood close by the <b>gang-plank</b> with the key in his hand, ready to deliver it without delay.|$|E
60|$|I {{set about}} helping him, {{and for an}} hour we labored at this hasty and toilsome moving. It was indeed a toilsome business. The floors were shelving, the stairs leaned over sideways, ever so far, and the <b>gang-plank</b> was desperately short and steep.|$|E
60|$|Had {{they been}} alone the Rovers {{might have had}} some {{difficulty}} in gaining entrance to the dock; but the detective led the way, showing his badge; and soon the party found themselves at the <b>gang-plank</b> of the steamer. Here Sam rejoined them.|$|E
60|$|And {{when the}} shades of evening began to gather around us, I hauled in the <b>gang-plank</b> (just like a {{delightful}} old draw-bridge, Euphemia said, although I {{hope for the}} sake of our ancestors that draw-bridges were easier to haul in) and went to bed.|$|E
60|$|But Weedon Scott was not listening. He was {{thinking}} rapidly. The Aurora's whistle hooted a final announcement of departure. Men were scurrying down the <b>gang-plank</b> to the shore. Matt loosened the bandana {{from his own}} neck and started to put it around White Fang's. Scott grasped the dog-musher's hand.|$|E
60|$|The sailors {{were pulling}} the <b>gang-plank</b> ashore, and Joe {{saw that his}} time was indeed limited. Since he had been ordered {{to care for the}} baggage until the gentleman came, he had no idea of leaving it on the steamer, neither did he propose to make a trip to Providence.|$|E
6000|$|The lascar grinned. [...] "Then it {{will not}} be in this way--with {{stonework}} sunk under water, as the Quetta was sunk. I like sus-sus-pen-sheen bridges that fly from bank to bank, with one big step, like a <b>gang-plank.</b> Then no water can hurt. When does the Lord Sahib come to open the bridge?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{arrival of}} the War Eagle from St. Paul carried a fine foreign significance, and I ascended its <b>gang-plank</b> with {{the air of a}} {{traveller}} embarking at Cairo for Assouan. Once aboard the vessel I mingled, aloofly, with the passengers, absorbed in study of the river winding down among its wooded hills.|$|E
60|$|And then he {{took his}} load from me and dashed down the <b>gang-plank.</b> I went below to look for Pomona. The lantern still hung on the nail, and I took it down {{and went into the}} kitchen. There was Pomona, dressed, and with her hat on, quietly packing some things in a basket.|$|E
6000|$|The Lascar grinned. [...] "Then it {{will not}} be in this way - with {{stonework}} sunk under water, as the Qyetta was sunk. I like sus-sus-pen-sheen bridges that fly from bank to bank. with one big step, like a <b>gang-plank.</b> Then no water can hurt. When does the Lord Sahib come to open the bridge?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] he cried, [...] "the tide's {{down and}} I got ashore without any trouble. You {{stay where you}} are. I've hired a couple of mules to tow the boat back. They'll be here when the tide rises. And, hello! I've found the <b>gang-plank.</b> It floated ashore {{about a quarter of}} a mile below here." ...|$|E
60|$|Sam {{reached the}} <b>gang-plank,</b> showed his ticket, {{and made his}} way through the crowd of passengers, passengers' friends, stewards, junior officers, and sailors who infested the deck. He {{proceeded}} down the main companion-way, through a rich smell of india-rubber and mixed pickles, as far as the dining saloon; then turned down the narrow passage leading to his state-room.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Portney, in the jam {{of people}} below, heard and looked up. In {{a moment he}} had caught sight of his nephews and he shook his hand at them. Soon he was {{mounting}} the <b>gang-plank,</b> {{the last of the}} passengers to come on board. He was out of breath and gave the boys an odd smile.|$|E
60|$|In fact, an hour earlier, as the Makambo's anchor was heaving out {{and while}} Captain Kellar was {{descending}} the port <b>gang-plank,</b> Michael was coming on board through a starboard port-hole. This was because Michael was inexperienced in the world, {{because he was}} expecting to meet Jerry on board this boat since the last he had seen of him was on a boat, and because {{he had made a}} friend.|$|E
60|$|There was a rattle as the <b>gang-plank</b> moved inboard and was {{deposited}} on the deck. The girl uttered a little cry of dismay. Then suddenly her face brightened {{and she began}} to wave her arm {{to attract the attention of}} an elderly man with a red face made redder by exertion, who had just forced his way to the edge of the dock and was peering up at the passenger-lined rail.|$|E
6000|$|By now {{the bustle}} which precedes the {{departure}} of an ocean liner was at its height. Hoarse voices were crying, [...] "All for the shore!" [...] The gangway was thronged with friends of passengers returning to land. The crowd on the pier waved flags and handkerchiefs and shouted unintelligibly. Members of the crew stood alertly by the <b>gang-plank</b> ready to draw it in {{as soon as the}} last seer-off had crossed it.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the top of}} the <b>gang-plank</b> {{he stood}} still a minute, his box still on his back, and said, [...] "This then is the pathway to Saint Helena." [...] I heard an officer down on the dock call up, [...] "Now then, my man, move on there smartly, please." [...] And I saw some young roughs {{pointing}} at Uncle and laughing and saying, [...] "Look at the old guy with the red handkerchief. Is he batty, eh?" ...|$|E
