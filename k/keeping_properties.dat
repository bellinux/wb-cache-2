40|$|Hybrid {{materials}} {{obtained by}} sol-gel process {{are able to}} degrade and release Si compounds that are useful in regenerative medicine due to their osteoinductive properties. The present work studies the behavior of new organic-inorganic sol-gel coatings based on triple mixtures of alkoxysilanes in different molar ratios. The precursors employed are methyl-trimethoxysilane (MTMOS), 3 -glycidoxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS). After optimization of the synthesis conditions, the coatings were characterized using 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance (29 Si-MNR), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), contact angle measurements, hydrolytic degradation assays, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and mechanical profilometry. The degradation and EIS results show that by controlling the amount of TEOS precursor in the coating {{it is possible to}} tune its degradation by hydrolysis, while <b>keeping</b> <b>properties</b> such as wettability at their optimum values for biomaterials application. The corrosion properties of the new coatings were also evaluated when applied to stainless steel substrate.

40|$|From {{the last}} decade, the multi-scale image {{segmentation}} {{is getting a}} particular interest and practically being used for object-based image analysis. In this study, we have addressed the issues on multi-scale image segmentation, especially, in improving the performances for validity of merging and variety of derived region’s shape. Firstly, we have introduced constraints on the application of spectral criterion which could suppress excessive merging between dissimilar regions. Secondly, we have extended the evaluation for smoothness criterion by modifying the definition {{on the extent of}} the object, which was brought for controlling the shape’s diversity. Thirdly, we have developed new shape criterion called aspect ratio. This criterion helps to improve the reproducibility on the shape of object to be matched to the actual objectives of interest. This criterion provides constraint on the aspect ratio in the bounding box of object by <b>keeping</b> <b>properties</b> controlled with conventional shape criteria. These improvements and extensions lead to more accurate, flexible, and diverse segmentation results according to the shape characteristics of the target of interest. Furthermore, we also investigated a technique for quantitative and automatic parameterization in multi-scale image segmentation. This approach is achieved by comparing segmentation result with training area specified in advance by considering the maximization of the average area in derived objects or satisfying the evaluation index called F-measure. Thus, it has been possible to automate the parameterization that suited the objectives especially in the view point of shape’s reproducibility...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{duplication}} of genes and even complete genomes {{may be a}} prerequisite for major evolutionary transitions and the origin of evolutionary novelties. How-ever, the evolutionary mechanisms of gene evolution and the origin of novel gene functions after gene duplication have been a subject of many debates. Recently, we com-piled 26 groups of orthologous genes, which included one gene from human, mouse, and chicken, one or two genes from the tetraploid Xenopus and two genes from zebrafish. Comparative analysis and mapping data showed that these pairs of zebrafish genes were probably produced during a fish-specific genome duplication that occurred between 300 and 450 Mya, before the teleost radiation (Taylor et al. 2001). As discussed here, many of these retained duplicated genes code for DNA binding proteins. Different models {{have been developed to}} ex-plain the retention of duplicated genes and in particular the subfunctionalization model of Force et al. (1999) could explain why so many developmental control genes have been retained. Other models are harder to reconcile with this particular set of duplicated genes. Most genes seem to have been subjected to strong purifying selec-tion, <b>keeping</b> <b>properties</b> such as charge and polarity the same in both duplicates, although some evidence was found for positive Darwinian selection, in particular for Hox genes. However, since only the cumulative pattern of nucleotide substitutions can be studied, clear indica-tions of positive Darwinian selection or neutrality may be hard to find for such anciently duplicated genes. Nev-ertheless, an increase in evolutionary rate in about half of the duplicated genes seems to suggest that either positive Darwinian selection has occurred or that functional con-straints have been relaxed at one point in time during functional divergence...|$|E
40|$|The {{consumer}} purchases meat {{after making}} a judgement about quantity and quality received for price paid. Quantity and price are easy to assess, whereas quality is a more subjective characteristic and {{is more difficult to}} measure, particularly as done by consumers. Through the years, pork has had an excellent image. It has been considered an attractive, nutritious and wholesomemeat available for a reasonable price. In addition, it has lent itself well to conversion to a variety of processed products- such as hamandbacon- whichhavedifferentpalatabilityand <b>keeping</b> <b>properties.</b> Since the trend is to use more pork for further processing, quality is equally important for ensuring 'ideal ' processed pork as well as 'ideal ' fresh pork. But, the image hasn't been totally positive. Pork has been perceived as a fatty meat. This probably resulted not only from the heavy layers of backfat found on most hogs some years ago but also from the fact that pork fat is softer than fat from other meat animal species. Therein arose the concept that pork was "greasy " or "hard to digest. " Pork producers attempted to change this image beginning in the 1950 sby instituting breeding programs designed to lower the fat content of pork carcasses. In reality, they were seeking to produce a trim, muscular "meat type " hog. This change was advantageous-but, in the process of selection, the quality of the muscle was unexpectedly changed, too. Pale, soft and exudative (PSE) pork quickly became recognized as undesirable not only because of its unattractive visual appearance but also because of shrinkage due to drip loss {{and the fact that the}} meat was less functional for processed products. PSEmeat was often associated with trim, muscular hogs. Subsequently,it was also recognizedthat some of these same hogs were more susceptible to stress and, in fact, suffered the potentially terminal condition known as porcine stress syndrome (PSS) ...|$|E
