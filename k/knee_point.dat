50|$|The knee-point voltage of {{a current}} {{transformer}} is {{the magnitude of}} the secondary voltage above which the output current ceases to linearly follow the input current within declared accuracy. In testing, if a voltage is applied across the secondary terminals the magnetizing current will increase in proportion to the applied voltage, until the <b>knee</b> <b>point</b> is reached. The <b>knee</b> <b>point</b> is defined as the voltage at which a 10% increase in applied voltage increases the magnetizing current by 50%. For voltages greater than the <b>knee</b> <b>point,</b> the magnetizing current increases considerably even for small increments in voltage across the secondary terminals. The knee-point voltage is less applicable for metering current transformers as their accuracy is generally much higher, but constrained within a very small range of the current transformer rating, typically 1.2 to 1.5 times rated current. However, the concept of <b>knee</b> <b>point</b> voltage is very pertinent to protection current transformers, since they are necessarily exposed to fault currents of 20 to 30 times rated current.|$|E

30|$|Knee points {{show the}} {{conflicting}} degree and are interesting to DMs {{if they do}} not have specific preferences [68]. <b>Knee</b> <b>point</b> detection is based on the different definition for 2 or 3 -objective problems [73]. The definition of <b>knee</b> <b>point</b> in MaOPs is not yet well-established, because the conflicting degree might vary with different pairs of objectives. The sensitivity to changes in individual objectives may exist in some particular regions on the PF, which can be considered as partial knee points that are of interested to DMs.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} time series forecasting using single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), which is optimized via multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. By utilizing the adaptive differential evolution (JADE) and the <b>knee</b> <b>point</b> strategy, a nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE) and its improved version knee point-based NSJADE (KP-NSJADE) are developed for optimizing SLFNs. JADE aiming at refining the search area is introduced in nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The presented NSJADE shows superiority on multimodal problems when compared with NSGA-II. Then NSJADE is applied to train SLFNs for time series forecasting. It is revealed that individuals with better forecasting performance in the whole population gather around the <b>knee</b> <b>point.</b> Therefore, KP-NSJADE is proposed to explore the neighborhood of the <b>knee</b> <b>point</b> in the objective space.

30|$|Third, <b>knee</b> <b>point</b> {{selection}} plays a {{key role}} in enabling the population of KnEA to converge to the Pareto fronts for MaOPs. On all tested MaOPs, KnEA only using <b>knee</b> <b>point</b> selection can achieve a competitive performance in terms of IGD and GD, especially for DTLZ 2 with 5 and 10 objectives. This result shows that KnEA is still effective on most MaOPs when the knee points are selected from the whole population instead of each non-dominated front of the population, despite that the performance has a little deterioration. It seems that non-dominated sorting is more helpful in KnEA on DTLZ 1 with a large number of local Pareto fronts, which can considerably enhance the convergence of population of KnEA in terms of GD.|$|E

40|$|Limb {{design is}} well conserved among quadrupeds, notably, the <b>knees</b> <b>point</b> forward (i. e. cranial {{inclination}} of femora) and the elbows point back (i. e. caudal inclination of humeri). This study was undertaken {{to examine the}} effects of joint orientation on individual leg forces and centre of mass dynamics. Steady-speed trotting was simulated in two quadrupedal models. Model I had the knee and elbow orientation of a quadruped and model II had a reversed leg configuration in which <b>knees</b> <b>point</b> back and elbows point forward. The model's legs showed directional compliance determined by the orientation of the knee/elbow. In both models, forward pointing knees/elbows produced a propulsive force bias, while rearward pointing knees/elbows produced a braking force bias. Hence, model I showed the same pattern of hind-leg propulsion and fore-leg braking observed in trotting animals. Simulations revealed minimal pitch oscillations during steady-speed trotting of model I, but substantially greater and more irregular pitch oscillations of model II. The reduced pitch oscillation of model I was a result of fore-leg and hind-leg forces that reduced pitching moments during early and late stance, respectively. This passive mechanism for reducing pitch oscillations was an emergent property of directionally compliant legs with the fore–hind configuration of model I. Such intrinsic stability resulting from mechanical design can simplify control tasks and lead to more robust running machines...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{oxidative}} polymerization of alpha-methylstyrene (AMS) {{has been}} studied at various temperatures(45 - 70 degrees C) and pressures (50 - 400 psi). Due to its high electron dense double bond, it undergoes thermal oxidative polymerization even at low temperatures fairly easily.

Above 45 degrees C the rate of polymerization increases sharply at a particular instant showing an ''autoacceleration'' {{with the formation of}} a <b>knee</b> <b>point.</b> The ''autoacceleration'' is supported {{from the fact that the}} plot, of R-p vs T shows a rapid rise, and the plot of ln R-p vs 1 /T is non-Arrhenius. The occurrence of autoacceleration is explained on the basis of acetophenone-induced cleavage of PMSP during polymerization, generating more initiating alkoxy radicals, which subsequently leads to the rapid rise in the rate of polymerization.
