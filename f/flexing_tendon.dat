40|$|PURPOSE AND METHODS: In {{order to}} {{determine}} forces acting upon an articular joint during hand rehabilitation, a dynamic splint was built and connected to a dynamometer (capable of measuring forces in the range 0 - 600 gf). Through trigonometric calculation, the authors measured the flexing force in the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger at 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, and 90 ° of flexion. Measurements were obtained in a population of 40 voluntary adults, 20 females and 20 males, This flexing force was correlated with age, sex, and anthropometric measures. RESULTS: Force in the <b>flexing</b> <b>tendon</b> is maximal {{at the start of}} flexion, and decreases as the angle of joint flexion increases. A relationship was observed between finger length and the magnitude of the force exerted on the tendon: the longer the finger, the greater the force exherted upon the tendon. Force is greater at all the measured angles, (except 30 °) in males and in individuals of higher stature, and bigger arm span. CONCLUSIONS: The flexing force can be effectively measured at all flexing angles, that it correlates with a number of different anthropometric parameters, and that such data are likely to open the way for future studies...|$|E

25|$|This work in {{particular}} shows Leonardo's expertise in painting the human form. The outstretched hand of Cecilia was painted with great detail. Leonardo paints every contour of each fingernail, each wrinkle around her knuckles, {{and even the}} <b>flexing</b> of the <b>tendon</b> in her bent finger.|$|R
25|$|Knowledge of equine forelimb anatomy is {{especially}} useful for understanding navicular syndrome. The navicular bone lies behind the coffin bone {{and under the}} small pastern bone. The deep digital flexor (DDF) tendon runs {{down the back of}} the cannon and soft tissue in that area and under the navicular bone before attaching {{to the back of the}} coffin bone. The DDF <b>tendon</b> <b>flexes</b> the coffin joint, and the navicular bone acts as a fulcrum that the DDF tendon runs over.|$|R
50|$|Wounds {{inflicted by}} the conical Minié ball were {{different}} from those caused by the round balls from smoothbore muskets, since the conical ball had a higher muzzle velocity and greater mass, and easily penetrated the human body. Round balls tended to remain lodged in the flesh, and they were often observed to take a winding path through the body. <b>Flexed</b> muscles and <b>tendons,</b> as well as bone, could cause the round ball to deviate from a straight path. The Minié ball tended to cut a straight path and usually {{went all the way}} through the injured part; the ball seldom remained lodged in the body. If a Minié ball struck a bone, it usually caused the bone to shatter. The damage to bones and resulting compound fractures were usually severe enough to necessitate amputation. The entire point of the minie ball was to damage the bones, and have them do the damage themselves. A hit on a major blood vessel could also have serious consequences.|$|R
