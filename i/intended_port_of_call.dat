5000|$|If {{the suspect}} chose to confess their guilt and abjure, {{they did so}} in a public ceremony, usually at the church gates. They would {{surrender}} their possessions to the church, and any landed property to the crown. The coroner, a medieval official, would then choose a port city from which the fugitive should leave England (though the fugitive sometimes had this privilege). The fugitive would set out barefooted and bareheaded, carrying a wooden cross-staff {{as a symbol of}} protection under the church. Theoretically they would stay to the main highway, reach the port and take the first ship out of England. In practice, however, the fugitive could get a safe distance away, abandon the cross-staff and take off and start a new life. However, one can safely assume the friends and relatives of the victim knew of this ploy and would do everything in their power to make sure this did not happen; or indeed that the fugitive never reached their <b>intended</b> <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> becoming a victim of vigilante justice under the pretense of a fugitive who wandered too far off the main highway while trying to [...] "escape." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the O Tahiti Nui Freedom was {{inspired}} by a historical plan drawn in Tahiti by Admiral Paris around 1820 (standard plank of wood and stitch construction). The design was then reviewed and modernized by a group of naval architects {{in order to meet the}} standards of modern safety while respecting the line and form of Paris' 1820 plan. This modified design was then sent to all <b>of</b> the <b>intended</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> to assure compliance with local standards.|$|R
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{did not go}} {{according to}} plan after its departure from Baltimore on June 23, 1932. Ten of the [...] "gentleman rovers" [...] pulled out before the start and the ship was blown far off course by storms, making an unplanned first landfall at Bermuda. Eleven more members of the expedition quit while there, before the ship sailed on to its <b>intended</b> first <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> Martinique. En route, {{it was discovered that}} the ship's fresh water had all leaked away. More expedition members abandoned ship on arrival. As the expedition was critically short of money, the ship's owners ordered it to return to Baltimore, bringing to an end what the captain described as [...] "the worst trip I ever made". Hubbard nonetheless presented the expedition as a success and blamed the captain for its travails: [...] "the ship's dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous, requiring Ron Hubbard's hand at both the helm and the charts." ...|$|R
40|$|The Cruise Itinerary Schedule Design (CISD) problem {{determines the}} optimal {{sequence}} {{of a given}} set <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> (a <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is an intermediate stop in a cruise itinerary) and the arrival and departure times at each <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> {{in order to maximize}} the monetary value of the utility at <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> minus the fuel cost. To solve this problem, in view of the practical observations that most cruise itineraries do not have many <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> we first enumerate all sequences <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> and then optimize the arrival and departure times at each <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> by developing a dynamic programming approach. To improve the computational efficiency, we propose effective bounds on the monetary value of each sequence <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> eliminating non-optimal sequences without invoking the dynamic programming algorithm. Extensive computational experiments are conducted and the results showthat, first, using the bounds on the profit of each sequence <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> considerably improves the computational efficiency; second, the total profit of the cruise itinerary is sensitive to the fuel price and hence an accurate estimation of the fuel price is highly desirable; third, the optimal sequence <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is not necessarily the sequencewith the shortest voyage distance, especially when the ports do not have a natural geographic sequence.

From 1964-1988 the ship was owned by Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab (VDS). Its <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> was Stokmarknes.

On 30 September 1988 the ship was sold to Finnmark Fylkesrederi og Ruteselskap (FFR) for 20 million Norwegian Kroner (nok), and its <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> was changed to Hammerfest, Norway.
