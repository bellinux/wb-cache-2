Although the Women's Army Corps (WAC) accepted African-American women from its inception, the U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) only began accepting African-American women in October 1944, with fewer than 100 of them serving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>WAVES,</b> and the U.S. Marine Corps Women's Reserve never opened its ranks to African-American women. The five African-American women who served in the SPARS were: Olivia Hooker, D. Winifred Byrd, Julia Mosley, Yvonne Cumberbatch, and Aileen Cooke.|$|E

LDDP, on the other hand, prioritized maintaining the existing levels of production, which meant ensuring that the land stays {{in the hands of}} those who would work it most efficiently. Once in power, LDDP introduced changes to the Law on Land Reform, slowing down the process of restitution and limiting its scope.|$|E

500|$|WAVE {{officers}} were first assigned to recruiting {{stations in the}} different U.S. naval districts, later {{they were joined by}} enlisted personnel with recruiter training. The primary sources of publicity used were radio, newspapers, posters, brochures, and personal contacts. [...] The focus of their advertising campaign was patriotism and the need for women.

At the end of 1942, there were 770 officers and 3,109 enlisted women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>WAVES.</b> By 3 July 1945 their ranks had risen to 86,291, which included 8,475 officers, 73,816 enlisted, and about 4,000 in training.|$|E
500|$|Out {{of an army}} of {{approximately}} 66,000 men, the Austrians lost 22,000, including 3,000 dead, 7,000 wounded, and an astonishing 12,000 captured. Of the dead and wounded, Austrian demographer and historian Gaston Bodart estimated that almost five percent were officers; [...] he also placed such other losses as capture and desertion at 17,000, almost 26 percent. Charles lost entire regiments, either scattered in the first attacks or overrun at the end; they simply dissolved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> of Prussian blue coats. The Prussians also captured 51 standards and 116 of the 250 Austrian cannons. [...] Of the Prussian army of 36,000, Frederick lost 6,344, including 1,141 dead, 5,118 wounded and 85 captured. He lost none of his artillery. Despite the victory, its cost was high: Frederick lost one fifth of the men he had taken into battle, including two of his major generals.|$|E

Others were destroyed: an American ship named Ellis, passing close to Crookhaven on 29 December, encountered a vessel wallowing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waves,</b> dismasted and with the deck strewn with bodies. The American captain, Harvey, reported that he approached the ship {{but was unable to}} assist her due to the storm and as he watched, the ship was driven ashore and destroyed.

500|$|Neurath {{had enjoyed}} {{role-playing}} video games like Wizardry, {{but found that}} their simple, abstract visuals were an obstacle to the suspension of disbelief. He believed that Dungeon Masters detailed first-person presentation was a [...] "glimpse into the future", and he sought to create a fantasy role-playing game that built on its example. In early 1990, Neurath wrote a design document for a game titled Underworld, which described such elements as [...] "goblins on the prows of rowboats tossed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waves,</b> shooting arrows at the player above on a rope bridge swinging in the wind." [...] He contracted former Origin employee Doug Wike to create concept art. Wike created a brief, hand-drawn animation with Deluxe Paint Animation, which depicted the game's interface and a creature moving toward the player. The animation defined the game's direction, and it {{was used as a}} reference point for the game's tone and features throughout development. That spring, Neurath founded the company Blue Sky Productions in Salem, New Hampshire, with the intention to create Underworld. Among the company's first employees was Doug Church, who was studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The team was thus composed of Doug Church as programmer, Doug Wike as lead artist and Paul Neurath as lead designer. Development began in May 1990.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the storm}} had abated, the men built a raft from planks and barrels and sent two men to shore. The raft broke up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waves,</b> and both men drowned. After making a second, more solid, raft, the others {{were able to make}} it safely to shore. Over the next few days they {{returned}} to the ship daily to retrieve cargo, managing to salvage some of La Salle's papers and clothes, barrels of flour, casks of wine, glass beads, and other trade items. Before long, however, a strong southerly wind drove the hull into the muddy bottom, and soon only the rear deck remained above water. Of the 27people originally assigned to the ship, the only survivors were Tessier, a priest, a military officer, a regular soldier, a servant girl, and a small boy. They remained on the peninsula for three months, as the only way to the fort was to walk through Karankawa territory. [...] After a small Indian canoe washed ashore one day, the survivors were able to paddle across the bay and return to the fort. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of any assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy {{at the end of the}} war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve.
