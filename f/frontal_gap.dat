40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{electrochemical}} machining of micro slots using a shaped electrode {{instead of the}} traditional cylindrical electrode is presented. By applying shaped electrode the flow state of processing can be improved. An electrochemical machining (ECM) system for meeting {{the requirements of the}} ECM process was established and a shaped electrode was fabricated by BEDG (Block Electrical Discharge Grinding). A set of experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of shaped electrode on machining efficiency and shape precision. The results show that the side gap and <b>frontal</b> <b>gap</b> of the micro slots can be reduced and machining speed will be improved when the shaped electrode was used compare with cylindrical electrode...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} frontal gaps and skeletal stability after intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO) for correction of mandibular prognathism. Materials and Methods. Thirty-three patients with frontal gaps after IVRO-based mandibular prognathism correction were included. Three lateral and frontal cephalometric radiographs were obtained: preoperatively (T 1), immediately postoperatively (T 2), and 2 years postoperatively (T 3). Two linear measurements (menton [Me] and <b>frontal</b> <b>gap)</b> were compared from T 1 to T 3 (T 21 : immediate surgical changes; T 32 : postoperative stability; T 31 : 2 -year surgical change). Data were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression. Results. The T 21 mean surgical horizontal change in the Me position was 12. 4 ± 4. 23 [*]mm. Vertically, the mean downward Me movement was 0. 6 ± 1. 73 [*]mm. The mean frontal gaps were 4. 7 ± 2. 68 [*]mm and 4 ± 2. 48 [*]mm in {{the right and left}} gonial regions, respectively. Postoperative stability (T 32) significantly correlated with the amount of setback. Frontal gaps did not {{have a significant effect on}} postoperative stability. However, multiple regression model (R 2 = 0. 341, P= 0. 017) showed value predictability, especially in the amount of setback. Conclusion. Frontal gaps occur after IVRO but have no significant effect on long-term postoperative skeletal stability. The primary risk factor for postoperative relapse remains the amount of mandibular setback...|$|E
40|$|The {{presumptive}} "simple" {{nervous system}} of cnidarians has been recently {{demonstrated in the}} hydrozoan diploblastic planula of Clava multicornis to achieve a surprisingly high level of histological, cytological, biochemical and functional complexity, with characteristic localization of sensory neurons concentrated in the anterior ectoderm and a prominent anterior neural plexus (PIRAINO et al., 2011). These morphological features are reminiscent of those already present in early bilaterian animals, {{and they have been}} interpreted as pre-requisites for the forward-directed crawling behavior of the benthic larva of C. multicornis. In addition, circumferential GLWamide-immunoreactive neurite bundles of the anterior neural plexus are distributed around a <b>frontal</b> <b>gap</b> in the ectoderm and mesoglea, where the endoderm bulges out in contact with the external environment. Opposite to the pole where the polyp mouth will open at metamorphosis, such histological discontinuity has been interpreted as a functional anterior larval orifice, allowing effective communication between the inner planula cavity and the outer environment. To further investigate the features and the functionality of such a mouth-like anterior discontinuity, both TEM ultrastructural analysis and functional experiments with labeled dyes and particles were carried out. Transverse sections were made at the anteriormost part of the planulae and observed under TEM, clearly confirming the occurrence of a mesogleal interruption of the ectodermal layer at the anterior larval pole, i. e. a true anterior orifice, where endodermal cells are in contact with the direct environment. At the level of this orifice, a big mucous aggregate containing several bacteria was documented, surrounded by cytoplasmic protrusions of ectodermal support cells, as in the act of being engulfed into the planula inner cavity. In vivo experiments allowed to documenting the passage of labeled fluids and particles from the outer environment towards the inner planula cavity, through loose intercellular spaces in the anteriormost ectodermal layer, lacking cell-cell septate junctions. Taken together, these findings (neural anterior concentration, anterior orifice surrounded by sensory cells and circumferential plexus) corroborate the hypothesis that a certain degree of ancestral cephalization and a bilateral bauplan organization was already achieved at the dawn of metazoans...|$|E
40|$|Pulse Electrochemical Machining (PECM) is a {{potentially}} cost-effective technology meeting the increasing needs of precision manufacturing of superalloys, like titanium alloys, into complex shapes such as turbine airfoils. This dissertation reports (1) {{an assessment of}} the worldwide state-of-the-art PECM research and industrial practice, (2) PECM process model development, (3) PECM of a superalloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), and (4) key issues in future PECM research. The assessment focuses on identifying dimensional control problems with continuous ECM and how PECM can offer a solution. Previous research on PECM system design, process mechanisms, and dimensional control is analyzed, leading to a clearer understanding of key issues in PECM development such as process characterization and modeling. New interelectrode gap dynamic models describing the gap evolution with time are developed for different PECM processes with an emphasis on the <b>frontal</b> <b>gaps</b> and a typical two-dimensional case. A 2 ̆ 2 PECM cosineθ principle 2 ̆ 2 and several tool design formulae are also derived. PECM processes are characterized using concepts such as quasi-equilibrium gap and dissolution localization. Process simulation is performed to evaluate the effects of process inputs on dimensional accuracy control. Analysis is made on three types (single-phase, homogeneous, and inhomogeneous) of models concerning the physical processes (such as the electrolyte flow, Joule heating, and bubble generation) in the interelectrode gap. A physical model is introduced for the PECM with short pulses, which addresses the effect of electrolyte conductivity change on anodic dissolution. PECM of the titanium alloy is studied from a new perspective on the pulsating currents influence on surface quality and dimension control. An experimental methodology is developed to acquire instantaneous currents and to accurately measure the coefficient of machinability. The influence of pulse parameters on the surface passivation is explained based on the correlation among the instantaneous current, gap resistance, and surface microscopical features. A planned research is also introduced including a new concept of gap on-line recognition. In summary, this dissertation presents PECM problem identification, dynamic and physical modeling, and application to machining a titanium alloy. ...|$|R
