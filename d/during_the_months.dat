The Beta Taurid meteor shower occurs <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of June and July in the daytime, and is normally observed using radio techniques. Between 18 and 29 October, both the Northern Taurids and the Southern Taurids are active; though the latter stream is stronger. However, between November 1 and 10, the two streams equalize.|$|E

5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed {{his new album}} as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand.

To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the Oblique Strategies, and began coming up with new ideas {{as he did with}} his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of May and June, four named systems developed. In July, one {{tropical}} storm and two hurricanes formed. The following month, five tropical systems developed. Towards {{the end of}} the season, tropical cyclone activity declined somewhat. While five storms formed in September, only one formed in October and none during the month of November. A moderate El Nino was present throughout the season; water temperatures across the equatorial Central Pacific were 1.3°C (3°F) above normal. In addition, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was in a warm phase during this time period.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Albin was {{involved}} in a political controversy regarding succession to an earldom. An alleged papal bull, dated 13 December 1255, had named Bishop Albin as a papal mandatory, along with Robert de Stuteville, with instructions to investigate Alan Durward's claim to the earldom of Mar; however, the bull was denounced as a forgery on 28 March 1257, after Durward's rivals had seized power. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> preceding this denunciation, Albin was once again out of Scotland; on 4 March 1257 his presence was once again recorded at Durham.|$|E

Among the people present there were the anti-totalitarian socialist Victor Serge, anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, playwright Arthur Adamov, philosopher and poet René Daumal, and several prominent Surrealists: Breton, Char, and Benjamin Péret, as well as artists Max Ernst, André Masson, Wifredo Lam, Jacques Hérold, Victor Brauner and Óscar Domínguez. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> spent together, and before some of them received permission to leave for America, they invented a new card game, on which traditional card imagery was replaced with Surrealist symbols.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rains and}} {{flooding}} {{are the primary}} problem associated with tropical cyclones across the Pelican State. Recent examples of flooding across the state from tropical cyclones include Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, Tropical Storm Frances in 1998, Tropical Storm Allison in 1989, and Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979. Three of the four systems stalled across eastern Texas, prolonging the rainfall which occurred over Louisiana. If {{it were not for}} the intermittent invasions from tropical cyclones, rainfall <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of August, September, and October would average about 25% less than it currently does.|$|E

She {{was assigned to the}} I Squadron as the second command flagship for the annual autumn maneuvers. These exercises were interrupted by the visit from Nicholas II of Russia, who came aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. After the maneuvers, Fischel was replaced by Konteradmiral Curt von Prittwitz und Gaffron on 24 October. In late 1901, the fleet went on a cruise to Norway, during which Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm stopped in Oslo. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of December, January, and February, the ship was in drydock for major repair work.|$|E

The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as Voyager 2 approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.|$|E

5|$|The pygmy slow loris mates {{once every}} 12–18 months and has {{one or two}} {{offspring}} after an average gestation period of six months. For the first few days, the young loris clings to the belly of its mother. After six months the baby will be weaned, the females reach sexual maturity by 16 months, while the male reaches maturity by about 18 months. The pygmy slow loris is seasonally fertile <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of July and August. Chemical signals {{play a role in}} the reproductive behavior of female pygmy slow lorises.

5|$|There is {{very little}} {{geographic}} variation in size. The main differences are {{the presence or absence}} of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the mass}} protests that {{occurred}} {{at that time}} were the winter 1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała, the nationwide warning strike {{in the spring of}} that year and hunger demonstrations in summer. The warning strike took place {{in the aftermath of the}} Bydgoszcz events (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.|$|E
5|$|Construction on Intimidator began {{during the}} summer of 2009 with land {{clearing}} and footings being constructed. Track pieces first began to arrive at Carowinds on August 7, 2009. About 3 weeks later, Intimidator was officially announced on August 26, 2009 by Carowinds. Along with the announcement, Carowinds reached a licensing agreement with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to utilize the Dale Earnhardt brand as part of the ride. One of Earnhardt's sons, Kerry Earnhardt, was on-hand for the press conference announcing the attraction and endorsed the ride on behalf of the family. The first supports and track for Intimidator were installed on September 1, 2009. The lift hill was erected on October 1, 2009 and was completed on October 13, 2009. In order to install the last lift piece, 3 cranes were required. Construction on the roller coaster layout continued through November and December with the final track piece installed on December 21, 2009. Construction on the station, mechanics, and landscaping of Intimidator took place <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of January and February.
