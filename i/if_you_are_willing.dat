However, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> {{to assume that the}} normality assumption holds (that is, that [...] ), then additional properties of the OLS estimators can be stated.|$|E
2500|$|Caius in his Disputation Against Proclus (198 AD) {{mentions}} this of {{the places}} in which {{the remains of the}} apostles Peter and Paul were deposited: [...] "I can point out the trophies of the apostles. For <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to go to the Vatican or to the Ostian Way, you will find the trophies of those who founded this Church".|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} polarizing reviews. Rock Sound {{gave the}} album an 8/10 rating, remarking that [...] "It {{may not be}} perfect, but Korn have thrown caution to the wind and set out an impressive template for a future sound, for a band doing that nearly 20 years into their career, they deserve your respect". They do note however that the album sounds [...] "a little formulaic" [...] and [...] "monotonous" [...] at times. Spin gave the album a 7/10, saying [...] "Thing is, dubstep's slithering textures actually suit Davis' demented croon". Henry Northmore from The List gave the album a rating of 4/5 saying that [...] "the purists (both metal and dubstep) will probably hate it, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to have your brain assaulted from every direction by a new Frankensteinian metal/beats hybrid, you’ll find an album packed with pure adrenaline". Allmusic gave the album 4/5 saying that [...] "despite all the electronics, there’s no mistaking The Path of Totality as a Korn album...and one of their better ones to boot".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Lucy, [...] "I {{wanted to}} ask <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to let me stay here to-day and play with Rollo, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{do not go to}} the mountain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, it {{was about}} a little plan that I have formed -- namely, that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> we should pack up our traps and go off to Africa on another expedition.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{no trouble}} until your boys came," [...] {{retorted}} Esther, losing her temper a little, [...] "and I believe that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to co-operate with me that I could govern them." ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{the final}} mention of Elijah in the Hebrew Bible {{is in the}} Book of Chronicles, the Christian Bible's {{ordering}} of the books of the Septuagint places the Book of Malachi, which prophesies a messiah, before the Gospels [...] and means that Elijah's final Old Testament appearance is in the Book of Malachi, where it is written, [...] "Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes." [...] That day is described as the burning of a great furnace, [...] "... {{so that it will}} leave them neither root nor branch." [...] In Christianity it is traditionally believed that Elijah's appearance during the transfiguration of Jesus fulfilled this prophecy. Moreover, in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the spiritual successor to Elijah: [...] "and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come." [...] Finally, the verses in Malachi are believed to indicate that Elijah has a role in the end-times, immediately before the second coming of Jesus.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think you}} did. But {{that has nothing}} to do with the present situation. I want to know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to come to terms or not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is one of}} the conditions. They want to fix {{the thing}} before Kekewich, who hasn't been well lately, starts East on a trip to Montreal. I promised to wire <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to go down and see them to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no {{saying he}} won't, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to sell." [...] And having planted these wounds {{in the heart}} of his once {{imperious}} master Jopp went on his way; while Henchard stared and stared into the racing river till the bridge seemed moving backward with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I always believed," [...] {{said his}} uncle. [...] "The {{ceremony}} must be repeated {{when we find}} her: though even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing,</b> the other parties are very ill-advised to press for a marriage without judgment first being delivered, how far the present is binding. So she wants to send you off on your travels, does she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a risk. I {{think we}} shall both need courage, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> I need not hesitate. I {{will try to}} make a good farmer's wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about that. But I am willing to do this: <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to go ashore quietly and say nothing, I am willing that you shall do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall go in a canoe," [...] replied Harold; [...] "but my {{reason for}} {{broaching}} the subject just now is, that I may ask <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> {{to go with}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And to {{tell you}} the truth, Mr. Fenwick," [...] {{continued}} Lord St. George, [...] "you might be put, most unjustly, into a peck of troubles if we did not do this. You have no right to let the glebe on a building lease, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing,</b> and high ecclesiastical authority would call upon you at once to have the nuisance removed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Croup," [...] said he, [...] "I {{heard you}} swear once, and I never heard anybody swear better, {{and with more}} conscience. You did that {{swearing}} for me, and now I want to ask <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to swear for me again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] the station-master answered, [...] "a special train to London would {{cost you a}} hundred and eighty pounds, {{and in the second}} place, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to pay that sum, it would be at least two hours before I could start you off. We could not {{possibly}} disorganize the whole of our fast traffic. The ordinary mail train leaves here at midnight with sleeping-cars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{too far to}} walk," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "But I'll {{tell you}} what you might do, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to risk it. You might sail to town in the Dartaway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hum, yes. I {{was sure}} you would be. The other duties that were Felicien's you would soon learn. Well, well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing,</b> you may come along with us. You'd want some salary, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we'll {{get down}} to business. I'll tell you what I want done, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> you can do it; {{if you are not}} willing you can leave it--and go to the devil! Sit down." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{broke off}} for a moment, and held her silent by a gesture until he went on again. [...] "I have been swept away, and even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to make it, I would take no promise from you. Until I have {{won the right to}} come back <b>you</b> must <b>be</b> {{absolutely}} free. Now you know this, it would be very much wiser if I went away as soon as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's nothing much, but--well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going, <b>will</b> <b>you</b> tell him--" [...] {{he dropped}} his voice to a whisper--"I think I've found the extra coffee-cup!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{this time}} {{there would have been}} little left to excite curiosity <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> to leave those beasts to their work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly, my poor girl. He says `Come unto me,' and `Whosoever will,' let him come. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing,</b> {{there is}} no doubt about His willingness. The {{difficulty}} only lies with you, not with Him. Where do you live?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is where}} you make a mistake. The sailors are all rough fellows, some of them worse than Jack Lesher. Now, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to count me as a friend, I'll stand by you when the crowd comes over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a wise resolve," [...] {{declared}} the Yips, much relieved. [...] "It is your dishpan that is lost, not ours. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to risk {{your life and}} liberty to regain it, no one can deny you the privilege." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{we agreed}} that, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing,</b> I should go. I {{thought of the}} furniture; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do not come back here to live, {{it would be no}} use to keep the chairs, and tables, and beds, and things. We can put all Missy's things, and {{everything}} you like to keep, into a great box, and I could take them with me; or you could have them placed with some honest man, who would only charge very little, for storage." ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{interesting}} that Wainscott—such a small town—should present a different landscape than East Hampton or Amagansett. The town is flat: houses border on potato or corn fields that then border on the dune and the ocean. Main Street {{used to have a}} General Store and a Post Office; before 1935 it was lined with sycamores, but the hurricane took them all down. (The day after the hurricane it was posted that free firewood could be had on Main Street, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to chop it.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} no other motive," [...] she went on, {{deliberately}} taking off her slate-coloured mittens, and rolling them up, [...] "I have only {{to thank you for}} your visit, and to say that I will not detain you here any longer. Your information would <b>be</b> more satisfactory <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to explain how you became possessed of it. However, it justifies me, I suppose, in going into mourning. There is not much alteration necessary in my dress, as you see. When I have changed my mittens, I shall be all in black." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear sir," [...] he protested, [...] "your trans-Atlantic bluntness is {{somewhat}} disconcerting. However, you {{must admit that}} we have heard you patiently. Let us now, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing,</b> discuss {{for a minute or}} two the real object of your visit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the custom}} among men," [...] said he, [...] "to make out their report, {{in such a}} case, fully, {{so that it would}} explain itself; and I should like to have you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing,</b> to make out yours a little more distinctly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure I {{can take}} you {{anywhere}} along the river, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to pay for it," [...] said he, in {{answer to a question}} from the oldest Rover boy. [...] "Just give me time to get a mouthful and I will be with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} fear me," [...] he said. [...] "I shall not harm you. I only wish to {{discover}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have fever--if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> entirely well. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> we <b>will</b> {{set forth in}} search of Korak." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gerber’s {{early life}} and accomplishments in America were {{the subject of}} the 1950 Broadway play Young Man in a Hurry, written by Morton Wishengrad and {{starring}} Cornel Wilde. In 1953, J. Robert Oppenheimer and other judges selected Gerber as one of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s [...] "Ten Most Outstanding Young Men in America." [...] Reflecting on his immigrant experience, Gerber would observe that he"learned that in USA it <b>was</b> true <b>you</b> could accomplish things <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to work because then people, recognizing not only your abilities but your earnestness, will give you of themselves beyond belief to help you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Well, in the beginning, {{early in}} the {{development}} process, several people were pushing for a crossbar switch, {{and the way the}} bus <b>is</b> designed, <b>you</b> could actually pull out the EIB and put in a crossbar switch <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to devote more silicon space on the chip to wiring. We had to find a balance between connectivity and area, and there just was not enough room to put a full crossbar switch in. So we came up with this ring structure which we think is very interesting. It fits within the area constraints and still has very impressive bandwidth.|$|R
