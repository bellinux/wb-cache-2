50|$|Glass can be {{decorated}} by sandblasting {{the surface of}} a piece in order to remove a layer of glass, thereby making a design stand out. Items that are sandblasted are usually thick slabs of glass into which a design has been carved by means of high pressure sandblasting. This technique provides a three-dimensional effect but is not suitable <b>for</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> as the process could shatter it.|$|R
50|$|While {{uncontrolled}} {{residual stresses}} are undesirable, some designs rely on them. In particular, brittle materials can be toughened by including compressive residual stress, {{as in the}} case <b>for</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> and pre-stressed concrete. The predominant mechanism for failure in brittle materials is brittle fracture, which begins with initial crack formation. When an external tensile stress is applied to the material, the crack tips concentrate stress, increasing the local tensile stresses experienced at the crack tips {{to a greater extent than}} the average stress on the bulk material. This causes the initial crack to enlarge quickly (propagate) as the surrounding material is overwhelmed by the stress concentration, leading to fracture.|$|R
25|$|Wearers of {{polarized}} sunglasses will occasionally observe inadvertent polarization effects such as color-dependent birefringent effects, <b>for</b> {{example in}} <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> (e.g., car windows) or items made from transparent plastics, {{in conjunction with}} natural polarization by reflection or scattering. The polarized light from LCD monitors (see below) is very conspicuous when these are worn.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a harmonic component monitoring technique {{to study the}} aging of <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> insulators. Harmonic analysis theories and the principles of statistical analysis are applied in this finding. Both new and aged insulators are tested for harmonic components with a 240 Vrms AC voltage input. The power spectrum obtained from experiment is analyzed for the potential harmonic component {{as an indicator of}} aging in <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> insulators. The new and aged <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> insulators' power spectrums are compared to obtain the desired result. The level of confidence for the obtained result is determined by using statistical analysis. It is found that the fundamental, third, fifth and seventh harmonic components have positive results (i. e. the power consumed by these harmonic components increases with the age of the <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> insulator). The experimental results show that the third harmonic component is an indicator of the aging of <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> insulators...|$|R
50|$|Chemical {{strengthening}} {{results in}} a strengthening similar to <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b> However, the process does not use extreme variations of temperature and therefore chemically strengthened glass {{has little or no}} bow or warp, optical distortion or strain pattern. This differs from <b>toughened</b> <b>glass,</b> in which slender pieces can be significantly bowed.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Toughened</b> <b>glass</b> is {{used when}} strength, thermal resistance, and safety are {{important}} considerations. Passenger vehicles, for example, have all three requirements. Since they are stored outdoors, they {{are subject to}} constant heating and cooling as well as dramatic temperature changes throughout the year. Moreover, they must withstand small impacts such as from road debris such as stones as well as automobile accidents. Because large, sharp glass shards would present additional and unacceptable danger to passengers, <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> is used so that if broken, the pieces are blunt and mostly harmless. The windscreen or windshield is instead made of laminated glass, which will not shatter into pieces when broken while side windows and the rear windshield is typically <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R

50|$|Using <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> {{can pose}} a {{security}} risk {{in some situations}} because of the tendency of the glass to shatter completely upon hard impact rather than leaving shards in the window frame.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the desired}} form is obtained, glass is usually {{annealed}} {{for the removal}} of stresses and to increase the glass's hardness and durability.Surface treatments, coatings or lamination may follow to improve the chemical durability (glass container coatings, glass container internal treatment), strength (<b>toughened</b> <b>glass,</b> bulletproof glass, windshields), or optical properties (insulated glazing, anti-reflective coating).|$|R

50|$|Unlike <b>toughened</b> <b>glass,</b> {{chemically}} strengthened glass may be cut after strengthening, but {{loses its}} added strength {{within the region}} of approximately 20 mm of the cut.

40|$|Spontaneous {{failures}} in thermally <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> are frequently reported, although the actual percentage is quite small, suppliers in the Netherlands reporting {{one or two}} cases a year while thousands of tempered panels are supplied. These cases are rarely investigated in the Netherlands because the broken thermally <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> is usually not in one piece and can thus not be sent for analysis. In 2015 several sliding thermally <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> single curved vehicle roof windows failed within several months. A butterfly pattern was seen and NiS failure was suspected by the window manufacturer. As a coloured adhesive foil had been applied during manufacturing the glass shards were kept together. The broken glass was shipped back to the supplier and was together with several non-broken roof windows sent to Delft University of Technology for analysis. The compressive surface pre-stress in the intact roof panels was measured with a SCALP 5 device. It {{was found that the}} compressive surface pre-stress varied, as bands of low compressive surface pre-stress alternating with bands of high compressive surface pre-stress appeared in the specimens. Destructive testing of the intact windows showed that the windows failed in the bands of low compressive surface pre-stress. The actual bending strength was far below the strength thermally <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> should have. Microscopic analysis of the butterfly fragment of the “spontaneously” failed roof windows showed that the failure was not caused by any inclusion in the glass, but started at the surface of the glass and was probably due to overloading. It is concluded that the failures were not spontaneous but the result of overloading due to uneven tempering of the glass. Structural MechanicsStructural and Building Engineerin...|$|R
