5|$|Soon after {{fighting}} {{broke out}} between ZANLA and ZIPRA {{members of a}} recently integrated Zimbabwe National Army battalion at Ntabazinduna, just north-east of Bulawayo, the two guerrilla camps at Entumbane began exchanging rifle, machine gun and mortar fire at about 20:00 on 11 February. Dyck, at the Alamo, reported that both sides were also attacking his position. He radioed Brigade HQ for instructions and was told to pull out; he replied that this was impossible as he was surrounded. At Shute's orders, McKenna mobilised {{the rest of the}} battalion at an airfield near Brady Barracks within an hour. Meanwhile, a detachment of ZIPRA armoured vehicles left Essexvale for Bulawayo, and was spotted on the road by one of McKenna's observation posts. Devine was sent with his Elands to intercept them, supported by 12 1RAR men under Major Tony Husher. At an intersection {{on the outskirts of the}} city, Devine encountered a ZIPRA BTR-152 APC and impacted it with a single <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) round, killing all 20 combatants inside. McKenna then told Devine to advance to the city limits, where he and Husher set up an ambush on the road. Husher's men shot out all nearby overhead street lights, and some of them went to scout ahead; Devine positioned two of his Elands on each of the two lanes of the road under cover of darkness.|$|E
25|$|A bazooka is a shoulder-fired, man-portable {{recoilless}} rocket {{anti-tank weapon}} {{that features a}} solid rocket motor for propulsion, allowing for high explosive (HE) and <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The bazooka was co-invented in February 1942 by Edward Uhl, then a lieutenant in the United States Army, and Colonel Leslie Skinner.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, most armies were fielding light anti-tank guns firing 3.7cm (37mm) ammunition. The guns were usually mounted on two-wheeled carriages {{so they could be}} towed into position, then withdrawn and repositioned rapidly. Since they weighed only a few hundred pounds on average, they could also be manhandled into position. All fired high-explosive and solid armor-piercing shot effective at relatively medium range, and an increasing number were manufactured with protective gun shields in addition to a split rail mounting. They were able to destroy tanks fielded by both sides during {{the first two years of}} the war, but soon proved impotent against the heavier tank armor which debuted in 1940. Introducing improved ammunition and increasing muzzle velocity initially helped compensate for their mediocre performance, but it was clear that small caliber anti-tank guns would soon be overtaken by yet more heavily armored tanks. Medium caliber guns in the 40mm to 50mm range began to appear, some of which simply utilised rebored 37mm barrels. Although they too were soon approaching obsolescence, most remained in use with infantry units until the end of the war. Anti-tank guns remained ineffective against sloped armor, as demonstrated by an incident in 1941 when a single Soviet T-34 tank was impacted over thirty times by a battalion-sized contingent of German 37mm and 50mm anti-tank guns. The tank survived intact and was driven back to its own lines a few hours later. This helped earn the Pak 36 the moniker of Panzeranklopfgerät ("tank door knocker") because its crew simply revealed their presence and wasted their shells without damaging the T-34's armor. Anti-tank gunners began aiming at tank tracks, or vulnerable margins on the turret ring and gun mantlet, rather than testing their lighter cannon against bow and turret armor. These difficulties resulted in new types of ammunition being issued, namely <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) and armor-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) projectiles.|$|E
50|$|The Medium Mark I successor, the Vickers Medium Mk II {{combined}} some of {{the best}} traits of WWI tanks into a much faster tank. It was derived from the Vickers Medium Mark I, and was developed to replace the last of the Medium Mark Cs still in use. It had a fully rotating turret on top like the FT, but mounted a dual-use 3-pounder gun (that could fire both <b>high-explosive</b> and <b>anti-tank</b> shells) with a coaxial machine gun.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, UOF-412 round {{carried the}} 15.6 kg (34.39 lbs) F-412 <b>high-explosive</b> {{fragmentation}} shell. <b>Anti-tank</b> ammunition available from World War II {{until the late}} 1960s {{was based on the}} UBR-412 round, including the BR-412 armour-piercing high-explosive projectile, with the ballistic-capped BR-412B and BR-412D ammunition becoming available in the late 1940s. There was also a D-412 smoke shell.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{design was}} the Vickers Medium Mk II, a pivotal design which {{combined}} {{some of the}} best traits of World War I tanks into a much faster tank. It had a fully rotating turret on top like the FT, but mounted a dual-use 3-pounder gun (that could fire both <b>high-explosive</b> and <b>anti-tank</b> shells) with a coaxial machine gun. It also had a radio, a machine-gunner position {{in the front of the}} hull, and some limited use of sloped armour. Some of these tanks would go on to serve in World War II, though most of the significance of the design lies in the amount of features that were copied (or at least also used) in later tank designs.|$|R
500|$|The turrets were {{designed}} to mount the 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 gun. Combined with the Turmzielfernrohr 9d (German [...] "turret telescopic sight") monocular sight by Leitz, which {{all but a few}} early Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first round hit on a [...] high, [...] wide target only dropped below 100 percent at ranges beyond , to 95–97 percent at [...] and 85–87 percent at , depending on ammunition type. Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000m, in the 60s at 1,500m and the 40s at 2,000m. Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was [...] at [...] and [...] respectively for the Panzergranate 39/43 projectile (PzGr—armour-piercing shell), and [...] for the PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges. The Sprenggranate 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets, or the Hohlgranate or Hohlgeschoss 39 (HlGr—HEAT or <b>High-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warhead) round, which had [...] penetration at any range, {{could be used as a}} dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets.|$|E
500|$|The Leopard 1 and the AMX-30 {{originated}} from a joint tank development program {{known as the}} Europanzer. [...] For a tank, the AMX-30 had a low silhouette; {{the height of the}} tank was 2.28meters (7.48ft), compared to the Leopard's 2.6meters (8.53ft). [...] In terms of lethality, the AMX-30's Obus G <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) round {{was one of the most}} advanced projectiles at the time. [...] Because HEAT warheads become less efficient during spin stabilization induced by the rifling of a tank-gun barrel, the Obus G was designed so that the shaped charge warhead was mounted on ball bearings within an outer casing, allowing the round to be spin stabilized through the rifling of the gun without affecting the warhead inside. [...] The Obus G was designed to penetrate up to 400millimeters (15.75in) of steel armor. [...] On the other hand, the Leopard was armed with the L7A3 tank gun, capable of penetrating the frontal armor of most contemporary tanks. [...] Although the Leopard boasted greater armor than the AMX-30—partially accounting for the weight difference between the two tanks—the latter was sold at a cheaper price.|$|E
500|$|The new tank's {{firepower}} requirements {{were met}} by fitting a British [...] Royal Ordnance L7A1 [...] main gun. [...] This gun was later replaced by the modified L7A2 and finally by Rheinmetall's Rh-105-30 [...] gun. [...] This gun is manufactured in Argentina as the FM K.4 Modelo 1L. [...] The Rh-105-30's advantages include low weight, compact size and increased lethality. [...] Unlike the Rh-105-30, the FM K.4 {{does not have a}} muzzle brake. [...] The locally built cannon can be elevated to 18 degrees or depressed to -7 degrees on the TAM. [...] The gun's hydraulic recoil mechanism has an extended range of [...] to absorb the [...] recoil force. [...] It is designed to fire the M735A1 armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot, which can penetrate a maximum of [...] at [...] [...] It can also fire <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> rounds, high-explosive squash head and smoke rounds. [...] The tank's secondary armaments include a co-axial [...] FN MAG 60-40 general purpose machine gun and a second FN MAG 60-20 mounted on the TAM's turret roof as an anti-aircraft machine gun. [...] The fire control system includes a [...] with a range of [...] and a FLER-HG ballistic computer to compute the gun's fire solutions—helping the gunner aim and hit the target. [...] The tank commander uses a Zeiss PERI-R/TA panoramic periscope, with a 2x and 8x zoom.|$|E
5000|$|The final tank {{designs in}} World War I showed {{a number of}} trends {{such as in the}} US and British {{produced}} Mark VIII tank for heavy tanks. However, the French Renault FT set the pattern for almost all tanks that followed it; these tanks generally had lower track profiles and more compact hulls, and mounted their weapons in turrets. Following the Great War, Britain continued its technical dominance of tank design, and British designs, particularly those from Vickers-Armstrong, formed the basis for many Soviet tank designs of the 1930s, including the T-26 and BT series. Designs such as the Vickers Medium Mk II brought to the forefront the fully rotating turret on top and dual-use 3-pounder gun (that could fire both <b>high-explosive</b> and <b>anti-tank</b> shells), while the Vickers Carden-Lloyd machine gun carriers influenced the tankette concept such as the Soviet T-27.|$|R
2500|$|In 1964, the NII-24 {{research}} bureau started {{design work}} on an improved 3UBM6 anti-tank round. [...] In 1967 the 3BM6 hyper-velocity armour-piercing discarding-sabot round (HVAPDS) entered service: At a range of 2,000m, it could penetrate 290mm of flat armour, or 145mm of armour angled at 60 degrees from the vertical. [...] It was later replaced by the 3BM8 HVAPDS projectile, with a tungsten carbide penetrator. [...] <b>High-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) rounds, which penetrate armour with the focused explosion of a shaped charge, included the 3UBK4 with 3BK5M warhead, later replaced by the 3UBK9 with 3BK17M warhead.|$|E
2500|$|Bazooka is {{the common}} name for a man-portable, tube launched, {{recoilless}} rocket antitank weapon, widely fielded by the United States Army. [...] Also {{referred to as the}} [...] "Stovepipe", the innovative bazooka was amongst the first generation of rocket propelled anti-tank weapons used in infantry combat. Featuring a solid rocket motor for propulsion, it allowed for <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. [...] The Bazooka also fired a HESH, effective against buildings and tank armour. The universally-applied nickname arose from the M1 variant's vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a [...] "bazooka" [...] invented and popularized by 1930s U.S. comedian Bob Burns.|$|E

5000|$|Developed by Instalaza {{for use by}} the Spanish Army, the M65 was an {{improved}} version of the M20 [...] "Super Bazooka". It used {{an improved}} ignition method and new ammunition types. The available ammunition used were the CHM65 (<b>High-Explosive</b> <b>Anti-Tank),</b> MB66 (Dual-Purpose), and FIM66 (Smoke) shells.|$|E
50|$|<b>High-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warheads (HEAT for short) were {{developed}} during the Second World War as a munition made of an explosive shaped charge that uses the Munroe effect to create a very high-velocity partial stream of metal {{in a state of}} superplasticity, and used to penetrate solid vehicle armour.|$|E
50|$|During {{the initial}} hours of warfare, some under-equipped ROK Army border units used 105 mm howitzers as {{anti-tank}} guns {{to stop the}} tanks heading the KPA columns, firing <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> ammunition (HEAT) over open sights to good effect; at the war's start, the ROK Army had 91 such guns, but lost most to the invaders.|$|E
50|$|The {{launcher}} {{carries a}} tandem warhead. The precursor <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) warhead penetrates armour or other obstacles (reinforced concrete, masonry, etc.). The main warhead creates a fine explosive cloud and takes {{into the interior}} through the hole, pierced by the precursor charge. Detonation of the main warhead explosive boasts a multiple effects (high-explosive and incendiary).|$|E
50|$|<b>High-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> rounds {{caused a}} {{revolution}} in anti-tank warfare {{when they were first}} introduced in the later stages of World War II. One infantryman could effectively destroy any existing tank with a handheld weapon, thereby dramatically altering the nature of mobile operations. During World War II, weapons using HEAT warheads were termed hollow charge or shape charge warheads.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{construction}} {{details of the}} armour remain a secret, it {{has been described as}} being made by sandwiching composite panels between rolled homogeneous armour (RHA). The number of layers may vary based on the user requirements. This armour is able to defeat armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) and <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warhead (HEAT) rounds and is known to defeat armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS).|$|E
50|$|Tank {{ammunition}} {{was developed}} in WWI as tanks first appeared on the battlefield. However, as tank-on-tank warfare developed (including the development of anti-tank artillery), more specialized forms of ammunition were developed such as <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warheads and armor-piercing discarding sabot rounds. The development of shaped charges has {{had a significant impact}} on anti-tank ammunition design, now common on both tank-fire ammunition and in anti-tank missiles.|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the jet of a copper-lined shaped charge is not molten, {{although}} it is heated to about 500 °C. This misconception {{is due to the}} metal's fluid-like behaviour, which is caused by the massive pressures produced during the explosives detonation causing the metal to flow plastically. When used in the anti-tank role, a projectile that uses a shaped-charge warhead is known by the acronym HEAT (<b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank).</b>|$|E
50|$|The PLA {{began to}} search for a {{successor}} for the Type 78 in the 1990s. The older, 1950s-era equipment began to show its age. The Type 98 was revealed with a garrison unit in Macao in 1999, while some elite units began to receive the weapon after 2000. The design makes the accurate delivery of a 120 mm multi-purpose high-explosive or <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> projectile with negligible recoil possible. The weapon can be tripod- or shoulder-fired.|$|E
50|$|The light tank variant is {{armed with}} a fully stabilised 105mm rifled gun. The 105mm rounds carried consist of armour {{piercing}} fin stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS), high explosive (HE), and <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) rounds, and Chinese 105mm laser beam riding guidance anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM). The 105mm missile offers the capability to engage shore targets whilst still swimming at sea, where conventional ammunition would perform poorly due to the motion of sea waves.|$|E
50|$|After 1966, AMX-13s in French service were up-gunned with a 90mm F3 medium {{pressure}} gun firing more effective <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) munitions; this variant was designated AMX-13/90. The F3 {{was similar to}} the DEFA D921/F1 low pressure gun developed for the Panhard AML-90, and even utilized the same ammunition, though it possessed a significantly higher muzzle velocity. By the late 1960s, an export model of the AMX-13 was also available with an even larger 105mm gun.|$|E
50|$|The {{first of}} two types of rockets {{produced}} was a <b>High-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warhead (HEAT) round known as ’Buzogány’ (mace). With 4.2 kg of explosive, this shaped charge was capable of penetrating 300 mm of armour or concrete and destroy any type of heavy tank from a maximum distance of 1200 m. A high explosive (HE) projectile round was also available for use in an anti-personnel role referred to as ’Zápor’ (rainfall, shower). Both types were spin-stabilized.|$|E
50|$|Type 63A {{introduces}} {{an enlarged}} welded turret replacing the original Type 63 turret, the modernised Type 63A utilises the dual-way stabilised 105 mm rifled gun replacining the 85 mm gun. The 105 mm rifled gun, fires armour piercing fin stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS), high explosive (HE), and <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) ammunitions, with 45 rounds carried inside the vehicle. APFSDS round penetrates 400 mm steel armour or destroy a reinforced concrete bunker {{a distance of}} 2,000 m.|$|E
50|$|For {{the base}} model M1 Abrams, Steven J. Zaloga gives a frontal armor {{estimate}} of 350 mm vs armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot (APFSDS) and 700 mm vs <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warhead (HEAT) in M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank 1982-1992 (1993). In M1 Abrams vs T-72 Ural (2009), he uses Soviet estimates of 470 mm vs APFSDS and 650 mm vs HEAT for the base model Abrams. He also gives the Soviet {{estimates for the}} M1A1, 600 mm vs APFSDS, and 700 mm vs HEAT.|$|E
5000|$|Toophan (توفان, meaning [...] "Typhoon" [...] in Persian) is {{a series}} of Iranian {{anti-tank}} missiles. Toophan 1 is a reverse-engineered copy of the US military BGM-71 TOW missile. The Toophan-1's payload is a 3.6 kg <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> warhead that can penetrate up to 550mm of steel armor. The range is 3,850m, the top speed 310 m/s. The manufacturer is the Aerospace Industries Organization of Iran, which has produced the missile since 2000. Several other variants are also built with more penetration power.|$|E
50|$|During the {{development}} stage, engineers {{opted for a}} license on the NATO standard Royal Ordnance L7 105mm cannon. Japan only produced the barrel under licence, developing an indigenous mantlet, breech and recoil system. The full length of the cannon was 5,592 mm, for a total weight of 2,800 kg. Initially the main gun only used APDS (Armour-Piercing Discarding Sabot) and HEP (High Explosive Plastic) as its primary ammunition. Later it was modified to fire APFSDS (Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) and HEAT-MP (<b>High-Explosive</b> <b>Anti-Tank</b> Multi-Purpose) shells as well.|$|E
50|$|Originally, most MBTs {{relied on}} steel armour {{to defend against}} various threats. As newer threats emerged, however, the {{defensive}} systems used by MBTs had to evolve to counter them. One of the first new developments {{was the use of}} explosive reactive armour (ERA), developed by Israel in the early 1980s to defend against the shaped-charge warheads of modern anti-tank guided missiles and other such <b>high-explosive</b> <b>anti-tank</b> (HEAT) projectiles. This technology was subsequently adopted and expanded upon by the United States and the Soviet Union.|$|E
