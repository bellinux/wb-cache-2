25|$|The <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> {{provides}} a pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a fifth wheel configuration, requiring the coupling {{to be installed}} {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a coupling pin (or kingpin) {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the fifth wheel coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.|$|E

50|$|While some {{trackless}} {{trains are}} functional or modern in appearance, many are often constructed with false bodywork and are painted {{to look like}} nineteenth century steam trains. Others may feature decorative or fun paint schemes to appeal to children. Certain models of trackless train may look the same as narrow gauge rail guided amusement park trains, due to the common manufacture of both vehicles. Some <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupled</b> trailer buses may also be similarly decorated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{originally}} {{not a complete}} circle and were hand forged. When mass production of buggy parts {{began in the early}} 19th century, <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> were among the first products to be made. There were a number of patents awarded for fifth-wheel design. Edward and Charles Everett, Quincy, Illinois patented a type of <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1850, followed by Gutches' metallic head block and <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1870 and Wilcox <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1905.|$|R
5000|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> for motorized trucks is often credited to US inventor Charles H. Martin of the Martin Rocking <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> Co. who invented the device in 1915. [...] It was submitted for patent in 1915, and finalized in 1916. Herman Farr invented it, and Martin hooked up with him and became the assignee. When they formed the Martin <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> company Martin was president and Farr was named secretary. The 5th wheel was Farr's invention. Martin capitalized on it. [...] "It's a fair question whether you really can consider the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> as a milestone separate from the semi-trailer. After all, {{the purpose of the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> is to link the tractor and the trailer; indeed, trailers existed before Charles H. Martin introduced the Martin Rocking <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> in 1915. At the time, the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> literally was a wheel that moved with the trailer—unlike today’s technology that secures a kingpin. What makes the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> so important is the ability it gave fleet owners to attach large trailers to tractors easily and safely and the freedom it gave them to switch out trailers. Without a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the modern distribution system would look quite different as drop-and-hook would not be easy. The semi-trailer increased the capacity of trucks, but it was the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> that brought the flexibility for drivers to keep moving while receivers unloaded the loads they just delivered." ...|$|R

50|$|Today's <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> {{allow the}} {{trailers}} to {{slide into the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> and lock into it, and are a very reliable unit when maintained and serviced properly. The engagement of the king pin into the fifth-wheel locking mechanism is {{the only means of}} connection between tractor and trailer; no other device or safety mechanism is used. Couplers and pintle hooks use safety chains {{in the event of a}} trailer separation while going down the road. Trailer-to-trailer connection can also be made by using <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Semi-trailers {{with two}} trailer units are called B-doubles (Australian English) or tandem tractor trailers, tandem rigs, or doubles (American English). Other terms used are [...] "B-train" [...] or (when {{there are three}} or more trailers) [...] "road train". A B-double {{consists}} of a prime mover towing two semitrailers, where the first semitrailer {{is connected to the}} prime mover by a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> (a.k.a. 'converter dolly') and the second semitrailer is connected to the first semitrailer by a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling.</b> In Australian English, the tractor unit is usually referred to as a [...] "prime-mover", and the combination of a prime-mover and trailer is known as a [...] "semitrailer" [...] or [...] "semi".|$|E
50|$|The {{two types}} of {{couplings}} are <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> and automatic. In some applications, no separable coupling is fitted, and the trailer is bolted to the tractor unit, using a bearing, and rocker feet as are used under a fifth wheel skid plate.|$|E

50|$|The years beyond 1920 saw several advancements, such as {{improved}} rural roads, {{the introduction}} of the diesel engine (which are 25-40% more efficient than gasoline engines), the standardization of truck and trailer sizes along with <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> systems, as well as power assisted brakes and steering.

50|$|The {{tractor-trailer}} combination distributes a load {{across multiple}} axles while being more maneuverable than an equivalently sized rigid truck. The most common trailer attachment {{system is a}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling,</b> allowing rapid shift between trailers performing different functions, such as a bulk tipper and box trailer. Trailers containing differing cargos can be rapidly swapped between tractors, eliminating downtime while a trailer is unloaded or loaded.|$|E

50|$|The {{towing vehicle}} {{has a wide}} {{coupling}} plate known as a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> bolted onto its chassis on which the semi-trailer rests and pivots. As the tractor reverses under the trailer, a kingpin under {{the front of the}} trailer slides into a slot in the skidplate, and the jaws of the fifth wheel close onto it. The driver has to raise the trailer legs manually, and couple the airbrake lines and electrical cables.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 SAT {{started a}} {{development}} project jointly with consulting company Jaakko Pöyry for suitable vehicles for {{loading and unloading}} of ro-ro vessels. As a result, SAT launched a four-wheel-drive model TV-10 and its reversed steering version T-10 in 1971. 22 units were produced in the same year. A significant feature was its patented <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> system which enabled a quick a flexible engagement. The solution was developed by technician Nils Fagerstedt and it paved the success in export market.|$|E
50|$|The drawbar {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>coupling.</b> The drawbar requires a trailer which either loads the drawbar lightly (for example a small boat trailer, or caravan, where a load of up to ~50 kg is part of correct trailer loading practice), or the load is the weight of the coupling components only (larger trailers, usually but not always with a steerable hauled axle, front or rear). By contrast, the fifth wheel is designed to transmit a major proportion of the load's weight to the hauling vehicle.|$|E
50|$|A {{horizontal}} wheel or segment of a <b>wheel</b> called a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> sometimes forms an extended support {{to prevent the}} carriage from tipping; it consists of two parts rotating on each other about the kingbolt above the fore axle and beneath the body.
