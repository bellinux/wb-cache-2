5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} can cause seizures, brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and unconsciousness, and <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in {{damage to the}} lungs, causing pain and difficulty in breathing. Oxidative damage to the eye may lead to myopia or partial detachment of the retina. Pulmonary and ocular damage {{are most likely to}} occur when supplemental oxygen is administered as part of a treatment, particularly to newborn infants, but are also a concern during hyperbaric oxygen therapy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mollusk shells, various other natural history specimens {{are susceptible to}} this form of decay, including eggshells and some fossils and mineral samples that are composed of calcium carbonate. This condition <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> for museum scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent realocation to an archival setting.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. Species richness peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size {{is a result of the}} different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between marine mammal species richness and areas of human impact on the environment <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E

Late CNS risks are possible neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or premature aging. The effect of the protracted exposure of the CNS to the low dose-rate (< 50 mGy h–1) of proton, HZE particles, and neutrons of the relevant energies for doses up to 2 Gy <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{vulnerability}} of nuclear plants to deliberate attack <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> {{in the area}} of nuclear safety and security. Nuclear power plants, civilian research reactors, certain naval fuel facilities, uranium enrichment plants, fuel fabrication plants, and even potentially uranium mines are vulnerable to attacks which could lead to widespread radioactive contamination. The attack threat is of several general types: commando-like ground-based attacks on equipment which if disabled could lead to a reactor core meltdown or widespread dispersal of radioactivity; and external attacks such as an aircraft crash into a reactor complex, or cyber attacks.|$|E
25|$|Other people {{raise the}} issue of hazards to the animals in their working environments. The risk of {{accidental}} detonation of a mine by an animal <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> to some; the Navy maintains that the chances of this are minimal, because the animals are trained not to touch the mines, which in any case are specifically designed not to be detonated by marine animals. Another fear is that opposing forces, aware of mine-hunting dolphins in a given area, may shoot dolphins in the water, leading to deaths of both NMMP and native animals.|$|E

25|$|Ragwort <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> {{to people}} who keep horses and cattle. In {{areas of the world}} where ragwort is a native plant, such as Britain and {{continental}} Europe, documented cases of proven poisoning are rare. Horses do not normally eat fresh ragwort due to its bitter taste. The result, if sufficient quantity is consumed, can be irreversible cirrhosis of the liver of a form identified as megalocytosis where cells are abnormally enlarged. Signs that a horse has been poisoned include yellow mucous membranes, depression, and lack of coordination.|$|E
25|$|A {{prolific}} and adaptable species, {{the eastern}} gray squirrel {{has been introduced}} to, and thrives in, several regions of the western United States. The gray squirrel is an invasive species in Britain; it has spread {{across the country and}} has largely displaced the native red squirrel, S. vulgaris. In Ireland, the red squirrel has been displaced in several eastern counties, though it still remains common in the south and west of the country. That such displacement might happen in Italy <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern,</b> and gray squirrels might spread from Italy to other parts of mainland Europe.|$|E
25|$|In some Islamic populations, sex-selective female {{infanticide}} <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> because of abnormally high boy to girl ratios at birth. In Islamic Azerbaijan, for example, the birth sex ratio {{was in the}} 105 to 108 range, before {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in the early 1990s. After the collapse, the birth sex ratios in Azerbaijan has sharply climbed to over 115 and remained high for the last 20 years. The persistently observed 115 boys for every 100 girls born suggests sex-selective abortion of females in Azerbaijan in the last 20 years. Other Muslim-majority countries with high birth sex ratio, implying female sex-selective abortion, include Albania (112) and Pakistan (111).|$|E

25|$|The {{garden tiger}} moth {{population}} decline <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> for both laboratory research and in nature. A possible way to combat this in a laboratory setting is to use synthetic food. While not ideal, it resolves many issues that arise when trying to raise captive Lepidoptera. Concerns such as food sterility are quickly resolved, along with issues of gathering hard to find or cultivate host plant material. Many larvae, including those of A. caja, can consume synthetic food, which is based primarily on agar, powdered cellulose, cabbage, sucrose, salts, and wheat germ. Synthetic options {{appear to be a}} promising way to raise lab populations of this species, for conservation or for study.|$|E
25|$|One sample {{preparation}} issue with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is possible matrix effects {{due to the}} presence of background molecules. These matrix effects have been shown to decrease the signal in methods such as PI and ESI by amounts as much as 60% depending on the sample being analyzed. The matrix effect can also cause an increase in signal, producing false positive results. This can be corrected by purifying the sample as much as possible before LC is performed, {{but in the case of}} analyzing environmental samples where everything in the sample <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern,</b> {{sample preparation}} may not be the ideal solution to fix the problem. Another method that can be applied to correct the issue is by using the standard addition method.|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} of headphones <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> {{because of}} the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be louder and more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level.|$|E
