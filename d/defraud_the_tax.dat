50|$|The {{end result}} was that the {{government}} must prove an intent to <b>defraud</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> system, not merely that Snider made an untrue statement. The majority then concluded that Snider's claiming three billion adjustments was so clearly {{outside the realm of}} possibility {{that there was no way}} a jury could conclude that he intended to deceive his employer or the IRS into giving him credit for three billion adjustments.|$|E
50|$|He was prosecuted at the Old Bailey for {{submitting}} false {{income tax}} returns in 1954. The prosecuting counsel was Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, the Solicitor General and later Speaker of the House of Commons; {{counsel for the}} defence was Frederick Lawton, later a senior judge. Megarry's tax affairs were complex, with his earnings as a lecturer dealt with by {{his wife and his}} self-employed income from his legal practice dealt with by his clerk. Each assumed that the other was dealing with certain items of income, but in fact neither did, so it was omitted from Megarry's tax returns. The judge directed the jury to acquit Megarry, {{on the grounds that the}} error was a genuine mistake with no intention to <b>defraud</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> authorities.|$|E
40|$|Tax {{agents are}} {{responsible}} for assisting taxpayers to submit tax returns for individual, company, {{and other types of}} tax returns and to prepare business activity statements for business taxes, including goods and services taxes or GST. Unfortunately, some agents abuse their positions of trust to <b>defraud</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> system. One way they do this is by inflating the busi-ness deductions of their clients. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is responsible for identifying high-risk tax agents who are engaging in unaccept-able practice. The methods described in this paper were aimed at identifying high-risk agents. In this paper, we report some results from modelling tax agent behavior using a distance-from-the-centroid (DFC) method with assistance from a ge-netic algorithm (GA). DFC is an example of what are called “instance-based learning methods. ” These use known high-risk cases, or instances, to see if other cases have practice profiles that are similar to them. DFC works simply by identifying the center of gravity or centroid of a collection of known high-risk cases and then finds other cases not previously classified that are close in distance to the centroid. GAs are ideal for problem...|$|E

5000|$|On 19 February 2009, the US {{government}} {{filed suit}} against UBS to reveal {{the names of all}} 52,000 American customers, alleging that the bank and these customers conspired to <b>defraud</b> <b>the</b> US <b>tax</b> authority IRS of legitimately owed tax revenue. [...] However revealing of customer names was contrary to Swiss law and put UBS in a difficult position. Eventually UBS with the support of FINMA agree to provide the names of 250 to 300 clients through FINMA and pay a U.S. $780 million of fine as settlement. FINMA used a section of the Act provided for situations where a bank is threatened with bankruptcy to allow this to happen. Subsequently, in February 2009 the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland ordered FINMA to stop the transmission to <b>the</b> U.S. <b>tax</b> authorities. However it is believed that data from 250 UBS clients had already been transmitted.|$|R
40|$|The Commonwealth has had {{a recent}} string of cases where a person has been {{successfully}} prosecuted for fraud, or conspiracy to <b>defraud</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth. R v Pearce resulted in five people being imprisoned following {{the collapse of a}} mass marketed scheme, known as "Servcom". Of the five convicted of conspiracy, three were accountants that had been involved in arranging <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> effective financing that was the basis of the scheme. A charge of conspiracy to <b>defraud</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth requires that the parties have acted dishonestly, and in a way that puts the revenue at risk. In <b>the</b> context of <b>tax</b> planning, tax advisers regularly give advice that is intended to reduce <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> liability of their client. This article examines the Pearce case to identify why the actions of <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> advisers were seen as dishonest, thereby crossing the line that separates tax advice from a conspiracy to <b>defraud</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth. It also examines the relationship between a tax scheme that may be invalidated under income tax law and fraud, as understood in the criminal law...|$|R
50|$|On appeal, the Fourth Circuit {{held that}} <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> form was so clearly {{incorrect}} {{that it could}} not be considered an actual attempt to <b>defraud</b> <b>the</b> federal government. Thus the specific intent to violate this law was absent, and so no conviction would stand. As to the contempt charges, the court found that the appellants actions did not obstruct the administration of justice, and so they had not violated that statue either. The court specifically declined to address the appellants First Amendment arguments.|$|R

5000|$|On March 11, 458, Majorian {{issued a}} law {{entitled}} De indulgentiis reliquorum, [...] "On the Remission of Past-Due Accounts" [...] (Novella Maioriani 2).
