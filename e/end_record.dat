5000|$|Ripp quickly rose in {{the music}} publishing, recording, and {{distribution}} business. In 1961, after Goldner transferred his Gone and <b>End</b> <b>record</b> labels to music industry executive Morris Levy, Ripp became national promotion director at Nevins/Kirshner Associates, Inc., founded by Al Nevins and Don Kirshner. (Nevins/Kirshner was {{the parent company of}} Dimension Records and its music publishing division Aldon Music (BMI). Aldon, located at 1650 Broadway in Manhattan, {{played a significant role in}} shaping the so-called [...] "Brill Building Pop" [...] sound of the late 1950s and early 1960s.) In 1962b Ripp partnered with music publisher Aaron [...] "Goldie" [...] Goldmark and was named vice president of three of Goldmark's newly established businesses: Goldie Records, Inc., Armada Music, Inc. (ASCAP), and Fredella Music, Inc. (BMI) (which were together known as Goldmark Music, Ltd. in association with Chappell, Ltd.). During the summer of 1962, Goldmark and Ripp collaborated to generate worldwide distribution arrangements that were described by Billboard as having [...] "angles never before achieved in the business." [...] In 1963, when Goldmark was selected to head Premier Albums' newly established publishing and master-production operations, Ripp followed and was named chief of [...] "A&R" [...] (Artists and Repertoire) for Premier's subsidiary, Award Music, which was the master-production business. As A&R Chief, Ripp signed singer Carl Dobkins, Jr. Also under contract with Award during Ripp's tenure were Jimmy Jones and The Hollywood Flames, both of whom were on the Vee-Jay record label.|$|E
40|$|MM - P&DMRecords {{management}} {{is an important}} component of information management. Records represent a major source of information that provides evidence of decisions, actions, and interactions between government and citizens. Records management practices underpin all aspects of public service administration, and are a critical activity for effective service delivery. Records are regarded as the “lifeblood of public administration” (Fletcher, 1990). To this <b>end,</b> <b>record</b> keeping is a fundamental and core activity of public sector management. Without reliable records, there can be no accountability and no rule of law. The failure to manage records leads to poor decisions and an inability to measure programmes and service effectiveness. The Directorate of Social Security within the Eastern Cape Department of Social Development is used as a case study to investigate records management practices and effects on service delivery. The key issues raised in the study were: records management processes and procedures, records management policy and the regulatory environment, influence of Information Technology on records management practices. The research findings were assessed against the International Standard for Records Management (ISO 15489) to identify gaps between best practices captured in the standard, and what is happening in reality in relation to records management policies, procedures and processes. The standard (ISO 15489) is endorsed by the National Archives and Records Service of South Africa. It provides guidelines on records management practices and a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of records management programmes and systems in organizations. The key findings include: · There is no records management policy statement, the social grant records are managed without recourse to legislative requirements · Training is not focused on records management principles. iii · The implementation of the Social Development Information Management System has brought improvements to service delivery, though there are still infrastructural and communication problems between social grant offices at local, district levels. · Respondents cited lack of human resources and functional capacity in some areas of social grant processing as an obstacle to service delivery...|$|E
