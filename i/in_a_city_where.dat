5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division but lately, have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>where</b> the manufacturing sector is declining. Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E

500|$|Berkman {{continued}} {{to suffer from}} depression and increasingly spoke about committing suicide. He began a new lecture tour, but when he failed to appear in Cleveland, concerned friends sent a telegram to Goldman in New York. She worried that he had killed himself. Anarchists across the country searched for Berkman in police stations, hospitals, and morgues. Even newspapers wondered where he was, speculating {{that he might have}} been kidnapped by Pittsburgh detectives, by Secret Service agents, or by [...] "agents of millionaires" [...] who opposed his message. Three days later, Berkman appeared in New York and contacted Goldman. He said the lecture tour had made him feel miserable. He had purchased a handgun in Cleveland with the intention of killing himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>where</b> nobody knew him, but he was unable to complete the act.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1918, as World War I drew to a close, Cluj became a centre of revolutionary activity, headed by Amos Frâncu. [...] On 28 October 1918, Frâncu made an appeal for the {{organisation}} of the [...] "union of all Romanians". Thirty-nine delegates were elected from Cluj to attend the proclamation of the union of Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania in Alba-Iulia on 1 December 1918, later acknowledged internationally by the Treaty of Trianon. The interwar years saw the new authorities embark on a [...] "Romanianisation" [...] campaign: a Capitoline Wolf statue donated by Rome {{was set up in}} 1921; in 1932 a plaque written by historian Nicolae Iorga was placed on Matthias Corvinus's statue, emphasising his Romanian paternal ancestry; and construction of an imposing Orthodox cathedral began, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>where</b> only about a tenth of the inhabitants belonged to the Orthodox state church. This endeavour had only mixed results: by 1939, Hungarians still dominated local economic (and to a certain extent) cultural life: for instance, Cluj had five Hungarian daily newspapers and just one in Romanian.|$|E

2500|$|Gaskell uses a {{cause of}} {{conflict}} between masters and workers (the installation of ventilators in the carding rooms) to illustrate the greed of one and the ignorance of the other, making social progress difficult (Navailles, 1983), and calls attention to anti-Irish prejudice <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>where</b> the Irish are a small minority. She exposes the beliefs and reasoning of manufacturers in Thornton's defence of a theory approaching social Darwinism: capitalism as naturally (almost physically) obeying immutable laws, a relentless race to progress in which humanity is sacrificed; the weak die, whether they are masters or workers (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 15). Mrs. Thornton expresses the middle-class view {{of the working class}} as [...] "a pack of ungrateful hounds" [...] (chapter 15).|$|E

Likewise, the newspaper complained that the National Assembly was issuing [...] "excellent" [...] laws, but nobody was [...] "going by the law". [...] Finally, on its front page of May 1918, it complained that there was [...] "still debris all over the city". The Diario de Centro América itself was print in the rubble, in spite of which it was able to issue its two daily numbers.|$|E

2500|$|In San Francisco, California protests {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} day and {{in different parts of}} the city with up to 150 people arrested for misdemeanors such as trespassing, resisting arrest and blocking an intersection. Part of the success of the group coordinating named Direct Action was due to utilizing smart mob technologies including text messaging, Google Maps, live video-feeds and internet radio updates. In contrast to the first-day protests in 2003 when the city was effectively shut down in many ways, the protests were focussed on specific targets and conveying messages – [...] "there's little point in barricading the Bay Bridge <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> <b>where</b> most people are against the war anyway." [...] In the morning, a group of 500 worked their way through the morning commute effectively tying-up traffic for hours as the police had to block, move and re-block streets and busses for the procession. The Federal Reserve Bank and Chevron Corporation were also targeted with actions and saw arrests. Starting around noon and lasting for several hours the most [...] "dramatic" [...] protests were a die-in – again blocking the main traffic artery, Market Street – directly in front of California Senator Dianne Feinstein's office. Feinstein supported the Iraq war resolution and subsequent supplemental appropriations bills although she has stated she was deceived by the Bush administration about the weapons of mass destruction. As police arrested dozens of protesters more would take their place. In the evening 7000 marched and rallied in front of San Francisco City Hall hearing speeches including Assemblywoman Carole Migden. Although mostly peaceful some police were pelted with glass Christmas ornaments filled with paint.|$|E
