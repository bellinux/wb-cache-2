5000|$|CEESI {{created the}} [...] "CEESI Technical Library" [...] in October 2007 {{which is a}} web-based {{collection}} of documents and references to papers related to fluid <b>flow</b> <b>measurement.</b> Bibliographic references and thousands of papers, available for free in PDF format, were collected and indexed by CEESI. CEESI made agreements with the American School of Gas Measurement Training, American Gas Association, and the Natural Gas Sampling Technology Conference {{to allow for the}} downloading of papers on <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> topics. CEESI also reached agreements with the International School of Hydrocarbon Measurement (ISHM) to which resulted in ISHM allowing their publications be made available via download through the library. Similarly, the organizers of the International Symposium on Fluid <b>Flow</b> <b>Measurement</b> (the North American Fluid <b>Flow</b> <b>Measurement</b> Council) also granted CEESI permission to allow users of the <b>Flow</b> <b>Measurement</b> Technical Library to download symposium proceedings. CEESI entered into a partnership with the Pipeline Research Council International (also known as [...] "PRCI") in 2008 which allowed the expansion and further development of the library; the library’s name was changed to the “Flow Measurement Technical Library” after this partnership began. By 2012, the following organizations/conferences that have allowed some portion of their papers to be downloadable by the public through the <b>Flow</b> <b>Measurement</b> Technical Library: International School of Hydrocarbon Measurement, International Symposium on Fluid <b>Flow</b> <b>Measurement,</b> Acadiana <b>Flow</b> <b>Measurement</b> Society, American School of Gas Measurement Technologies, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Western Gas Measurement Short Course, Canadian School of Hydrocarbon <b>Measurement,</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Measurement</b> Institute, South East Asia Hydrocarbon <b>Flow</b> <b>Measurement</b> Workshop, North Sea <b>Flow</b> <b>Measurement</b> Workshop, and the Appalachian Gas Measurement Short Course. In 2017, the name was shortened to [...] "Measurement Library".|$|R

40|$|The Utah Water Research Laboratory, in {{conjunction}} with the State of Utah, initiated a study to determine the accuracy {{of a wide variety of}} <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> devices in Utah. The project selected 70 sites with <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> devices throughout the state. During the assessment each device had its physical condition and <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> accuracy documented. Although a wide variety of <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> devices were tested, the majority were Parshall flumes. Many of the assessed Parshall flumes were not measuring flow to the specified ± 5 percent design accuracy. Problems in <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> were due to issues with the staff gauge location and incorrect entrance geometry. Laboratory tests were conducted at the Utah Water Research Laboratory in an attempt to provide accurate <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> from flumes with these issues. The tests simulated incorrect locations for measuring upstream head with different entrance geometries on a 2 -ft-wide Parshall flume. The flume was tested with three different entrance wingwall configurations, eighteen stilling wells, and two point gauges, allowing water surface profiles to be collected throughout the flume. Corrections for incorrect head measurement locations and entrance geometries were created. The objective of this thesis is to provide water users and regulators with the information necessary to help improve open-channel <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> accuracies. An overview of design accuracies and <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> devices is given. In addition, a method to correct for incorrect head readings in Parshall flumes, a widely used <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> device in Utah, is presented. It is expected that this information will help water users and regulators monitor their water with the understanding necessary to ensure that water is more accurately measured...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identity and recommend a type of <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> technique suitable for <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> in the CW ducts. After conducting a literature survey, the author restricted research to a local flow measuring technique as a result of physical constraints on site. In addition, the flow profile in the CW ducts was unknown so that existing <b>flow</b> rate <b>measurement</b> standards could not be applied.

Using a downhole annular <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> system to obtain real-time information of downhole annular flow {{is the core}} and foundation of downhole micro-flux control drilling technology. The research work of electromagnetic flowmeters in recent years creates a challenge for downhole annular <b>flow</b> <b>measurement.</b> This paper proposes a new method for an annular <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> system based on the electromagnetic induction principle. First, the annular flow measuring principle, the weight function, the density of virtual current, and the magnetic field of the annular <b>flow</b> electromagnetic <b>measurement</b> system are described. Second, the basic design of the annular <b>flow</b> electromagnetic <b>measurement</b> system is described. Third, model simulation and dynamic experiments on an annular <b>flow</b> electromagnetic <b>measurement</b> system are carried out. The simulation and experimental results show a linear relationship between the system output and the annular flow rate, and also verify the correctness of annular <b>flow</b> electromagnetic <b>measurement</b> theory...|$|R

40|$|A sonar-based <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> technology, {{capable of}} clamp-on <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> of single and {{multiphase}} flow applications within {{the chemical and}} petrochemical industries, is described. Developed and field proven in {{oil and gas production}} industry over the last five years, sonar-based <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> technology provides robust accurate volumetric <b>flow</b> rate <b>measurement</b> for a broad range of process fluids, slurries, pipes sizes and flow conditions. The sonar-based flow metering technology utilizes an array of sensors to listen to, and interpret, unsteady pressure fields within standard process flow lines. The methodology can be implemented using pressure transducers, directly ported in to the process fluid, or using strain-based sensors clamped-on to existing process piping. Flow rate is determined using sonar array processing techniques which track the speed at which turbulent eddies, inherent to turbulent pipe flow, convect past the sensor array. This convection speed is directly related to volumetric flow rate through a Reynolds number calibration. Results from a calibration facility for both ported-pressure and strain-based, clamp-on configurations of the sonar flow meters are presented. Calibration testing of the sonar-based flow metering technology demonstrated 0. 5 % accuracy in volumetric flow using a single Reynolds number based calibrations applicable to a family of geometrically similar sonar meters ranging in diameters from 3 to 16 inches. Data is also presented from a field trial in which the sonar-based <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> is demonstrated on water-conveyed, solid polymer slurry. This data demonstrates the applicability of sonar-based <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> to multiphase slurries, a class of flows that represent a long-standing <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> challenge within the chemical and petrochemical processing industries...|$|R
40|$|During {{fatigue crack}} {{propagation}} experiments with constant force {{as well as}} constant stress intensity lock in thermography and heat <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> with a new developed peltier sensor have been performed. With lock in thermography space resolved measurements are possible and the evaluation allows to distinguish between elastic and dissipated energies. The specimens have to be coated with black paint to enhance the emissivity. The thickness of the coating influences the results and therefore quantitative measurements are problematic. The heat <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> are easy to perform and provide quantitative results but only integral in an area given by the used peltier element. To get comparable results the values measured with thermography were summarized in an area equivalent {{to that of the}} peltier element. The experiments with constant force show a good agreement between the thermography and the heat <b>flow</b> <b>measurements.</b> In case of the experiments with a constant stress intensity some differences become visible. Whereas the thermography measurements show a linear decrease of the signal with rising crack length, the heat <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> show a clearly nonlinear dependency. Obviously the measured energies in thermography and peltier based heat <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> are not comparabl...|$|R

40|$|Traffic <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> are {{required}} by several applications in network and service management. For Internet measurements, the IETF has defined a Realtime Traffic <b>Flow</b> <b>Measurement</b> (RTFM) architecture providing high functionality, but requiring rather complex configuration. This contribution suggests an application-oriented highlevel interface to the RTFM architecture that simplifies configuration by hiding several details and that thereby facilitates the integration of standardized traffic <b>flow</b> <b>measurements</b> into management applications. The simplification leads to a restriction of the available functionality. However, the remaining functionality still matches the requirements of a large range of management applications. Besides several simplifications, also one extension is contained in the suggested interface. The RTFM architecture requires a reader of <b>flow</b> <b>measurement</b> data to poll for new information. This pull mode is extended by a push mode creating notifications if new traffic data is available.
