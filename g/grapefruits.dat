25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} compounds {{may also}} induce or inhibit CYP activity. For example, bioactive compounds found in grapefruit juice {{and some other}} fruit juices, including bergamottin, dihydroxybergamottin, and paradicin-A, {{have been found to}} inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of certain medications, leading to increased bioavailability and, thus, the strong possibility of overdosing. Because of this risk, avoiding grapefruit juice and fresh <b>grapefruits</b> entirely while on drugs is usually advised.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no known}} cure, but an {{appropriate}} diet and the enzyme xylose isomerase can help. The ingestion of glucose simultaneously with fructose improves fructose absorption and may prevent {{the development of}} symptoms. For example, people may tolerate fruits such as <b>grapefruits</b> or bananas, which contain similar amounts of fructose and glucose, but apples are not tolerated because they contain high levels of fructose {{and lower levels of}} glucose.|$|E
25|$|Caution {{should be}} {{exercised}} when taking dextromethorphan when drinking grapefruit juice or eating <b>grapefruits,</b> as compounds in grapefruit affect {{a number of}} drugs, including dextromethorphan, through the inhibition of the cytochrome p450 system in the liver, {{and can lead to}} excessive accumulation and prolonged effects. Grapefruit and grapefruit juices (especially white grapefruit juice, but also including other citrus fruits such as bergamot and lime, {{as well as a number}} of noncitrus fruits) generally are recommended to be avoided while using dextromethorphan and numerous other medications.|$|E
25|$|All {{citrus trees}} {{belong to the}} single genus Citrus and remain almost entirely interfertile.

As the interfertility of oranges and other citrus has produced numerous hybrids and cultivars, and bud mutations have also been selected, their taxonomy is fairly controversial, confusing or inconsistent. The fruit of any citrus tree is considered a hesperidium, a kind of modified berry; it is covered by a rind originated by a rugged thickening of the ovary wall.|$|E

Initially, the Osem plant produced mainly pasta products, but the scope of activities broadened over the years. In 1997, the facility doubled in size and three production lines were installed for baked goods such as crackers, biscuits, cookies and pretzels. Bamba, a popular Israeli snack food, is also produced in Yokneam. Many Yokneam residents are employed at the plant, which won awards from the Council for a Beautiful Israel for its attractive premises.|$|E
500|$|The cabinet for {{the game}} was {{designed}} by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. His designed featured a joystick for each player, which was encased in a pink dome that the player would rest their hands on to control the joysticks, meant to resemble breasts. Faraco later acknowledged that [...] "they didn't have bumps on them or anything, but {{the way they were}} the size of <b>grapefruits</b> next to each other, you got the impression of what they were supposed to be." [...] Atari's second engineer, Don Lange, who assisted with the game, has also stated that the design was intentional on the part of Faraco, who fellow Atari designer Regan Chang has claimed [...] "had some really far out ideas". According to rumor, Faraco got the idea from a joke that joysticks resembled phalluses, and that Atari should make a game with female controls. Like Faraco's initial design for Space Race, which was changed due to its expense after a few dozen units, the joysticks for Gotcha were changed to standard ones shortly into the production run prior to the October 1973 release. The design did inspire the advertising flyer {{for the game}}, however, which features a man chasing a woman in a nightdress with the initial design of the cabinet behind them. The final cabinet stands over 5 feet tall and weighs nearly 200 pounds. The breast-like controllers reappeared in yellow in prototype versions of the 1974 Touch Me arcade game, but were not used in production.|$|E

50|$|The <b>grapefruit</b> diet, {{also known}} as the Hollywood Diet is a {{short-term}} fad diet that has existed in the United States since at least the 1930s. The diet is based on the claim that <b>grapefruit</b> has a fat-burning enzyme or similar property. The variations of the <b>grapefruit</b> diet that are too low in calories (below 800-1000 calories a day), too low in carbohydrates, or too low in essential micronutrients are considered unhealthy and potentially dangerous. While eating half a <b>grapefruit</b> with every meal may {{be a good way to}} incorporate more fruit in the diet of a healthy person, <b>grapefruit</b> and <b>grapefruit</b> juice is harmful if the dieter is taking medicines that can interact with <b>grapefruit</b> juice or is allergic to citruses. This diet will not be beneficial to anyone over a long time as the extremely low calorie intake could lead to malnutrition and many health problems.

It {{suggests}} that <b>grapefruit</b> helps burn body fat when eaten with foods high in dietary fat, {{which is why}} the <b>grapefruit</b> diet encourages consumption of meat, eggs, and other foods that are rich in fat and protein. A typical breakfast menu usually includes bacon and eggs. The <b>grapefruit</b> diet restricts consumption of carbohydrates by eliminating sugar, sweet fruits and vegetables, grains, and cereals.

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{interaction}} between calcium channel antagonists and <b>grapefruit</b> juice varies widely among drugs. Coadministration of calcium channel antagonists with <b>grapefruit</b> juice can elevate the bioavailability of drugs and alter pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug.

The area under the concentration-time curve and peak serum con-centrations of azelnidipine, efonidipine, felodipine, manidipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nisoldipine, nitrendipine and verapamil are influenced by <b>grapefruit</b> juice. Conversely, pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine and diltiazem are not affected by <b>grapefruit</b> juice. The action of <b>grapefruit</b> juice is rapid, and a single exposure to one glass of juice can usually produce a significant interaction.

40|$|Background: Dietary {{guidance}} recommends {{consumption of}} a nutrient-dense diet containing {{a variety of}} fruits. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate usual nutrient intakes and adequacy of nutrient intakes among adult <b>grapefruit</b> consumers and non-consumers, and to examine associations between <b>grapefruit</b> consumption and select health parameters. Methods: The analysis was conducted with data collected in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003 – 2008. Respondents reporting consumption of any amount of <b>grapefruit</b> or 100 % <b>grapefruit</b> juice at least once during the 2 days of dietary recall were classified as <b>grapefruit</b> consumers. Results: Among adults aged 19 + years with 2 days of dietary recall (n= 12, 789), 2. 5 % of males and 2. 7 % of females reported consumption of 100 % <b>grapefruit</b> juice or fresh, canned, or frozen <b>grapefruit</b> during the recalls. <b>Grapefruit</b> consumers were less likely to have usual intakes of vitamin C (males: 0 % vs. 47 %; females: 0 % vs. 43 %; P< 0. 001) and magnesium (P< 0. 05) below the estimated average requirement (EAR) compared to non-consumers, and they were more likely to meet adequate intake levels for dietary fiber (P< 0. 05). Potassium and β-carotene intakes were significantly higher among <b>grapefruit</b> consumers (P< 0. 001). Diet quality as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index- 2005 (HEI- 2005) was higher in <b>grapefruit</b> consumers (males: 66. 2 [95 % CI: 61. 0 – 71. 5] vs. 55. 4 [95 % CI: 54. 4 – 56. 4]; females: 71. 4 [95 % CI: 65. 1 – 77. 6] vs. 61. 2 [95 % CI: 59. 8 – 62. 6]). Among women, <b>grapefruit</b> consumption was associated with lower body weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P< 0. 05), However, risk of being overweight/obese was not associated with <b>grapefruit</b> consumption.
