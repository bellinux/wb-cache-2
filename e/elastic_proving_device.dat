40|$|Abstract. Different {{security}} notions {{and settings}} for identification pro-tocols {{have been proposed}} so far, considering different powerful adver-saries that can play “man-in-the-middle ” attacks. In this paper we consider {{one of the strongest}} forms of these attacks, namely resettably non-transferable identification introduced in [Bellare et al., Eurocrypt 2001]. This notion immunizes a scheme from powerful adversaries that have physical access to the <b>proving</b> <b>device</b> and can thus reset it to a previous state. We discuss some limitations of existing notions as well as different im-possibility results for strong notions of non-transferability. We introduce a strong and achievable notion for resettably non-transferable identifi-cation that reflects real scenarios more adequately and show a general protocol that satisfies it. We show how to efficiently instantiate our con-struction and discuss the viability of our protocol {{for the next generation of}} electronic passports (e-passports) ...|$|R

40|$|The role of space-based {{interferometry}} {{in achieving}} astronomical {{goals of the}} 21 st century, including precise mapping of the celestial sphere and detecting extra-solar planets, requires an infusion of advanced technology beyond that used in ground-based systems. High performance optical delay lines, which are used in many interferometers to control the optical pathlength difference to nanometer levels, {{need to be developed}} from a multi-disciplinary perspective in order to overcome optical pathlength distur-bances which arise from increased system flexibility in space-based interferometers. This work utilizes a combined control-structure approach to investigate several opti-cal delay line (ODL) structural design issues, including identifying good suspension characteristics, understanding the limitation of actuation noise and device staging, and posing the problem in an efficient framework to attain desired overall device characteristics in the presence of optical disturbance rejection.
