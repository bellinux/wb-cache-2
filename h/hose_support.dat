40|$|The {{process of}} milk {{pasteurization}} generally use thermal method. The method can cause microorganisms inactive {{on the other}} side, the method result in the degradation of quality food. An alternative method {{that can be used}} is by using technology of ultraviolet irradiation. Ultraviolet light has short wavelength with a very strong antimicrobacterialenergy. The mechanism of its wor is by absorbing the energy by nucleid acid without causing damaged on the surface of cel. The absorbed energy will cause the bonding of tymine (dimer tymine) so that the function of nucleic acid is disturbed and it cause the dead of microorganism (Lay and of Hastowo, 1992). The devices used in this research are ultraviolet lamp type C, spiral <b>hose,</b> <b>supporting</b> frame, materials containers and the devices for measuring the amount of microbes, fat, specific gravity and colour. Materials used in this research is fresh milk that obtained from KUD DAU Malang. The result are pasteurization process with UV irradiation decrease microorganisms and fat in milk...|$|R
50|$|Mama's {{appearance}} {{is based on}} that of a stereotypical elderly woman. She is a buxom, purse-lipped widow, with silvery blue curls. All of her outfits have consisted of various short-sleeved, floral-print dresses that carry lace collars. As much of Mama's time on Mama's Family was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping apron. Mama's lower legs have been clasped by visible <b>support</b> <b>hose</b> since the outset of Mama's Family; she wore no <b>support</b> <b>hose</b> during The Family sketches nor the Eunice movie. For footwear, Mama has invariably worn white, orthopedic shoes of a high heeled brogue style.|$|R

40|$|The Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, first {{reported}} in 1910, is a triad of cutaneous hemangioma, varicose veins, and soft tissue or bony hypertrophy. The varicosities are extensive involving the tributaries {{of the greater}} or lesser saphenous systems. Arteriogram are normal with no evidence of arteriovenous fistulas. Multiple ligation and stripping may worsen the condition, and treatment consists of wearing elastic <b>supporting</b> <b>hose.</b> A similar condition but associated with arteriovenous fistula {{is known as the}} Parkes Weber syndrome...|$|R

5000|$|A {{commonly}} used configuration is the catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM), {{which can be}} capable of handling very large crude carriers. This configuration uses six or eight heavy anchor chains placed radially around the buoy, of a size to suit the designed load, each about 350 m long, and attached to an anchor or pile to provide the required holding power. The anchor chains are pre-tensioned {{to ensure that the}} buoy is held in position above the PLEM. As the load from the tanker is applied, the heavy chains on the far side straighten and lift off the seabed to apply the balancing load. Under full design load there is still some 27 m of chain lying on the bottom. The flexible hose riser may be in one of three basic configurations, all designed to accommodate tidal depth variation and lateral displacement due to mooring loads. In all cases the hose curvature changes to accommodate lateral and vertical movement of the buoy, and the <b>hoses</b> are <b>supported</b> at near neutral buoyancy by floats along the length. These are: ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} outcomes for patients with trauma who had vena caval filters placed in the absence of venous thromboembolic disease (group P) and compare them with outcomes for patients with trauma who had filters placed after either deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (group T). Design: The study is a case series of consecutive patients who received vena caval filters after traumatic injury. Data were collected prospectively at the time of filter placement from reports of diagnostic studies obtained for clinical indications and during the annual follow-up examinations. Event rate findings are based on objective tests. Data were obtained from the Michigan Vena Cava Filter Registry. Results: Filters were placed in 385 patients with trauma; 249 of these filters were prophylactic (group P). Event rates were similar in the two groups. New pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 1. 5 % of the patients in group P and 2 % of the patients in group T. Caval occlusion rates were 3. 5 % for group P and 2. 3 % for group T. In all, 15. 6 % of the patients in group P had deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism after placement. The frequencies of lower extremity swelling and use of <b>support</b> <b>hose</b> were higher in group T than in group P (43 % vs 25 % and 25 % vs 3. 5 %, respectively; P <. 005). Outcomes were comparable in the two groups with respect to mechanical stability of the filter. Conclusions: The prophylactic indication for vena caval filter placement in patients with trauma is associated with a low incidence of adverse outcomes while providing protection from fatal pulmonary embolism. The current challenge is to limit the number of unnecessary placements through improved methods of risk stratification. (J Vasc Surg 2000; 32 : 490 - 7. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{shortage}} of multiproduct replenishment {{ships in the}} early 1970s {{led to the development}} of an improvised system for dispensing fuel from ammunition and stores ships that allowed them to transfer fuel to smaller combatants. Neither type of ship had cargo fuel, but each could share its own fuel with destroyers and frigates in an emergency. The lack of sufficient numbers of AOEs or AORs precluded the deployment of these types in support of any of the surface warfare groups, which were generally composed of destroyers and frigates. The old saw that necessity is the mother of invention proved to be true when Rear Admiral John Johnson devised a practical solution to the {{shortage of}} fuel-carrying UNREP ships based on the modification of existing cargo transfer gear on ammunition and stores ships. As commander Task Force 73 (the service force of the Seventh Fleet) in 1973, Admiral Johnson had to contend with the problem of how to provide logistic support for the two Seventh Fleet destroyers deployed to the Indian Ocean for an extended period of time. The answer was to turn the [...] into a mini multiproduct ship by adding two cargo reefer boxes as deck cargo and outfitting it with a jury-rigged fuel station. The latter was achieved by temporarily rigging a 7-inch fuel hose to the starboard side cargo station—the one closest to the ship's fuel receiving raiser. The highline was used as a span wire, and fuel <b>hose</b> saddles were <b>supported</b> from a wire whip from a nearby hauling winch or a fiber whip from a nearby gypsy. Fuel was pumped from the ship's own fuel bunkers to the receiving ship alongside using the fuel-transfer pump normally carried aboard the AE. The pumping rate was considerably less than that of a fleet oiler and, while workable, contained many drawbacks.|$|R
