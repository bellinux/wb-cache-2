5000|$|The {{device is}} {{typically}} fabricated by first depositing {{a thin film}} of a superconducting metal such as aluminum on an insulating substrate such as silicon. The deposition is performed inside a vacuum chamber. Oxygen gas is then introduced into the chamber, resulting {{in the formation of}} an insulating layer of aluminum oxide (...) with a typical thickness of several nanometers. After the vacuum is restored, an overlapping layer of superconducting metal is deposited, completing the STJ. To create a well-defined overlap region, a procedure known as the Niemeyer-Dolan technique is commonly used. This technique uses a suspended bridge of resist with a <b>double-angle</b> deposition to define the junction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{evaluation}} for <b>double-angle</b> compression {{members is}} a tedious procedure {{and is not}} an easy task for practicing engineers. In this study, a computer program has been developed to calculate the Pu based on the AISC specifications. It is found that the calculated value is quite close to the tabulated one if effective length (KL) is longer than 10 feet. However, the Pu is not tabulated for effective length less than 10 feet in some lager sections. It is found that the differences between the calculated value and the interpolated value could be as much as 20 %. Unfortunately, the difference errors are not on conservative side and the use of interpolated values is not acceptable in practice. This study evaluates all <b>double-angle</b> compressive formulas provided by the AISC manuals and the comparisons among them are presented. The Pu versus KL curves, in which effective lengths less than 10 feet are added and plotted. Some supplementary tabulated values, which required in routine design and not listed in current AISC design manuals, are also furnished. This study will fulfill the needs for those who seek higher performance and wider coverage when evaluating the design of <b>double-angle</b> compression members under flexural-torsion condition...|$|E
40|$|Stringer-to-floor-beam {{connections}} in riveted railway bridges have {{in many cases}} shown to be critical details with respect to fatigue. These connections, while generally designed with respect to shear forces alone, are often subjected to repeated out-of-plane distortion as a re-sult of their rotational stiffness. Static and fatigue tests involving three full-scale bridge parts have been conducted in order to study the behavior and the fatigue performance of riveted <b>double-angle</b> connections. The bridge parts were taken from an old riveted railway bridge built in 1896 and demolished in 1993. Each test specimen consisted of three floor beams and four stringers connected to each other with riv-eted double angles. Fig. 1 shows the set-up of the test specimens and loading arrangement, to-gether with a detail of the <b>double-angle</b> connections. Finite element analysis of the tested specimens was also performed in order to more closely study the load-deformation characteris-tics of these connections...|$|E
40|$|Several {{improvements}} {{are made to}} an algorithm of Higham and Smith for com-puting the matrix cosine. The original algorithm scales the matrix by a power of 2 to bring the ∞-norm to 1 or less, evaluates the [8 / 8] Pade ́ approximant, then uses the <b>double-angle</b> formula cos(2 A) = 2 cos 2 A − I to recover the cosine of the origi-nal matrix. The first improvement is to phrase truncation error bounds in terms of ‖A 2 ‖ 1 / 2 instead of the (no smaller and potentially much larger quantity) ‖A‖. The second is to choose the degree of the Pade ́ approximant to minimize the computa-tional cost subject to achieving a desired truncation error. A third improvement is to use an absolute, rather than relative, error criterion {{in the choice of}} Padé approximant; this allows the use of higher degree approximants without worsen-ing an a priori error bound. Our theory and experiments show that each of these modifications brings a reduction in computational cost. Moreover, because the modifications tend {{to reduce the number of}} <b>double-angle</b> steps they usually result in a more accurate computed cosine in floating point arithmetic. We also derive an algorithm for computing both cos(A) and sin(A), by adapting the ideas developed for the cosine and intertwining the cosine and sine double angle recurrences...|$|E

In order to free from the circular property of directional data, the treatment of initial angular data sets is performed using scalar values provided by the direction cosines of <b>double-angle</b> values.

The effectiveness of this scheme is demonstrated with femtosecond-regime pulses from a resonant structure and record pulse energies for the VECSEL gain medium. In addition, we show that the interference pattern of the intracavity mode within the active region, resulting from the <b>double-angle</b> multifold, is advantageous for operating the laser in CW on multiple wavelengths simultaneously.

40|$|The inelastic {{flexural}} and flexural-torsional buckling of axially loaded, pin-ended single-angle, tee and <b>double-angle</b> struts are investigated theoretically. The calculated {{inelastic buckling}} loads {{are based on}} the tangent modulus concept, assuming idealised residual stress distributions in the strut sections. In the inelastic range, although the elastic flexural-torsional buckling loads for some struts are less than the elastic flexural buckling loads, results show that the inelastic buckling loads of the struts are not at all influenced by nor related to the elastic flexural-torsional buckling loads. It is found that flexural buckling mode is the dominant failure mode for most of the strut shapes, except for single unequal angles and for tees and double angles whose radii of gyration ratios, rx/ry, are greater than 1 · 0. Experimental results compare well with the ultimate strength curves, except for tee struts in which experimental buckling loads are consistently lower than the theoretical predictions...|$|E

40|$|The {{resistance}} {{of a building}} to fire {{is the ability of}} the structure to withstand a combination of gravity loads and the induced thermal loads without undergoing failure either during the heating or cooling phases of the fire. Many researchers internationally have investigated the performance of steel-frame buildings in fire. However, few of them have examined U. S. building construction practices. ^ This project focused on the thermal and structural behavior of simple (shear) connections used in steel-frame buildings through experimental and numerical investigations. These connections include shear-tab, single-angle, and <b>double-angle</b> connections, both all-bolted and all-welded. The experimental approach included the use of high-temperature ceramic fiber radiant heaters, vertical loading, and advanced thermal instrumentation. Isolate lap joints were heated to target temperatures and loaded to evaluate the isolated failure modes of simple connections. These failure modes included bolt shear and plate bearing. Large-scale composite beams with simple connections were subjected to a combination of heating and loading. These tests evaluated failure modes of simple connections {{as a part of a}} floor system subjected to fire loading conditions. While the composite beams were able to sustain the service level loads at elevated temperatures, the shear-tab connections fractured during the cooling phase of the test. Single-angle and <b>double-angle</b> connections did not fail, rather prying of the angles was observed after the cooling phase. ^ Sequentially-coupled thermal-structural 3 D finite element models were developed to evaluate both the thermal and structural response of composite beams with simple connections. This modeling approach accounted for temperature-dependent material properties and the force-slip behavior of the shear studs. In addition, these models included contact definitions between the connection elements to simulate the bolt bearing behavior on the connection. A parametric study was conducted to evaluate the effects of various parameters on the capacity of simple connections at elevated temperatures. Variations in connection geometry, fire resistance rating, concrete deck type, continuous reinforcement were considered. ^ The thermal and structural behavior of simple connections was evaluated as an isolated connection, as a part of a one-bay composite beam, three-bay composite beam, and as a part of a full ten-story office building. The results of the parametric study were evaluated at a full building scale. Compartment, full-story, and moving fires were simulated in a ten-story office building. The fire resistance rating of structural members varied to understand the most cost efficient and effective fire resistance rating to withstand design fires. The results were compared with simplified methodologies developed by previous researchers to provide a simple design method without having to perform extensive thermal and structural analyses. ...|$|E

The paper {{deals with the}} simplification of pre-tensioned bolt model and simplification of load transfer within connection. Influence on normal strain (and thus stress) distribution at critical cross-section is investigated. Laboratory testing of single-angle or <b>double-angle</b> members – to – gusset plates bolted connections were taken as basis for numerical analysis. FE models were created using 1 D and 2 D elements. Angles and gusset plates were modelled with shell elements. Two methods of modelling of friction grip bolting were considered: bolt-regarding approach with 1 D element systems modelling bolts and two variants of bolt-disregarding approach with special constraints over some part of member and gusset plate surfaces in contact: a) constraints over whole area of contact, b) constraints over the area around each bolt shank (“partially tied”). Modelling of friction grip bolted connections using simplified bolt modelling may be effective, {{especially in the case}} of analysis concerning elastic range only. In such a case disregarding bolts and replacing them with “partially tied” modelling seems to be more attractive. It is less time-consuming and provides results of similar accuracy in comparison to analysis utilizing simplified bolt modelling...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of transmission field B(1) (+) and reception sensitivity maps is important in high-field (>= 3 T) human magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for several reasons: these include post-acquisition correction of intensity inhomogeneities, which may {{affect the quality of}} images; modeling and design of radiofrequency (RF) coils and pulses; validating theoretical models for electromagnetic field calculations; testing the compatibility with MR environment of biomedical implants. Moreover, inhomogeneities in the RF field are an essential source of error for quantitative MR spectroscopy. Recent studies have also shown that B(1) (+) and reception sensitivity maps can be used for direct calculation of tissue electrical parameters and for estimating the local specific absorption rate (SAR) in vivo. Several B(1) (+) mapping techniques have been introduced {{in the past few years}} based on actual flip angle (FA) mapping, but, to date, none has emerged as a standard. For reception sensitivity calculation, the signal intensity equation can be used where the nominal FA distribution must be replaced with the actual FA distribution calculated by one of the B(1) (+) mapping techniques. This study introduces a quantitative comparison between two known methods for B(1) (+) /actual FA and reception sensitivity mapping: the <b>double-angle</b> method (DAM) and the fitting (FIT) method. Experimental data obtained using DAM and FIT methods are also compared with numerical simulation results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
