500|$|.....We felt {{because it}} was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans. They aren't quite as {{experienced}} as Master Chief, and we looked a lot at combat infantry going into actual wars, and typically {{at the beginning of}} a war, especially the Vietnam War, if you look at the infantry, they're all loaded up. They have all the backpacks on, they have all the belts on, every single bit of armor is there, and they're carrying around lots of armor. At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need. This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> have. So if you look at our Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor. They've still got the belts on, they're still carrying around everything.|$|E
2500|$|Pei {{encouraged}} {{criticism of}} the governance and often promoted officials who submitted good criticism. [...] On one occasion, when the officials Dugu Yu (獨孤郁), Li Zhengci (李正辭), and Yan Xiufu (嚴休復) were set to be promoted from being Shiyi (拾遺) to Bujue (補闕), they met him to thank him. [...] Pei commented, [...] "The Bujue Dugu and Li often submitted their best thoughts, {{and now they are}} finally being promoted. [...] I am embarrassed that that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> are receiving for their labor. [...] The Bujue Yan might have had uncommon achievements, but when I was submitting your promotion, I had hesitations." [...] This caused Yan much embarrassment.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid 13th century, {{gunpowder}} weapons {{had become}} {{central to the}} Song war effort. In 1257 the Song official Li Zengbo was dispatched to inspect frontier city arsenals. Li considered an ideal city arsenal to include several hundred thousand iron bombshells, and also its own production facility to produce {{at least a couple}} thousand a month. The results of his tour of the border were severely disappointing and in one arsenal he found [...] "no more than 85 iron bomb-shells, large and small, 95 fire-arrows, and 105 fire-lances. This is not sufficient for a mere hundred men, let alone a thousand, to use against an attack by the ... barbarians. The government supposedly wants to make preparations for the defense of its fortified cities, and to furnish them with military supplies against the enemy (yet this <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> give us). What chilling indifference!" [...] Fortunately for the Song, Möngke Khan died in 1259 and the war would not continue until 1269 under the leadership of Kublai Khan, but when it did the Mongols came in full force.|$|E

60|$|And {{as soon as}} {{they had}} {{scrambled}} through their gap where Oak, Ash, and Thorn grew, that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> remembered.|$|R
50|$|The Hedoth {{initially}} left no clue {{of where}} they went, but their departure was remarkably tidy. Scattered installations and miscellaneous war machines <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> left behind.|$|R

60|$|Eighteen inches a man <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> allow you; {{eighteen}} {{inches in}} width; {{in that you}} must swing. Dreadful! they give you more swing than that at the gallows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Practically this <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> {{have left}} to {{them of their}} empire. Abroad the cities have either revolted with us or wait the issue. Your {{awakening}} has perplexed them, paralysed them." ...|$|E
60|$|My two {{children}} were, indeed, taken happily off my hands by my husband's father and mother, and that, by the way, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> got by Mrs. Betty.|$|R
50|$|This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> could {{remember}} {{of what had}} been said and done. It subsequently appeared that they had been drunk the greater part of the time while at St. Louis.|$|R
50|$|The Lions scored 10 {{points in}} the second quarter but that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> could muster as the Bears outgained them in yards 338-180 and scored ten second-half points to win 20-10.|$|R
6000|$|III:3:33 [...] ALAR. [...] A little breath [...] <b>Is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> {{have cost}} me, tho' their blood has stained [...] My damask blade. And still the Moor! What ho! [...] Why fliest not like thy mates? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A little {{measure of}} philosophy. It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> want. Only the faint-hearted, {{who have not}} the courage to {{contemplate}} physical annihilation, console themselves by building up a hysterical faith in an impossible hereafter. There is no hereafter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 221. But how {{to unite}} the two great sects of paralyzed Protestants? By keeping simply to Scripture. The members of the Scottish Church have not a shadow of excuse for refusing Episcopacy; it has indeed been abused among them, grievously abused; {{but it is in}} the Bible; and that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> have a right to ask.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't arrest me, boss. I wasn't in the game. The men {{hired me}} to take 'em out--that <b>was</b> <b>all.</b> <b>They</b> said the girl was light-headed and the place was a private asylum." ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> could say. The {{situation}} was new, unheard of, incredible; {{they could not}} understand it, {{they did not know}} how to take hold of it, it approximately paralyzed speech.|$|R
60|$|That, I say, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> knew {{of their}} Father in heaven, till missionaries came and preached the Gospel to them, {{and told them}} what St. Paul told the Greeks in my text.|$|R
6000|$|... "The tarnal ruffians!" [...] Peter exclaimed; [...] "the murdering varmints! And {{to think}} of 'em {{carrying}} off that purty little gal of yours! I suppose by this time they're at their old game of plundering and slaying on the frontier. It's naught to them which side they fight on; scalps and plunder <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> care for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ha, ha!' chuckled Mr. Staples. 'Queer old girls they are. Very high. Very {{good to the}} poor. All {{the good}} that is done in Vale Leston is by them; but {{anything}} between a swell and a pauper don't exist for them. They're as poor as Job, and their pride <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> have, so they {{make the most of}} it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Yet write, oh! {{write me}} all, that I may join Griefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine. Nor foes nor fortune take this power away; And is my Abelard less kind than they? Tears still are mine, and those I need not spare, Love but demands what else were shed in prayer; No happier task these faded eyes pursue; To read and weep <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> now can do.|$|E

50|$|The {{three runs}} scored by Florida {{in the bottom}} of the second inning <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> needed to secure the win. Stacey Nelson pitched a seven-inning, three-hit shutout while {{striking}} out seven and walking none.|$|R
50|$|The entire storyline {{involving}} {{the parents and}} their greed for money was also deleted, cut short by a small cutscene and a narrator explaining that worrying over their son <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> needed to reform completely.|$|R
6000|$|... "But they can't hurt me," [...] father objected. [...] "Thank God I am independent. Oh, I assure you, I {{know the}} frightful {{persecution}} they can wage on a professor who is economically dependent on his university. But I am independent. I {{have not been}} a professor {{for the sake of}} my salary. I can get along very comfortably on my own income, and the salary <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> can take away from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} {{advantage}} of bearing it alone, and, to tell the truth, it doesn't bother me much. That a man should go straight in the present <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> ask in Canada, and homeless adventurers with no possessions--the kind of comrades I've generally met--are charitable. As a rule, it wouldn't become them to be fastidious. Anyway, sir, you must see the absurdity of believing that Bertram could have failed in his duty in the way the tale suggests." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{scattered}} over the island. There are eight or ten dwellers here like myself, and several of them have {{one or more of}} these fellows with them; others have built huts for themselves and shift as they can; but it is a hard shift, I reckon, and beech-nuts and acorns, eked out with an occasional fish caught in the streams, <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> have to live upon. I wonder that they do not go back to honest work among their kinsfolk." ...|$|E
5000|$|..... {{some of the}} Manchesters {{were there}} yet, seven days wounded and not looked to.... Our men gave all their food and water away, but that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> could do. Lieutenant W. G. Fisher (13 October) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O yes; they'll {{take one}} always, because few care to come. 'Tis a starve-acre place. Corn and swedes <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> grow. Though I be here myself, I feel 'tis a pity for such as you to come." ...|$|R
60|$|This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> {{could get}} out of the sailor, try their best, and, upon Oliver Wadsworth's advice, they did not bother him any further. Before {{returning}} to the sanitarium, the rich manufacturer called Dave to one side.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is all I know," [...] {{replied the}} prisoner, [...] "other than that he whom they call Lu-don, {{the high priest}} at A-lur, was very angry, {{and that one of}} the two priests who guided us out of the city said to the other that the {{stranger}} was not Dor-ul-Otho at all; that Lu-don had said so and that he had also said that he would expose him and that he should be punished with death for his presumption. That <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> said within my hearing.|$|E
60|$|Those who {{contend that}} space and body are the same, bring this dilemma:--either this space is {{something}} or nothing; if nothing be between two bodies, they must necessarily touch; if it {{be allowed to}} be something, they ask, Whether it be body or spirit? To which I answer by another question, Who told them that there was, or could be, nothing; but SOLID BEINGS, WHICH COULD NOT THINK, and THINKING BEINGS THAT WERE NOT EXTENDED?--which <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> mean by the terms BODY and SPIRIT.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Stone's {{voice rose}} again. [...] "Their form and balance is their single soul; they have {{preserved}} it from century to century. This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> live for. In those days"--his voice sank; he had plainly forgotten {{that he was}} not alone--"when men had no universal conceptions, they would have done well to look at the trees. Instead of fostering a number of little souls on the pabulum of varying theories of future life, they should have been concerned to improve their present shapes, and thus to dignify man's single soul." ...|$|E
60|$|No. He {{believed}} it was ME. I had told his story to Assistant-secretary Blank, who had, in turn related it to Bureau-director Dash--both good fellows--but this <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> could do. Yes, it was a foothold. But he must go now.|$|R
6000|$|They {{signified}} wonder roundly At any astounding yarn, By darning their dear eyes roundly ('T <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> had to darn).

60|$|I {{snatched}} the neglected glasses {{from the deck}} and hurried aft to join my client on the overhang, but a pipe <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> revealed above the bleak hillocks of sand. My client turned {{to me with a}} face that was white under the tan.|$|R
