The phase composition and morphology of the coated powders {{as well as}} the microstructure of grinding surface of the ceramics were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. The results show that the coated powders have a distinct core-shell structure which has a great effect on material’s removal approaches. The main fracture mode is caused by <b>intragranular</b> <b>fracture</b> of layered LaPO 4 rather than the weak interface.

It was shown that <b>intragranular</b> <b>fracture</b> can proceed inside the grain at low temperature, and plastic deformation around {{the tip of the}} crack is accommodated by dislocation nucleation/emission; indeed, both fully extended dislocation and deformation twinning were visible around the tip of the crack during fracture. In addition, due to a higher concentration of stress in front of the crack at a relative lower temperature, it was found that twinning deformation is easier to nucleate from the tip of the crack. These results also showed that the decreasing grain size below a critical value exhibits a reverse Hall-Petch relationship due to the enhancing grain boundary mediation, and high temperature is better for propagating ductile cracks. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} microstructural {{as well as}} {{bulk and}} mineral chemical investigations of deformation bands in uncemented, friable arkosic sands of Miocene age (Vienna Basin, Austria). Our microstructural study indicates grain size reduction by grain flaking in deformation bands with small offsets (0. 5 – 8  cm), and dominant <b>intragranular</b> <b>fracturing</b> and cataclasis of altered feldspar grains at larger displacements (up to 60  cm). Relative to quartz, the sericitized feldspar grains are preferably fractured and abraded, which additionally leads to an enrichment of mainly phyllosilicates by mechanical expulsion from feldspar. Both cataclasis of quartz and feldspar grains and enrichment of phyllosilicates result in grain size reduction within the deformation bands. The measured reduction in porosity of up to 20 % is in some cases associated with a permeability reduction, reflected in the retention of iron-oxide rich fluids along deformation bands. These deformation bands formed at very shallow burial depths in unconsolidated sediments indicate that fault sealing may occur {{in the absence of}} chemical alteration of the deformation bands and lead to a compartmentalization of a groundwater or hydrocarbon reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{fractures}} in an arkosic sandstone {{from the western}} damage zone of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) at San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) was used {{to better understand the}} origin of damage and to determine the scale dependence of fracture fabric and fracture density. Samples for this study were acquired from core taken at approximately 2. 6 km depth during Phase 1 drilling at SAFOD. Petrographic sections of samples were studied using an optical petrographic microscope equipped with a universal stage and digital imaging system, and a scanning electron microscope with cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) imaging capability. Use of combined optical imaging and SEM-CL imaging was found to more successfully acquire true fracture density at the grain scale. Linear fracture density and fracture orientation were determined for transgranular fractures at the whole thin section scale, and <b>intragranular</b> <b>fractures</b> at the grain scale. The microscopic scale measurements were compared to measurements of mesoscopic scale {{fractures in}} the same core, as well as to published data from an ancient, exhumed trace of the SAF in southern California. Fracturing in the damage zone of the SAF fault follows simple scaling laws from the grain scale to the km scale. Fracture density distributions in the core from SAFOD are similar to distributions in damaged arkosic sandstone of the SAF along other traces. Transgranular fractures, which are dominantly shear fractures, indicate preferred orientation approximately parallel to the dominant sets of the mesoscale faults. Although additional work is necessary to confirm general applicability, the results of this work demonstrate that fracture density and orientation distribution over a broad range of scales can be determined from measurements at the mesoscopic scale using empirical scaling relations...|$|R

Moreover, weld cracks due to pores were investigated. The results show that weld pores less than 300 μm in size are redistributed or removed via remelting due to TIG dressing. Regardless of the temperature condition, TIG dressing welding showed ductility, and there was a loss of 7 % tensile strength of the weldments. Additionally, it was considered that porosity redistribution by TIG dressing was due to fluid flow during the remelting of the weld pool. Weld cracks in titanium weldment create branch cracks around pores that propagate via the <b>intragranular</b> <b>fracture,</b> and oxygen is dispersed around the pores.

Torsion experiments were conducted at 300 MPa confining pressure, temperatures ranging from 475 °C to 1000 °C and shear strain rates from 2. 0 x 10 - 5 to 2. 1 x 10 - 3 s- 1 up to total strains of 21. 3. Flow is Newtonian for a solid fraction of Φs = 0. 0 - 0. 16 with a log dynamic viscosity Η = 10. 3 Pa. s (T = 500 °C). A deviation from Newtonian behavior is observed for Φs > 0. 16 with an increase in apparent viscosity of about one order of magnitude between Φs = 0. 16 and 0. 54. The shape fabric of the solid phase is characterized by a unimodal orientation that is almost stable and nearly parallel to the shear direction. Both shape fabric and deviation from Newtonian behavior originate from {{the increase in the number}} of particle clusters in the suspension. The apparent viscosity increases by 1. 5 orders of magnitude between Φs = 0. 54 and 0. 65 and extrapolation of the data suggests a very sharp increase in apparent viscosity for Φs ≥ 0. 65.

The recovery of relatively undeformed diabases from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) /Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 504 B provides a {{first opportunity to}} examine a reference section of microstructural features that influence strain localization at depths of 2 km in the ocean crust. Syn- and post-crystallization features in plagioclase and augite crystals have been examined by optical microscopy and secondary and backscattered electron imaging.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of analysis of surface roughness parameters in the Krosno Sandstones of Mucharz, southern Poland. It was aimed at determining whether these parameters are influenced by structural features (mainly the laminar distribution of mineral components and directional distribution of non-isometric grains) and fracture processes. The tests applied in the analysis enabled us to determine and describe the primary statistical parameters used in the quantitative description of surface roughness, as well as specify the usefulness of contact profilometry as a method of visualizing spatial differentiation of fracture processes in rocks. These aims were achieved by selecting a model material (Krosno Sandstones from the Górka-Mucharz Quarry) and an appropriate research methodology. The schedule of laboratory analyses included: identification analyses connected with non-destructive ultrasonic tests, aimed at the preliminary determination of rock anisotropy, strength point load tests (cleaved surfaces were obtained due to destruction of rock samples), microscopic analysis (observation of thin sections {{in order to determine the}} mechanism of inducing fracture processes) and a test method of measuring surface roughness (two- and three-dimensional diagrams, topographic and contour maps, and statistical parameters of surface roughness).

40|$|Introduction: During {{hypervelocity}} {{impact the}} crater subsurface experiences pervasive deformation. Fracture propagation and the localization behavior of damage depend on mechanical {{properties of the}} rock, i. e., dynamic strength behavior, which in turn must be constrained by the mechanical properties of the rock-forming minerals phases. These patterns also correspond to the variation of the stress field that occurs during the propagation of the shock wave. Where pressures {{in the order of}} a several GPa above the Hugoniot Elastic Limit (HEL) are achieved, non-porous rocks fail under compression, due to pervasive shearing under differential stresses [1]. When pressures decrease to around the HEL, more localized, tensile deformation can occur in the target, e. g. radial fractures [2]. Our goal is to determine how impact-induced deformation varies between different mineralogically homogeneous, nonporous rocks and address their potential influence on the resulting crater. Methods: Two hypervelocity impact experiments into quartzite and marble were conducted, using a spherical 2. 5 mm steel and iron meteorite projectile, respectively, with densities between 7. 8 – 8. 1 g/cm 3 and an impact velocity of ca. 5. 0 km/s. The crater surface topography was measured with a 3 D laser scanner. Craters were sawn in half and thin sections of the crater subsurface were made to analyze subsurface deformation. Orientations of the deformation features were mapped to infer the deformation mechanisms. Results: Subsurface analysis of the two craters shows that a common feature of both is the development of subconcentric tensile fractures directly beneath the crater floor due to dilatancy upon pressure release. The maximum depth of tensile failure below the crater floor varies with target material: quartzite 2. 2 dp, marble 1. 5 dp (projectile diameter). The quartzite target additionally shows localized deformation along discrete, 25 to 180 μm wide zones with subradial orientation relative to the impact point. Target material within these zones has a mean grain size of ~ 1. 3 - 2. 6 μm and thus is highly comminuted. Additionally, they are commonly surrounded by areas with large fractures. Outside of these fault zones the quartzite target suffered only the formation of narrow radial fractures down to a depth of at least 8. 5 dp. In comparison, the marble target experienced intensive and pervasive intra- and intergranular fracturing, but did not develop the localized fracture zones seen in the quartzite target. The <b>intragranular</b> <b>fractures</b> show a stong correlation to the natural cleavage of calcite and a high percentage of the <b>intragranular</b> <b>fractures</b> is crystallographically orientated. In combination with the intergranular and tensile fractures they led to a much stronger overall comminution in the marble subsurface than in the quartzite. A further impact-induced deformation feature is microtwinning along crystallographic planes in calcite minerals and results in minor crystal-plastic behavior of the calcite. Close to the crater floor several sets of twins per grain developed, but with increasing distance to the crater floor their abundance decreases to a depth of ~ 2 dp. The depth of observable deformation features in quartzite extends down to ~ 11. 4 dp, compared to only 3. 6 dp in the marble target. In both targets, the deformation in the most proximal, highly comminuted area underneath the crater floor seems to be controlled by shear deformation. Such a dominance of one deformation mechanism over others cannot be established in the deeper regions of the crater subsurface. Discussion: The compressive and subsequent tensile stress fields generated in the shock wave are demonstrated by distinct deformation featuers in both target materials. The strong grain comminution in the localized deformation zones in quartzite indicates compressive failure due to shearing under differential stresses. The apparent absence of deformation in the neighboring areas of the shear zones is probably attributed to the lack of cleavage in quartz. The radial fractures are suggested to form due to hoop stresses in the elastic decay regime [2]. The less localized and more pervasive deformation in the marble target on the other hand {{can be attributed to the}} weaker crystal strength of calcite. The excellent rhombohedral cleavage and the possibility of twin formation led to a stronger absorbtion of impact energy by the formation of cleavage fractures and twins. Thus, the shock wave is more effectively dampened than in the quartzite. Conclusions: First results of SEM microscopy of impacted quartzite and marble target subsurfaces reveal great differences in impact induced deformation mechanisms between the two non-porous target materials. The origin of these differences seems mostly to be found in the dynamic mechanical properties of the main rock-forming minerals. Further investigations will be performed to validate these preliminary results...|$|R

Taking Longmaxi Shales in the Jiaoshiba {{area of the}} Sichuan Basin as a study object, we systematically study the microscopic pore structures of shales by using Argon-ion polishing Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), high-pressure mercury injection and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments. The study results show that: the Longmaxi Shale {{in this area are}} dominated by nano-scale pores which can be classified into organic pores, inorganic pores (intergranular pores, intragranular pores, inter-crystalline pores and dissolution pores), microfractures (<b>intragranular</b> structure <b>fractures,</b> interlayer sliding fractures, diagenetic shrinkage joints and abnormal-pressure fractures from organic evolution), among which organic pores and clay mineral pores are predominant and organic pores are the most common; a TOC value shows an obvious positive correlation with the content of organic pores, which account for up to 50 % in the lower-quality shales with a TOC of over 2 % where they are most developed; microscopic pore structures are very complex and open, with pores being mainly in cylinder shape with two ends open, or in parallel tabular shape with four sides open and 2 – 30  nm in diameter, being mostly medium pores. On this basis, factors affecting the micropore structures of shales in this area are studied. It is concluded that organic matter abundance and thermal maturity are the major factors controlling the microscopic pore structures of shales, while the effects of clay mineral content are relatively insignificant...|$|R
40|$|By {{introducing}} a controlled porosity into the ceramic systems, the properties {{can be improved}} and make the material proper for being used as high-frequency ultrasonic transducers or for tunable applications. The tailored porosity exposes special properties and characteristics of the materials, which might be completely different than their conventional dense equivalents. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize (Ba,Sr) TiO 3 ceramics with different porosity levels. Powders with the composition Ba 0. 60 Sr 0. 40 TiO 3 (BST) were prepared following the mixed oxide method by solid-state reaction at a sintering temperature of 1450 °C for 2 h. The BST ceramics with various porosities have been prepared by addition of lamellar graphite in concentration of 10, 20 and 35 %. The effect of addition of graphite on dielectric properties was investigated. We noticed that the increasing of the amount of graphite increases the graded porosity and leads to a low mechanical quality factor. The relative density of the obtained samples varies from values around 95 % for the dense ceramic to 66 % for porous ceramics. Graphite was burned out through the sintering process and this resulted in a modification of morphology, microstructure and pore density of the ceramic product. The porous samples produced with homogeneous or graded porosity show a strong difference of the dielectric properties and microstructure in comparison with the dense ceramic samples. The role of anisotropic porosity on the functional properties on the dielectric properties is discussed. Microstructural, morphological and dielectric investigations have been performed and data were compared with other literature studies. From SEM analysis it was found that with addition of graphite as pore forming the samples present a fracture mode transformation from <b>intragranular</b> <b>fracture</b> to an intergranular fracture and a decreasing of grain size of BST. Furthermore, as BST grain size becomes smaller, the volume of grain boundary increases and the crack prefers spreading along grain boundary to splitting the strengthened grain. The Impedance Spectroscopy analyse was performed in the temperature range of (21 - 200) °C and frequency of 20 Hz- 2 MHz. The dielectric investigations have shown that the dielectric constant of the Ba 0. 60 Sr 0. 40 TiO 3 (BST) ceramics with different degree of porosity, decrease and remains constant at higher frequency, indicating dielectric dispersion. The frequency dependence of the real and imaginary part of permittivity present a few characteristic relaxations which appear in the specific frequency ranges: (i) the increasing of the real and imaginary parts of permittivity at low frequencies below 100 Hz for the compositions with x= 10, 20 and 35 % graphite is most probably associated to the thermally activated space charge effects (Maxwell-Wagner phenomena) and (ii) anomalies of the imaginary part of permittivity above 103 Hz, for samples with x= 10 and 20 % porosity, which seems to be related to a Debye-type relaxation process. The dielectric properties of the investigated ceramics were characterized and correlated with their microstructure. From dielectric constant dependence with temperature, a shift of Curie temperature of ceramics was observed and possible reasons for these effects were interpreted.

40|$|WC/Co is the {{material}} of choice for most high wear applications such as hot forming operations, drilling, cutting, machining and wire drawing due to its superior wear properties. In the evaluation of its material properties to withstand wear, particularly that of its hardness, most of the available information is based on room temperature investigations. However, when WC/Co {{is used in the}} actual applications, it also experiences very high contact temperatures and this localized heating has a detrimental effect on the WC/Co material causing microstructural changes on the surface and sub-micron surface that affect its wear resistance properties. Creep also {{plays an important role in}} the damage mechanisms at elevated temperatures especially in prolonged contact to heat such as those used in hot metal forming operations. However, the current information on these high temperature properties is not complete and has contradictory results. Moreover, creep studies of WC/Co have been done at temperatures > 800 °C and information below this temperature is also lacking. Therefore, the primary goal of this thesis is to obtain a first time in-depth understanding of its high temperature property–composition–microstructure interaction that affects its wear properties from room temperature up to 800 °C using comprehensive scratch tests, high temperature indentation hardness tests and indentation creep tests. These tests are supplemented with advanced 3 D imaging, microstructural and composition analysis using SEM, EBSD, FIB, EDX, SIMS and laser confocal microscopy. Moreover, due to the lack of a commercially available high temperature microindentation test system, this thesis also aims to design, build and commission a high temperature and high vacuum microindentation test system to carry out these investigations. The results of the scratch tests showed new information on the damage mechanisms, particularly on the formation of a tribo-layer on the scratched surfaces and the evolution of surface damages incurred on the indenter tip which is found to affect the coefficient of friction. These provide baseline information on the damage mechanisms occurring at room temperature and were instrumental in the development of the methodology used in the high temperature indentation tests. The results of the high temperature indentation tests showed that the behaviour of the WC/Co hardmetals were categorised according to two temperature regimes. In the low temperature regime (20 °C? 500 °C), the controlling factor is dominated by the WC grain size and that the damage mechanisms are characterised by plastic deformation of the WC grains via slip, <b>intragranular</b> <b>fracture</b> of the WC grains within the surface of the indent and intergranular fracture along the edges of the indent. In the high temperature regime (> 500 °C), the controlling factor was dominated by the Co binder and the damage mechanism showed first time observation of severe plastic flow accompanied by shape change on the WC grains. A tribo-layer was also found to exist on the room temperature indents but not on the high temperature indents. In addition, pitting of the indenter tip occurred at test temperatures > 700 °C and its contribution to the measured hardness were determined. These results provide significant information on the best combination of WC grain size and Co content that are suitable for applications requiring high hardness retention and creep resistance. In addition, the thorough investigation of the damage mechanisms ensuing at these temperatures is beneficial in the design of WC/Co with better wear properties at elevated temperatures...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{distribution}} and nature of microstructures, geochemistry, and mineralogy along two traverses across the Punchbowl fault, southern California, to determine the morphology and deformation mechanisms of the fault zone in schistose rocks. The Punchbowl fault is an exhumed fault that has two main strands of slip localization and has a total of 44 km of right-slip. Protolith {{in the study area}} consists of the Pelona Schist, which is primarily a quartz–albite–muscovite–actinolite schist with thin to medium banding, and rare metabasalts. The traverses are 1. 3 km apart, and were conducted at a site with a single fault strand and a site where both principal strands of the fault are exposed. The fault-zone thickness {{is a function of the}} type of measurement that is used to define it. For the single strand site, analysis of the distribution of microfractures shows that the fault zone consists of a roughly 40 -m-thick damaged zone adjacent to the fault core. The damaged zone is marked by an increase in veins, thin cataclasite bands, inter- and <b>intragranular</b> <b>fracturing,</b> and alteration relative to the country rock. Brittle grain-size reduction occurs in a zone 10 m thick as measured from the fault core, which consists of a continuous, 10 -cm-thick, very fine-grained cataclasite that experienced repeated alteration, vein injection and grain-size reduction. Whole-rock geochemical analyses of the fault-related rocks suggest that the geochemically defined fault zone is less than 10 m thick. Volume loss at the site with one fault strand appears to have been small. The dominant alteration reactions associated with the fault core are the hydration of hornblende and actinolite accompanied by the alteration of muscovite to produce a quartz ± chlorite ± albite ± epidote ultracataclasite. The composition of the fault core is variable and locally influenced by one of the adjacent protoliths. The examination of the two fault strand sites shows that two damaged-zone fault-core structures are present. The region between the two strands experienced a greater degree of deformation than the protolith, but the total deformation is much less than immediately adjacent to the fault cores. The total thickness of the damaged zone around the two strands is less than 200 m. The fault core enveloped by a damaged-zone morphology, as well as the textures of the fault-core rocks are similar to rocks associated with the North Branch San Gabriel fault, which formed in crystalline rocks with a total displacement of 22 km. Fault thickness is less in the Pelona Schist than in the crystalline rocks, perhaps owing to more efficient strain localization in the schists. Thus, the faults of the San Andreas system may be thinner in regions where schists or Franciscan rocks are the protolith, but the main fault core may be a constant feature of the fault zone. Transformation-induced weakening is less important in this part of the Punchbowl fault, since the protolith has a large amount of mica. The structure of the fault zone with two principal slip surfaces is marked by both chemical changes and microstructures, and indicates that some parts of the San Andreas fault system may consist of multiple slip surfaces, each with a damaged zone, that together may create a fault zone 3 ̆e 100 m thick, and in which slip is localized to zones meters to decimeters thick...|$|R
40|$|Au {{mineralization}} in {{the western}} Lupa goldfield, southwestern Tanzania was associated with transpression and reverse sinistral slip along a network of steeply S dipping shear zones with non-Andersonian geometries. Slip was accommodated by: (1) frictional failure and sliding during emplacement of quartz ± Au-bearing veins; and (2) crystal plasticity and fluid-assisted diffusive mass transfer. The Kenge mineral system is situated along a NW-SE-trending shear zone and is characterized by ≤ 10 -m thick, Au-bearing fault-fill veins hosted by well-developed phyllosilicate-rich mylonites. The broadly contemporaneous Porcupine mineral system is situated along an ENE-WSW– to E–W-trending shear zone, which is characterized by narrow, discontinuous mylonitic shear zone within a silicified and nonfoliated granitoid protolith. Au mineralization at Porcupine occurs within steeply dipping fault-fill and subhorizontal extension/oblique-extension veins. Three-dimensional frictional reactivation theory provides a self-consistent explanation for the different vein styles at Kenge and Porcupine and extends the classic fault valve model to the general case of oblique slip along multiple, arbitrarily oriented shear zones. Analysis of the differential stress required for frictional reactivation suggests the following: (1) the Kenge shear zone was intrinsically weaker than the Porcupine shear zone, consistent {{with the lack of}} well-developed mylonites at Porcupine; and (2) frictional reactivation of the Kenge shear zone occurred under suprahydrostatic but sublithostatic pore fluid pressures, whereas frictional reactivation of the Porcupine shear zone occurred under near-lithostatic fluid pressures. We hypothesize that near-lithostatic pore fluid pressures relieved effective normal stresses at grain-grain contacts, helping to preserve <b>intragranular</b> and <b>fracture</b> porosity at the Porcupine orebody. As such, these pore spaces may be important microstructural sites for Au mineralization. Low effective normal stresses can also explain the poorly developed phyllosilicate-rich mylonites and limited degree of shear zone weakening at Porcupine...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{chalcopyrite}} {{from two}} localities was experimentally deformed in compression under 1. 5 kilobars of confining pressure at temperatures up to 300 øC over the strain rate range 10 - • to 10 -ø sec-•. At 25 ø and 100 øC the stress-strain behavior was relatively independent of temperature and strain {{rate and the}} deformation proceeded predom-inantly by <b>intragranular</b> and grain-boundary <b>fracturing</b> (microfracturing). From 150 ø to 300 øC strength decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate, and the dominant mode was intragranular slip and deformation twinning. The higher temperature behavior of the two different experimental materials was similar in spite of differences in impurity and grain size. The low-temperature microfracturing strength, however, was higher in the finer graine d, less pure chalcopyrite. Extrapolation of the experimental data for "steady state " plastic flow to representa-tive geological strain rates indicates stress differences {{in the order of}} 250 to 1, 000 bars at 100 øC, 80 to 500 bars at 200 øC, and 30 to 300 bars at 300 øC. These values are not expected to vary with confining pressure. $yntectonic recrystallization might lower these stress differences even further. Chalcopyrite is expected to flow plastically in the crust except for very shallow conditions where low confining pressures and temperatures and relatively high stress differences prevail. In etched polished sections evidence of naturally deformed chalcopyrite can be provided by slip lines, deformation twins, subgrains, high-energy serrated grain bound-aries, distorted twin boundaries, and elongation (straining) of grains. Such evidence may be partially or wholly obliterated by subsequent recrystallization...|$|R
