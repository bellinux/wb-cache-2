50|$|<b>Filaminast</b> (code name WAY-PDA 641) {{was a drug}} {{candidate}} developed by Wyeth-Ayerst. It is a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor (PDE4 inhibitor) and an analog of rolipram, which served as a prototype molecule for several development efforts. It was discontinued after a Phase II trial showed that its therapeutic window was too narrow; {{it could not be}} dosed high enough without causing significant side effects (nausea and vomiting), which was a problem with the rolipram class of molecules.|$|E
40|$|Biological {{networks}} are powerful tools for predicting undocumented relationships between molecules. The underlying principle is that existing interactions between molecules {{can be used}} to predict new interactions. Here we use this principle to suggest new protein-chemical interactions via the network derived from three-dimensional structures. For pairs of proteins sharing a common ligand, we use protein and chemical superimpositions combined with fast structural compatibility screens to predict whether additional compounds bound by one protein would bind the other. The method reproduces 84 % of complexes in a benchmark, and we make many predictions that would not be possible using conventional modeling techniques. Within 19, 578 novel predicted interactions are 7, 793 involving 718 drugs, including <b>filaminast,</b> coumarin, alitretonin and erlotinib. The growth rate of confident predictions is twice that of experimental complexes, meaning that a complete structural drug-protein repertoire will be available at least ten years earlier than by X-ray and NMR techniques alone...|$|E
40|$|PDE 4 inhibitors {{have been}} in {{development}} as a novel anti-inflammatory therapy since the 1980 s with asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) being primary indications. Despite initial optimism, none have yet reached the market. In most cases, the development of PDE 4 inhibitors of various structural classes, including cilomilast, <b>filaminast,</b> lirimilast, piclamilast, tofimilast, AWD- 12 - 281 (aka GSK 842470), CDP 840, CI- 1018, D- 4418, IC 485, L- 826, 141, SCH 351391 and V 11294 A has been discontinued due to lack of efficacy. A primary problem is the low therapeutic ratio of these compounds, which severely limits the dose that can be given. Indeed, for many of these compounds {{it is likely that the}} maximum tolerated dose is either sub-therapeutic or at the very bottom of the efficacy dose-response curve. Therefore, the challenge is to overcome this limitation. It is, therefore, encouraging that many â€˜new(er) ' PDE 4 inhibitors in development are reported to have an improved therapeutic window including tetomilast, oglemilast, apremilast, ONO 6126, IPL- 512602 and IPL- 455903 (aka HT- 0712), although the basis for their superior tolerability has not been disclosed. In addition, other approaches are possible that may allow the anti-inflammatory activity of PDE inhibitors to be realized. Accordingly, this Commentary endorses the view of Spina (2008), published in the current issue of the British Journal of Pharmacology, that the therapeutic utility of PDE 4 inhibitors to suppress inflammation still remains a viable concept...|$|E
