25|$|While {{the current}} {{benchmarks}} comparing Core Duo to Core 2 Duo processors show very little difference when running in 32 bit, the 64 bit edge {{has become more}} of an issue {{with the release of}} Mac OS X v10.6 (Snow Leopard), and now users can <b>dual</b> <b>boot</b> Windows 7 in full 64-bit mode.|$|E
25|$|The Edge was {{designed}} as a hybrid device, which would function as a high-end smartphone (with both Ubuntu Touch and Android), or—when used with a monitor, keyboard and mouse—be able to operate as a conventional desktop PC running Ubuntu. The Ubuntu Edge was also designed to support <b>dual</b> <b>boot,</b> and was to run along with Android.|$|E

5000|$|For example, on a PC with Windows XP {{installed}} on the hard drive, the user could set the boot order to the one given above, and then insert a Linux Live CD {{in order to try}} out Linux without having to install an operating system onto the hard drive. This is an example of <b>dual</b> <b>booting,</b> in which the user chooses which operating system to start after the computer has performed its Power-on self-test (POST). In this example of <b>dual</b> <b>booting,</b> the user chooses by inserting or removing the CD from the computer, but it is more common to choose which operating system to boot by selecting from a BIOS or UEFI boot menu, by using the computer keyboard; the boot menu is typically entered by pressing [...] or [...] keys during the POST.|$|R
25|$|Between 1987 and 1998, RISC OS was {{contained}} within every ARM-based Acorn computer model. These included the Acorn Archimedes range, Acorn's R line of computers (with RISC iX as a <b>dual</b> <b>boot</b> option), RiscPC, A7000 and also prototype models {{such as the}} Acorn NewsPad and Phoebe computer. A version of the OS (called NCOS) was also used in Oracle's Network Computer and compatible systems.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{emulation}} software such as DOSBox or Microsoft Virtual PC {{was required}} to run x86 software on the Macintosh. Such software could now enjoy much more success with near-native performance through virtualization, such as is currently being done by Parallels Desktop for Mac and VMware Fusion. For those customers wishing to achieve a more conventional environment, a <b>dual</b> <b>boot</b> solution is possible on an x86 Apple device using Boot Camp software (which includes Windows drivers for Mac hardware). Some third-party partitioning options can even provide triple, or even quadruple boot.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the release}} of Intel-based Macs, {{third-party}} platform virtualization software such as Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion, and VirtualBox began to emerge. These programs allow users to run Microsoft Windows or previously Windows-only software on Macs at near native speed. Apple also released Boot Camp and Mac-specific Windows drivers that help users to install Windows XP or Vista and natively <b>dual</b> <b>boot</b> between Mac OS X and Windows. Though not condoned by Apple, {{it is possible to}} run the Linux operating system using Boot camp or other virtualization workarounds. Unlike most PCs, however, Macs are unable to run many legacy PC operating systems. In particular, Intel-based Macs lack the A20 gate.|$|E
5000|$|In an openSUSE survey {{conducted}} in 2007, 69.5% {{of respondents said}} they <b>dual</b> <b>booted</b> a Microsoft Windows operating system in addition to a Linux operating system.

25|$|In 2008, Negroponte {{showed some}} {{doubt about the}} {{exclusive}} use of open-source software for the project, and made suggestions supporting a move towards adding Windows XP, which Microsoft {{was in the process}} of porting over to the XO hardware. Microsoft's Windows XP, however, is not seen by some as a sustainable operating system. Microsoft announced that they would sell them Windows XP for $3 per XO. It would be offered as an option on XO-1 laptops and possibly be able to <b>dual</b> <b>boot</b> alongside Linux. In response, Walter Bender, who was the former President of Software and Content for the OLPC project, left OLPC and founded Sugar Labs to continue development of the open source Sugar software which had been developed within OLPC. No significant deployments elected to purchase Windows licenses.|$|E
2500|$|OLPC's {{dedication}} to [...] "Free and open source" [...] was questioned with their May 15, 2008, announcement that large-scale purchasers would be offered {{the choice to}} add an extra cost, special version of the proprietary Windows XP OS developed by Microsoft alongside the regular, free and open Linux-based operating system with the SugarLabs [...] "Sugar OS" [...] GUI. Microsoft developed {{a modified version of}} Windows XP and announced in May 2008 that Windows XP will be available for an additional cost of 10 dollars per laptop. James Utzschneider, from Microsoft, said that initially only one operating system could be chosen. OLPC, however, said that future OLPC work would enable XO-1 laptops to <b>dual</b> <b>boot</b> either the free and open Linux/Sugar OS or the proprietary Microsoft Windows XP. Negroponte further said that [...] "OLPC will sell Linux-only and dual-boot, and will not sell Windows-only [...] ". OLPC released the first test firmware enabling XO-1 dual-boot on July 3, 2008. This option did not prove popular. As of 2011, a few pilots had received a few thousand total dual-boot machines, and the new ARM-based machines do not support Windows XP. No significant deployment purchased Windows licenses. Negroponte stated that the dispute had [...] "become a distraction" [...] for the project, and that its end goal was enabling children to learn, while constructionism and the open source ethos was more of a means to that end. Charles Kane concurred, stating that anything which detracted from the ultimate goal of widespread distribution and use was counterproductive.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the changes}} made to the {{partition}} table, this can cause problems when <b>dual</b> <b>booting</b> other operating systems on the same hard disk. It is possible to retain dual-boot compatibility, but can involve saving the partition table before enabling GoBack, and after enabling GoBack, re-writing the partition table back to the disk (after booting from a different device, such as a Live CD).|$|R
50|$|For {{operating}} {{systems such as}} Microsoft DOS or older version of Windows, each partition must start and end at a cylinder boundary. Only {{some of the most}} modern {{operating systems}} (Windows XP included) may disregard this rule, but doing so can still cause some compatibility issues, especially if the user wants to perform <b>dual</b> <b>booting</b> on the same drive. Microsoft does not follow this rule with internal disk partition tools since Windows Vista.|$|R
5000|$|This {{goal was}} met as Mandrake Linux gained a {{reputation}} as [...] "one of the easiest to install and user-friendly Linux distributions". At this time Internet Explorer held a dominant share of the web browser market, and Microsoft a near monopoly in operating systems. Web browsers for Linux were limited to Mozilla, followed {{by a variety of}} poorly performing Linux-specific browsers such as Konqueror or Galeon. Mandrake Linux earned praise as a Linux distribution that users could use all the time, without <b>dual</b> <b>booting</b> into Windows for compatibility with web sites or software unavailable under Linux. CNET called the user experience of Mandrake Linux 8.0 the most polished available at that time.|$|R

50|$|Splashtop OS (previously {{known as}} SplashTop) is a {{discontinued}} proprietary Linux distribution intended {{to serve as}} instant-on environment for personal computers. The original concept of Splashtop {{was that it was}} intended to be integrated on a read-only device and shipped with the hardware, rather than installed by the user. It did not prevent the installation of another operating system for <b>dual</b> <b>booting.</b> It was an instant-on commercial Linux distribution targeting PC motherboard vendors and other device manufacturers. The first OEM partner for the original Splashtop was ASUS, and their first joint product was called Express Gate. Later, other computer manufacturers also built Splashtop into certain models and re-branded it under different names. The aspects below detailing these events are retained verbatim from past articles, for historical reference.|$|R

50|$|Recent {{hardware}} models circumvents booting {{from other}} devices and allowing access {{by using a}} <b>dual</b> Master <b>Boot</b> Record (MBR) system whereby the MBR for the operating system and data files is all encrypted along with a special MBR which is required to boot the operating system. All data requests are intercepted in the SED firmware and will not allow decryption to take place unless the system has been booted from the special SED operating system which will then load the MBR of the encrypted part of the drive. This works by having a separate partition, hidden from view, which contains the proprietary operating system for the encryption management system. This means no other boot methods will allow access to the drive.|$|R
40|$|Evaluations and {{comparisons}} {{within this}} paper are for technical government purposes only {{and do not}} constitute an endorsement of any system by NASA or the U. S. Government. This paper describes work conducted at NASA Langley Research Center during an evaluation of PowerMac G 4 systems for FORTRAN-based scientific computing and computational fluid dynamics simulation. A PowerMac G 4 / 500 was configured for <b>dual</b> <b>booting</b> into Mac OS and Linux operating systems. Various developer tools were used to compile and run test codes on the G 4 for comparison benchmarking with platforms including Cray C- 90, Compaq Alpha, Pentium III, and Silicon Graphics (SGI) systems. Following general benchmarking, more specific AltiVec testing was conducted on the G 4 using FORTRAN and C, and approaches for implementing AltiVec in generic FORTRAN computations were developed. Results indicate that the PowerMac G 4 system {{has the potential to be}} an inexpensive high performance scientific computing platform. Much of that potential is currently unrealized, however, due to the limited amount of AltiVec support in FORTRAN. Without the parallel vector processing capabilities of AltiVec, the G 4 places near the end of the pack in performance tests using standard FORTRAN scientific codes. In limited cases where AltiVec acceleration was available and tested under FORTRAN, the G 4 showed a clear advantage with 4 - 7 X greater performance and a 5 - 8 X greater cost effectiveness than all other workstation systems evaluated. Examples presented in this report show that only minor re-coding would be necessary to implement AltiVec instructions if they were accessible to standard FORTRAN programming. Because of this, there appear to be many opportunities to advance scientific computing on the PowerMac G 4 platform...|$|R
5|$|The MacBook Pro {{comes with}} the {{successor}} to BIOS, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers, but provides backwards compatibility, allowing <b>dual</b> and triple <b>boot</b> configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software. Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported.
