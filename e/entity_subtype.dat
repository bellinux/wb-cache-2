40|$|As natural {{language}} understanding research advances towards deeper knowledge modeling, the tasks {{become more and more}} complex: we are interested in more nuanced word characteristics, more linguistic properties, deeper semantic and syntactic features. One such example, explored in this article, is the mention detection and recognition task in the Automatic Content Extraction project, with the goal of identifying named, nominal or pronominal references to real-world entities—mentions— and labeling them with three types of information: entity type, <b>entity</b> <b>subtype</b> and mention type. In this article, we investigate three methods of assigning these related tags and compare them on several data sets. A system based on the methods presented in this article participated and ranked very competitively in the ACE’ 04 evaluation. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Automatic {{extraction}} of semantic relationships between entity instances in an ontology {{is useful for}} attaching richer semantic metadata to documents. In this paper we propose an SVM based approach to hierarchical relation extraction, using features derived automatically {{from a number of}} GATE-based open-source language processing tools. In comparison to the previous works, we use several new features including part of speech tag, <b>entity</b> <b>subtype,</b> entity class, entity role, semantic representation of sentence and WordNet synonym set. The impact of the features on the performance is investigated, as is the impact of the relation classification hierarchy. The results show there is a trade-off among these factors for relation extraction and the features containing more information such as semantic ones can improve the performance of the ontological relation extraction task. ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Dysthymic {{disorder}} and other chronic depressive disorders {{have recently been}} merged in DSM- 5 into a 'persistent depressive disorder' category. As its introduction in DSM-III, the validity of dysthymic disorder has long been challenged, posing concerns regarding the validity of its successor - persistent depressive disorder. This review aims to present recent findings regarding the validity and utility of dysthymic disorder. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent studies raise questions regarding the validity of dysthymic disorder, namely, results indicating a significant overlap between dysthymic {{disorder and}} other mood and/or anxiety disorders, failure of such a diagnosis to predict illness outcome {{and the lack of}} any validation strategy identifying that it is a depressive <b>entity</b> or <b>subtype.</b> SUMMARY: Research findings indicate that dysthymic disorder is a heterogeneous diagnosis encompassing many different depressive (and anxiety or personality weighted) conditions, and without clear evidence of its validity as a diagnostic entity. As dysthymic disorder is a key component of DSM-defined persistent depressive disorder - the latter is at similar risk of providing a heterogeneous domain diagnosis, and thus limiting identification of specific causative factors and preferential treatment modality. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} use of Bayesian methods for {{analyzing}} gene expression data. We focus on methods which select groups of genes {{on the basis of}} their expression in RNA samples derived under different experimental conditions. We first describe Bayesian methods for estimating gene expression level from the intensity measurements obtained from analysis of microarray images. We next discuss the issues involved in assessing differential gene expression between two conditions at a time, including models for classifying the genes as differentially expressed or not. In the last two sections, we present models for grouping gene expression profiles over different experimental conditions, in order to find co-expressed genes, and multivariate models for finding gene signatures, i. e. for selecting a parsimonious group of genes that discriminate between <b>entities</b> such as <b>subtypes</b> of disease...|$|R

40|$|The {{extended}} {{entity relationship}} model (EERM) attempts to capture more semantic detail than is otherwise {{possible in the}} standard entity relationship model. In particular, the specialisation hierarchy, which is conceptually similar to the Object Oriented notion of inheritance, is a construct used in EERM for representing <b>entity</b> supertypes and <b>subtypes.</b> Grouping <b>entities</b> into various types based on the generic and unique characteristics they contain, affords the benefit of avoiding null values in the resulting table structures. The approach also allows relationships that are unique to a particular subtype to be modelled. However, it is the author’s experience that while many course texts provide examples of how these specialisation hierarchies can be logically modelled, little is said on {{how they can be}} implemented within relational databases.

40|$|Background: Depression is {{supposed}} to be associated with an unhealthy lifestyle including poor diet. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate differences in diet quality between patients with a clinical diagnosis of depression and population-based controls. Additionally, we aimed to examine effects of specific depression characteristics on diet by analyzing if diet quality varies between patients with distinct depression subtypes, and if depression severity is associated with diet quality. Methods: The study included 1660 participants from the BiDirect Study (n[*]=[*] 840 patients with depression, n[*]=[*] 820 population-based controls). The psychiatric assessment was based on clinical interviews and a combination of depression scales in order to provide the classification of depression subtypes and severity. Diet quality scores, reflecting the adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, were calculated on the basis of an 18 -item food frequency questionnaire. Using analysis of covariance, we calculated adjusted means of diet quality scores and tested differences between groups (adjusted for socio-demographic, lifestyle-, and health-related factors). Results: We found no differences in diet quality between controls and patients with depression if depression was considered as one entity. However, we did find differences between patients with distinct subtypes of depression. Patients with melancholic depression reported the highest diet quality scores, whereas patients with atypical depression reported the lowest scores. Depression severity was not associated with diet quality. Conclusions: Previous literature has commonly treated depression as a homogeneous <b>entity.</b> However, <b>subtypes</b> of depression may be associated with diet quality in different ways. Further studies are needed to enlighten the diet-depression relationship and the role of distinct depression subtypes. <br...|$|R
40|$|Acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL) is a subtype {{of acute}} myelocytic leukemia(AML) {{associated}} with unique {{features such as}} the presence of atypical promyelocytes and bleeding tendency due to disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC). In a retrospective study, we analyzed 96 cases of AML seen at our hospital between June, 1989 and December 1993. Thirteen cases of APL(14 %) were identified and their clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. The 86 cases of other types of AML served as controls. The distinct clinicopathologic features of APL as contrasted to other types of AML included younger age of patients, shorter duration of symptom before diagnosis, higher level of albumin at presentation, and a higher proportion of patients having coagulation abnormalities (75 vs. 25 %). Bone marrow cellularity was higher in APL when compared to other types of AML (100 vs. 90 %, P = 0. 013). Of 13 patients with APL, 4 died of bleeding/sepsis between days 2 to 4 after admission. Seven of 9 patients who received induction therapy achieved complete remission(CR). CR rate in APL was similar to other types of AML (78 vs. 64 %, P = 0. 743). Five of seven patients who achieved CR remain in continuous CR at 9 + to 42 + months. CR duration is significantly longer in APL when compared to other types of AML (P = 0. 029). In conclusion, this study showed that APL is a distinct <b>entity</b> among <b>subtypes</b> of AML with clinically significant bleeding tendency and rapidly fatal course if untreated. With appropriate antileukemic therapy, CR can be achieved in the majority of patients and the patients show a longer duration of CR when compared to other types of AML...|$|R

40|$|Merkel cell {{carcinoma}} (MCC) {{is a rare}} and a highly aggressive skin cancer of neuroendocrine origin that is frequently associated with a poor prognosis, a clonal integration of a polyomavirus (MCPyV), and a high propensy for recurrence and metastasis; its incidence increases with age, immunodeficiency and sun exposure [2, 4, 5, 6, 8]. Importantly, cytokeratin 20 (CK 20) is expressed in approximately 95 % of MCC cases, MCPyV in about 80 % of cases, and MCPyV is less common in CK 20 -negative MCC [6]. The disease progression could be evaluated by means of high numbers of mitoses, proliferation and survival of tumour cells as marked by Ki- 67 - and Bcl- 2 -staining, and infiltration of lymphatic vessels [12]. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis using random effects model revealed {{that there is an}} increased risk for second malignancies due to MCC (e. g. malignant melanoma) [9]. In fact, the origin of MCC is rather controversial, its pathogenesis (e. g. the molecular mechanisms underlying MCC development after MCPyV infection) remains unclear, and MCC seems to be a heterogenous <b>entity</b> with distinct <b>subtypes</b> [2, 3]. Indeed, while the presence of neurosecretory granules and expression of specific biomarkers (i. e. PGP 9. 5, chromogranin A and several neuropeptides) has suggested that MCCs originate from one of the neurocrest derivatives, most probably Merkel cells, zurHausen et al. hypothesized that they could originate from early B cells since they commonly express.

For example, many thousands of BC patients around the world have already been subjected to second- or third-line therapy with platinum agents, but the association between BRCA status and response to the treatment has not been systematically evaluated in these women. While potential biases of retrospective studies are widely acknowledged, it is frequently ignored that the use of archival collections may provide preliminary answers for long-standing questions within days instead of years. However, even elegantly-designed, small-sized, hypothesis-generating retrospective studies may require multicenter efforts and somewhat cumbersome logistics, that may explain the surprising lack of historical data on the platinum-based treatment of BC in BRCA 1 carriers. </p...|$|R
40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) comprises a heterogenous group of tumors. Traditionally, papillary RCC (pRCC) {{is associated with}} a favorable outcome compared to clear cell RCC (ccRCC), while other series report equivalent or worse prognosis. In this paper we comparatively evaluate outcome of pRCC versus ccRCC in two large multi-institutional databases (cohort study), including distribution of pRCC subtypes 1 and 2. Retrospective data of 1, 943 surgically treated pRCC patients from 17 European/ North American centers between 1984 - 2015 were compared to 5, 600 ccRCC patients from a database comprising 11 European/ North American centers (1984 - 2011). Median follow-up was 64. 6 months. Differences between pRCC, subtypes, and ccRCC were compared with t-tests, Chi^ 2 -tests, and exact Fisher tests. Cancer-specific mortality was analyzed with cumulative incidence curves and Cox cause-specific hazard models. The robustness of our results was examined with sensitivity analyses. We present that cancer-specific mortality rates and variables as stage, lymph node, and distant metastasis differ significantly between groups. Furthermore, we demonstrate that patients with non-metastatic pRCC had a significantly better cancer-specific mortality (HR 0. 76, p = 0. 007), when compared to ccRCC. Additionally, pRCC type 2 versus ccRCC exhibited no difference in cancer-specific mortality (HR 0. 9, p = 0. 722), whereas pRCC type 1 versus ccRCC displayed a risk of death reduced by 69 % (p = 0. 044). Taken together, outcome of pRCC versus ccRCC varies significantly in non-metastatic disease. Furthermore, pRCC type 2 exhibited no difference in cancer-specific mortality, whereas pRCC type 1 displayed a significantly reduced risk of death. Consequently, there is urgent need to respect histopathological <b>entities</b> and their <b>subtypes,</b> when assigning follow-up or targeted therapy to RCC patients...|$|R
