500|$|For his part, Chadwick, {{who had not}} yet {{read the}} manuscript, could not fathom why the Americans wanted to publish such a document. When he did read it, he became quite alarmed. His {{concerns}} were addressed in a meeting with Groves and Conant, and he accepted their point of view.

500|$|After Knight had {{presented}} the prosecution evidence the court heard testimonies on the personalities and character flaws of the accused, from their relatives and acquaintances. [...] Details {{of their lives}} were revealed by one of Lim's [...] "holy wives". [...] Private medical practitioners Dr. Yeo Peng Ngee and Dr. Ang Yiau Hua admitted that they were Lim's sources for drugs, and had provided the trio sleeping pills and sedatives without question on each consultation. [...] The police and forensics teams gave their accounts of their investigations; Inspector Suppiah, the investigating officer-in-charge, read out the statements the defendants had made during their remand. [...] In these statements Lim stated that he had killed for revenge, {{and that he had}} sodomised Ng. [...] The accused had also confirmed in their statements that each was an active participant in the murders. [...] There were many contradictions among these statements and the confessions made in court by the accused, but Judge Sinnathuray declared that despite the conflicting evidence, [...] "the <b>essential</b> <b>facts</b> of this case are not in dispute". [...] Lim's involvement in the crimes was further evidenced by a witness who vouched that just after midnight on 7February 1981, at the ground floor of Block 12, he saw Lim and a woman walk past him carrying a dark-skinned boy.|$|E

40|$|Belle Époque Belgium {{recorded}} {{an unprecedented}} trade boom. Exploiting a new granular trade dataset, {{we find that}} the number of products delivered abroad and destinations serviced more than doubled in less than 40 years. To explain this remarkable achievement, we study the relationship between trade costs and the intensive and extensive margins of trade. The establishment of a foreign diplomatic network that lowered beachhead costs and enabled the entry of new products was an <b>essential</b> <b>fact</b> of the trade boom. Interestingly, the expansion in trade in certain sectors did not translate into faster productivity growth. We offer some explanations. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

60|$|Taking {{this as a}} {{very broad}} and general {{statement}} of the <b>essential</b> <b>facts</b> of the case, the raising of the stone is intelligible enough, as {{a case of the}} communication of motion from one body to another.

To all appearance, there is nothing either pushing or pulling it towards the earth, or the earth towards it; and yet it is quite certain that the stone tends to move towards the earth and the earth towards the stone, in the way defined by the law of gravitation.|$|E

The [...] "Commissioner" [...] deals with this matter in paragraph No. 4 of his letter; and I observe, with no little satisfaction, that he does not venture to controvert any one of the statements of my witnesses. He tacitly admits that the author of [...] "The New Papacy" [...] was a person [...] "greatly esteemed in Toronto," [...] and that he held [...] "a high position in the army"; further, that the Canadian [...] "Commissioner" [...] thought it worth while to pay the printer's bill, in order that the copies already printed off might be destroyed and the pamphlet effectually suppressed.

40|$|We form a {{generating}} {{series of}} regularized volumes of intersections of special cycles on a non-compact unitary Shimura variety with a fixed base change cycle. We {{show that it}} is a Hilbert modular form by identifying it with a theta integral, which we show converges even though the parameters lie outside the classical convergence range of Weil. By applying the regularized Siegel-Weil formulas of Ichino and Gan-Qiu-Takeda, we show the modular form is the restriction of a hermitian modular form of degree n related to Siegel Eisenstein series on U(n,n). An <b>essential</b> <b>fact</b> used is a computation showing the Kudla-Millson Schwartz function vanishes under the Ikeda map. Comment: 27 page...|$|R
50|$|The <b>essential</b> <b>fact</b> in all advance-fee fraud {{operations}} is the promised money {{transfer to the}} victim never happens, because the money does not exist. The perpetrators rely on the fact that, {{by the time the}} victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have sent thousands of dollars of their own money, and sometimes thousands more that has been borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire transfer. The scammer disappears, and the victim is left on the hook for the money sent to the scammer.|$|R
