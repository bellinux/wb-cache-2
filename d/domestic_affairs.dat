5|$|Although modern {{scholars}} know of some surviving {{cases where}} Han law dealt with commerce and <b>domestic</b> <b>affairs,</b> the spheres of trade (outside the monopolies) {{and the family}} were still largely governed by age-old social customs.

50|$|At {{the first}} UN {{gathering}} in 1946, South Africa {{was placed on}} the agenda. The primary subject in question was the handling of South African Indians, a great cause of divergence between South Africa and India.

The government attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations with other countries in the region.

5|$|The press did {{not cover}} the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's {{dispatch}} to Eustis to {{mean he was}} defeated. By December, as most major American papers carried stories on the battle, public outrage over the Shawnee attack grew. At a time of high tensions with the United Kingdom, many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. In response, Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American <b>domestic</b> <b>affairs.</b> A few months later, on June 18, 1812, the U.S. government declared war against United Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, Harrison left Vincennes to seek a military appointment.|$|E

During this term he vetoed {{a bill that would}} have disbanded the state police, which were charged with the law's enforcement, and also vetoed a bill replacing prohibition with a licensing scheme. In the 1874 election, anti-prohibition Republicans joined with Democrats to elect William Gaston over Talbot by a narrow margin. The election marked a watershed in post-Civil War Massachusetts, since it was the first victory for a Democrat in that period, and exposed the state Republican Party's fractures on <b>domestic</b> <b>affairs</b> like prohibition. Talbot refused to run in 1875.|$|E

5|$|Atrash {{was born}} 3 February 1925 in the Druze {{community}} of al-Qurayya in Jabal al-Druze (Jabal al-Arab), {{months before the}} Great Syrian Revolt, which was launched and led by his father Sultan al-Atrash. At the time, the Jabal al-Druze area constituted an autonomous zone (existing between 1922 and 1936) within the French Mandate of Syria (established in 1920). Tensions between the Druze and the French authorities stemmed {{from a number of}} reasons, particularly what the local Druze leaders saw as French encroachment into their <b>domestic</b> <b>affairs</b> and self-governance. The revolt began in the summer of 1925 and had soon spread throughout Syria, ending with the military defeat of Syrian rebels in 1927 and the self-imposed exile of Sultan to Transjordan after the Mandatory authorities issued a warrant for his arrest. He returned in 1937 after being pardoned by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|His government's {{treatment}} of non-Arab Libyans has also {{came in for}} criticism from human rights activists, with native Berbers, Italians, Jews, refugees, and foreign workers all facing persecution in Gaddafist Libya.

According to journalist Annick Cojean and psychologist Seham Sergewa, Gaddafi and senior officials raped and imprisoned hundreds or thousands of young women and reportedly raped several of his female bodyguards. Gaddafi's actions in promoting foreign militant groups, although regarded by him as a justifiable support for national liberation movements, was seen by the United States as interference in the <b>domestic</b> <b>affairs</b> of other nations and active support for international terrorism.|$|E
5|$|In Bulgaria, the {{two decades}} {{following}} the end of the rebellion marked the lowest point of decline of the Second Empire. The reigns of George Terter I (r. 1280–1292) and his successor Smilets (r. 1292–1298) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state's <b>domestic</b> <b>affairs</b> and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates. Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in no position to regain these regions. The fortunes of the country changed for the better under George Terter I's son, Theordore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1321), when Bulgaria acquired Bessarabia from the Mongols and reconquered Northern Thrace from the Byzantines, bringing stability and prosperity.|$|E

50|$|The {{creation}} of the hospital was not without controversy at the time, and the nature, characteristics and effects of the British in particular, and maternity hospitals in general, {{continue to be a}} subject of study. Prior to the hospital's creation, childbirth was for the most-part a <b>domestic</b> <b>affair</b> relying on the good offices of largely untrained (if well-experienced) midwives; only the upper echelons of society tended to be served by male physicians. The British Lying-In Hospital offered — to married women only — a largely female-only space removed from the home in which childbirth was supervised almost exclusively by female midwives under the supervision of female matrons. The intervention of male physicians was a rare event.|$|R

Washington also lays out the greatest threats he sees to the Union, warning Americans to: distrust the passions of political factionalism, be wary of foreign interference in the nation's <b>domestic</b> <b>affairs,</b> and avoid an entangling foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{turned his}} focus to <b>domestic</b> <b>affairs</b> after the war. Empress Joséphine had still not {{given birth to}} a child from Napoleon, who became worried about the future of his empire {{following}} his death. Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Joséphine in January 1810 and started looking for a new wife. Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the Archduchess Marie Louise, who was 18 years old at the time. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of King of Rome. His son never actually ruled the empire, but historians still refer to him as Napoleon II.|$|E

It has been the bloodiest conflict in the nation‟s history, claiming the lives of more than 620, 000 soldiers and an unknown number of civilians. The Civil War is mostly known as a <b>domestic</b> <b>affair</b> of the United States, which is true in the sense that no foreign power intervened in the conflict; however, almost all great powers closely followed the developments, since European powers had trouble expanding their spheres of interest in the Americas.
