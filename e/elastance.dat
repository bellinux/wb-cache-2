5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, <b>elastance</b> (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E

25|$|A {{ventilator}} assists breathing {{using either}} pressure control or volume control {{based on the}} equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact {{is known as the}} equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: Pressure = (<b>Elastance</b> × Volume) + (Resistance × Flow)In this equation, pressure, volume, and flow are all continuous functions of time. Pressure is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). <b>Elastance</b> (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in <b>elastance</b> and resistance.Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a constant value or it is proportional to the patient’s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and flow change with changes in <b>elastance</b> and resistance.Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (pressure, volume, or flow) are preset. In this case only the inspiratory and expiratory times are preset.|$|E

40|$|Considering {{the limited}} number of {{available}} lung donors, lung bioengineering using whole lung scaffolds has been proposed as an alternative approach to obtain lungs suitable for transplantation. However, some decellularization protocols can cause alterations on the structure, composition, or mechanical properties of the lung extracellular matrix. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the acellular lung mechanical properties when using two different routes through the trachea and pulmonary artery for the decellularization process. This study was performed by using the lungs excised from 30 healthy male C 57 BL/ 6 mice, which were divided into 3 groups: tracheal decellularization (TDG), perfusion decellularization (PDG), and control groups (CG). Both decellularized groups were subjected to decellularization protocol with a solution of 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate. The behaviour of mechanical properties of the acellular lungs was measured after decellularization process.

40|$|The {{pulmonary}} circulation is a high-flow and low-pressure circuit. The functional {{state of the}} {{pulmonary circulation}} is defined by pulmonary vascular pressure-flow relationships conforming to distensible vessel models with a correction for hematocrit. The product of pulmonary arterial compliance and resistance is constant, but with a slight decrease {{as a result of}} increased pulsatile hydraulic load in the presence of increased venous pressure or proximal pulmonary arterial obstruction. An increase in left atrial pressure is transmitted upstream with a ratio ≥ 1 for mean pulmonary artery pressure and ≤ 1 the diastolic pulmonary pressure. Therefore, the diastolic pressure gradient is more appropriate than the transpulmonary pressure gradient to identify pulmonary vascular disease in left heart conditions. Exercise is associated with a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and an increase in pulmonary arterial compliance.

40|$|The hemodynamic {{evaluation}} of the pulmonary circulation normally includes the measurements of mean pulmonary artery pressure and a calculation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The definition of PVR can be improved by the measurements of pulmonary vascular pressures at several levels of flow to derive a pressure-flow line, and the site of PVR can be identified by the analysis of pulmonary artery pressure decay curves after balloon occlusion. An analysis of the morphology of pulmonary artery pressure and flow waves informs about right ventricular (RV) hydraulic load. As pulmonary hypertension is clinically a right heart failure syndrome, {{it is important to}} measure the coupling of RV to pulmonary arterial function. This can be done using a single beat method with sampling and synchronization of instantaneous pulmonary artery flow and RV pressure to calculate a ratio of end-systolic to arterial <b>elastances.</b> The optimal value of this ratio is depressed in minimally symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, indicating pending right heart failure.

To do so, we had to rely on variables such as strain, stress, and mechanical energy instead of tidal volume/kilogram ideal body weight and airway pressures (plateau and PEEP). Strain measures the actual distortion of the lung: for the same tidal volume/kilogram, the strain may be completely different {{depending on the size of}} the “baby lung” [18, 19]. Likewise, the same airway pressure may result in widely differing transpulmonary pressures (stress), depending on the relationship between lung and chest wall <b>elastances</b> [20]. The initial trigger of stress and strain, however, is the force applied to the extracellular matrix times its displacement, which equals the product of pressure times delta-volume (P[*]×[*]dV). The cyclic energy loads applied at a given frequency (power) trigger the VILI, which may be seen in this context as a sort of “fatigue” of the extracellular matrix, similar to material “fatigue” [21 – 24]. We believe that the energy/power concept, which encompasses stress, strain, frequency, and flow rate, explains the different effects of tidal volume (dynamic), PEEP (static), and the physical thresholds conditioning the appearance of VILI.|$|R
