40|$|This article revisits {{the debate}} over Barker and Cox’s (2011) use of Gramsci’s {{distinction}} between traditional and organic intellectuals to contrast academic and activist modes of theorizing about social movements. Often misread as an attack on personal choices in career and writing, the distinction aimed to highlight the <b>different</b> <b>purposes,</b> <b>audiences,</b> and social relationships entailed by these different forms of theorizing. Discourses which take ‘scholarship’ as their starting point position ‘activist’ as a personal choice within an institutional field, and substitute this moral commitment for a political assessment of its effects. By contrast, few academics have undergone the political learning curve represented by social movements. This may explain the widespread persistence – beyond any intellectual or empirical credibility – of a faith in ‘critical scholarship’ isolated from agency, an orientation to policy makers and mainstream media as primary audiences or an unquestioned commitment to existing institutional frameworks as pathways to substantial social change. Drawing on over three decades of movement participation and two of academic work, this article explores two processes of activist training within the academy. It also explores the politics of different experiences of theoretical publishing for social movements audiences. This discussion focuses on {{the control of the}} “means of mental production” (Marx, 1965), and the politics of distribution. The conclusion explores the broader implications of these experiences for the relationship between movements and research...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the efficacy of using e-mail {{in the form of}} a class mailing list to help ESL students practice and develop academic writing skills beyond the spatial and time limits of a writing classroom. In this study, e-mail writing tasks of <b>different</b> <b>purposes,</b> <b>audiences</b> and task structures were integrated into a process-oriented freshman ESL writing class. The subjects of this study were 22 ESL students in a freshman composition course. In an ex post facto design (Hatch & Lazaraton, 1991), this study involved within-subject repeated measures of data collected from different e-mail writing tasks over the course of a semester. Data analysis included (1) computerized text analysis focusing on the linguistic and textual features of written discourses at the levels of syntactic complexity, lexical richness, textual cohesion and grammatical accuracy; (2) holistic and analytical assessments by ESL raters focusing on the overall rhetorical features and quality of writing. The results indicated that there were syntactic, lexical, textual and grammatical differences in ESL students' writing performance on e-mail writing tasks of different rhetorical purposes, and there was also variation between e-mail tasks involving an interactive audience and those involving an non-interactive audience, and between structured versus non-structured e-mail tasks. In particular, in e-mail tasks in which an interactive audience was present, students tended to produce texts that were linguistically more complex. Besides, students wrote with a higher level of syntactic and lexical complexity in the non-structured e-mail tasks than in the structured ones, indicating more sophisticated use of language when the student were given more freedom and control of the learning activities. The results also showed obvious tradeoff effects between linguistic complexity and accuracy, i. e. while students produced texts that were linguistically more complex, there was less attention to grammatical accuracy. Furthermore, the results suggested that motivation, attitude, and anxiety had some significant contributions to the variation in ESL students' writing performance while they composed in an electronic mode...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the arrival}} of Web 2. 0 {{technologies}} use of ePortfolios in higher education has dramatically increased in all disciplines. These portfolios are used {{to encourage students to}} collate and curate their learning experiences. EPortfolios are sometimes used in assessment processes, and this is challenging as views are mixed as to how a fluid and dynamic portfolio of learning can be effectively assessed. Issues such as access, security, privacy and ownership are further complicating the use of portfolios. There is some use of ePortfolios in work integrated education, and while some practitioners are convinced of the benefits for students, host organisations and academic institutions, other point to significant challenges in implementation and creating positive student learning experiences. This paper is a summary of the writing and emerging issues from implementation of ePortfolios in work integrated learning. EPortfolios offer a range of advantages over traditional methods of collation and curation of learning experiences and development. Within an ePortfolio students have the opportunity to collate artifacts, reflect on their practice and plan their professional development.

40|$|Technical {{advances}} in landscape visualization have tended to, and still do, outstrip {{the understanding of}} how best to use them in practical planning contexts. This paper draws upon recent literature and experience gained during a number of projects to address three key questions regarding the most effective use of 3 D landscape visualizations for communication purposes. In essence these are “when?” (to use them), “what?” (to include) and “how?” (to display them). Three main visualization options (rendered still images, animations and real-time models) are compared and particular constraints and strengths are discussed. In addition, an evaluation is made of {{the ability of the}} information presented in landscape visualizations to meet criteria of credibility, salience and legitimacy when communicating with stakeholders. Closing guidance is given on the use of visualizations in landscape planning and suggestions regarding future research needs are made. These focus on the need for applications of 3 D visualization techniques to be more systematically evaluated, ideally as part of landscape planning exercises where the benefits of particular approaches for <b>different</b> <b>purposes</b> and <b>audiences</b> are examined across all stages of the decision-making process...|$|R

Our study is motivated by examination of performance characteristics of four simulators: JavaSim, ns, SSFNet-Java, and SSFNet-C++. Our approach considers “utility functions ” that a user might develop to quantify his view of the speed/memory/functionality tradeoffs. We consider general properties such functions might have, and explore how these properties lead utility to favor one simulator over another. Finally, we apply utility theory to the four simulators that motivated the study, and observe that a balance of speed and model size capability tends to maximize performance. ...|$|R

40|$|The texts (and talk) of {{engineers}} take different forms. In this essay, I present and critique several texts written for <b>different</b> <b>purposes</b> and <b>audiences</b> but all intended {{to convey to}} the reader the technical details of whatever they are about - whether a textbook passage describing the fundamental behavior of an electrical component, a journal article about a mathematical technique intended for use in design optimization, a memo to co-work- ers within a firm about a heat transfer analysis of a remotely sited building, or a general introduction {{to the field of}} ‘ergonomics’. My aim is to explore how the ways in which engineers describe and document their problems and projects frame what they accept, display and profess as useful knowledge. In this I am particu- larly interested in how engineers envision the 'users' of, or participants in, their productions. Like science, engineering texts are written as if they were timeless and untainted by socio-cultural features. A technical treatise is not devoid of metaphor or creative rendering of events; there is always a narrative within which worldly data and instrumental logic is embedded - but it is a story in which the passive voice prevails, history is irrelevant, and the human actor or agent is painted in quantitative parameters fitting the occasion. Whether this rhetoric can be sustained in the face of challenges to traditional ways of doing engineering is an open question...|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{heritage}} {{is a modern}} technological application that aims to transfer the experience of historic buildings, urban spaces and cities into an engaging experience of real-life quality for the ordinary people. Computer-simulated environments can simulate physical presence in places {{in the real world}} offering digital display of lost heritage that conveys inherent values in the education process for students in both pre-university as well as graduate education. For architecture and archaeological students, in particular, it virtually transfers them to another world where they engage with architectonics and quality of architecture. For conservators, historians and archaeologists, it helps develop a rich library and digital archive of details, information and data necessary in restoring historical sites, as well as heritage preservation where the 3 D virtual models contain accurate data and help for restoration. This paper reports on recently completed research project on the development of virtual heritage platforms for medieval culture.

40|$|The project {{presented}} here started approximately {{four years ago}} and concerns the main temple of Olympia, a UNESCO world heritage site, which is visited by thousands of tourists nearly every day. Although Olympia is familiar to everybody and its monuments have been well-researched for more than a century, there are still many puzzles related to its history and remains. A new interpretation of the east pediment of the temple and the ensuing debate caused the reopening of the issue of the reconstruction. The historical setting of the temple-building was also reconsidered and led to a detailed study and re-construction of the architecture as well. All these investigations made extensive use of digital technologies and are {{presented here}} as a case study for applying virtual reality to old problems of classical archaeology. The digitization of the extant fragments and a three-year project enabled the produc-tion of a virtual 3 D reconstruction of the east pediment of the classical temple of Zeus. In addition, the Doric temple itself as well as the famous cult statue made by Pheidias were also reconstructed virtually, making thus the visualization of the long and complicated history of the entire monument possible. The model is highly flexible and can thus be adapted to illustrate and to test different scholarly hypotheses concerning some details, e. g. the arrangement of the central group of the east pediment or the effects of different lighting conditions. It also allows the non-specialist user to manipulate the individual pieces of sculpture, to familiarize him- or herself with their original appearance and position on the building and finally to observe minor details and {{to learn more about the}} problems involved in reconstructing ancient works of art.

40|$|Damian Finnegan (damian. finnegan@mah. se) Asko Kauppinen (asko. kauppinen@mah. se) Anna Wärnsby (anna. warnsby@mah. se) On the Importance of Teaching Academic Writing to Teacher Trainees Many EFL {{learners}} {{struggle with}} issues pertaining to grammar, style and idiomaticity, and, traditionally, language teachers {{spend a lot}} of time addressing these mechanical errors (Zamel 1985). This corrective practice seems to shape learner and teacher expectations of the type of feedback that is most effective or useful to learners (Hedgcock and Lefkowitz 1996). In the context of teaching academic writing, this may easily pose a problem for allocating teacher resources away from teaching writing as a process to taking care of the learner language issues. In the new Swedish school curriculum for English, however, the ability to write for <b>different</b> <b>purposes</b> and <b>audiences</b> and the familiarity with different text types is made prominent (Lgr 11). Therefore, the teachers’ ability to reflect on the writing process as such and not only on the mechanical learner errors is crucial for the pupils’ achievement of the learning outcomes specified in the curriculum. At Malmö University, we facilitated systematic instruction to teacher trainees, amongst others, through the creation of courses in academic writing in English across the curriculum (WAC). The design of our courses is explicitly based on the general model of information processing, which assumes that “complex behavior builds on simple processes” (McLaughlin and Heredia, 1996, p. 213). The focus of all learning activities is on acquisition of procedural knowledge geared towards comprehension and production (see Anderson 1983, 2009). Specifically, we gear our courses to equip teacher trainees with tools that can later aid them in their reflection on elements of the writing process other than those that are traditionally addressed in the language classroom. In this paper, we address particularly the increased ability in teacher trainees to reflect upon their own and their peers’ writing. We look at their ability to identify core elements of the writing process, for example, <b>purpose,</b> <b>audience,</b> genre, structure, critical thinking, and meta-cognitive analysis. These data have been compiled in the form of self-reflective papers produced by teacher trainees upon completion of our course. References Anderson, J. R. 2009.
