40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to develop a thermal control system that can operate under the extreme thermal environments found on the lunar surface. While these proposed <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems</b> use different methods to reject heat, each system contains a similar component, a thermal radiator system. These studies have always considered pristine thermal control system components and have overlooked the possible deleterious effects of lunar dust contamination. Since lunar dust has a high emissivity and absorptivity (greater than 0. 9) and is opaque, dust accumulation on a surface should radically alter its optical properties and therefore alter its thermal response compared to ideal conditions. In addition, the non-specular nature of the dust particles will alter the performance of systems that employ specular surfaces to enhance <b>heat</b> <b>rejection.</b> To date, few studies have examined the effect of dust deposition on the normal control system components. These studies only focused on a single <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> or photovoltaic <b>system.</b> These studies did show that lunar dust accumulations alter the optical properties of any lunar base hardware, which in turn affects component temperatures, and <b>heat</b> <b>rejection.</b> Therefore, a new study was conducted to determine the effect of lunar dust contamination on <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems.</b> For this study, a previously developed dust deposition model was incorporated into the Thermal Synthesizer System (TSS) model. This modeling scheme incorporates the original method of predicting dust accumulation due to vehicle landings by assuming that the thin dust layer can be treated as a semitransparent surface slightly above and in thermal contact with the pristine surface. The results of this study showed that even small amounts of dust deposits can radically alter the performance of the <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems.</b> Furthermore. this study indicates that <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems</b> be either located far from any landing sites or be protected from dust producing mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|For short durations, {{phase change}} based <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems</b> {{are a very}} {{effective}} way of removing heat from spacecraft. Future NASA vehicles, such as the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), will require non-radiative <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems</b> during at least {{a portion of the}} planned mission, just as their predecessors have. While existing technologies are available to modify, such as Apollo era sublimators, or the Space Shuttle Flash Evaporator System (FES), several new technologies are under development or investigation to progress beyond these existing <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems.</b> Examples include the Multi-Fluid Evaporator developed by Hamilton Sundstrand, improvements upon the Contaminant Insensitive Sublimator originally developed for the X- 38 program, and a Compact Flash Evaporator System (CFES).

The new developments are targeted at increasing operating life, expanding the environments in which the system can operate, improving the mass and volume characteristics, or some combination of these or other improvements. This paper captures the process and results of a preliminary trade study performed at Johnson Space Center to compare the various existing and proposed phase change based <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems</b> for the CEV. Because the new systems are still in development, and the information on existing systems is extrapolation, this trade study is not meant to suggest a final decision for future vehicles.

40|$|Polymer matrix {{composites}} {{offer the}} promise of reducing the mass and increasing the performance of future <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems.</b> With lifetimes for <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems</b> reaching {{a decade or more}} in a micrometeoroid environment, use of multiple heat pipes for fault tolerant design is compelling. The combination of polymer matrix composites and heat pipes is of particular interest for <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>systems</b> operating on the lunar surface. A technology development effort is under way to study the performance of two radiator demonstration units manufactured with different polymer matrix composite face sheet resin and bonding adhesives, along with different titanium-water heat pipe designs. Common to the two radiator demonstration units is the use of high thermal conductivity fibers in the face sheets and high thermal conductivity graphite saddles within a light weight aluminum honeycomb core. Testing of the radiator demonstration units included thermal vacuum exposure and thermal vacuum exposure with a simulated heat pipe failure. Steady state performance data were obtained at different operating temperatures to identify heat transfer and thermal resistance characteristics. Heat pipe failure was simulated by removing the input power from an individual heat pipe in order to identify the diminished performance characteristics of the entire panel after a micrometeoroid strike. Freeze-thaw performance was also of interest. This paper presents a summary of the two radiator demonstration units manufactured to support this technology development effort along with the thermal performance characteristics obtained to date.

Five propylene LHPs collect and transport the instrument waste heat to the near room temperature nadir viewing radiators. During {{the early months of}} the mission, ice contamination of the cryogenic surfaces including the focal planes led to increased cryocooler loads and the need for periodic decontamination cycles. Focal plane decontamination cycles require power cycling both cryocoolers which also requires the two cryocooler LHPs to turn off and on during each cycle. To date, the cryocooler LHPs have undergone 24 start-ups in orbit successfully. This paper reports on the TES cryocooler loop heat pipe based <b>heat</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>system</b> performance. After a brief overview of the instrument thermal design, the paper presents detailed data on the highly successful space operation of the loop heat pipes since instrument turn-on in 2004.

At the lunar equator and during the lunar midday, an unshaded radiator absorbs more heat than it rejects. This problem can be solved by using a shading device to reduce radiation incident on the radiator.
