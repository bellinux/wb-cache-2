500|$|While {{molten rock}} comes {{closer to the}} surface it would most likely cause more fragmentation, {{triggering}} an explosive eruption that could produce an eruption column with an elevation of [...] and may be sustained for 12hours. A well-documented explosive eruption in the Garibaldi Belt with such force is the eruption of Mount Meager 2,350years ago, which deposed ash as far east as Alberta. This would endanger air traffic {{and would have to}} take another route away from the eruptive zone. Every airport buried under pyroclastic fall would be out of service, including those in Vancouver, Victoria, Kamloops, Prince George and Seattle. The tephra would destroy power transmission lines, satellite dishes, computers and other equipment that operates on electricity. Therefore, telephones, radios and cell phones would be disconnected. Structures not built for holding heavy material would likely demolish {{under the weight of the}} tephra. Ash from the eruption plume would subside above the vent area to create pyroclastic flows and would travel east and west down the nearby Cheakamus and Squamish river valleys. These would likely have significant impacts on salmon in the associated rivers and would cause considerable melting of glacial ice to produce debris flows that may extend into Daisy Lake and Squamish to cause significant damage. The eruption column would then travel eastward and <b>extract</b> <b>air</b> travel throughout Canada from Alberta to Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E

50|$|In heating, {{ventilation}} and air-conditioning systems, HVAC, recuperators {{are commonly}} used to re-use waste heat from exhaust air normally expelled to atmosphere. Devices typically comprises a series of parallel plates of aluminium, plastic, stainless steel, or synthetic fiber, alternate pairs of which are enclosed on two sides to form twin sets of ducts {{at right angles to}} each other, and which contain the supply and <b>extract</b> <b>air</b> streams. In this manner heat from the exhaust air stream is transferred through the separating plates, and into the supply air stream. Manufacturers claim gross efficiencies of up to 80% depending upon the specification of the unit.|$|E
50|$|The device {{consists}} of a battery of multi-row finned heat pipe tubes located within both the supply and exhaust air streams. Within the exhaust air side of the heat pipe, the refrigerant evaporates, taking its heat from the <b>extract</b> <b>air.</b> The refrigerant vapour moves towards the cooler end of the tube, within the supply air side of the device, where it condenses and gives up its heat. The condensed refrigerant returns {{by a combination of}} gravity and capillary action in the wick. Thus heat is transferred from the exhaust air stream through the tube wall to the refrigerant, and then from the refrigerant through the tube wall to the supply air stream.|$|E
50|$|The mixing plenum {{normally}} combines two air streams, {{and includes}} for {{three sets of}} dampers: one for the fresh air, one for the exhaust air, and a mixing damper between the two air streams. The mix of fresh air and recirculated air can thus be adjusted to suit {{the needs of the}} building's occupants. Most systems will use motorized dampers to control the air mixing, and controlled by the building management system (BMS), or controls system. Typically as the fresh air and exhaust air dampers are driven from 0% open to 100% open, the mixing damper will in turn be driven from 100% open to 0% open, so as to always ensure a constant volume of supply and <b>extract</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E

It is proposed to have three ventilation buildings sited near the western end, mid-length and eastern end of the Bypass to achieve the three objectives of supplying fresh <b>air,</b> <b>extracting</b> vitiated <b>air</b> and removing smoke during fire.|$|R

50|$|In {{building}} services engineering and HVAC, a bell mouth is a tapered expanding or reducing {{opening in the}} end of a ventilation duct, so named because the taper can resemble that of a bell shape. They are primarily designed and used for return air or <b>extract</b> <b>air</b> purposes within building ventilation systems, more commonly located within ceiling voids or other similar plenum. The bellmouth cross sectional area is normally double that of the duct area, so that the air velocity entering the bellmouth is low (to reduce noise, turbulence and pressure drop), and gradually increases to the normal design velocity of the ductwork. The angle of the bellmouth is normally tapered at about 45° as a balance between keeping the bellmouth short without causing too much turbulence or excessive pressure drop. Bell mouths can be manufactured to suit either circular or rectangular ductwork sections.|$|E
5000|$|From the front, the Quadrifoglio distinguishes {{itself from}} the rest of the range by a {{specific}} front bumper—with a carbon fibre splitter and enlarged air intakes for the twin intercoolers and for the brakes—and by a bonnet pierced by two cooling outlets for the engine bay.

At the rear a low-profile carbon fibre spoiler is applied to the boot lid, and a rear diffuser makes up the lower half of the bumper, flanked by quadruple exhaust tips. Working in conjunction with the faired-in underside, the diffuser is fully functional in generating downforce—as at the front is the [...] "Active Aero Splitter", which can vary its angle of attack by 10°, moved by electric motors. Alfa Romeo claims these active aero features to be firsts in the Giulia's market segment and are able to generate up to 100 kg of downforce at 300 km/h.

50|$|Warm, {{moist air}} is {{drawn into the}} unit at A in the diagram above. This air passes into a {{crossflow}} plate heat exchanger (B) where a substantial proportion of the sensible heat is transferred to a cool supply air stream. This process brings the extracted air close to saturation. The air then passes to the plenum chamber of the extract fan (C) where a portion of it may be rejected to outside. The amount that is rejected can be varied and is determined either by legislation on fresh air requirements, or by the requirement to maintain a fresh, odour free environment. The balance of the air then passes into the evaporator coil of the heat pump where it is cooled and the moisture is condensed. This process yields substantial amounts of latent energy to the refrigeration circuit. Fresh air is then introduced to replace the amount that was extracted and the mix is discharged by the supply fan (G) to the crossflow plate exchanger (B) where it is heated by the <b>extract</b> <b>air</b> from the pool. This pre-warmed air then passes through the heat pump condenser (F) where it is heated by the latent energy removed during the condensation process {{as well as the}} energy input to the compressor.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Jim Hall of Chaparral first {{introduced}} [...] "ground effect" [...] downforce to auto racing. In the mid 1970s, Lotus engineers {{found out that}} the entire car could be made to act like a giant wing by the creation of an airfoil surface on its underside which would cause air moving relative to the car to push it to the road. Applying another idea of Jim Hall's from his Chaparral 2J sports racer, Gordon Murray designed the Brabham BT46B, which used a separately-powered fan system to <b>extract</b> <b>air</b> from the skirted area under the car, creating enormous downforce. After technical challenges from other teams, it was withdrawn after a single race. Rule changes then followed to limit the benefits of 'ground effects' - firstly a ban on the skirts used to contain the low pressure area, later a requirement for a 'stepped floor'.Despite the full-sized wind tunnels and vast computing power used by the aerodynamic departments of most teams, the fundamental principles of Formula One aerodynamics still apply: to create the maximum amount of downforce for the minimal amount of drag. The primary wings mounted front and rear are fitted with different profiles depending on the downforce requirements of a particular track. Tight, slow circuits like Monaco require very aggressive wing profiles - you will see that cars run two separate 'blades' of 'elements' on the rear wings (two is the maximum permitted). In contrast, high-speed circuits like Monza see the cars stripped of as much wing as possible, to reduce drag and increase speed on the long straights.|$|E
