Thirty-three years later the mission would unknowingly witness the origin of the California citrus {{industry}} with the planting of the region's first significant orchard, though the commercial potential of citrus would not be realized until 1841. Several small carloads of California crops were shipped eastward via the new transcontinental route almost immediately after its completion, using a special type of ventilated boxcar modified specifically for this purpose.

5|$|With the {{development}} of the U.S. railroad system, natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through the invention of the refrigerator car. The first refrigerator cars emerged in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and were crude constructions holding up to 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of ice, on top of which the food was placed. It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks of ice in cars caused it to perish; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks, allowing the meat to breathe, while the swinging carcasses improved the circulation in the car. After the Civil War, J. B Sutherland, John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars, which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool. This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods. Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an <b>iced</b> <b>refrigerator</b> car, which preserved foods even better. For much of the 19th century, the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines, which was a problem when the ice was continually melting; by the 1860s, refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process.|$|R

500|$|In {{order for}} a {{domestic}} or commercial customer to use ice, however, it was typically necessary {{to be able to}} store it for a period away from an ice house. As a result, Ice boxes and domestic refrigerators were a critical final stage in the storage process: without them, most households could not use and consume ice. By 1816, Tudor was selling Boston refrigerators called [...] "Little Ice Houses" [...] to households in Charleston; these were made of wood, lined with iron and designed to hold three pounds (1.4kg) of <b>ice.</b> Household <b>refrigerators</b> were manufactured in the 1840s on the east coast, most notably by Darius Eddy of Massachusetts and Winship of Boston; many of these were shipped west. The degree to which natural ice was adopted by local communities in the 19th century heavily depended on the availability and up-take of ice boxes.|$|R

Foram {{realizadas}} seis repetiÃÃes do experimento, no perÃodo de outubro de 2005 a marÃo de 2006. O camarÃo foi adquirido na feira de pescado da Praia do Mucuripe, Fortaleza-CearÃ. Em laboratÃrio, 1. 500 g de camarÃo eram lavados com Ãgua destilada e imersos em Ãgua fervente por cinco minutos para eliminar qualquer Vibrio presente na amostra. A contaminaÃÃo do camarÃo era feita mediante o contacto dos animais com a cultura de V. parahaemolyticus, por cinco minutos. A amostra era dividida em 40 fraÃÃes de 25 g sendo uma delas usada para contagem no tempo zero e as restantes divididas em trÃs lotes sendo estocadas em trÃs temperaturas: caixa isotÃrmica com gelo (- 1 a 13 ÂC), geladeira (11 ÂC) e freezer (- 21 ÂC). Por dez dias seguidos, e nos 15 o, 20 o e 25 o dias, V. parahaemolyticus eram quantificados nos camarÃes atravÃs do MÃtodo de Contagem PadrÃo em Placas, em meios de TCBS e PCA. Todas as trÃs temperaturas foram eficientes no controle da viabilidade de V. parahaemolyticus. A aÃÃo do frio gerado por gelo, geladeira e freezer inibe o crescimento dessa bactÃria em camarÃes, sendo a temperatura do freezer, a mais eficiente na reduÃÃo dessa espÃcie bacteriana em camarÃes. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the survival of Vibrio parahaemolitycus inoculated in meat homogenate of shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei at different temperatures of refrigeration (refrigerator, freezer and isothermic box with ice) during ten days and on the 15 th, 20 th and 25 th days. The experiment was repeated six times during October 2005 to March 2006. Shrimps were obtained on fish market located at Praia do Mucuripe, Fortaleza, CearÃ. In the laboratory, the shrimps were washed with distilled water and from immersed in boiling water for five minutes in order to eliminate any other Vibrio the sample. The sample inoculation happened with the contact between the shrimps and the V. parahaemolyticus culture during five minutes. Then, the sample was divided in 40 portions with 25 g each. One of the portions was used as zero time. The other 39 portions were separated in 3 batches and mantained on freezer (- 21 ÂC), refrigerator (11 ÂC) and isothermic box with ice (- 1 ÂC to 13 ÂC). The number of V. parahaemolyticus was monitored for 10 days and on 15 th, 20 th and 25 th days by the plate count method on TCBS and PCA media. All temperatures were efficient to control the viable cells of V. parahaemolyticus. The action of cold produced by <b>ice,</b> <b>refrigerator</b> and freezer inhibit the bacterial growth on shrimps.

40|$|A {{special test}} {{apparatus}} {{was developed to}} measure the tensile strength of impact ices perpendicular to the direction of growth. The apparatus consists of a split tube carefully machined to minimize {{the effect of the}} joint on impact ice strength. The tube is supported in the wind tunnel by two carefully aligned bearings. During accretion the tube is turned slowly in the icing cloud to form a uniform coating of ice on the split tube specimen. The two halves of the split tube are secured firmly by a longitudinal bolt to prevent relative motion between the two halves during ice accretion and handling. Tensile test strength results for a variety of icing conditions were obtained. Both glaze and rime ice conditions were investigated.
