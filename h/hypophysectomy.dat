50|$|Early {{research}} {{pointed to}} vasopressin {{as a potential}} treatment for improving the memory of patients living with post-traumatic amnesia (PTA). Lysine vasopressin, a modified form of the vasopressin molecule, had positive effects on memory when administered by injection to patients with amnesia resulting from traumatic brain injury and Korsakoff's syndrome. Subsequent animal studies with rats found similar results, particularly in aversion and avoidance learning tasks. Rats lacking adequate vasopressin, either due to genetic defect or <b>hypophysectomy</b> (surgical removal of the pituitary gland), exhibited significant improvements in memory and learning functions when exogenous vasopressin was administered. Particularly encouraging was the finding that a short treatment period produced long-lasting improvements, in both humans and rats. However, the animal models of PTA are highly limited, as the dimension of self-awareness and orientation {{is almost impossible to}} model adequately. PTA in animals, especially rats, is often observed post-trauma (commonly post-surgery), but it is often only measured in terms of impaired learning or unusual behavior.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{these factors}} {{correlate}} with each other. The sustained {{high levels of}} glucocorticosteroids stimulate gluconeogenesis, which subsequently causes an increase of blood glucose that activates the release of insulin to regulate glucose levels by causing its reuptake and storage as glycogen in the tissues in the body. In the case of obesity, which researchers speculate {{to have a strong}} genetic and a dietary basis, insulin resistance prevents high blood glucose regulation, resulting in morbid levels of glucose and diabetes mellitus. In addition, high levels of glucocorticosteroids causes an increase of NPY by directly activating type II glucocorticosteroids receptors (which are activated only by relatively high levels of glucocorticosteroids) and, indirectly, by abolishing the negative feedback of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) on NPY synthesis and release. Meanwhile, obesity-induced insulin resistance and the mutation of the leptin receptor (ObRb) results in the abolition of inhibition of NPYergic activity and ultimately food intake via other negative feedback mechanisms to regulate them. Obesity in rats was significantly reduced by adrenalectomy or <b>hypophysectomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stress: Operating {{through the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), the {{anterior}} pituitary gland {{has a large}} role in the neuroendocrine system’s stress response. Stress induces a release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin from the hypothalamus, which activates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland. Then, this acts on the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids such as cortisol. These glucocorticoids act back on the anterior pituitary gland and the hypothalamus with negative feedback to slow the production of CRH and ACTH. Increased cortisol under stress conditions can cause the following: metabolic effects (mobilization of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids), bone re-absorption (calcium mobilization), activation of the sympathetic nervous system response (fight or flight), anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibition of reproduction/growth. When the anterior pituitary gland is removed (<b>hypophysectomy)</b> in rats, their avoidance learning mechanisms were slowed down, but injections of ACTH restored their performance. In addition, stress may delay the release of reproductive hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This shows that the anterior pituitary gland is involved in behavioral functions as well as being part of a larger pathway for stress responses. It is also known that (HPA) hormones are related to certain skin diseases and skin homeostasis. There is evidence linking hyperactivity of HPA hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors.|$|E
50|$|Alkaline phosphatase, {{an enzyme}} {{located in the}} {{proximal}} tubules, {{plays an important role}} in the polarization of membrane surfaces. While the activity of this enzyme varies across seasons and the mating habits of the newt, the exact role this enzyme plays is not particularly well understood. From the experiment performed by Dore et al., it was observed that the alkaline phosphatase activity was reduced in the transport of two anti-diuretic hormones, prolactin and arginine-vasotocin. It was also noted that the activity of alkaline phosphatase decreased, due in part to <b>hypophysectomy.</b> In summer, aldosterone creates an increase in enzymatic activity (Lodi et al. 1995). Because of this increase in activity, there is a decrease in ion transport, which ties into the activity of ion transport during the aquatic phase. This is likely due to the lowering of bodily functions. Of course, there is an involvement of APH activity in the mechanisms involved in ion transport across the epithelial membrane, also called the cutaneous epithelium. Epithelial cells undergo frequent renewal, and this, in combination with the processes that lead to the rapid regulation of membrane transport, will lead to the said regulation. The APH molecule, in short, plays a large role in the ion exchange across the membrane between the internal and external environments (Lodi et al. 1995). Aldosterone, will independently cause an increase in Na+ channels within the cutaneous membrane. The ion transport is a direct result of coordination and cooperation of both MR cells and the principal cells; for instance, a main role of the mitochondria-rich cells is to energize sodium absorption through use of the principal cells.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} better {{the relationship between}} hypothalamic galaninergic neurons and the pituitary gland, we studied the effects of <b>hypophysectomy</b> on hypothalamic galanin (GAL) content and distribution by radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemistry, and on GAL mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Three weeks after <b>hypophysectomy,</b> performed at 5 or 8 weeks of age, the hypothalamic concentrations of GAL and GAL mRNA were reduced by 30 - 50 % in {{both male and female}} rats, compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Similar reverse-phase HPLC retention times of hypothalamic GAL were observed in intact and hypophysectomized rats. The reduction of hypothalamic GAL concentration following <b>hypophysectomy</b> was time-dependent, as peptide levels were unaffected one week after surgery. Immunohistochemistry showed regional differences in the effect of <b>hypophysectomy</b> on galaninergic neurons. In the hypophysiotropic hypothalamus, the scarce GAL immunoreactivity normally observed in the arcuate nuclei was no longer detectable in hypophysectomized rats, and the intense GAL immunoreactivity of the external zone of the median eminence progressively decreased and completely disappeared 3 and 6 weeks after <b>hypophysectomy.</b> In contrast, in the neurohypophyseal system, there was an increase of GAL labelling of the perikarya and emerging axons in the supraoptic and lateral-paraventricular nuclei, 1 and 3 weeks after <b>hypophysectomy,</b> that disappeared 6 weeks after <b>hypophysectomy.</b> An increase of GAL immunoreactivity was also observed in the internal zone of the median eminence 1 week but not 3 weeks after <b>hypophysectomy.</b> We conclude that <b>hypophysectomy</b> reduces the content of GAL and GAL mRNA in the rat hypothalamus.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{reported}} that various types of axonal injury of hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract can result in degeneration of the magnocellular neurons (MCNs) in hypothalamus and development of central diabetes insipidus (CDI). However, the mechanism of the degeneration and death of MCNs after <b>hypophysectomy</b> in vivo is still unclear. This present study was aimed to disclose it and to figure out the dynamic change of central diabetes insipidus after <b>hypophysectomy.</b> Results The analysis on the dynamic change of daily water consumption (DWC), daily urine volume(DUV), specific gravity of urine(USG) and plasma vasopressin concentration showed that the change pattern of them was triphasic and neuron counting showed that the degeneration of vasopressin neurons began at 10 d, aggravated at 20 d and then stabilized at 30 d after <b>hypophysectomy.</b> There was marked upregulation of cleaved Caspase- 3 expression of vasopressin neurons in <b>hypophysectomy</b> rats. A "ladder" pattern of migration of DNA internucleosomal fragments was detected and apoptotic ultrastructure was found in these neurons. There was time correlation among the occurrence of diabetes insipidus, the changes of plasma vasopressin concentration and the degeneration of vasopressin neurons after <b>hypophysectomy.</b> Conclusion This study firstly demonstrated that apoptosis was involved in degeneration of supraoptic vasopressin neurons after <b>hypophysectomy</b> in vivo and development of CDI. Our study on time course and correlations among water metabolism, degeneration and apoptosis of vasopressin neurons suggested that there should be an efficient therapeutic window in which irreversible CDI might be prevented by anti-apoptosis. </p...|$|E

The hypox poults used were all hypophysectomized at 8 wk of age. The purpose of the experiment was to determine whether the source of growth hormone (GH) or the physiological changes associated with <b>hypophysectomy</b> might affect the disappearance of the hormone from the circulation and, hence, alter the biological response of the bird to exogenous GH. The mean half-life of GH in the growing turkey was 12. 88 ±. 54 (SE) min. The source of GH had no effect on half-life, and GH half-life did not vary significantly between poults sampled at 8 and 13 wk. <b>Hypophysectomy</b> significantly (P<. 01) increased the half-life of administered GH from 11. 21 ±. 50 min in intact poults to 14. 70 ±. 84 min in hypox poults. The MCR of GH in hypox poults 2 days following <b>hypophysectomy</b> was markedly lower than that of intact birds (1. 08 versus 2. 9 S ml /min; P<. 001). The GH clearance in hypox birds increased during the 5 wk following <b>hypophysectomy</b> but still remained somewhat lower than that of intact birds (2. 5 S versus 3. 00 mlV min; P =. 06).

OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the prognostic value of perioperative plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations for identifying recurrence of hypercortisolism after transsphenoidal <b>hypophysectomy.</b> ANIMALS: A total of 112 dogs with PDH that underwent transsphenoidal <b>hypophysectomy</b> met the inclusion criteria of the study. METHODS: Hormone concentrations were measured preoperatively and 1 - 5 hours after surgery. Both absolute hormone concentrations and postoperative concentrations normalized to preoperative concentrations were included in analyses. The prognostic value of hormone concentrations was studied with Cox's proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS: Median follow-up and disease-free period were 1096 days and 896 days, respectively. Twenty-eight percent of patients had recurrence, with a median disease-free period of 588 days. Both absolute and normalized postoperative cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in dogs with recurrence than in dogs without recurrence. High ACTH 5 hours after surgery, high cortisol 1 and 4 hours after surgery, high normalized ACTH 3 hours after surgery, high normalized cortisol 4 hours after surgery and the random slope of cortisol were associated with a shorter disease-free period. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Individual perioperative hormone curves provide valuable information about the risk of recurrence after <b>hypophysectomy.</b> However, because no single cutoff point could be identified, combination with other variables, such as the pituitary height/brain area (P/B) ratio, is still needed to obtain a good estimate of the risk for recurrence of hypercortisolism after <b>hypophysectomy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Five {{groups of}} five {{lactating}} rabbits each were used. Milk yield was recorded from the 8 th day of lactation onwards {{and on the}} 10 th day of lactation the rabbits received the following treatments: Group S, sham=req- operation with saline (1 ml/ 12 h); Group P, <b>hypophysectomy</b> with sheep prolactin (1 mg/ 12 h); Group H, <b>hypophysectomy</b> with human growth hormone (1 mg/ 12 h); Group B, <b>hypophysectomy</b> with bovine growth hor-mone (1 mg/ 12 h) and Group C, <b>hypophysectomy</b> with saline (1 ml/ 12 h). The injections of saline or hormones were continued for 5 days {{and at the end}} of this period a blood sample was taken, the animals were killed and their mammary glands removed for histological examination and assay of the following enzymes: 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 44), phosphofructokinase (EC 2. 7. 1. 11), phosphoglucomutase (EC 2. 7. 5. 1), UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2. 7. 7. 9), acetyl-CoA carboxylase(EC 6. 4. 1. 2), acetyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6. 2. 1. 1) and ATP-citrate lyase(EC 4. 1. 3. 8). On the 5 th day after surgery the concentrations of blood L=req- lactate and pyruvate and plasma free fatty acids and protein were similar in all groups, whereas plasma glucose was higher in groups S, B and H than i...|$|E
