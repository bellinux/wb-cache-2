Both dispersal variance and migration probabilities are variables in this model and both contribute to local genetic differentiation. <b>Isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance is usually the simplest model for the cause of genetic isolation between populations. Evolutionary biologists and population geneticists have been exploring varying theories and models for explaining population structure. Yoichi Ishida compares two important theories of <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance and clarifies the relationship between the two. According to Ishida, Sewall Wright’s <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance theory is termed ecological <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance while Gustave Malécot’s theory is called genetic <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance.Isolation by distance is distantly related to speciation. Multiple types of isolating barriers, namely prezygotic isolating barriers which includes <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance, are considered to be the key factor in keeping populations apart limiting gene flow.|$|R
40|$|The <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> {{distance}} {{model is}} both a population process and a surface model. In this model the surface is, on average, flat in every direction. By contrast, probably most observed genetic surfaces exhibit trends generated by complex long-distance populational processes. When one estimates the parameters of a Malecot-Morton equation for those surfaces, the <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance model does not fit. In the simplest case, in first-order trends (two-dimensional clines) the genetic differentiation increases dramatically, faster per unit distance than it would <b>by</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance alone. When <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance takes place but is hidden through the apparent and complicated relief of a surface, another surface model incorporating trend spatial analysis can bypass the difficulty of estimating the <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance process if approached through the Malecot-Morton equation or through a measure of spatial autocorrelation...|$|R

50|$|Both {{adaptive}} and nonadaptive processes play a part, {{individually or}} acting together, and create variation in populations and species. Understanding {{the roles of}} both processes has been a central goal in biology. As previously described, gradual genetic drift across populations (<b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance) and limited gene dispersal can account {{for some of the}} genetic and phenotypic divergence across populations, but there are alternative models besides <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance that can contribute to these differences as well. Two of these alternate models include <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> colonization and <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> adaptation. The former is a product of colonization history and founder effects while the latter is a product of adaption to varying environments inhibiting migration between populations.A recent scientific article (Spurgin et al., 2014) tried to differentiate between these processes by utilizing island populations of Anthus berthelotii (Berthelot’s pipit) native to three Atlantic archipelagos. Microsatellite markers and approximate Bayesian computation revealed that the northward colonization of the species produced genetic bottlenecks. High levels of genetic structure occurring across the archipelagos indicate an <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> colonization pattern. Significant morphological divergence was present that is highly consistent with trends of bottleneck and genetic structure history, not with geographic distance or environmental variation.|$|R

40|$|Discerning the {{relative}} roles of adaptive and nonadaptive processes in generating differences among populations and species, {{as well as}} how these processes interact, is a fundamental aim in biology. Both genetic and phenotypic divergence across populations can be the product of limited dispersal and gradual genetic drift across populations (<b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance), of colonization history and founder effects (<b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> colonization) or of adaptation to different environments preventing migration between populations (<b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> adaptation). Here, we attempt to differentiate between these processes using island populations of Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii), a passerine bird endemic to three Atlantic archipelagos. Using microsatellite markers and approximate Bayesian computation, we reveal that the northward colonization of this species ca. 8500 years ago resulted in genetic bottlenecks in the colonized archipelagos. We then show that high levels of genetic structure exist across archipelagos and that these are consistent with a pattern of <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> colonization, but not with <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance or adaptation. Finally, we show that substantial morphological divergence also exists and that this is strongly concordant with patterns of genetic structure and bottleneck history, but not with environmental differences or geographic distance. Overall, our data suggest that founder effects are responsible for both genetic and phenotypic changes across archipelagos. Our findings provide a rare example of how founder effects can persist over evolutionary timescales and suggest that they may {{play an important role in}} the early stages of speciation...|$|R

Biodiversity and Conservation, 12, (2), 217 - 224. The majority of estimates of <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance are produced byindirect molecular methods rather than direct observation of dispersal events orcolonisation rates. This {{is in part}} due to technical difficulties in recordingrare dispersal events in the field, and may be limiting the testing ofmetapopulation models. The fact that tombstones are dated on erection was usedto perform direct measurements of rates of colonisation for two contrasting speciesof crustose lichen, Candelariella vitellina andPlacynthium nigrum, which occur commonly on sandstone andgranite headstones, respectively. The effects of <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distancewere observed in the colonisation of sandstone by C. vitellina within the first 50 years of the erection of headstones in thesmallest of three burial grounds investigated in northeast Scotland.

There was noapparent effect of <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance on the rate of colonisation of graniteheadstones by P. nigrum at any of the three study sites atany period of colonisation.

40|$|The {{population}} structure of an organism reflects its evolutionary history and influences its evolutionary trajectory. It constrains {{the combination of}} genetic diversity and reveals patterns of past gene flow. Understanding it {{is a prerequisite for}} detecting genomic regions under selection, predicting the effect of population disturbances, or modeling gene flow. This paper examines the detailed global {{population structure}} of Arabidopsis thaliana. Using a set of 5, 707 plants collected from around the globe and genotyped at 149 SNPs, we show that while A. thaliana as a species self-fertilizes 97 % of the time, there is considerable variation among local groups. This level of outcrossing greatly limits observed heterozygosity but is sufficient to generate considerable local haplotypic diversity. We also find that in its native Eurasian range A. thaliana exhibits continuous <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance at every geographic scale without natural breaks corresponding to classical notions of populations. By contrast, in North America, where it exists as an exotic species, A. thaliana exhibits little or no population structure at a continental scale but local <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance that extends hundreds of km. This suggests a pattern for the development of <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance that can establish itself shortly after an organism fills a new habitat range. It also raises questions about the general applicability of many standard population genetics models. Any model based on discrete clusters of interchangeable individuals will be an uneasy fit to organisms like A. thaliana which exhibit continuous <b>isolation</b> <b>by</b> distance on many scales...|$|R
