However, the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on land and sea; and therefore combating the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta. Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Katanga secession, {{political}} negotiations {{began to}} reconcile the disparate political factions. The negotiations coincided with the formation of an émigré political group, the Conseil National de Libération (CNL), by dissident Lumumbists and others in neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. The negotiations culminated {{in the creation of a}} new, revised constitution, known as the Luluabourg Constitution, after the city in which it was written, to create a compromise balance of power. The new constitution increased the power of the presidency, ending the system of <b>joint</b> <b>consultation</b> between President and Prime Minister, and appeased federalists by increasing the number of provinces from six to 21 while increasing their autonomy. The constitution also changed the name of the state from the Republic of the Congo to Democratic Republic of the Congo. The constitution was passed in a constitutional referendum in June 1964 and Parliament was dissolved to await new elections. Kasa-Vubu appointed Tshombe, the exiled Katangese leader, as interim Prime Minister. Although personally capable, and supported as an anti-communist by Western powers, Tshombe was denounced by other African leaders such as King Hassan II of Morocco as an imperialist puppet for his role in the Katangese secession.|$|E

40|$|Within writing centers, it {{is common}} for a writing {{consultant}} to pull in a second consultant during a one-on-one session with a student. Yet there is currently nothing in writing center scholarship that discusses this practice or ways to do it well. So, how can we structure these <b>joint</b> <b>consultations</b> in productive ways that will benefit students? Is there potential in collaborating with peer library consultants in these sessions? In this paper, I argue that there is vast potential in <b>joint</b> <b>consultations.</b> They give students multiple perspectives on their writing, create an enthusiastic and supportive environment for discussion, and model the benefits of collaboration for students. Furthermore, <b>joint</b> <b>consultations</b> including a writing consultant and a peer library consultant better reflect the recursive nature of the writing process for students than our current model. I tested <b>joint</b> <b>consultations</b> in the writing center, and I examine this experience in the paper. This experiment informed the sections on strategies for making <b>joint</b> <b>consultations</b> effective, as well as solutions for potential obstacles.

40|$|Introduction: care overload, {{aging of}} population, and {{increased}} chronic diseases {{lead to increased}} referrals from primary care, which may sometimes overload the health system. Thus, different interventions {{have been carried out}} attempting to improve these aspects. Objectives: to assess the most frequent causes of consultation of general physicians, both in <b>joint</b> <b>consultations</b> and clinical sessions held jointly with specialist consultant in primary care, in the urban and rural setting, and the influence on referrals to first consultations of gastroenterology. Material and methods: a mainly training type of intervention was carried out, consisting of regular meetings in both urban and rural primary care center, to perform <b>joint</b> <b>consultations</b> and clinical sessions on patients and topics related to the specialty of gastroenterology. The intervention period (divided in two subperiods) was compared with a control period. Results: most reasons for consultation were those corresponding to lower gastrointestinal tract, followed by liver disease and upper gastrointestinal tract. Significant differences were only found in distribution of diagnoses between the two centers in <b>joint</b> <b>consultations.</b> There was a relative (percent) decrease in referrals at the global level in both subperiods, only significant in the first (51. 45 %), as well as in rural setting (45. 24 %). Conclusion: common consultations motifs were similar in urban and rural settings, with some relevance of lower gastrointestinal tract disease. Most of them can be solved at primary care, with the help of consultant specialist. There is impact on referrals to the outpatient first consultations of gastroenterology, mainly in rural setting...|$|R

40|$|Asthma {{and chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) are {{leading causes of}} hospitalisation and death in the city of Sao Bernardo do Campo. The municipality had difficulties in sustaining a pulmonology specialist team. Local policy has strengthened the knowledge of the primary care teams to improve the management of these diseases. Our aim is to pilot the implementation of an educational intervention based on collaborative care focused on reducing respiratory-related referrals. We implemented 'matrix support': a Brazilian collaborative educational intervention promoting specialist training and support for primary care physicians in three health territories with the highest number of referrals. Clinicians and nurses from primary care attended an 8 -h workshop. The backlog of respiratory referrals was prioritised, where Asthma and COPD represented 70 % of referral reasons. Initially, pulmonologists held <b>joint</b> <b>consultations</b> with physicians and nurses; as confidence grew, these were replaced by round-table note-based case discussions. The primary outcome was the number of asthma and COPD referrals. Almost all primary healthcare professionals in the three areas (132 of 157 - 87 %) were trained; 360 patients were discussed, including 220 <b>joint</b> <b>consultations.</b> The number of respiratory referrals dropped from 290 (the year before matrix support) to 134 (the year after) (P< 0. 05). Referrals for asthma/COPD decreased from 13. 4 to 5. 4 cases per month (P = 0. 09) and for other lung diseases from 10. 8 to 5. 3 cases per month (P< 0. 05). Knowledge scores showed a significant improvement (P< 0. 001). Matrix-support collaborative care was well-accepted by primary care professionals associated with improved knowledge and reduced respiratory referrals. The initiative attracted specialists to the region overcoming historical recruitment problems. This project was made possible by an educational grant from the International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG) and an organisation-unrestricted grant from the Municipality of Sao Bernardo do Campo (Brazil). info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{environmental}} impact assessment is a control procedure that aims to summarize and evaluate {{the impact of a}} project on the environment at the stage of project planning and thus to reduce its potential negative impacts in the future. One of the main ideas of the EIA process is to avoid since the very beginning problems and confrontation which would otherwise appear in the future in connection with the planned project. This principle is particularly important in cases of transboundary assessment where communication between countries and <b>joint</b> <b>consultations</b> on the project in its early stages of planning might prevent potential conflicts and disruption of mutual relations in the future resulting from an already implemented plan. The cornerstone of a transboundary assessment is the understanding that the harmful effects of a specific project do not stop at the borders of one state, but can reach a territory of many other countries, mutual cooperation in this subject is thus with regard to environmental protection necessary. The necessity of such a cooperation on one hand, as well as its pitfalls and difficulties on the other hand, are illustrated in the case of transboundary EIA between the Czech Republic and Austria, that is specifically {{in the case of the}} construction of the nuclear power plant [...] ...|$|R

Many visit their GPs, hospitals and other health services many times, yet their problems remain unresolved, at a high cost to them, to their families and to the NHS. People with medically unexplained symptoms, people with personality disorders and those with complex mental health problems frequently get‘bounced’ around the NHS, passed from one service to another, none able(or willing) to offer them the flexible, personalised and sometimes time- consuming support they require.
