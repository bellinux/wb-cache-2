30|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} delayed rupture of the Tokai and Nankai segments on coastal tsunami heights. The parameter search based on the superposition principle of linear long wave theory indicates that the worst case scenario is the rupture starts on the Tonankai (N 2) segment followed by the rupture on the Tokai (N 1) segment 21 min later, and the Nankai (N 3 and N 4) segments 15 min and 28 min later. In this scenario, the tsunami heights become significantly amplified (A > 1.4) with respect to <b>the</b> simultaneous rupture <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>coasts</b> of <b>the</b> sea of Hyu’uga and in the Bungo Channel, amplified (1 < A < 1.2) <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>coasts</b> of Tosa Bay and in the Kii Channel.
