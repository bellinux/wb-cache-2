40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} intra- and intersession test-retest reliability for the measurements of centre of pressure displacement in quiet standing and during maximal voluntary body leaning (approximate area of stability limits). 27 elderly men participated in the study (71. 4 ± 4. 9 of age). Intrasession (4 measurements with two-minute breaks) and intersession (4 measurements one week apart) reliability were examined. Parameters connected to the centre of pressure data (AMTI force platform) were measured during a quiet stance and voluntary body leaning in medio-lateral and anterior-posterior directions (approximate limits of stability). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 2, 1 and ICC 2,k) were calculated. In case of quiet standing, only mean velocity of centre of pressure sway provides high reliability in intrasession – ICC 2, 1 of. 84 and ICC 2,k of. 96, and in intersession – ICC 2, 1 of. 76. Evaluation of limits of stability showed high values of all parameters (maximal and minimal displacement in sagittal and <b>frontal</b> <b>planes,</b> distance between maximal and minimal position of centre of pressure in sagittal and <b>frontal</b> <b>planes</b> and approximated area of stability limits) in intrasession – ICC 2, 1 between. 82 to. 96 and ICC 2,k between. 95 to. 99.

Average velocity of the centre of pressure is the only parameter that showed a high application value in case of measurements during quiet standing. Parameters related to the stability limits appeared very reliable what proves that this evaluation may have potential application in the clinical practice.

40|$|Purpose. The {{modified}} Star Excursion Balance Test (mSEBT) assesses dynamic neuromuscular control, with predictive ability regarding {{lower extremity}} injury risk. Previous kinematic mSEBT analyses {{are limited to}} sex differences between injured or fatigued populations or non-fatigued groups in the sagittal plane only. We hypothesize that sex differences exist in the <b>frontal</b> and transverse <b>plane</b> kinematics of the hip and knee in healthy, non-fatigued subjects during the mSEBT. Methods. The descriptive laboratory study involved 38 healthy subjects: 20 males (aged 24. 8 ± 2. 7 years) and 18 females (24. 1 ± 3. 7 years). Peak kinematics, obtained by a VICONTM motion system, of the hip and knee in the sagittal, <b>frontal,</b> and transverse <b>plane</b> were compared during the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral reach of the mSEBT.
