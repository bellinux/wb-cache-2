40|$|AbstractTo {{gauge the}} {{accuracy}} of the crowd-sourced damage assessments in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan, REACH and the American Red Cross conducted a study comparing <b>enumerated</b> <b>field</b> damage assessments with the remote damage assessments conducted by the OpenStreetMap community. The potential utility of remote sensing imagery and rapid GIS-based mapping in humanitarian responses relies on {{the accuracy of}} these techniques. Recent studies from other emergencies have questioned the current capacity of these tools to deliver the levels of accuracy needed, but have acknowledged that these levels can be improved with further research, development and standardization for the humanitarian context. This assessment sought to address some of these questions of accuracy by comparing remote damage assessment findings with field-level damage assessments and to identify any differences in accuracy. The assessment also aimed to assess the ability of crowd-sourced platforms to go beyond providing only base data by creating information about building-level damage. The conclusions and recommendations are intended to inform contributors and developers of crowd-source platforms as well as the humanitarian community at large, contributing to a dialogue about the how to capitalize on the present tools and improve {{the way in which they}} are used in humanitarian settings...|$|E
40|$|Plotless density estimators (PDEs) can be {{efficient}} alternatives to quadrat sampling for estimating {{the density of}} stationary objects. Variable area transect (VAT) sampling had been identified, and optimized relative to effort, in previous Monte Carlo simulated population studies as a low-labor field method that demonstrated superior estimation properties among many PDEs considered. However, natural populations tend {{to be much more}} complex and less predictable in spatial distribution than computer generated populations. Therefore, we carried out a Monte Carlo simulation study that used 17 fully <b>enumerated</b> <b>field</b> populations rather than simulated populations. These natural populations represented a variety of population densities and spatial patterns. We focused on assessing the effect of the number of population members searched for along each transect (r), sample size, and transect width on estimation quality. Using relative root mean-squared error and relative bias as criteria, the optimal range for r was 5 to 7 population members encountered from each start point. Sample size was best if n 3 ̆e 20, but returns in estimation quality diminished by n= 40.

Next, the Washington Field Office and the Research and Development Division investigated if GPS receivers could assist field enumerators with the Wheat Objective Yield Survey. Currently, Wheat Objective Yield Survey field enumerators go to specified areas of the sampled wheat fields, lay out two objective yield units and record various crop counts. Every month until the fields are harvested, the enumerator returns to the same units and records crop counts. Sometimes a field enumerator has difficulty finding the same location again or a different field enumerator may need to <b>enumerate</b> the <b>field</b> and is unable to find the same location. This costs NASS in field enumeration time, and in those instances where the units were unable to be found, the data quality suffers...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{smallest}} eukaryotes (cells less than 5 m in diameter) play key roles in marine food webs, particularly in open oligotrophic areas, the study of their in situ diversity started just one year ago. Perhaps the most remarkable finding of the most recent studies has been the discovery of completely new phylogenetic lineages, such as novel clades belonging to the stramenopile and alveolate phyla. The two new groups account for a significant fraction of clones in genetic libraries from North Atlantic, equatorial Pacific, Antarctic, and Mediterranean Sea waters. However, the identities and ecological relevance of these organisms remain unknown. Here we investigate the phylogenetic relationships, morphology, in situ abundance, and ecological role of novel stramenopiles. They form at least eight independent clades within the stramenopile basal branches, indicating a large phylogenetic diversity within the group. Two lineages were visualized and <b>enumerated</b> in <b>field</b> samples and enrichments by fluorescent in situ hybridization using specific rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. The targeted organisms were 2 - to 3 -m-diameter, round-shaped, nonpigmented flagellates. Further, they were found to be bacterivorous. One lineage accounted for up to 46 % (average during an annual cycle, 19 %) of heterotrophic flagellates in a coastal environment, providing evidence that novel stramenopiles are important and unrecognized components of the total stock of bacterial grazers.

Before each experiment, {{the surface of}} the glass cover slides (13 mm diameter and 1.2 mm thick) was treated with a cleaning solution (Korenblum et al. 2008). The device for biofilm formation was a 24 -well-plate with a cover glass slide in each well. Two assays were used to test the efficacy of the LEO against SRB biofilm formation. For the two assays, LEO at MIC, sub-MIC and supra-MIC concentrations was added as follows: (assay 1) LEO added {{at the same time that}} the SRB cells were introduced in the biofilm device; and (assay 2) planktonic SRB cells were incubated with LEO for 24 h and then these pretreated cells were introduced in the biofilm system. A control without LEO was performed in both assays. Two milliliters of the cell suspension (pre-treated with LEO, or untreated) was added to each well, covering the glass surfaces, and incubated at 30 °C for 7 days. After the incubation period for biofilm formation on the glass surfaces, unattached or loosely attached cells were removed by washing with N 2 purged distilled water, prior to biofilm cell enumeration.

40|$|The Fisher {{information}} matrix (FIM) {{has long been}} of interest in statistics and other areas. It is widely {{used to measure the}} amount of information and calculate the lower bound for the variance for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). In practice, we do not always know the actual FIM. This is often because obtaining the first or second-order derivatives of the log-likelihood function is difficult, or simply because the calculation of FIM is too formidable. In such cases, we need to utilize the approximation of FIM. In general, {{there are two ways to}} estimate FIM. One is to use the product of gradient and the transpose of itself, and the other is to calculate the Hessian matrix and then take negative sign. Mostly people use the latter method in practice. However, this is not necessarily the optimal way. To find out which of the two methods is better, we need to conduct a theoretical study to compare their efficiency. In this paper we mainly focus on the case where the unknown parameter that needs to be estimated by MLE is scalar and the random variables we have are independent. In this scenario, Fisher {{information matrix}} is virtually Fisher information number (FIN). Using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), we get asymptotic variances for the two methods, by which we compare their accuracy. Taylor expansion assists in estimating the two asymptotic variances.

40|$|An SU(2) slave boson {{formulation}} of bond-type spin nematic orders is developed in frustrated ferromagnets, where the spin nematic states {{are described as}} the resonating spin-triplet valence bond (RVB) states. The d-vectors of spin-triplet pairing ansatzes {{play the role of}} the directors in the bond-type spin quadrupolar states. The low-energy excitations around such spin-triplet RVB ansatzes generally comprise the (potentially massless) gauge bosons, massless Goldstone bosons, and spinon individual excitations. Extending the projective symmetry group argument to the spin-triplet ansatzes, we show how to identify the number of massless gauge bosons efficiently. Applying this formulation, we next (i) <b>enumerate</b> possible mean <b>field</b> solutions for the S= 1 / 2 ferromagnetic J 1 -J 2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice, with ferromagnetic nearest neighbor J 1 and competing antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor J 2, and (ii) argue their stability against small gauge fluctuations.

40|$|Marine {{microorganisms}} {{represent the}} largest reservoir of living organic carbon {{in the ocean}} and collectively manage the pools and fluxes of nutrients and energy. Climate-induced increases in sea surface temperature and associated modifications to vertical stratification are affecting the structure and production of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms in ocean surface waters. However, {{little is known about}} how future alterations will affect the mortality of marine microbes. The various modes of mortality influence the cycling of biogeochemical elements very differently. This in turn affects the production to respiration ratio of the ocean and thus the efficiency with which photosynthetic organic carbon is transferred to higher trophic levels or exported to the deep ocean (via the biological pump). The Atlantic Ocean provides a meridional gradient in stratification, is essential to global circulation and acts as a major sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide. The Northeast Atlantic thus provides an ideal model system for the current study which aims to investigate the influence that vertical stratification has on the source of mortality (i. e., viral lysis versus grazing). After a general introduction, this thesis begins by providing a comprehensive overview of what is currently known about how environmental factors in the marine environment affect virus-host interactions. Abiotic and biotic variables can influence the infectivity and survival of marine viruses, and regulate the physiology, production and distribution of the host. Ultimately, these aspects govern the efficiency with which viruses can replicate and thus propagate through the marine environment (Chapter 2). The review illustrates that at this moment in time, our ability to identify general ecologically functional patterns important in governing virus dynamics over broad oceanic scales is restricted by the availability of information regarding both the effect of individual environmental factors and by the scarcity of reported rates. In order to better understand the importance of vertical mixing and physicochemical features in structuring phytoplankton (unicellular algae) host populations, a high-resolution mesoscale description of the phytoplankton community along a meridional gradient in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean was conducted during the spring and summer (Chapter 3). Vertical stratification was identified as a key factor governing the distribution and separation of different phytoplankton taxa and size classes, indicating that incorporation of vertical turbulence structure of the water column will improve biogeochemical and ecological modeling studies. The data support predictions that climate-change induced increases in ocean surface temperature and expansion of oligotrophic (nutrient-limited) areas willincrease the contribution of pico-sized (58 °N), resulting in grazing-dominated phytoplankton mortality. A method optimization for the enumeration of samples with low viral abundance (pH modification of the TE-buffer used for the dilutions) substantially improved total virus counts in North Atlantic samples compared to those obtained using the standard method (Chapter 5). This method was applied to <b>enumerate</b> <b>field</b> samples which utilized a virus reduction approach to investigate the viral life strategy and magnitude of infection in heterotrophic prokaryotic populations (Chapter 6). Compared to grazing, viruses were the dominant mortality factor regulating prokaryotic losses in the surface waters of the Northeast Atlantic Ocean during summer. Lytic infection (virus replication and host lysis proceeds immediately after infection) was the favored life strategy in the surface mixed layer, while lysogeny (virus incorporated into host genome where it remains until triggered into lytic cycle upon stimulation by an environmental factor) was only relevant within the deep chlorophyll maximum layer of oligotrophic southern stations. The data revealed a close to steady state situation and rapid turnover in the south and net heterotrophic production in the north, suggesting that alterations in stratification will also affect heterotrophic prokaryote production. Implementing measured production and loss rates of autotrophic (Chapter 4) and heterotrophic (Chapter 6) organisms into a steady state carbon-flux model demonstrates that 80 % of the photosynthetically fixed carbon flowed through the viral shunt in the oligotrophic south, which is more than 2 -fold higher than thenorthern region. These results illustrate that viruses play a more prominent role in stratified (steady state) marine ecosystems than thought previously. Overall, this thesis reveals that viral lysis is an important factor regulating the biomass and productivity of marine microbial populations during summer stratification in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, the data support the hypothesis laid out in this thesis that alterations in microbial communities due to global warming-induced changes in vertical stratification will affect mortality processes and the distribution of predators (e. g. mortality agents). The partitioning of photosynthetic carbon through the separate mortality pathways has important implications for ecosystem functioning as each pathway affects the structure and activity of the pelagic food web in different ways. Grazing transfers biomass to higher trophic levels, thus increases the overall efficiency and carrying capacity of the ecosystem. On the other hand, viral activity stimulates recycling via heterotrophic prokaryotes by shunting biomass to the dissolved organic matter pool, and therefore enhances the availability of inorganic nutrients in the oligotrophic surface waters of the ocean. In conclusion, the data presented in this thesis indicate that climate change-induced alterations in the timing and strength of seasonal stratification at the higher latitudes will shift the ecosystem towards a more viral-lysis dominated system. A more prominent future role of viral lysis in the northern region of the North Atlantic Ocean would thus markedly reduce biological carbon export into the ocean’s interior in one of the key areas of global carbon sequestration, reducing the potential for the ocean to serve as a long-term sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide...|$|R

Substantial data or information such as fungal mass or carbon loading to ambient aerosols is however still lacking. This study aimed to quantify the specific organic carbon content (OC per spore) of eleven fungal species commonly found airborne in the subtropics, and estimated their contribution to organic carbon in aerosols. The specific OC contents showed a size-dependent relationship (r = 0. 64, p < 0. 05) and ranged from 3. 6 to 201. 0 pg carbon per spore or yeast cell, giving an average of 6. 0 pg carbon per spore (RSD 51 %) for spore or cell size less than 10 mu m. In accounting for natural variations in the composition and abundance of fungal population, weighted-average carbon content for field samples was adopted using the laboratory determined specific OC values.

Bhatnagar et al. (2012) presented the results of a wind tunnel study in an open circuit boundary layer flow condition, carried out on a model of low-rise building with sawtooth roof. Tominaga and Stathopoulos (2012) modeled turbulent scalar flux in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for near-field dispersion around buildings. Raj et al.

Muehleisen and Patrizi (2013) developed parametric equations to find out the values of pressure coefficients (C p) on the surfaces of rectangular low-rise building models from experimental wind tunnel data. Amin and Ahuja (2013) investigated through wind tunnel studies rectangular building models of different side ratios (ratio of building’s depth to width) ranging from 0.25 to 4, keeping the area and height the same for all models, while the wind angle changes at an interval of 15 ° from 0 ° to 90 °. Kushal et al. (2013) recognized that the plan shape of the building affects the wind pressure to a great degree. Verma et al.

Kheyari and Dalui (2015) have conferred the results of a case study to estimate wind load on a tall building under interference effects. They used a CFD simulation tool to create a ‘virtual’ wind tunnel to predict the wind characteristics and wind response.|$|R

To {{determine whether or not}} PAHs were being degraded under anaerobic conditions in situ, groundwater and sediment porewater samples were analyzed for metabolic biomarkers, or metabolites, formed in the anaerobic degradation of naphthalene (a low-molecular weight PAH). In addition, a groundwater push-pull method was developed to evaluate whether the transformation of deuterated naphthalene to a deuterated metabolite could be monitored in situ and if conservative rates of transformation can be defined using this method. Metabolites of anaerobic naphthalene degradation were detected in all samples that also contained significant levels of naphthalene. Anaerobic degradation of naphthalene appears to be widespread in the upland contaminated aquifer, as well as within the adjacent river sediments. A zero-order rate of transformation of naphthalene-D₈ to naphthoic acid-D₇was calculated as 31 nM·d-¹. This study is the first reported use of deuterated naphthalene to provide both conclusive evidence of the in situ production of breakdown metabolites and an in situ rate of transformation. Methane ebullition was observed in areas of the sediment cap footprint associated with organophilic clay that was used a reactive capping material to sequester mobile non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) at the site. Anaerobic slurry incubations were constructed using sediment core samples to quantify the contribution of the native sediment and the different layers of capping material (sand and organophilic clay) to the overall methane production. Substrate addition experiments using fresh, unused organophilic clay, as well as measured changes in total carbon in organophilic clay over time supported the hypothesis that microbes can use organophilic clay as a carbon source. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) directed at the mcrA gene <b>enumerated</b> methanogens in <b>field</b> samples and incubations of native sediment and capping materials. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was also performed on DNA extracted from these samples to identify some of the predominant microorganisms within the sediment cap footprint. The organophilic clay incubations produced up to 1500 times more methane than the native sediment and sand cap incubations. The organophilic clay field sample contained the greatest number of methanogens and the native sediment contained the least. However, the native sediment incubations had greater numbers of methanogens compared to their respective field sample and comparable numbers to the organophilic clay incubation. An increase in methane production was observed with the addition of fresh, unused organophilic clay to the already active organophilic clay incubations indicating that organophilic clay stimulates methanogenesis. In addition, organophilic clay retrieved from the field lost about 10 % of its total carbon over a 300 -day incubation period suggesting that some component of organophilic clay may be converted to methane. DGGE results revealed that some of the predominant groups within the native sediment and sediment cap were Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Deltaproteobacteria. An organism 98 % similar to Syntrophus sp. was identified in the organophilic clay suggesting this organism may be working in concert with methanogens to convert the organic component of organophilic clay ultimately to methane. The capacity of organophilic clay to sequester organic contaminants will likely change over time as the organic component is removed from the clay. This, in turn, affects the use of this material as a long-term remedial strategy in reduced, contaminated environments...|$|R
