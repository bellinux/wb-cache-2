25|$|A {{campaign}} {{by the local}} newspaper, the Blackpool Gazette in 2006 to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illuminated trams, The Western Train, back on track, resulted in a £278,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to restore the two tramcars in the Western Train set which first ran in 1962. They had been withdrawn in 1999 and stood derelict at Rigby Road depot. The tramcars returned to service during the 2009 Illuminations Switch-On. In January 2008 {{it was revealed that}} another iconic illuminated tram, the Rocket, which had been in service between 1961 and 1999 but which had since then stood idle, was also due to be restored for the Illuminations in 2012 {{at a cost of about}} £150,000 and with the help of a newly created Friends of the Illuminations group. The full restoration did not occur but it was cosmetically restored in 2012 and used as a static display as part of the Illuminations for 2012 and 2013. The Frigate was rebuilt in 2004 and the Trawler was created from Brush car 633 in 2001.|$|E

2500|$|Lithuania {{was among}} the many European {{independent}} states that due to the dissolutions of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, would return into the Olympic competition for the 1992 games. For the 1992 Pre-Olympic Basketball Tournament, held in Spain from June 22 to July 5, Lithuania was joined by the debuting Croatia, Slovenia, Latvia, and Estonia, along with the non-Baltic Soviet republics in a Commonwealth of Independent States. The latter was a particularly awaited adversary for the Lithuanians, as according to LTOK president Artūras Poviliūnas, [...] "We have dreamed {{all of our lives}} about playing against the Soviet Union. Although it's not called the Soviet Union any more, this game will be very important and very symbolic. It will be as important as the Olympics themselves." [...] With a trip funded by the Spanish city of Melilla, Lithuania managed to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four qualifying spots disputed by 25 participants, winning all their 11 games in the tournament.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1871, Tryon was {{appointed}} private secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty, George Goschen. The appointment normally {{went to an}} experienced captain with ten years' service, whereas Tryon had yet to serve at sea in that rank. The post carried considerable influence, equivalent in practice {{to that of other}} Lords of the Admiralty, in advising upon naval appointments. Goschen said of Tryon, [...] "I had an immensely high opinion not only of his naval knowledge, but of his general savoir faire, rapidity of judgement, decision, extraordinary shrewdness, and great knowledge of men. He was somewhat cynical in his views of human nature but his cynicism was of a good humoured and harmless cast." [...] A story was related of the Admiralty board travelling to Dover to meet the Shah of Persia in 1872. At the railway station it was found they would have to walk some distance through a large crowd. Tryon commented to a friend that he would <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> admirals to carry his bag for him, which he duly did by asking the admiral to hold his bag while he opened a way through the crowd. Tryon then avoided reclaiming his luggage until they reached their destination.|$|E

2500|$|Their live {{performances}} were notoriously hit-or-miss, and were usually far more rough-edged than their recordings; the Horrible Truth of their live album (The Horrible Truth About Burma) being an in-joke about their inconsistency. Boston critic Tristam Lozaw described Mission of Burma live: [...] "When they were good, {{they were very}} very good, but when they were bad they were horrid ... But that {{was the nature of}} the beast ... Because they took chances, you never knew whether you were going to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most spectacular experiences of your life or {{if it was going to}} be a ball of incomprehensible noise." [...] While the band's improvisational side and the unpredictable chaos of Swope's tape work contributed a little to this inconsistency, the two main factors were (as Lozaw implies) the live sound and the pacing and timing of their sets. When faced with a venue where the sound system or room acoustics weren't up to the task of conveying clarity along with the band's trademark volume, Swope always refused to compromise, and opted for volume. The band's set lists (composed by committee a few minutes before going on stage) could range from well-constructed to seemingly picked at random, and (aside from [...] "Secrets" [...] as a frequent opener and [...] "All World Cowboy Romance" [...] or a cover as an encore) there was a general reluctance to repeat any song placement or sequence that had worked in the past.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 1932, the Lytton Commission {{arrived in}} Manchuria to begin its {{investigation}} to establish if Japan had committed aggression or not. Puyi {{was interviewed by}} Lord Lytton, and recalled thinking {{that at the time}} that he desperately wanted to ask Lytton for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was sitting right next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that [...] "the masses of the people had begged me to come, that my stay here was absolutely voluntary and free". After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: [...] "Your Excellency's manner was perfect; you spoke beautifully". The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the Lytton Commission as its Chinese assessor received a secret message saying that [...] "...a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me". The representative, posing as an antique dealer, who [...] "...told me he was sent by the Empress: She wanted me to help her escape from Changchun. He said she found life miserable there because she was surrounded in her house by Japanese maids. Every movement of hers was watched and reported". Koo said he was [...] "touched", but he could do nothing to help Wanrong escape, which her brother Rong Qi said was the [...] "final blow" [...] to her, leading her into a downward spiral. Right from the start, the Japanese occupation had sparked much resistance by guerrillas, whom the Kwantung Army called [...] "bandits". General Doihara was able for in exchange for a multi-million bribe to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more prominent guerrilla leaders, the Hui Muslim general Ma Zhanshan to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defense Minister. Much to the intense chagrin of Puyi and his Japanese masters, Ma's defection turned to be ruse, and only months after Puyi appointed him Defense Minister, Ma took his troops over the border to the Soviet Union to continue the struggle against the Japanese.|$|E
