The <b>HAD</b> <b>Scale</b> was translated into Cantonese and administered by an interviewer to 298 Chinese aged 60 or above before their doctor consultations. The acceptance rate of the Scale was 96 % and each interview took only 5 - 10 min to complete. All 298 elderly understood and completed the <b>HAD</b> <b>Scale.</b> Validation of the results of the <b>HAD</b> <b>Scale</b> by the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS) was done on a random sample of 100 elderly. Relative operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the optimal cut-off points of the <b>HAD</b> <b>Scale</b> was a depression score of 6 and an anxiety score of 3. The sensitivity was 80 %, specificity was 90 %, OMR (overall misclassification rate) was 12 %, positive predictive value was 67 % and negative predictive value was 95 %. Thirty-six per cent of the,elderly had scores above these cut-off points. More females than males had high anxiety scores. Nearly half of those with positive HAD scores were not known to have any psychological illness. The <b>HAD</b> <b>Scale</b> has great potential to be used as a screening instrument for psychological illnesses in Cantonese-speaking Chinese elderly all over the world. postprin...|$|E
40|$|The Hospital Anxiety and Depression (<b>HAD)</b> <b>scale,</b> a self-report questionnaire, {{was tested}} {{as a method}} of {{identifying}} mood disorder among patients with operable breast cancer during the year after diagnosis. In a cohort of 91 patients anxiety and depression were assessed preoperatively, and at 3 and 12 months post-operatively, using a standardised psychiatric interview and diagnostic rating criteria. The patients also completed the <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> at each assessment. Fifty out of 91 (55 %) patients were full or borderline cases of depression and/or anxiety at one or more assessment points. Using a receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, the optimum threshold for the preoperative <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> total score to identify psychiatric disorder either preoperatively or at 3 and 12 months post-operatively was 11. With this threshold 70 % of both full and borderline cases occurring at any of the assessment points were correctly identified. The false-positive rate was 12 %. This approach was particularly sensitive to full cases, correctly identifying 90 % of them. The potential for the preoperative <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> total score to identify mood disorder in the year after diagnosis was influenced by age. Among women aged less than 50 years, a preoperative <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> total score > or = 11 provided a highly sensitive indicator of mood disorder (full and borderline cases) {{at any time in the}} year after diagnosis (sensitivity = 90 %). The false-positive rate was 40 %. Among women older than 50 who experienced a mood disorder, only 57 % were correctly identified by a <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> total score of > or = 11 (sensitivity = 57 %). However, the false-positive rate among older women was low (3 %). This simple preoperative screening approach can be used to identify patients who have or are at high risk of developing severe mood disorder in the year after diagnosis. The <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> is also sensitive to the detection of borderline mood disorder in patients under the age of 50. It is a specific screening tool among patients over 50, but is not sensitive to the detection of borderline mood disorder in this age group...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{association}} between deprivation and degraded health {{is well documented}} {{as well as the}} links between morbi-mortality and risk behaviours. We examine the associations between deprivation, self- perceived health and anxiodepressive disorders. Methods: The study population is consultants from health examination centers in Central Western France. Each participant completed a self administered questionnaire including three validated scales (EPICES deprivation scale, Duke health profile and Hospital Anxiety and Depression (<b>HAD)</b> <b>scale).</b> All psychoactive drugs were recorded. Results: We have studied 6, 211 volunteers. The mean values of all 10 dimensions of the Duke health profile decreased significantly with an increasing level of deprivation. Anxiety and depression, measured with the <b>HAD</b> <b>scale,</b> increased with deprivation level. Psychoactive drugs consumption was highest in the most deprived. The inadequacy of detection and care was seen in the most deprived from the comparison between psychoactive drug consumption and <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> results. Conclusion: The deprived are a priority population for health examination centers. Detecting psychological disorders with validated questionnaires is necessary, in order to propose appropriate health care. Prat Organ Soins. 2010; 41 (4) : 313 - 32...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the effects of {{personality}} (tempera-ment and character) on specific depression and specific anxiety. A total of 541 Japanese undergraduates were investigated by using the Tempera-ment and Character Inventory (TCI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depres-sion (<b>HAD)</b> <b>scale.</b> Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that specific depression was predicted by lower Reward-Dependence, Per-sistence, Self-Directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-Transcendence; spe-cific anxiety was predicted by higher Novelty-Seeking, Harm-Avoidance, Persistence, and Self-Transcendence, and lower Self-Directedness. Imma-turity of Self-Directedness is a risk factor for negative affectivity. Imma-turity of all character dimensions is a risk factor for specific depression.

40|$|Objectives. To {{compare the}} fit of various factor {{solutions}} for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983). Design. A cross-sectional postal survey was used to collect the data from community-based participants in the West of Scotland Twenty- 07 study. Methods. The <b>HAD</b> <b>scale,</b> a 14 -item self-administered measure of anxiety and depression, was completed by 2547 participants from three age cohorts (aged approximately 18, 39 and 58 years). Using confirmatory factor analyses four models suggested by prior exploratory factor analyses were compared to a model derived from Clark and Watson's (1991) tripartite theory of anxiety and depression. Results. The model derived from the tripartite theory of anxiety and depression (with factors labelled negative affectivity, anhedonic depression and autonomic anxiety) produced the closest fit to the data. This model produced a good fit in all three cohorts although group comparisons suggested that there were variations in the strength of some factor loadings across the three age groups. A model that had a hierarchical arrangement of the three factors in the tripartite model was also produced. This model fit the data equally as well as did the 'flat' tripartite model. Conclusions. Three factors appear to underlie the <b>HAD</b> <b>scale.</b> Research is needed that examines whether or not using sub-scales based on these factors increases {{the ability of the}} <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> to detect cases of anxiety and depression...|$|E

40|$|A Swedish/Norwegian {{head and}} neck cancer study was {{designed}} to assess prospectively the levels of mental distress and psychiatric morbidity in a heterogeneous sample of newly diagnosed {{head and neck}} cancer patients. A total of 357 patients were included. The mean age was 63 years, and 72 % were males. The patients were asked to answer the <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) six times during 1 year. The number of possible or probable cases of anxiety or depression disorder was calculated according to standardized cut-offs. Approximately one-third of the patients scored as a possible or probable case of a major mood disorder at each measurement point during the study year. There were new cases of anxiety or depression at each time point. The anxiety level was highest at diagnosis, while depression was most common during treatment. Females were more anxious than males at diagnosis, and patients under 65 years of age scored higher than those over 65. Patients with lower performance status and more advanced disease reported higher levels of mental distress and more often scored as a probable or possible cases of psychiatric disorder. Our psychometric analyses supported the two-dimensional structure and stability of the <b>HAD</b> <b>scale.</b> The <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> seems to be the method of choice for getting valid information about the probability of mood disorder in head and neck cancer populations.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} {{the presence or absence}} of the symptoms of anxiety and depression compared with the 48 h pad test as an objective measure of incontinence. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Urodynamics clinic in a large teaching hospital. Subjects: All patients with urinary incontinence attending for urodynamic assessment from 23. 4. 96 to 29. 10. 96. Interventions: 48 h pad test, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (<b>HAD</b> <b>scale).</b> Main outcome measures: Urodynamic diagnosis of cause of incontinence. Urinary loss over 48 h as measured by weight change in pads. Presence of symptoms of anxiety or depression as defined by <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> score of 8 or more. Results: Urodynamic investigation was performed for incontinence on 133 patients. Of these 127 (95. 4 %) completed the <b>HAD</b> <b>scale</b> questionnaire. Of the 43 patients (32. 2 %) who returned the pads 18 (41. 8 %) patients were found to have symptoms of anxiety and six patients (13. 9 %) had symptoms of depression. Patients with symptoms of anxiety had lower mean measured urinary loss over a 48 h period compared to women with no symptoms of anxiety (median loss 44. 2 ml range 6. 8 – 622. 4 versus 97. 1 ml range 8. 2 – 4384. 4 ml) (P= 0. 05). There was no significant association between symptoms of depression and pad test results. Conclusions: Patients presenting with incontinence who have symptoms of anxiety are on average less incontinent compared to than those without symptoms of anxiety.

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between tinnitus and psychiatric disorders {{is a matter}} of controversy and there are few studies on antidepressants and psychotherapy in the treatment of tinnitus. Aims: To determine the prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses and to investigate the screening performance of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (<b>HAD</b> <b>Scale)</b> in a consecutive series of tinnitus patients. To elucidate the clinical significance of the severity of tinnitus and to study the benefits of antidepressants and psychotherapy in the treatment of severe refractory tinnitus. Subjects and Methods: Only patients without socially disabling hearing loss were included. One study group consisted of 82 consecutive patients and two other groups (n = 76, n = 68) were deemed by screening to be at high risk for severe and disabling tinnitus. The severity of tinnitus was assessed by clinical gradings, using the Tinnitus Severity Questionnaire (TSQ) and VAS-scales for annoyance and loudness. DSM criteria were used to identify psychiatric disorders, and the <b>HAD</b> <b>Scale,</b> the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS-S-A) and the Hamilton rating scales (HAM-D, HAM-A) were used to assess the severity of anxiety and depression. Patients were randomly assigned to 16 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo (n= 38) or sertralin (n= 38). Thirty-seven patients received group psychotherapy in 8 one-hour sessions over a 3 month period. Changes in the severity of symptoms were the primary outcome. Results: Lifetime depressive and anxiety disorders were recorded in 62 % and 45 % of the cases, respectively. The <b>HAD</b> <b>Scale</b> was better at detecting depression than anxiety disorders. Significant correlations were found between the severity of tinnitus and the severity of depression and anxiety. Sertraline showed to be more effective than placebo (p= 0. 024) in decreasing reported tinnitus severity according to the TSQ, and perceived tinnitus loudness (p= 0. 014). Comparisons between the group psychotherapy and placebo groups revealed no benefits {{at the end of the}} intervention period. However, at follow-up 3 months later a significant improvement in anxiety (p< 0. 01) was recorded for the psychotherapy group. Conclusions: There is a close association between tinnitus and psychiatric disorders. The <b>HAD</b> <b>Scale</b> is a handy and useful instrument for screening for psychiatric disorders, especially depression, in tinnitus patients. The severity of tinnitus is associated with psychiatric disorders, as well as with the severity of anxiety and depression in tinnitus patients. Sertraline is more effective than placebo in the treatment of severe refractory tinnitus. Group psychotherapy does not reduce tinnitus but might be beneficial in terms of anxiety reduction...|$|E
