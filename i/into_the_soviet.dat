His remarks are credited by Dainis Īvāns, leader of the Popular Front of Latvia, with galvanizing the independence movement in Latvia.|$|E
5|$|When Lithuania {{declared}} {{its independence from}} Russia in 1918, the song was declared the national anthem. It held this status until Lithuania was annexed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union during World War II. During the interwar period, there had been suggestions to modify the words to include a reference to God. It was decided, in Kudirka's memory, that the lyrics should remain as he had written them.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in very poor {{condition}} following an accidental collision {{with the heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen late in the war. Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, emerged from the war largely unscathed, and as a result, was seized by the Soviet Navy as war reparations, and commissioned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E

5|$|Germany {{had been}} de facto divided, and two {{independent}} states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were created within {{the borders of}} Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence. Most eastern and central European countries fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Manstein was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 11th Army after its previous commander, Colonel-General Eugen Ritter von Schobert, perished when his plane landed in a Soviet minefield. The 11th Army was tasked with invading the Crimean Peninsula, capturing Sevastopol, and pursuing enemy forces on the flank of Army Group South during its advance <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Hitler's intention was to prevent the Red Army from using airbases there, and {{to cut off the}} Soviet supply of oil from the Caucasus.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} used in Lithuania's first period of {{independence}} (in the 20th century) from 1918 to 1940, which ceased with the occupation first by Soviet Russia and Lithuania's illegal annexation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, and then by Nazi Germany (1941–44). During the post-World War II Soviet occupation, from 1945 until 1989, the Soviet Lithuanian flag consisted first of a generic red Soviet flag {{with the name of}} the republic, then changed to the red flag with white and green bars at the bottom. The last alteration to the current flag occurred in 2004, when the aspect ratio changed from 1:2 to 3:5.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the long}} term, Tchaikovsky's {{influence}} over the Belyayev composers was not as great. Though they remained more eclectic in their musical approach and focused more on absolute music than The Five had done, they continued writing overall in a style more akin to Rimsky-Korsakov than to Tchaikovsky. Even Glazunov backed away from echoing Tchaikovsky strongly in his mature work, instead amalgamating nationalistic and cosmopolitan styles in an eclectic approach. The Belyayev composers also spread the nationalist musical aesthetic to Russia {{as a whole and}} were themselves an influence on composers well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> era.|$|E
5|$|The 1st and 2nd SS Infantry Brigades, {{which had}} been formed from surplus {{concentration}} camp guards of the SS-TV, and the SS Cavalry Brigade moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union behind the advancing armies. At first they fought Soviet partisans, but by the autumn of 1941, they left the anti-partisan role to other units and actively {{took part in the}} Holocaust. While assisting the Einsatzgruppen, they formed firing parties that participated in the liquidation of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union.|$|E

The Service learns that after destroying Blofeld's castle in Japan, Bond suffered a head injury and developed amnesia. Having lived as a Japanese fisherman for several months, Bond travelled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union to learn his true identity.

5|$|Hitler {{felt that}} the planned {{extermination}} of the Jews was too difficult and important to be entrusted to the military. In 1941 the Einsatzgruppen were sent <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union to begin large-scale genocide of Jews, Romani people, and communists. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related agencies killed {{more than two million}} people, including 1.3 million Jews. The largest mass shooting perpetrated by the Einsatzgruppen was at Babi Yar outside Kiev, where 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation on 29–30 September 1941. In the Rumbula massacre (November–December 1941), 25,000 victims from the Riga ghetto were killed. Another mass shooting early in 1942 claimed the lives of over 10,000 Jews in Kharkov.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Khrushchev {{was on the}} Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko {{proposed}} a massive counteroffensive in the Kharkov area. Stalin approved {{only part of the}} plan, but 640,000Red Army soldiers would still become involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to attack at Kharkov, and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off. Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000soldiers, including more than 200,000men captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the army}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, the Einsatzgruppen rounded up and killed Jews and others deemed {{undesirable}} by the Nazi state. Hitler was sent frequent reports. In addition, 2.8 million Soviet {{prisoners of war}} died of starvation, mistreatment or executions in just eight months of 1941–42. As many as 500,000 Soviet prisoners of war died or were executed in Nazi concentration camps {{over the course of}} the war; most of them were shot or gassed. By early 1941, following Himmler's orders, ten concentration camps had been constructed in which inmates were subjected to forced labour. Jews from all over Germany and the occupied territories were deported to the camps or confined to ghettos. As the Germans were pushed back from Moscow in December 1941, signalling that the expected quick defeat of the Soviet Union had failed to materialize, Hitler and other Nazi officials realised that mass deportations to the east would no longer be possible. As a result, instead of deportation, many Jews in Europe were destined for death.|$|E
50|$|After {{combined}} German and Soviet aggression on Poland, Huta Stepańska, {{together with}} whole Volhynian Voivodeship, was annexed by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and was incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ukrainian <b>Soviet</b> Socialist Republic.

5|$|Soviet rule of Estonia was re-established by force, and sovietisation followed, {{which was}} mostly {{carried out in}} 1944–1950. The forced {{collectivisation}} of agriculture began in 1947, and was completed after the mass deportation of Estonians in March 1949. All private farms were confiscated, and farmers were made to join the collective farms. An armed resistance movement of 'forest brothers' was active until the mass deportations. A total of 30,000 participated or supported the movement; 2,000 were killed. The Soviet authorities fighting the forest brothers suffered also hundreds of deaths. Among those killed on both sides were innocent civilians. Besides the armed resistance of the forest brothers, a number of underground nationalist schoolchildren groups were active. Most of their members were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The punitive actions decreased rapidly after Joseph Stalin's death in 1953; from 1956–58, {{a large part of}} the deportees and political prisoners were allowed to return to Estonia. Political arrests and numerous other crimes against humanity were committed all through the occupation period until the late 1980s. After all, the attempt to integrate Estonian society <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> system failed. Although the armed resistance was defeated, the population remained anti-Soviet. This helped the Estonians to organise a new resistance movement in the late 1980s, regain their independence in 1991, and then rapidly develop a modern society.|$|E

5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{operation}} was to take Salla, and then to proceed eastward along the railway to capture Kandalaksha, and to cut the Murmansk Railway line which connected Murmansk with Russia. To accomplish this, the German-Finnish forces advanced in two main groups: one led by the XXXVI Corps in the north, and one by the Finnish III Corps in the south. For XXXVI Corps part, the 169th Division advanced in a three-pronged, frontal attack against the defense line along the Tenniö River. Further south the Finnish 6th Division attempted a flanking operation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> rear from Kuusamo. They had to advance through difficult terrain to the northeast and capture the towns of Alakurtti and Kayraly (Kairala). Finnish III Corps was placed {{under the command of}} Army High Command Norway for {{the operation}}. There they would meet up with the German divisions. Both divisions were supported by the 6th SS Mountain Division that advanced in the centre along the Salla – Kandalaksha road in a frontal assault against the defensive line.|$|E

5|$|With Soviet troops already {{stationed}} in the country according to the Mutual Assistance Treaty, {{it was impossible to}} mount effective military resistance. On June 15, Lithuania unconditionally accepted the ultimatum and lost its independence. The Soviets sought to show the world {{that this was not a}} military occupation and annexation, but a legitimate socialist revolution, initiated by the local population demanding to join the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviets followed semi-legal procedures: they took control of the government institutions, installed a new puppet government, and carried out show elections to the People's Seimas. During its first session, the Seimas proclaimed creation of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and petitioned to be admitted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. The petition was officially accepted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 3, 1940. At the same time almost identical processes took place in Latvia and Estonia. Lithuania would not regain its independence until the proclamation of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania on March 11, 1990.|$|E
