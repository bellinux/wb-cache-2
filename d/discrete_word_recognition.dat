40|$|Determining the {{perceived}} quality of packet audio under packet loss usually requires human-based Mean Opinion Score (MOS) listening tests. We propose a new MOS estimation method based on machine speech recognition. Its automated, machine-based nature facilitates real-time monitoring of transmission quality {{without the need}} to conduct time-consuming listening tests. Our evaluation of this new method shows that it can use the <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> ratio metric to reliably predict perceived quality. In particular, we find that although the absolute <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> ratio of a speech recognizer may {{vary depending on the}} speaker, the relative <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> ratio, obtained by dividing the absolute <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> ratio with its own value at 0 % loss, is speaker-independent. Therefore the relative <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> ratio is well suited as a universal, speaker-independent MOS predictor. Finally we have also conducted human-based <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> tests and examined its relationship with machine-based recognition results. Our analysis shows that they are correlated although not very linearly. Also we find that human-based <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> ratio does not degrade significantly once packet loss is larg...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. One {{of the major}} tasks facing cognitive psychologists is to understand how humans recognise words. Models of <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> are influenced heavily by experimental research, {{and one of the}} most robust findings is that frequently used words (eg "house") are recognised faster than rare words (eg "larch"). However there is debate over the exact nature of this 'frequency effect', particularly whether it reflects the earliest stages of word perception. Related to this issue is the question of whether <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> competes for attention with other tasks (eg driving a car). Many theories assume that <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> can occur automatically, and therefore it should not matter if we are engaged on another task. However, recent research has suggested this may not be the case and that <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> does require attention. This project uses a "dual-task" method where participants perform two tasks in quick succession, one of which involves <b>word</b> <b>recognition.</b> Through manipulation of the frequency of the words involved, the technique will be used to demonstrate the role of frequency at different stages of <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> and the degree to which word processing places demands on attention.

Abstract: Objective: To investigate <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in noise in subjects treated in childhood with chemotherapy, study benefits of open-fitting hearing-aids for <b>word</b> <b>recognition,</b> and investigate whether self-reported hearing-handicap corresponded to subjects' <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> ability. Design: Subjects diagnosed with cancer and treated with platinum-based chemotherapy in childhood underwent audiometric evaluations. Study Sample: Fifteen subjects (eight females and seven males) fulfilled the criteria set for the study, and four of those received customized open-fitting hearing-aids. Results: Subjects with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity had severe difficulties recognizing words in noise, and scored as low as 54 % below reference scores standardized for age and degree of hearing loss. Hearing-impaired subjects' self-reported hearing-handicap correlated significantly with <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in a quiet environment but not in noise. <b>Word</b> <b>recognition</b> in noise improved markedly (up to 46 %) with hearing-aids, and the self-reported hearing-handicap and disability score were reduced by more than 50 %. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of testing <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in noise in subjects treated with platinum-based chemotherapy in childhood, and to use specific custom-made questionnaires to evaluate the experienced hearing-handicap. Open-fitting hearing-aids are a good alternative for subjects suffering from poor <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in noise...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{relative}} contributions of phonological, semantic radical, and morphological awareness to Chinese <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) children.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the relationship between <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> ability, knowledge of orthographic structures, and use of orthographic knowledge in <b>word</b> <b>recognition.</b> Fifty-six first and second graders were admini-stered a <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> test, two tests of orthographic knowledge, and two search tasks. The results indicated that when searching for multiple word targets children with <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> levels of less than 2 - 2 searched similarly through all fields, whereas children with <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> levels of 2 - 2 + searched faster through pseudowords and nonwords than through words. When searching for members of a category, children with <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> levels below 2 - 1 searched faster through nonwords and pseudowords than through words providing no evidence for the use of orthography in word search. Children with <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> levels above 2 - 1 searched faster through nonwords than through pseudowords and words, demonstrating a generalized effect of orthographic structure.

As such, semantic processes constrain alternatives at the feature analytic level but are themselves constrained by feature analysis.

The correlation and regression analyses showed that the strength of association was much stronger between <b>word</b> <b>recognition,</b> working memory, and reading comprehension in time constraint than that in non-time constraint reading condition. Study two examined whether FL readers were able to operate metacognitive reading strategies as a compensatory way of reading comprehension for inefficient <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> and working memory limitation in non-time constraint reading.

30|$|Hypotheses. Based {{on prior}} work in visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition,</b> one would hypothesize that degree (i.e., {{the number of}} words that are orthographically similar to the target word) {{facilitates}} lexical processing (i.e., faster and more accurate responses in the lexical decision and speeded naming tasks). However, it is unclear whether the clustering coefficient and closeness centrality measures might influence recognition and reading times and accuracies as this paper represents the first attempt to investigate if similarity measures derived from an orthographic network representation influence visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition.</b> Given previous investigations showing the influence of phonological clustering coefficient and closeness centrality on spoken <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> (Chan & Vitevitch, 2009; Goldstein & Vitevitch, 2017), however, one might expect that the orthographic measures of clustering coefficient and closeness centrality to have some influence on visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> as well.|$|R
