40|$|Currently in the {{development}} of Informational Retrieval (<b>IR)</b> systems, <b>a</b> set of keywords represents the semantics of a text document and after assigning weights to the set of keywords, they are used for indexing, searching and retrieval purposes. The current approaches for assigning weights are provided by <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> model that is used by <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> system. The main objective of the weight assignment was to provide ranking feature to <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> system. The retrieval performance of <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> system mainly depends on two parameters: extraction of a good set of keywords from text documents and the use of a good weight assignment approach. Most of currently available weight assignment approaches do not suggest any change to the weights of keywords after their initial assignment. It means that these approaches are static. In this study, we propose a dynamic weight assignment approach for weight assignment. In our opinion, using this proposed approach can be helpful in improving the retrieval performance of <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> system. This approach can be used as part of any IR model after initial assignment of weights...|$|R
40|$|Having {{convinced}} of the potential of hybrid rice, Rice Research Institute, Kala Shah Kaku began a research project with the objectives to evaluate local and exotic genetic material for their use in hybrid rice breeding programme; to evaluate existing hybrids for yield, adaptability and grain quality and to initiate hybrid rice breeding {{for the development of}} parental lines. From 1993 to 2006, 800 exotic rice hybrids were evaluated for yield, adaptability and heterosis. Heterosis of hybrids varied from 8 to 142 % over local check variety KS 282. A number of exotic hybrids out yielded the check variety but could not be popularized due to their poor cooking qualities. Six hundred eight test crossed were evaluated. The Institute has 22 CMS lines, 38 restorers and 52 maintainers from 608 testcrosses. Local germplasm have the more frequency of maintainers than restorers. <b>IR</b> 58025 <b>A,</b> <b>IR</b> 79156 <b>A,</b> <b>IR</b> 68897 <b>A,</b> <b>IR</b> 68886 <b>A,</b> <b>IR</b> 73328 <b>A,</b> <b>IR</b> 75596 <b>A,</b> <b>IR</b> 70369 <b>A</b> and <b>IR</b> 79128 <b>A</b> were selected for the development of hybrid rice {{on the basis of their}} better floral and agronomic characteristics.

30|$|Satellite imagery {{including}} <b>an</b> infrared (<b>IR)</b> wavelength {{had been}} trialled by three (18 %) companies and was regularly used by six (35 %) companies (Table  1). While three (18 %) companies had never considered acquiring <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> wavelength, three (18 %) didn’t believe there were benefits, five (29 %) suggested {{the cost was}} unjustifiable, and one (6 %) said they lacked the staff knowledge {{to work with the}} data. Survey responses showed that acquisition of <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> wavelength provided companies with the same benefits as three visible band (Red Green Blue, RGB) photography or imagery, but also the ability to map and quantify mixed species stands, to detect vegetation change and growth differences over time, to identify invasive species (Pinus contorta Doug.), to detect disease, and to identify areas where erosion had occurred. While more applications were possible with the inclusion of <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> wavelength, spatial resolution generally declined (Figure  2). This {{is not to say that}} the inclusion of <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> band necessarily degrades spatial resolution, but rather that acquisition of very high resolution aerial photography was typically done with a RGB sensor, while the IR band was often only collected in satellite imagery with lower resolution.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new concept “conformal theories with <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> cutoff’, after {{pointing out that the}} following two categories in SU(3) gauge theories with fundamental N f fermions possess <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> fixed point: Large N f (Ncf ≤ N f ≤ 16) QCD within the conformal window (referred as Conformal QCD) and small N f (1 ≤ N f ≤ Ncf − 1) QCD at temperature T/Tc> 1 (referred as High Temper-ature QCD). In the case of Conformal QCD in the continuum limit, the compact space and/or time gives <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> cutoff. In the case of High Temperature QCD, the temperature T plays a role of <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> cutoff together with a cutoff due to possible compact space, depending on how to take the continuum limit. We note any lattice calculation is performed on a finite lattice. Thus any calculation on a lattice possesses <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> cutoff. In the conformal theories with <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> cutoff there exists the “conformal region ” together with the confining region and the deconfining region. We verify numerically on a lattice of the size 163 × 64 the existence of the conformal region and the non-trivial Z(3) structure of the vacuum and the Yukawa-type decay form of meson propagators in the conformal region. We stress that High Temperature QCD is intrinsically accompanied with <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> cutoff. Therefore the understanding the vacuum structure and the property of correlation functions is the key to resolve long standing issues in High Temperature QCD. We further argue that there is a precise correspondence between Conformal QCD and High Tem-perature QCD in the temporal propagators under the change of the parameters N f and T/Tc re-spectively: the one boundary is close to meson states and the other is close to free quark states. In particular, we find the correspondence between Conformal QCD with N f = 7 and High Tem-perature QCD with N f = 2 at T ∼ 2 Tc being in close relation to a meson unparticle model. From this we estimate the anomalous mass dimension γ ∗ = 1. 2 (1) for N f = 7...|$|R

We consider the room easily controllable with <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> remote {{control of a}} home device. The room has automatic standby power cut-off outlets, a light, and a ZigBee hub. The ZigBee hub has <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> code learning function and educates the IR remote control signal of a home device connected to the power outlet. Then the power outlets and {{the light in the}} room can be controlled with <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> remote control. <b>A</b> typical automatic standby power cut-off outlet has a waiting time before cutting off the electric power. It consumes standby power during that time. To eliminate the waiting time, we turn off the home device and the power outlet simultaneously with <b>an</b> <b>IR</b> remote control through the ZigBee hub. This method actively reduces the standby power. The proposed HEMS provides easy way to add, delete, and move home devices to other power outlets. When a home device is moved to the different outlet, the energy information of the home device is kept consistently and seamlessly regardless of location change. The proposed architecture gives more efficient energy-saving HEMS 1...|$|R
