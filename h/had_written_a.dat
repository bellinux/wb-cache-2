5|$|In June 2011, Devlin {{confirmed}} {{that he and}} Emmerich <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> treatment for two sequels to form a trilogy; both expressed the desire for Will Smith to return. In October 2011, however, discussions over Smith returning were halted, due to Fox's refusal to provide the $50 million salary demanded by Smith for the two sequels. Emmerich, however, made assurances that the films would be shot back-to-back, regardless of Smith's involvement.|$|E

5|$|Blythe also {{alleged that}} after {{learning}} about Nosek's death, he <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> {{letter to the}} Nosek family, in which he offered help and a meeting in-person. Daniel Nosek's father, however, testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team.

US$530,000).|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Monteverdi {{was in his}} sixties, and his rate of {{composition}} seems to have slowed down. He <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> setting of Strozzi's Proserpina rapita (The Abduction of Proserpina), now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of Scherzi musicali was published in Venice in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi {{was admitted to the}} tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated {{as a member of the}} clergy of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} 1982 to 1991, Godwin {{produced}} another {{collection of short}} fiction and four more novels. According to Publishers Weekly, it was A Mother and Two Daughters (1982) and A Southern Family (1987) that substantially expanded her readership. These novels remained on bestseller lists {{for an extended period}} of time. Godwin's earlier works had sold an average of less than 8,000 copies, while A Mother and Two Daughters sold more than 1.5 million. It was the most popular of Godwin's early works and the first time she <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> narrative from the point-of-view of multiple characters. In 1987, Godwin was awarded the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for her work on The Southern Family.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton is {{not known}} to have ever owned slaves, {{although}} {{members of his family}} were slave owners. At the time of her death, Hamilton's mother owned two slaves named Christian and Ajax, and she <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> will leaving them to her sons; however, due to their illegitimacy, Hamilton and his brother were held ineligible to inherit her property, and never took ownership of the slaves. Later, as a youth in St. Croix, Hamilton worked for a company trading in commodities that included slaves. During his career, Hamilton did occasionally purchase or sell slaves for others as their legal representative, and one of Hamilton's grandsons interpreted some of these journal entries as being purchases for himself.|$|E
5|$|Hugh died on 7 February 1235, at his episcopal {{residence}} at Stow Park. He was buried on 10 February 1235 in Lincoln Cathedral, {{in the north}} aisle.

He left bequests to his family, his household, Lincoln Cathedral, {{and a number of}} monasteries in his diocese. What was left after the specific legacies was to be divided between poor religious houses, such as the Barrow Gurney Nunnery, students and teachers at Oxford University, Jewish converts and the poor on the episcopal manors.|$|E

5|$|John Stanford {{hoped that}} his son would follow him into the legal {{profession}} but accepted his decision to pursue music as a career. However, he stipulated that Stanford should have a conventional university education before going on to musical studies abroad. Stanford tried unsuccessfully for a classics scholarship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, but gained an organ scholarship, and later a classics scholarship, at Queens' College. By the time {{he went up to}} Cambridge in 1870 he <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> substantial number of compositions, including vocal music, both sacred and secular, and orchestral works (a rondo for cello and orchestra and a concert overture).|$|E
5|$|Nightclub hypnotist Ronald Pellar, {{also known}} as Ronald Dante or Dr. Dante (1969–1972). The couple met in 1969 in a Los Angeles discotheque and married that same year. After about six months of marriage, Pellar {{disappeared}} {{a few days after}} Turner <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> $35,000 check to him in order to help him in an investment; he used the money for other purposes. In addition, she later accused Dante of stealing $100,000 worth of jewelry from her. Dante denied that he stole from Turner and no charges were ever filed against him.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett had {{his writing}} {{breakthrough}} in 1968 when he interviewed Peter Bander van Duren, co-director {{of a small}} publishing company, Colin Smythe Ltd. During the meeting, Pratchett mentioned he <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> manuscript, The Carpet People. Colin Smythe Ltd published the book in 1971, with illustrations by the author. The book received strong, if few, reviews and {{was followed by the}} science fiction novels The Dark Side of the Sun (10 May 1976) and Strata (15 June 1981).|$|E

5|$|The holonovel was {{intended}} as a vehicle to further explore Janeway's imagination and her social relationships, but critics disagreed on whether the storyline was appropriate for the character. The plotlines introduced in Janeway Lambda one were never fully resolved due to lack of interest from fans of the Voyager series and an attempt to target a male audience; Taylor <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> conclusion for the holonovel, but it was never developed into an episode. Janeway Lambda one was received negatively by television critics who believed it was poorly developed and too isolated from the main storylines of the Voyager series. The show's frequent use and expansion of the holodeck technology was also panned by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{uranium ore}} was {{handed over to}} the Combined Development Trust, a legal entity set up to handle the {{acquisition}} of nuclear ores and materials. Lansdale <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> legal opinion for the Manhattan Project that it was within the powers of the President of the United States to conclude such agreements with the British without consulting Congress. In July 1945, Lansdale concluded an agreement with Brazil for the purchase of 3,000 tons of thorium-bearing monazite ore. For his wartime services, Lansdale was awarded the Legion of Merit and was made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Anbe Vaa {{marked the}} first time AVM Productions <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> script to suit an actor's image and acting style; prior to this they had chosen actors to fit an already {{completed}} script. AVM Productions' founder A. V. Meiyappan's son M. Saravanan, one of the film's producers, recalled in 2013 that, as a fan of M. G. Ramachandran, it was his wish to see him act under the AVM banner. For several days he hesitated to tell his father about this choice, but when he did, he showed support. While Tirulokchandar was writing the script, Meiyappan suggested approaching Ramachandran for the lead role. Tirulokchandar found this intriguing, as the script's genre was dissimilar to what Ramachandran was noted for: action-adventure or social and family dramas which portrayed him as a champion for the downtrodden.|$|E

5|$|Back in 1866, as the {{composer}} of The Brandenburgers with its overtones of German military aggression, Smetana {{thought he might}} be targeted by the invading Prussians, so he absented himself from Prague until hostilities ceased. He returned in September, and almost immediately achieved a long-standing ambition—appointment as principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre, at an annual salary of 1,200gulden. In the absence of a body of suitable Czech opera, Smetana in his first season presented standard works by Weber, Mozart, Donizetti, Rossini and Glinka, with a revival of his own Bartered Bride. The quality of Smetana's production of Glinka's A Life for the Tsar angered Glinka's champion Mily Balakirev, who expressed himself forcefully. This caused prolonged hostility between the two men. On 16May 1868 Smetana, representing Czech musicians, helped to lay the foundation stone for the future National Theatre; he <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> Festive Overture for the occasion. That same evening Smetana's third opera, Dalibor, was premièred at Prague's New Town Theatre. Although its initial reception was warm its reviews were poor, and Smetana resigned himself to its failure.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E
5|$|By 1665, he was {{collecting}} information for his county history, The Antiquities of Berkshire; and in 1672 he published The Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, a lavish folio with illustrations by Wenceslaus Hollar, {{for which he}} had conducted years of research. An earlier attempt to promote himself as the official historiographer of the order had failed but this work firmly established Ashmole as an expert. He <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>a</b> large part of it in 1665 while living in the country to escape the Great Plague which was then raging in London. Presentation copies sent to the foreign members of the order were reciprocated by gifts of gold insignia from the King of Denmark, the Elector of Brandenburg and the Elector Palatine. Ashmole performed the heraldic and genealogical work of his office scrupulously, and he was considered a leading authority on court protocol and ceremony.|$|E
