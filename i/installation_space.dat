25|$|During its lifetime, several {{competing}} products were released for the x86 platform, and MS-DOS went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000. Initially MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access {{not only the}} operating system, but application software and user data as well. Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats, along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures. Ultimately it was the key product in Microsoft's growth from a programming languages company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI. It is a flexible operating system, and consumes negligible <b>installation</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{the center}} of the <b>installation</b> <b>space</b> rests a six-by-six-meter paneled floor; these panels are laced with sensors that can detect your weight, tilt, and velocity. This {{information}} is continuously collected and analyzed, and is then translated into deformations in the lines projected on the floor near the visitor. GPS data of the location in which the installation is housed also affects the projected environment and the lines will change according to shifts in the location's gravity.|$|E

5000|$|When Ryman creates work on {{a larger}} scale the pieces {{interact}} with unique properties of the <b>installation</b> <b>space.</b> Such pieces are found in the corners of spaces or rising and falling from the walls. [...] In Ryman’s 2010 solo exhibition at DCKT Contemporary he showed the work Red Brick which consisted of a series of cut and painted wooden “bricks” stacked upon one another in varying shades of red and pink. In this work Ryman questions geometry, order, and the nature of painting itself.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} fully immerse the <b>installation</b> <b>space</b> {{with the scent}} of her bodily aromas, Wawrzyniak collaborated with the renowned {{professional}} perfumer Yann Vasnier of Givaudan and scent director Dawn Goldworm of 12.29 on synthetically reconstituting the organic essences for diffusion. These aromas were released inside a specially designed scent chamber into which visitors entered to partake in a solitary experience. A limited edition of the original organic essences were displayed in tear shaped chemistry vials as well as three candles that were made of paraffin that was scraped off Wawrzyniak’s body then melted into 250 ml chemistry beakers.|$|E
5000|$|James Webb (born June 20, 1975 in Kimberley, Northern Cape) is a South African artist {{best known}} for his {{interventions}} and installations incorporating sound. Webb also works as a sound designer, curator and teacher. [...] His sound installations place special emphasis on the sourcing and presentation of the sound clips, as well as the social significance and context of these sounds. [...] Often referred to as a [...] "collector of sounds," [...] Webb is interested in the role that aural events play in our everyday life. The physical presentation of the work, including the <b>installation</b> <b>space</b> and the logistics of speakers, are also deliberate choices for Webb.|$|E

30|$|The camera {{base was}} {{equipped}} with a 3 °-of-freedom adjustment device. By using a single-view-point constraint determination method [20] and by adjusting the device, the single-view-point constraint {{was considered to be}} satisfied during camera-mirror assembly, and the installation accuracy of the mechanical structures was guaranteed. There were no changes in the extrinsic parameters of our hardware configuration. The baseline was defined as the distance from the focus of the two mirrors under the unified sphere-imaging model, which was accurately measured directly by a long Vernier caliper. The <b>installation</b> <b>spacing</b> of the vertical baseline was 332  mm, which was used as a ground truth to validate the accuracy of the stereo calibration method.|$|R
50|$|During {{the exhibit}} the <b>installation</b> <b>space</b> is {{considered}} a traditional lodge space. Visitors to the exhibit are asked not to use cameras or other electronic devices, to remove their shoes, and to be smudged before entering the space. Each visitor is offered a tobacco tie to hold in the left hand, which is closest to the heart, before entering the exhibit area, which is covered in red cloth. Visitors move clockwise through the display area, and are asked {{to stay on the}} red cloth, not stepping on or over the vamps. At the end, they return the ties, which are later burned in a sacred fire. Native elders and volunteers are on hand to answer questions, or to hear visitors' impressions after the visit.|$|E
50|$|The {{department}} is based between four buildings sited {{on the north}} side of the Bailrigg Campus of Lancaster University. The main building, known as The LICA Building was opened in 2010, designed by the architect James Jones of Sheppard Robson, and houses purpose build performance spaces, installation spaces, lecture spaces, seminar rooms, design laboratories and art studios as well as several small outbuildings used as student meeting rooms. In 2011 the Lancaster Institute for the Contemporary Arts (LICA) became the first higher education building and only the second building ever to receive a BREEAM Outstanding rating post-completion. The main Art building is the Bowland Annex, adjacent to the LICA Building, housing the rest of the Fine Art studios, an <b>installation</b> <b>space,</b> wood workshop, and practical teaching spaces.|$|E

40|$|This {{descriptive}} study aimed to verify if the hospitals located in Sobral-CE, Brazil present adequate sanitary <b>installations,</b> <b>spaces</b> in lecture halls, elevators, escape routes and parking places {{for people with}} physical impairments. It was based on NBR 9050 by the ABNT with a checklist instrument. The data was collected in May 2004. The sample consisted of the four existing hospitals. Two hospitals have sanitary installations with adapted sanitary apparatus and sink. None of them contain accessible dressing rooms or toilets. There are neither elevators, escaping routes, reserved parking spaced, nor accessibility signs. Thus, the need is evidenced to comply with legal standards {{in order to achieve}} accessibility for people with physical impairments. ...|$|R
