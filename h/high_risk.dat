5|$|A <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> days. Such days are rare; a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> days). <b>High</b> <b>risk</b> areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of TB {{involves}} screening {{those at}} <b>high</b> <b>risk,</b> {{early detection and}} treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment {{requires the use of}} multiple antibiotics {{over a long period of}} time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{disclosure}} of the triple bottom line in the industry are included in the group of environment and social <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> industry. Triple Bottom Line is used is divided into three key performance indicators; economic performance, social performance, and environment performance. Components used in this study is constructed component by GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) which consists of 65 items. Object of this study is 30 environment <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> industry and 30 social <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> industry. Results of this study showed that the average disclosure on the triple bottom line of environment <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> industry as much as 28. 83 and social <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> industry as much as 30. 20 from 65 items. Highest item expressed by both the industry groups are the items included economic performance with code EC 1 item. While the lowest item is included in the item SO 3 from social performance. While testing the T-Test showed the Sig.

5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). <b>High</b> <b>risk</b> people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{released}} a report that estimates an increase in risk for specific cancers for certain subsets of the population inside the Fukushima Prefecture. A 2013 WHO report predicts that for populations living in the most affected areas there is a 70% <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of developing thyroid cancer for girls exposed as infants (the risk has risen from a lifetime risk of 0.75% to 1.25%), a 7% <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of leukemia in males exposed as infants, a 6% <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of breast cancer in females exposed as infants and a 4% <b>higher</b> <b>risk,</b> overall, of developing solid cancers for females.|$|R
30|$|This {{relationship}} can {{be due to}} different characteristics of industries based on industry concentration. Firms in highly concentrated industries have higher size and profitability and have usually <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> profile (MacKay and Phillips 2005). This <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> {{can be related to}} the incentives provided to equity holders in case of high bankruptcy chances due to <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> (Brander and Lewis (1986). This accounts for the negative relationship between industry concentration and leverage of the firm.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the short and}} long term benefits of a school and home based physical activity “enrichment” program for children at <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of cardiovascular disease as identified by cluster analysis. Study Design: During two 10 -week school terms, 800 11 -year-olds took part in a randomized controlled trial with the standard physical activity and nutrition program in six schools, the standard program in a further seven schools but with the addition of physical activity enrichment for <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> children in those schools, and no program in five control schools. Cluster analysis identifying the 29 % or so <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> children used systolic blood pressure, percent body fat, physical fitness, and blood cholesterol. Results: Fitness improved significantly in program schools, particularly with enrichment in <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> boys. Substantial improvements persisted 6 months later in girls from program schools. At “Enrichment” schools, cholesterol showed significant benefits in <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> girls and, 6 months later, in both boys and <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> girls. Sodium intake and, in girls, subscapular skinfolds were lower in “Enrichment” schools when the program ended, but not 6 months later. Conclusion: Two-semester health programs with physical activity enrichment for <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> children can produce benefits sustained for at least 6 months. Improvements extend to lower risk children exposed indirectly to the enrichment. Attenuation of effects on diet and body composition in the longer-term suggest the need for on-going programs...|$|R

5|$|Significant {{severe weather}} was ongoing {{at the start}} of April 27 and {{continued}} for the entire day virtually unbroken. For the second day in a row, the SPC issued a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of severe weather for the Southern United States, and late that morning the SPC increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an extremely rare issuance exceeding the <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> standards.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} meaning of <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> status to women {{undergoing}} prenatal maternal screening for chromosomal anomalies. Quotations from lightly structured interviews and transcripts of pre-screening consultations in suburban London are used to illustrate pregnant women's diverse responses to the offer of screening, and to entering, living with and exiting from <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> status. Some women reject screening {{in order to avoid}} the psychosocial and medical <b>risks</b> associated with <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> status, or because they rule out pregnancy termination. They may question the risk selection implicitly built into the provision of preventative systems for some health problems but not others. Women who screen at <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> may challenge this designation by questioning the system-specific probability used to separate them from the lower risk population. However, some experience distress even when they appreciate the precautionary basis on which their <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> designation is based. They may find disengagement from <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> status difficult after a diagnostic test has ruled out chromosomal anomalies. The findings highlight the complexity of communicating risk information to pregnant women and other screened populations, and emphasise the need to support those living with <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> status and the benefits of keeping the time lived with this status as short as possible.

However, Black women maintained more than a 2. 5 -fold <b>higher</b> <b>risk,</b> and women over age 40 had a ten-fold <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of embolism mortality.
