Chirithy {{claims that the}} events of the Keyblade War have really been a dream the player has had ever since turning down Ava's offer to join the Dandelions (although in Unchained χ, it is revealed that the player is actually sent to the Unchained Realm by Ephemer and Skuld) and the two decide to rest after confronting a wall of thorns. On {{the other side of the}} thorns, Maleficent (who is heavily implied to have found the Book of Prophecies) congratulates herself with what she has accomplished whilst wondering where Pete <b>is.</b> <b>Confident</b> <b>that</b> Sora and company cannot meddle in this world, she contemplates on conquering this iteration of her home world that she has entered in.|$|E

However, Pam consistently silences any attempt to bring up the device, saying she knows Dwight and <b>is</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> he will stop the device on his own. After complimenting Dwight numerous times and having a small meal, Pam makes a joke that emphasizes that everyone is human and makes mistakes.|$|E
5|$|As Buoso Donati lies {{dead in his}} curtained four-poster bed, his {{relatives}} gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning {{the contents of his}} will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who <b>is</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E

Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone {{in on his}} office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to {{identify}} two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E

25|$|When {{either of}} the two Houses of the Parliament of India is not in session, and if the {{government}} feels the need for an immediate procedure, the President can promulgate ordinances which have the same force and effect as an act passed by Parliament under its legislative powers. These are in the nature of interim or temporary legislation and their continuance is subject to parliamentary approval. Ordinances remain valid for no more than six weeks from the date the Parliament is convened unless approved by it earlier. Under , the President as the upholder of the constitution shall be satisfied that immediate action is mandatory as advised by the union cabinet and he <b>is</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> the government commands majority support in the Parliament needed for the passing of the ordinance into an act and Parliament can be summoned to deliberate on the passing of the ordinance as soon as possible. The promulgated ordinance is treated as an act of Parliament when in force and {{it is the responsibility of}} the President to withdraw the ordinance as soon as the reasons for promulgation of the ordinance are no longer applicable. Bringing laws in the form of ordinances has become a routine matter by the government and President, but the provisions made in Article 123 are meant for mitigating unusual circumstances where immediate action is inevitable when the extant provisions of law are inadequate. Re-promulgation of ordinances after failing to get approval within the stipulated time of both houses of parliament is an unconstitutional act by the President. President should not incorporate any matter in an ordinance which is violating the constitution or needs amendment to the constitution. The President should take moral responsibility when an ordinance elapses automatically or is not approved by the Parliament or violating the constitution.|$|E

500|$|After this initiation, Lucius {{moves to}} Rome and joins its main temple to the goddess, the Iseum Campense. Urged by more visions {{sent by the}} gods, he {{undergoes}} two more initiations, incurring more expenses—such as having to buy a replacement for the cloak he left behind at Cenchreae—each time. These initiations are not described in as much detail as the first. The second is dedicated to Osiris and {{is said to be}} different from the one dedicated to Isis. Apuleius calls it [...] "the nocturnal ecstasies of the supreme god" [...] but gives no other details. The third initiation may be dedicated to both Isis and Osiris. Before this initiation, Lucius has a vision where Osiris himself speaks to him, suggesting that he is the dominant figure in the rite. At the novel's end Lucius has been admitted to a high position in the cult by Osiris himself, and he <b>is</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> the god will ensure his future success in his work as a lawyer.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Horner <b>is</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> he {{can seek}} out the married women {{who are willing to}} have affairs because {{they are the ones who}} do not care about their honor. Horner seems to believe he is in a {{position}} of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him, but his power wanes during the duration of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner’s lodgings despite his protest, conveying “his lower position that alludes to his disguise: a lowly eunuch.” [...] They talk about him as if he was not present, referring to him as a ‘beast,’ ‘toad,’ and eunuch. Cohen says, “As the ladies grow in aggressive self-confidence, Lady Fidget also ‘claps him on the back’ thereby revealing the altered socio-sexual roles that are now presented.” [...] While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women, he has “exhausted his sexual resources and has, in reality, become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognizes him to be.” [...] Horner’s true power is not in relationship to the women, but to the men. He shows his dominance over the men he cuckolds.|$|E

500|$|... "Give Peace a Chance" [...] {{opens with}} Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital's chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) {{implementing}} a new computerized surgical scheduling system, which is disliked {{by many of}} the hospital's staff. Thereafter, Isaac (Faran Tahir), a hospital lab technician, brings Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) a scan of his tumor, which has been declared inoperable by several other physicians due to its complexity. Isaac asks Shepherd to remove it. Shepherd agrees, but Webber refuses permission for the procedure because of the high risk involved. Shepherd ignores the chief's directions and schedules the surgery. The interns and residents all want the chance to assist due to the rarity of such a tumor, so Shepherd hosts a competition in which the winner gets to join him in the operating room. After seeing Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul) make a mistake, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) <b>is</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> she will win the competition, but loses to Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams). Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is not invited to compete because Shepherd wants her to be his caregiver in what would be a long surgery. Knowing that she {{will not be able to}} use the bathroom for the entire procedure, Lexie decides to wear a diaper into the operating room; her courage and dedication impresses Yang.|$|E

Vincent is stunned at the display and becomes emotionally {{overwhelmed}} when he overhears art curator Dr. Black (Bill Nighy) say that Van Gogh was [...] "the greatest painter of them all" [...] and [...] "one of the greatest men who ever lived". They return an emotionally changed Vincent to the past and say their final goodbyes. As the Doctor and Amy return to the present, Amy <b>is</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> there will be hundreds of new paintings by Vincent waiting for them, though the Doctor is less certain. The former is crushed to learn that Vincent still committed suicide weeks after their adventure, at the age of 37. The Doctor explains that life is a mixture of bad and good, and while their brief encounter with Vincent couldn't undo all of the bad, they added some good to his life. The evidence is in Vincent's displayed works: the face no longer appears in The Church, and now Vase with 12 Sunflowers bears the inscription, [...] "For Amy".|$|E
500|$|... "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] {{has been}} labeled as a satire on American politics. Michael Bitzer, in an edited book by Joseph Foy and Stanley Schultz {{entitled}} Homer Simpson Goes to Washington, said this episode [...] "espouses the virtues, vices, and varieties of American political culture, public opinion, {{and ultimately the}} American Dream." [...] Bitzer also wrote that The Simpsons, through [...] "skillful" [...] use of satire, demonstrates with this episode [...] "insights into the underlying political culture and public opinion of the United States' governing system (and, more broadly, society at large)." [...] In his book Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, Paul Arthur Cantor said he was amazed by how far the episode [...] "willing to take its corrosive satire of national politics." [...] He said it [...] "attacks the federal government at its foundation, the patriotic myths upon which its legitimacy lies. It makes fun of the very process by which patriotism is inculcated in the nation's youth, the hokey contests that lead children to outdo each other in progovernment effusions." [...] When the corrupt congressman is arrested, Lisa proclaims [...] "The system works!" [...] Benedict Anderson wrote in the book The Spectre of Comparisons that series creator Matt Groening [...] "assumes that his tickled audience <b>is</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> the system barely works [...] So why does he need to show a patriot at all, especially one who is a deluded little female block-head? Probably because he, too, wishes {{to be seen as}} giving America another chance. Mr. Lisa guarantees his good intentions." ...|$|E
