50|$|Fermentable fibre is more {{beneficial}} for growing puppies, {{and it is}} often considered a prebiotic, meaning it supports the growth of beneficial microflora species in the intestinal tract. Fermentable fibre often contains fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS), both of which greatly stimulate <b>gut</b> <b>health.</b> FOS are fermented by beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria promoting their growth, while most pathogenic bacterial strains such as E. coli, C. perfringens and Salmonella are unable to ferment it. MOS {{has been shown to}} stimulate the immune system and increase resistance to pathogenic bacteria. Beet pulp is generally the standard fermentable fibre used in canine diets, however blends of fermentable fibre sources {{have been shown to be}} as effective at promoting <b>gut</b> <b>health.</b> Although fermentable fibre is extremely beneficial, it should still be added in moderate amounts as addition of fermentable fibre to a concentration of 14.1% or greater will result in lower digestibility of the feed.|$|E

50|$|Although young growing {{dogs have}} {{immature}} gastrointestinal tracts, they do contain microflora which can ferment fibre and generate short chain fatty acids beneficial to <b>gut</b> <b>health.</b> Colonization and establishment of these bacterial populations happens over time, beginning immediately after birth. Even {{with the ability}} for fermentation, addition of fibre to the diet should be done carefully, as fibre will dilute other nutrients in the feed. There are different types of fibre, all are made of carbohydrates, and NRC classifies them into fermentable and non-fermentable carbohydrates. Fermentable carbohydrates are generally 3-10 monosaccharide units joined by glycosidic bonds which cannot be degraded by endogenous enzymes and require the fermentation processes of intestinal microflora for proper degradation. Non-fermentable fibres are carbohydrate structures which are not fully fermented even by intestinal microflora. Little {{research has been done}} on non-fermentable fibre, however it is known that it causes fecal bulking and reduced intestinal transit time. It has been shown that addition of non-fermentable fibre in concentrations of 22% or greater of the total diet will reduce growth, feed intake and feed efficiency.|$|E
50|$|In farmed animals, <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> has an {{additional}} dimension, as a healthy gut enables more {{efficient use of}} feed, called the feed conversion ratio. Over many decades antibiotic drugs {{have been added to}} the diet of farmed animals at non-therapeutic levels in the absence of disease, in order to enhance the feed conversion ratio, accelerate growth and protect the animal's health, therefore increasing profitability for producers. Today, however, there is a global push to reduce the use of medically important antibiotics as feed additives for farm animals, due to concerns about this practice promoting the emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. This trend has fueled interest in natural nutritional concepts. Based on a large body of research MOS has established itself as one of the more important natural additives in farm animal production. The effect of MOS on animal performance was analysed in several meta-analyses (statistical analyses of final reports from trials that essentially contain the same experimental treatments) for poultry, pigs, and calves. These analyses reported improvements in performance with MOS.|$|E
5000|$|... == Fiber == Highly soluble or {{fermentable}} fiber from carbohydrate sources mentioned, and others, above {{also provide}} short chain fatty acids. These short chain fatty acids can represent approximately 10% of an animal's energy requirement through microbial fermentation within the gut. <b>Gut</b> <b>health</b> is also promoted by increasing mucosal health, increasing the microbial balance, improving digestion, improving nutrient absorption and upregulating immunity. [...] To insure this, owners {{should be looking}} to feed diets that contain 3%-7% of total digestible fiber (TDF) or ingredients such as beet pulp or rice bran which are moderately fermentable. Total dietary fiber is not standard on pet food labels and generally only crude fiber is provided, which does not given {{an indication of the}} solubility of fermentability of an ingredients. If non-soluble or non-fermentable fiber is found within the diet, the animal is likely to experience increased fecal bulk and moisture as well as a diluted energy intake. Consequently, dogs may experience decreased nutrient absorption, dehydration, pathogenic bacterial growth in the gut and diarrhea. Avoiding diets with crude fiber levels over 3% or high inclusions of ingredients such as cellulose or peanut hulls will assist in preventing some consequences such as pathogenic bacterial growth, colonic atrophy and dehydration.Furthermore, there are some additional fibers such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS) which will promote good bacteria and inhibit harmful ones, respectively. These two fibers are most important for animals fed a raw diet where pathogenic bacteria may be more prevalent.|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands, one in {{ten people}} suffers from gut {{complaints}} (functional gastrointestinal disorders), which can have a high negative impact on their daily activities. Because diagnosis and treatment are not straightforward, and are often impeded by the multiple factors that {{play a role in}} <b>gut</b> <b>health,</b> it is important to improve our knowledge about <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> to aid in future diagnosis and treatment of this prevalent disorder. In this thesis I describe our research on several aspects of <b>gut</b> <b>health.</b> The major focus is on the interaction between the gut microbiota and environmental factors and on its link to <b>gut</b> <b>health.</b> We find associations between microbiota composition and 126 factors including stool consistency, smoking and buttermilk consumption. In addition, I describe the associations between food intake and gut complaints. I find, for example, a lower intake of fiber and a higher intake of meat in people with gut complaints. With regard to the relation between overall wellbeing and <b>gut</b> <b>health,</b> I find an association between more severe gut complaints and a lower quality of life. I also present the results of our search for a biomarker panel to aid in the diagnosis of gut complaints.

40|$|<b>Gut</b> <b>health</b> ’ {{is a term}} {{increasingly}} used in the medical literature and by the food industry. It covers multiple positive aspects of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as the effective digestion and absorption of food, the absence of GI illness, normal and stable intestinal microbiota, effective immune status and a state of well-being. From a scientific point of view, however, it is still extremely unclear exactly what <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> is, {{how it can be}} defined and how it can be measured. The GI barrier adjacent to the GI microbiota appears to be the key to understanding the complex mechanisms that maintain <b>gut</b> <b>health.</b> Any impairment of the GI barrier can increase the risk of developing infectious, inflammatory and functional GI diseases, as well as extraintestinal diseases such as immune-mediated and metabolic disorders. Less clear, however, is whether GI discomfort in general can also be related to GI barrier functions. In any case, methods of assessing, improving and maintaining gut health-related GI functions are of major interest in preventive medicine. Background In recent times, the term ‘gut health ’ has become increasingly popular, as is evident by its more frequent use in the scientific literature and in the food industry [1]. In contrast to the medical understanding of the Western world, where gut issues are considered rather taboo, <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> is a central theme in Asian medicine, which recognises the abdomen as the location of the soul. “Honoured middle ” (onaka) and “centre of the spiritual and physical strength ” (hara) are how the Japanese describe our largest organ, the intestine, which for many Europeans is barely more than a simple digestive system which simply has to function [2].

40|$|The {{immediate}} post-weaning {{period is}} one of the most stressful phases in a pig's life, and during this period, piglets are usually exposed to environmental, social and psychological stressors which have direct or indirect effects on <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> and overall growth performance. In this review, the impact of husbandry practices on <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> outcomes and performance of piglets is discussed. Husbandry practices in the swine barn generally include nutrition and management practices, maintenance of hygienic standards and disease prevention protocols, and animal welfare considerations. Poor husbandry practices could result in reduced feed intake, stress and disease conditions, and consequently affect <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> and performance in weaned piglets. Reduced feed intake is a major risk factor for impaired gut structure and function and therefore a key goal is to maximize feed intake in newly weaned piglets. In weaned piglets, crowding stress could reduce pig performance, favor the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria resulting in diarrhea, stimulate immune responses and interfere with beneficial microbial activities in the gut. Sanitation conditions in the swine barn plays an important role for optimal piglet performance, because unclean conditions reduced growth performance, shifted nutrient requirements to support the immune system and negatively affected the gut morphology in weaned piglets. Appropriate biosecurity measures need to be designed to prevent disease entry and spread within a swine operation, which in turn helps to keep all pigs and piglets healthy. Collectively, husbandry practices relating to feeding and nutrition, animal welfare, biosecurity and disease prevention are important determinants of <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> and piglet performance. Thus, it is suggested that adopting high husbandry practices is a critical piece in strategies aimed at raising pigs without the use of in-feed antibiotics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract SCFA(Short Chain Fatty Acids) {{are readily}} {{absorbed in the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract and {{play an important role}} in the maintenance of <b>gut</b> <b>health.</b> The deficiency of SCFA (particularly acetic, propionic and butyric) may affect the pathogenesis of a diverse range of diseases ranging from allergies to asthma to cancers. The potential of having three different SCFA on one molecule for direct ingestion and metabolism can be of significant importance to maintaining <b>gut</b> <b>health.</b> SCFA triglycerides have not been characterized for use in clinical nutrition therefore it is important to understand their specific structure and composition. We synthesized ten reaction products of various triacylglycerols containing different ratios of acetic, propionic and butyric SCFA by interesterification. The reaction products were characterized by Gas Chromatography (GC), GC/MS and H 1 NMR. The weight % of the triesters found were compared to the amount predicted using the statistical randomized interesterification reaction model. We found that the difference in fatty acid size and the reduced steric demands of the SCFA did not give rise to positional specificity and found no observable deviations from the random interesterification model.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment {{was to investigate the}} effect of non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) solubility and inclusion rate on <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> and development, performance and risk of post weaning enteric disorders (PWED) using NSP sources known not to affect digesta viscosity. The experiment consisted of a 2 x 3 factorial combination of NSP type (sNSP vs insoluble NSP (iNSP); inulin vs purified cellulose) and inclusion level (50 vs 100 vs 150 g/kg). Piglets were weaned at 28 days (day 0) and fed ad libitum until slaughter on day 14. There were no incidences of PWED. NSP solubility had little effect on performance, but sNSP diets resulted in lower caecal and colonic pH and higher colonic Lactobacilli to coliform ratio compared to iNSP diets. Increasing NSP levels significantly reduced caecal and colonic pH but decreased empty body weight percentage (P= 0. 067). These results suggest that <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> may benefit most from diets containing appropriate sources of predominantly sNSP rather than iNSP. The optimal level of such sNSP will likely depend upon the level of risk of PWED in order to balance the trade off between maximising performance and improving <b>gut</b> <b>health.</b> Effects of NSP feeding under a higher infectious pressure remains to be assessed.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of <b>gut</b> <b>health</b> {{is complex and}} relies on a delicate balance between the diet, the commensal microflora and the mucosa, including the digestive epithelium and the overlying mucus layer. Superimposed on this balance is the frequent presence of enteric bacteria with pathogenic potential, the proliferation and metabolic activity of which may perturb digestive function, and lead to diarrhoea, poor growth rates and even death. Such enteric infections with pathogenic bacteria are common in young animals and children. Diet has an important influence on <b>gut</b> <b>health,</b> including effects on proliferation of pathogenic bacteria, and it can provide either beneficial or harmful input. Dietary fibre (DF) is a dietary component that has a major influence in this regard. DF is a heterogeneous class of components that are not hydrolysed by digestive enzymes of non-ruminant animals, and consequently are the main substrates for bacterial fermentation in the distal part of the gut. This review presents evidence that some components of dietary fibre may improve <b>gut</b> <b>health,</b> or alternatively enhance gut perturbation and subsequent diarrhoea in young animals (including piglets, chickens and children). This review reports and discusses how DF interacts with the gut epithelium and mucus, directly or by {{the way of the}} microflora, and consequently can protect against or enhance enteric infections...|$|E
