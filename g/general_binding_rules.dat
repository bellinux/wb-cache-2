40|$|IPPC {{is the key}} {{instrument}} of EU industrial policy relating to the environment. This brings the flexibility required for emissions trading into regular conflict with the relative inflexibility of site-specific IPPC permits. Trading beyond BAT provides insufficient scope for any serious scheme, so ways of resolving this conflict are being sought by those promoting emissions trading. The Commission has recently acted to remove one option i. e. exploiting the flexibility component of site-specific BAT by downgrading it to the minimum level required to protect local environmental quality standards. Such exploitation now risks the imposition of <b>general</b> <b>binding</b> <b>rules</b> by the Commission. The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Directive set the precedent for another ‘solution ’ by granting a derogation from IPPC for those installations involved in trading. However, it is highly debateable as to whether this preserves the energy efficiency requirement, integrated nature and level of ambition of IPPC. Neither does the US experience with acid gas trading provide justification fo...|$|E
40|$|The purpose {{my thesis}} is to analyse the {{substantive}} and temporal {{scope of application}} of selected <b>general</b> <b>binding</b> <b>rules</b> governing the international sales contract and to analyse their mutual relations. The work is composed of six chapters, each of them dealing with a different issue of international sales contract. The first chapter deals with {{the definition of the}} term international sales contract in view of the practical and theoretical understanding, because the definition of an international sales contract has its own specifics in contrast to the definition of a sales contract in Czech law. The second chapter discusses the basic approaches of legal regulation in private international law and outlines the basic advantages and disadvantages of specific approaches of legal regulation in private international law in view of the international sales contract in this section. I put this chapter into my work for the better understanding and orientation of reader in issue of general regulation of international sales contract. The third chapter deals with the substantive, temporal and personal scope of application of the Czech Act on Private International Law in view of the international sales contract. The fourth chapter discusses the substantive, temporal and personal scope of application of the Rome [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{investigate}} the prospects for identifying and prosecuting individuals suspected of war crimes, within the process of exclusion from refugee status under article 1 F(a) of the 1951 Refugee Convention, and using subsequent mechanisms for extradition or prosecution in international criminal law. A number of principles within human rights law and public international law have been advocated by the UNCHR and several human rights NGOs as necessary for a thorough application of the exclusion clauses; one that takes individual responsibility into account and upholds the aims and purposes of the exclusion clauses. There is a discussion as to whether specialised or accelerated exclusion procedures are justified for reasons of security and efficiency, or if they put the rights of the individual at risk and limit the opportunities for gathering information to support investigation and prosecution of the crime in question. Apart from the instruments of asylum law and procedure that have emerged within the EU harmonisation process, there are no <b>general,</b> <b>binding</b> <b>rules</b> on the procedural aspects of the exclusion clauses. One principle that regulates the consequences for the individual of exclusion from refugee status and decisions on extradition is, however, the principle of non-refoulement. Although partly contested in state practice, there is widespread consensus in international jurisprudence and doctrine that the principle, following its status as a jus cogens rule, prohibits every state from returning any individual to a territory where he or she may face torture or other cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment, irrespective of any security risks that the individual may pose to the custodial state. Extradition or prosecution of individuals suspected of crimes under article 1 F(a), based on universal jurisdiction and the principle of aut dedere aut judicare, has gained increased support from international conventions, such as the 1948 Convention on Genocide and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The principles are widely upheld by human rights NGOs, and tendencies in practice and policy among the member states of the EU and the parties to the Rome Statute point towards the development of a customary rule of universal jurisdiction among these states. Continuing resistance to the Rome Statute and to universal jurisdiction among influential states such as the USA, Russia, China and India nevertheless serves to exclude these states from being bound by such an emerging customary rule of universal jurisdiction. There are compelling arguments as to why breaches of jus cogens-rules should include or give rise to erga omnes rights or obligations for all states to exercise universal jurisdiction over such breaches. Without the support of major states it is, however, difficult to establish the existence of the general state acceptance of universal jurisdiction as is required for the principle to attain jus cogens-status and become universally applicable, regardless of state consent. Future prospects for adequate and efficient identification and prosecution of suspected war criminals depend on the correct and thorough application of the exclusion clauses, in combination with the development of existing rules of universal jurisdiction, and not least on the willingness and ability of states to overcome the political, economic and institutional obstacles that presently may prevent many states from extraditing or prosecuting individuals who fall within the scope of article 1 F(a) of the exclusion clauses...|$|E

40|$|Drug-eluting stents {{have emerged}} as the most {{effective}} method for treating restenosis following percutaneous coronary interventions. This thesis investigates how drugs with similar physiochemical properties but different specific binding targets yield drastically different tissue transport, retention and ultimately efficacy independent of their putative biological effects. Our central hypothesis is that both specific and <b>general</b> <b>binding</b> of drugs to tissue proteins, as mediated by drug-specific physiochemical properties, plays {{a central role in}} arterial transport and distribution. We define and compare the kinetic and transport properties of clinically implemented compounds with different binding modes. While hydrophilic compounds are rapidly cleared, hydrophobic ones are retained with an arterial transmural distribution dependent upon the distribution of specific and <b>general</b> <b>binding</b> sites. Common systemically administered cardiac drugs compete with locally delivered agents through displacement of <b>general</b> <b>binding</b> sites. Exploration of drug binding in thrombus indicates significant specific and <b>general</b> <b>binding</b> capacity. Stent-to- arterial wall drug transfer is acutely sensitive to stent strut position in clot relative to the wall due to thrombus binding capacity. A poorly controlled microthrombotic environment around a stent strut can drastically enhance systemic washout while reducing delivery to the tissue. Together this body of work implies that specific and <b>general</b> <b>binding</b> plays a critical role in the clinical efficacy of locally delivered drugs, and must be a consideration in the rational design of stent-based delivery devices. by Andrew D.

40|$|Information {{about the}} binding {{preferences}} of many transcription factors is known and {{characterized by a}} sequence binding motif. However, determining regions of the genome in which a transcription factor binds based on its motif is a challenging problem, particularly in species with large genomes, since there are often many sequences containing matches to the motif but are not bound. Several rules based on sequence conservation or location, relative to a tran-scription start site, have been proposed to help differentiate true binding sites from random ones. Other evidence sources may also be informative for this task. We developed a method for integrating multiple evidence sources using logistic regression classifiers. Our method works in two steps. First, we infer a score quantifying the <b>general</b> <b>binding</b> preferences of transcription factor binding at all locations based on a large set of evidence features, without using any motif specific information. Then, we combined this <b>general</b> <b>binding</b> preference score with motif information for specific transcription factors to improve prediction of regions bound by the factor. Using cross-validation and new experimental data we show that, surprisingly, the <b>general</b> <b>binding</b> preference can be highly predictive of true locations of transcription factor binding even when no binding motif is used. When combined with motif information our method outperforms previous methods for predicting locations of true binding. [Supplemental material is available online a...|$|R
