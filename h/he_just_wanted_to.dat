Brian realizes that Stewie is right and decides to listen to his advice.

500|$|One {{point of}} dispute was the {{calculation}} of Malay equity. Although officially, as of 1992, the Malays controlled 18% of the economy, some dismissed this figure as misleading. It was argued that as in reality, much of this amount comprised equity held by government agencies, therefore it belonged to Malaysians as a whole. The practice of awarding public works contracts mainly to Bumiputras was argued to be stifling Malay competency by providing little incentive to improve. Many Bumiputra contractors in turn subcontracted their jobs to others, who were in some cases Chinese; [...] "Ali Baba" [...] arrangements with [...] "the Malay [...] using his privileges to acquire licences and permits denied the non-Malay, then accepting a fee to be the front-man while the non-Malay [...] ran the business," [...] were prevalent.

You have a bond. It's like a fraternity or sorority."
