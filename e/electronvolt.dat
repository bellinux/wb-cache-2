5000|$|... the <b>electronvolt</b> (eV) is {{a unit of}} energy, {{but because}} of the mass-energy {{equivalence}} it can easily be converted to a unit of mass, and is often used like one. In this context, the mass has units of eV/c2 (where c is the speed of light). The <b>electronvolt</b> and its multiples, such as the MeV (megaelectronvolt), are commonly used in particle physics.|$|E

50|$|The zeptojoule (zJ) {{is equal}} to one sextillionth (10−21) of one joule. 160 zeptojoules is {{approximately}} equivalent to one <b>electronvolt.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In physics, the <b>electronvolt</b> (symbol eV, {{also written}} {{electron-volt}} and electron volt) is {{a unit of}} energy equal to approximately [...] joules (symbol J). By definition, it {{is the amount of}} energy gained (or lost) by the charge of a single electron moving across an electric potential difference of one volt. Thus it is 1 volt (1 joule per coulomb, [...] ) multiplied by the elementary charge (e, or [...] ). Therefore, one <b>electronvolt</b> is equal to [...] Historically, the <b>electronvolt</b> was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences because a particle with charge q has an energy E = qV after passing through the potential V; if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts, one gets an energy in eV.|$|E
50|$|Some {{other units}} {{such as the}} hour, litre, tonne, bar and <b>electronvolt</b> are not SI units, but are widely used in {{conjunction}} with SI units.|$|E

50|$|Since 1 mole = 6.02214179&times;1023 {{particles}} (atoms, molecules, ions etc.), 1 Joule per mole {{is equal}} to 1 Joule divided by 6.02214179&times;1023 particles, or 1.66054&times;10−24 Joule per particle. This very small amount of energy is often {{expressed in terms of}} a smaller unit such as the <b>electronvolt</b> (eV, see below).|$|E
50|$|The Planck {{constant}} {{is related}} to the quantization of light and matter. It {{can be seen as a}} subatomic-scale constant. In a unit system adapted to subatomic scales, the <b>electronvolt</b> is the appropriate unit of energy and the petahertz the appropriate unit of frequency. Atomic unit systems are based (in part) on the Planck constant.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1960, {{virtually}} all measurements of photoelectron kinetic energies were for electrons emitted from metals and other solid surfaces. About 1956 Kai Siegbahn developed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for surface chemical analysis. This method uses x-ray sources to study energy levels of atomic core electrons, {{and at the}} time had an energy resolution of about 1 eV (<b>electronvolt).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Energy in <b>electronvolts</b> is {{sometimes}} expressed through the wavelength of light with photons {{of the same}} energy: 1 eV = 8065.544005(49) cm−1.|$|R

5000|$|In high-energy physics, the <b>electronvolt</b> {{is often}} used as a unit of momentum. A {{potential}} difference of 1 volt causes an electron to gain an amount of energy (i.e., [...] ). This gives rise to usage of eV (and keV, MeV, GeV or TeV) as units of momentum, for the energy supplied results in acceleration of the particle.|$|E
50|$|The SI unit of {{temperature}} is the kelvin (K), but using the above relation the electron temperature is often {{expressed in terms}} of the energy unit <b>electronvolt</b> (eV). Each kelvin (1 K) corresponds to 8.6173324(78)×10−5 eV; this factor is the ratio of the Boltzmann constant to the elementary charge. Each eV is equivalent to 11,605 kelvin. It can be calculated by the relation,.|$|E
50|$|Electrons in solids have a {{chemical}} potential, defined {{the same way}} as the chemical potential of {{a chemical}} species: The change in free energy when electrons are added or removed from the system. In the case of electrons, the chemical potential is usually expressed in energy per particle rather than energy per mole, and the energy per particle is conventionally given in units of <b>electronvolt</b> (eV).|$|E

50|$|Wide-bandgap {{semiconductors}} (WBG or WBGS) are semiconductor materials {{which have}} a relatively large band gap compared to typical semiconductors. Typical semiconductors like Silicon have a bandgap {{on the order of}} 1 to 1.5 <b>electronvolt</b> (eV), whereas wide-bandgap materials have bandgaps on the order of 2 to 4 eV. Generally, wide-bandgap semiconductors have electronic properties which fall in between those of typical semiconductors and insulators.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, {{one more}} unit {{is needed to}} {{construct}} a usable system of units that includes energy and mass. Most commonly, <b>electronvolt</b> (eV) is used, {{despite the fact that}} this is not a [...] "natural" [...] unit in the sense discussed above - it is defined by a natural property, the elementary charge, and the anthropogenic unit of electric potential, the volt.

50|$|The {{activation}} {{energy for the}} simple atomic motion that gives the bond-rotation apparent in a Stone-Wales defects is fairly high—a barrier of several <b>electronvolts.</b> but various processes can create the defects at substantially lower energies than might be expected.|$|R
2500|$|At {{increased}} temperatures, {{chemical reactions}} proceed faster. [...] This relationship {{is described by}} the Boltzmann factor, where E is activation energy in <b>electronvolts</b> or joules, T is absolute temperature in kelvins, and k is the Boltzmann constant in eV/K or J/K: ...|$|R
