2500|$|By 1990, the eleventh-generation Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight was peaking {{in terms}} of {{mechanic}} perfection. It had a new <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> and increased horsepower from the somewhat sluggish 1985 models. [...] Also in 1990, a PGA edition package was offered on the Regency Brougham which included gold PGA emblems, gold nameplate badging, gold striping, and wire wheels with gold Oldsmobile rocket emblems.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1992 model year, the [...] LT1 {{engine was}} introduced, an {{increase}} of [...] over 1991's L98 engine. This engine featured reverse-flow cooling (the heads were cooled before the block), which allowed for a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1. A new distributor was also debuted. Called [...] "Optispark", the distributor was driven directly off {{the front of the}} camshaft and mounted in front of the timing cover, just above the crankshaft and <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer.</b> Also new for 1992 was Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR), a form of traction control which utilized the Corvette's brakes, spark retard, and throttle close-down to prevent excessive rear wheel spin and possible loss of control. The traction control device could be switched off if desired.|$|E
50|$|<b>Harmonic</b> <b>Balancer</b> - Some M112 and M113 engines used in W210 {{models were}} {{equipped}} with a <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> pulley which, due to a supplier quality problem, may fail and cause engine damage. If the rubber insert of the <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> pulley delaminates, the pulley may grind through the timing chain cover and oil pan, causing several thousand dollars of damage. Mercedes-Benz USA issued Service Campaign #2005-020003 which included inspection of the part and replacement if necessary at no cost. The part number on the <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> pulley {{can be compared to}} those given to Mercedes-Benz dealers in the Service Campaign notice to determine if the part is a faulty original or has been replaced with the updated part. Replacement of the faulty part with the updated part should be a permanent solution to this problem.|$|E
5000|$|The 425 CID L {{big-block}} was {{the first}} tall-deck [...] "big block," [...] produced from 1965 through 1967. It is arguably the best engine Olds made in the muscle car era, although it never made it into a [...] "muscle car". It used a 4.126 in bore and 3.975 in stroke. Most 425s were painted red, though the 1966 and 1967 Toronado units were light blue. All 425 engines were fitted with forged steel crankshafts with <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tuned {{absorber}} type of [...] "dampers" [...] {{often referred}} to as a harmonic dampers or <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancers</b> (even though it technically does not dampen or balance the crankshaft). This damper uses a spring element (often rubber in automobile engines) and an inertia ring that is typically tuned to the first torsional natural frequency of the crankshaft. This type of damper reduces the vibration at specific engine speeds when an excitation torque excites the first natural frequency of the crankshaft, but not at other speeds. This type of damper is analogous to the tuned mass dampers used in skyscrapers to reduce the building motion during an earthquake.|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{describes}} the mathematical modelling of self-excited induction generators (SEIGs) with are improved electronic load controller (IELC) for microhydel applications supplying variety of loads. In small hydro plants, governor unit of turbine can be eliminated using IELC, which {{is simple and}} cost effective. The improved electronic load controller {{is a combination of}} a three-phase insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) based current controlled voltage source inverter (CC-VSI) and a high frequency DC chopper which keeps the generated voltage and frequency constant in spite of change of balanced/unbalanced loads. A dynamic model of the SEIG-IELC suppling different types of loads using stationary d-q axes reference frame is developed for predicting the behavior of the system under transient conditions. The simulation is carried out for compensation of balanced/unbalanced loading conditions. The simulated results show that generated frequency and voltage remain constant with change in load. The proposed IELC acts as reactive power compensator, <b>harmonic</b> eliminator, load <b>balancer</b> and load controller. Key Words: Self-excited induction generator, improved electroni...|$|R

5000|$|The Lanchester <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> on the {{crankshaft}} has two weighted drums driven {{at twice}} crankshaft speed, one by a helical gear wheel {{attached to the}} crankshaft and the other by the primary drum. In a four-cylinder engine unbalanced secondary forces occur twice in each crankshaft revolution. The <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> counteracts any tendency to undesirable vibration.|$|E

50|$|The {{engine is}} {{essentially}} the four-cylinder engine of the preceding 25 hp car which chief engineer C E King had modified adding an overhead valve head and, because such largish engines now usually had six-cylinders for smoothness, the <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> invented by Dr F W Lanchester at the centre of its crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|By 1990, the eleventh-generation Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight was peaking {{in terms}} of {{mechanic}} perfection. It had a new <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> and increased horsepower from the somewhat sluggish 1985 models.

5000|$|Some {{performance}} enthusiasts {{have been}} known to remove the <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer,</b> believing that its mass reduces engine performance. Removal of this device from a traditional engine is very risky due to the potential for crankshaft damage. If the device has weight mounted on it to balance the rotating assembly, the effects may be felt immediately and could be catastrophic.|$|E
50|$|Some engines, such as GM's Premium V family, use crank {{position}} sensors which read a reluctor ring {{integral to the}} <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer.</b> This {{is a much more}} accurate method of determining the position of the crankshaft, and allows the computer to determine within a few degrees the exact position of the crankshaft (and thereby all connected components) at any given time.|$|E
50|$|The <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> helps {{minimize}} torsional crankshaft harmonics and resonance. The damper {{is composed}} of two elements: an inertia mass and an energy dissipating element. Most often made of rubber, this element may be composed of a synthetic elastomer, a clutch, a spring or fluid. The mass counteracts the torsional crank motions and {{in concert with the}} energy dissipating element absorbs the harmonics vibrations.|$|E
5000|$|A {{harmonic}} damper is {{a device}} fitted {{to the free}} (accessory drive) end of the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine to counter torsional and resonance vibrations from the crankshaft. This device must be interference fit to the crankshaft in order to operate in an effective manner. An interference fit ensures the device moves in perfect step with crankshaft. It is essential on engines with long crankshafts (such as straight-8 engines) and V8 engines with cross plane cranks. Harmonics and torsional vibrations can greatly reduce crankshaft life, or cause instantaneous failure if the crankshaft runs at or through an amplified resonance. Dampers are designed with a specific weight (mass) which {{is dependent on the}} damping material/method used and the freedom it affords the mass move allowing to reduce mechanical Q factor, or damp, crankshaft resonances. A <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> (sometimes crankshaft damper, torsional damper, or vibration damper) is the same thing as a harmonic damper except that the balancer includes a counterweight to externally balance the rotating assembly. The <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> often serves as a pulley for the accessory drive belts turning the alternator, water pump and other crankshaft driven devices.|$|E
50|$|Some known {{problems}} {{include the}} front spring perch has corroded and tearing {{away from the}} inner fender (wing), causing the front suspension to collapse. (4Matic models are not believed to be affected.) Other problems include defective <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> pulleys (recall), rust on trunk lid near latch, rust on Mercedes emblem on front hood, rust on door frames under window seals (recall), rust on front wings just above bumper, defective mass airflow meter, melted rear light bulb sockets, defective blower motor regulators, and rear window regulator failures.|$|E
50|$|The Lanchester Engine Company {{sold about}} 350 cars of various designs between 1900 and 1904, {{when they became}} {{bankrupt}} due to the incompetence of the Board of Directors. It was immediately reformed as The Lanchester Motor Company. During this period he also experimented with fuel injection, turbochargers, added steering wheels in 1907 and invented the accelerator pedal to help control engine operation, which previously would not cease if the operator had problems. He invented (or {{was the first to}} use) detachable wire wheels, bearings that were pressure-fed with oil, stamped steel pistons, piston rings, hollow connecting rods, the torsional vibration damper for 6-cylinder engines, and the <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> for 4-cylinder designs.|$|E
50|$|When {{looking at}} diesel driven vessels, the engines induce large {{accelerations}} that travel from {{the foundation of}} the engine throughout the ship. In most compartments, this type of vibration normally manifests itself as audible noise. The problem with diesels is that, for a given size, there is a fixed amount of power generated per cylinder. To increase power it is necessary to add cylinders but, when cylinders are added, the crankshaft has to be lengthened and after a very limited number of additions, the lengthened crankshaft begins to flex and vibrate all on its own. This results in an increase of vibrations spread all over the ships structure. Crankshaft vibration can be reduced by a <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Subaru {{chose to}} {{continue}} their longstanding use of the boxer engine in the Impreza. According to Subaru, their configuration of the engine inline with the transmission minimizes body roll due to the lower center of gravity compared with offset engines in most other vehicles. The boxer design provides good vibration mitigation due {{to the principles of}} a balanced engine because the movement of each piston is largely countered by a piston in the opposing cylinder bank, eliminating the need for a counter-weighted rotating crankshaft (<b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer),</b> but with some vibration from offsets. Torque steer is also reduced with this type of powertrain layout since the front drive shafts are of equal length and weight.|$|E
5000|$|The Olds 403 {{was used}} by Buick and Pontiac in {{addition}} to Oldsmobile. The engine was only produced through 1979. Output was [...] and [...] The Toronado version of the 1977 Oldsmobile 403 engine was fitted with a crank triggered ignition system. Parts peculiar to this system include a toothed disc between the <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> and the crank pulley, the adjacent sensor (which predated the modern-day crankshaft position sensor, which Oldsmobile used with their Quad 4 in the late 1980s with a cast-in toothed section of the crankshaft), a special distributor, an engine temperature sensor, and a rudimentary computer mounted inside the car, under the dash. No other years or models were provided with this system.|$|E

5000|$|The new [...] car {{appeared}} in 1901 and remained in production until 1905, with only minor design modifications. He became {{a friend of}} Rudyard Kipling and would send him experimental models to test. In 1905, Lanchester produced a [...] four-cylinder engine, and in 1906 he produced a [...] six-cylinder engine. Although Sir Henry Royce had already tackled the problem of crankshaft torsional oscillation and consequent vibration in straight-6 engines, Lanchester analysed the problem scientifically and invented the torsional crankshaft vibration damper {{as a solution to}} the problem of engine balance. His design, patented in 1907, used a secondary flywheel coupled to the end of the crankshaft with a viscous clutch. At around the same time Lanchester also patented a <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> to cancel out the unbalanced secondary forces in a four-cylinder engine, using two balance weights rotating at twice crankshaft speed in opposite directions.|$|E
50|$|OE dampers are {{predominantly}} made using rubber as the bonding agent between the inner hub {{and the outer}} mass. Rubber is susceptible to operational and environmental factors. Rubber only has a finite ability to withstand operating temperatures plus any fluids that may find their way onto the damper. They are also susceptible to low temperatures which can make them brittle. Any cracking of the elastomer would be an immediate indicator {{of the need to}} replace the unit. OE dampers must be balanced, unless acting as an external balancer (<b>Harmonic</b> <b>Balancer),</b> as the quality of materials (usually cast or sintered iron) do not lend themselves to acceptable/perfect balance straight from manufacturing. Most aftermarket dampers are rebuildable, excluding the fluid type. When used in racing (drag, circle track, road race, etc.) they require regular inspection to assure their proper function. When used on street driven vehicles the damper manufacturer can provide inspection and service intervals based on the particulars of the engine the damper is being used on.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1988 season, Williams {{worked with}} their new engine {{supplier}} Renault to develop their new the RS1 3.5 V10 engine. Williams designed a test mule for the engine named FW12B, {{very much like the}} Judd-powered car Williams used for the 1988 season except the mule was designed to accommodate the extra length of a V10 engine and not a V8 like the race cars used. For the [...] season the Renault V10 engine was used. This was the first Renault powered Williams F1 car and also saw Renault's re-entry into Formula One after stopping the supply of their turbocharged engines following the [...] season. The updated and revised FW12C showed its potential in the season opening Brazilian Grand Prix with Patrese qualifying 2nd and leading the race from the start in what was his 176th Grand Prix start. In his record breaking race, Patrese also set the fastest lap of the race before retiring in front of the pits with a broken <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The high {{nickel content}} block had a thicker deck, and a taller intake {{manifold}} {{due to the}} heads. It also had a distinct <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer,</b> crankcase windage tray, bigger diameter alternator pulley (from the 289HIPO), and bigger diameter power steering pulley all to accommodate the higher RPM capabilities of the engine vs a standard 302. The engine also came with an engine RPM limiter (to protect the owner's warranty options but was often {{one of the first}} things removed). The Boss 302 has eight valve cover bolts; in '69 they were chrome and in '70 cast aluminum, while the standard 302 has six. The connecting rods are the same as used in the 289 HIPO, and have an engineering number of C3AE-D on them. They are capable of higher RPMs than standard 302 rods (up to ~8k RPM), aided by a spot face for 3/8 inch bolts with a unique football-shaped head (vs 5/16 for standard small blocks), and beefier cap. The crankshaft is cross drilled (this was changed in 1970 for better reliability) high strength steel forging. The cam and lifters are high lift, solid mechanical units. The cam featured 290 degrees duration and [...]477 inches of lift.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985 a revised, [...] "low friction" [...] {{design was}} introduced, dubbed the B200 and B230 (depending on displacement). Several {{components}} had design changes, longer rods (152 mm c-c, 7 mm longer), pistons {{with a lower}} compression height, lower friction bearings (smaller in size), a crankshaft with 8 counterweights (instead of 4 on the older Bxx engines) and a heavy <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer</b> (aka damper) in the crank pulley. 1989 saw an upgrade to the crankshaft, with a relocated axial thrust bearing back to the number 5 journal, bigger main bearings, rods were enlarged to 13 mm from 9 mm in 1990. Also introduced in 1989 were 16 valve, twin-cam variants of the B200 and B230, dubbed the B204 and B234 respectively. The B204 was also available in turbo form in some markets (such as Italy) where large displacement motors were taxed heavily. It came in two versions: The B204GT turbo motor operates with a lead resistant lambda probe and generates approximately [...] The B204FT has a catalytic converter and generates [...] Both were the first redblocks standard equipped with oil squirters for piston cooling. Crankshaft, conrods and pistons all forged. Exhaust valves were sodium filled for cooler operation. It has smaller valves and stiffer valve springs than n/a 16V. Crank torque is 290 Nm at 2950 rpm for the GT, and 280 Nm for the FT. Other differences from the normal 16V redblock engine are that it uses a remote mounted oil filter (Away from block on exhaust side engine mount) and a windage tray.|$|E
5000|$|In 1966, General Motors {{designed}} a special [...] engine {{for the production}} Z/28 Camaro in order for it to meet the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans-Am Series road racing rules limiting engine displacement to [...] from 1967 to 1969. It {{was the product of}} placing the 283 cu in 3.00 in stroke crankshaft into a [...] bore 327 cu in cylinder-block. The 1967 302 used the same nodular cast-iron crankshaft as the 283, with a forged-steel crank that was also produced. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a crankshaft bearing diameter transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the [...] diameter small-journal to a [...] large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from [...] to [...] The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used 3/8 in diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal's 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of heavier crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm [...] diameter <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer.</b> It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel 'pink' connecting rods, floating-pin in `69, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings. Its solid-lifter cam, known as the [...] "30-30 Duntov" [...] cam named after its /0.030 in hot intake/exhaust valve-lash and Zora Arkus-Duntov (the first Duntov cam was the / 1957 grind known as the '097, which referred to the last three digits of the casting number) the [...] "Father of the Corvette", was also used in the 1964-1965 carbureted 327/365 and fuel injected 327/375 engines. It used the '202' / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump `461 heads, pushrod guide plates, hardened 'blue-stripe' pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the LT-1 350 cu in 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were equipped with until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet 'log' design to clear the Camaro chassis's front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube {{in the front of the}} intake manifold next to the thermostat housing from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome [...] drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a crankcase breather on a [...] vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. A 'divorced' exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster engine warm-up. Its single-point distributor had an ignition point cam designed to reduce point bounce at high rpm along with a vacuum diaphragm to advance ignition timing at idle and part-throttle for economy and emissions. Pulleys for the balancer, alternator, water-pump, as well as optional power-steering, were deep-groove to retain the drive belt(s) at high rpm. In 1969, the 302 shared the finned cast-aluminum valve covers with the LT-1 350 Corvette engine. Conservatively rated at [...] (SAE gross) at 5800 rpm and [...] at 4800, actual output with its production 11:1 compression ratio was around [...] with [...] primary x 3.00 in secondary Sanderson tubular headers that came in the trunk when ordered with a 1967 Z/28, and associated carburetor main jet and ignition timing tuningneeded. In 1968, the last year for factory headers, they had [...] primaries x 3.00 in secondaries. A stock 1968 Z/28 with the close-ratio transmission, optional transistorized-ignition and 4.88 gear, fitted with little more than the factory cowl plenum cold-air hood induction and headers, was capable of running 12.9 second/ 1/4-mile times on street tires.|$|E
40|$|Conversion of {{vibration}} energy in a structure, machine or vehicle into electric energy will improve reliability, comfort and energy utilisation efficiency, and can potentially reduce the amplitude of vibration and associated damaging effects. An analytical approach is proposed in combination of frequency analysis and time domain simulation. The main {{advantage of the}} approach is its capability to predict harvested resonant power and energy harvesting efficiencies of mechanical systems with built-in piezoelectric material, from a resonant frequency, mechanical damping, external load resistance and piezoelectric material properties regardless of the system size. The approach allows for prediction of output voltage and harvested resonant power from measured field vibration acceleration data. It allows for a parameter study and optimization of piezoelectric {{vibration energy}} harvesters. The dimensionless harvested resonant power and energy harvesting efficiency formula developed from this paper are useful for performance evaluation of the vibration energy harvesters ranging from macro to micro scales, even to nano scales. Potential industrial applications would be in ambient vibration energy harvesting analysis for machines or structure systems with built-in piezoelectric material. These systems may include engine torsion vibration absorbers (engine <b>harmonic</b> <b>balancer),</b> vehicle chassis suspension/mounting systems, vehicle power-train suspension/mounting systems, wheels and tyres or vehicle body panels.
