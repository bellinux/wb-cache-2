50|$|The circular-throw {{vibrating}} screen generates a rotating acceleration vector {{and the screen}} must maintain a steep throwing angle to prevent transportation along the screen deck. The deck is commonly constructed to have an angle {{within the range of}} 10° to 18°, in order to develop adequate particle movement. An Increase of <b>deck</b> <b>angle</b> speeds particle motion with proportional relationship to particle size. This decreases residence time and size stratification along the mesh screen. However, if the angle is greater than 20°, efficiency decreases due to reduction of effective mesh area. Effect of <b>deck</b> <b>angle</b> on efficiency is also influenced by particle density. In mining the optimal inclination angle is about 15°. Exceptions are the dewatering screens at 3° to 5° and steep screens at 20° to 40°.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1950s on {{conventional}} carriers {{it has been}} the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{investigation of}} a two- dimensional nozzle was completed to assess the use of fluidic injection to manipulate flow separation and cause thrust vectoring of the primary jet thrust. The nozzle was designed with a recessed cavity to enhance the throat shifting method of fluidic thrust vectoring. The structured-grid, computational fluid dynamics code PAB 3 D was used to guide the design and analyze over 60 configurations. Nozzle design variables included cavity convergence angle, cavity length, fluidic injection angle, upstream minimum height, aft <b>deck</b> <b>angle,</b> and aft deck shape. All simulations were computed with a static freestream Mach number of 0. 05. a nozzle pressure ratio of 3. 858, and a fluidic injection flow rate equal to 6 percent of the primary flow rate. Results indicate that the recessed cavity enhances the throat shifting method of fluidic thrust vectoring and allows for greater thrust-vector angles without compromising thrust efficiency...|$|E

Interception of the glide slope at 457. 2 m, glide slope tracking, deceleration along the glide slope to a spot hover were considered. Variations in airplane <b>deck</b> <b>angle,</b> deceleration schedule, and powered-lift management were studied. The overall descent performance envelope was identified {{on the basis of}} fan stall, maximum comfortable descent rate, and controllability restrictions. The collective-lift stick provided precise glide slope tracking capability.

40|$|The free wing/free trimmer {{concept was}} {{analytically}} studied in order to: (1) compare the {{fore and aft}} trimmer configurations {{on the basis of}} equal lift capability, rather than equal area; (2) assess the influence of tip mounted aft trimmers, both free and fixed, on the lateral directional modes and turbulence responses; (3) examine the feasibility of using differential tip mounted trimmer deflection for lateral control; (4) determine the effects of independent fuselage attitude on the lateral directional behavior; and (5) estimate the influence of wing sweep on dynamic behavior and structural weight. Results indicate that the forward trimmer concept is feasible with the reduced size examined, but it remains inferior to the aft trimmer in every respect except structural weight. Differential motion of the aft trimmer is found to provide powerful lateral control; while the effect of fuselage <b>deck</b> <b>angle</b> is a reduction of the dutch roll damping ratio for nose-down attitudes...|$|E
40|$|A Smart Screen Systems {{screening}} device {{was installed in}} the pilot plant at the Coleraine Mineral Research Laboratory. As installed, the machine holds one pre-tensioned panel at 25 -degrees from horizontal. Currently, single or two panel machines are available, and can be manufactured at the <b>deck</b> <b>angle</b> required for optimum performance. The effective screen cloth surface area on the pre-tensioned panels was 43 " wide by 34 " long, and the feed stream was distributed evenly along the 43 " wide surface. The panel installation system was very simple, consisting of six cams used to hold an edge bracket onto the panel. A single individual can change a panel {{in just a few}} minutes. The scope of work for this project follows the pattern set in Part 1, in which five tests were completed on each of two feed samples, one from Hibbing Taconite, and one from Northshore Mining. The scope of work for Part 2 also includes silica and magnetic iron assays on head samples as well as on each size fraction. Otherwise, the test plan was identical to the previous part. For each material, initial tests were completed to achieve the established separation criteria as in Part 1. These criteria were to achieve a split at near 100 microns for the Hibbing Taconite material, and to achieve an undersize grade close to 90 % - 325 mesh for the Northshore Mining material. Once the panel was selected and other operating issues were resolved, a formal test sequence was conducted using two values for feed rate and two values of feed solids that were just higher and just lower than in the initial tests. The idea was to bracket the optimum separation and measure the variation in screen performance as these two parameters varied. As seen in Table 1, the four tests were completed in a 2 x 2 pattern, and a fifth test was a repetition of one of the first four in order to measure experimental error.

5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the <b>angles</b> between the <b>deck</b> and the horizontal plane. These <b>deck</b> <b>angles</b> were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|R

5000|$|From January through July 1973, Kitty Hawk changed home ports from San Diego to San Francisco. Kitty Hawk {{moved into}} dry dock on 14 January 1973, and work began {{to convert the}} ship from an attack (CVA) to a {{multi-mission}} carrier (CV). The [...] "CV" [...] designation indicated that Kitty Hawk was no longer strictly an attack carrier, in that anti-submarine warfare would also become a major role. Kitty Hawk became the first Pacific Fleet carrier to carry the multi-purpose [...] "CV" [...] designation. The conversion consisted of adding 10 new helicopter calibrating stations, installing sonar/sonobuoy readout and analysis center and associated equipment, and changing {{a large portion of}} the ship's operating procedures. One of the major equipment/space changes in the conversion was the addition of the Anti-Submarine Classification and Analysis Center (ASCAC) in the CIC area. ASCAC worked in close conjunction with the anti-submarine warfare aircraft assigned aboard Carrier Air Wing 11. During the yard period, the Engineering Department underwent a major change in its propulsion plant. The Navy Standard Oil (black oil) fuel system was completely converted to Navy Distillate Fuel. The Air Department added several major changes to the flight deck, including enlarging the jet blast deflectors (JBD) and installing more powerful catapults in order to handle the new Grumman F-14 Tomcat, which Kitty Hawk was standing by to receive for its next deployment.
