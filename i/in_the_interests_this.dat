40|$|We {{argue that}} an {{increase}} in aggregate demand {{can lead to a}} reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> rate. <b>This</b> apparently perverse optimal response of interest rates can occur when the Phillips curve is non-linear.

Although the first two effects tend to increase <b>interest</b> rates, <b>the</b> latter effect can imply lower <b>interest</b> rates.

30|$|To {{be clear}} on this point: what PP does {{may not be}} {{described}} as a more or less neutral awakening of <b>interest.</b> Again <b>the</b> case of hydraulic fracturing illuminates this aspect.

As soon as PP decides to pursue an issue, it takes sides—and be it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public <b>interest.</b> <b>This</b> makes it hard to avoid one-sidedness and allows for counterarguments that weaken its original strength.|$|R
