That night, Marge prays for her husband at their bedside. Homer tries to seduce her while she is doing so, but then falls asleep suddenly and has a dream in which God personally appears to him. God is furious with Homer for forsaking his church. Homer answers that [...] "I'm not a bad guy, <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard,</b> and I love my kids... so why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?" [...] God agrees to let Homer worship in his own way. Homer starts following his own religion tailored to his personal tastes, including holidays he invents {{to get out of}} work.|$|E

[...] but <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard,</b> and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a 'serious' writer. Yet I have more stories to tell, and more novels [...] ". In The New York Review of Books in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates [...] "derives from reviewer's angst: How does one judge a new book by Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist?

2500|$|On a September 2007 {{edition of}} The Radio Factor, while having a {{discussion}} about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author Juan Williams about a meal he shared with Al Sharpton, O'Reilly said [...] "You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything. But everybody was very nice. And I couldn't get {{over the fact that}} there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." [...] He commented that no one in Sylvia's [...] was [...] "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" [...] He further added, [...] "I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They're just trying to figure it out. 'Look, I can make it. If <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> and get educated, I can make it.'" [...] The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that black people are just now starting to value education is [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is [...] "nuts". Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions. O'Reilly responded, saying, [...] "It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we're all Americans. The stereotypes they see on television are not true" [...] and also called out Media Matters, claiming that [...] "Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism." [...] Juan Williams said the criticism of O'Reilly was [...] "rank dishonesty" [...] and that the original comments [...] "had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN." [...] Williams went on to say it was [...] "frustrating" [...] that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race.|$|E

6000|$|I was, then, free--free of the {{injunction}} of {{that piece of}} paper reposing in my pocket. Yet its influence was still upon me. I did not hurry away, but lingered in the courts, fascinated {{by the notion that}} the fate of each prisoner had first passed through my hands. At last I made an effort, and went out into the corridor. There I passed a woman whose figure seemed familiar. She was sitting with {{her hands in her lap}} looking straight before her, pale-faced and not uncomely, with thickish mouth and nose--the woman whose bill we had thrown out. Why was she sitting there? Had she not then realised that we had quashed her claim; or was she, like myself, kept here by mere attraction of the Law? Following I know not what impulse, I said: [...] "Your case was dismissed, wasn't it?" [...] She looked up at me stolidly, and a tear, which had evidently been long gathering, dropped at the movement. [...] "I do nod know; I waid to see," [...] she said in her thick voice; [...] "I tink there has been mistake." [...] My face, no doubt, betrayed something of my sentiments about her case, for the thick tears began rolling fast down her pasty cheeks, and her pent-up feeling suddenly flowed forth in words: [...] "I work 'ard; Gott! how <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard!</b> And there gomes dis liddle beastly man, and rob me. And they say: 'Ah! yes; but you are a bad woman, we don' trust you--you speak lie.' But I speak druth, I am nod a bad woman--I gome from Hamburg." [...] "Yes, yes," [...] I murmured; [...] "yes, yes." [...] "I do not know this country well, sir. I speak bad English. Is that why they do not drust my word?"

Without the men I cannod make my living, I must drust them--and they rob me like this, it is too 'ard." [...] And the slow tears rolled faster and faster from her eyes on to her hands and her black lap.
