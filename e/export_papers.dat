Don Calogero sent truck caravans loaded with all the basic food commodities necessary for the Italian diet rolling northward to hungry Naples, where their cargoes were distributed by Genovese's organization. All of the trucks were issued passes and <b>export</b> <b>papers</b> by the AMGOT administration in Naples and Sicily, and some corrupt American army officers even made contributions of gasoline and trucks to the operation. According to Luke Monzelli, a lieutenant in the Carabinieri assigned to follow Genovese during his time in Italy: “Truckloads of food supplies were shipped from Vizzini to Genovese — all accompanied by the proper documents which had been certified by men in authority, Mafia members in the service of Vizzini and Genovese.” ...|$|E

40|$|Specialization in {{high-tech}} products is frequently used to capture technology intensity of exports. The {{literature suggests that}} developing countries are increasingly becoming exporters of high-tech products, and some may even {{be among the most}} deeply specialized countries in the field of high-tech <b>exports.</b> The <b>paper</b> scrutinizes the relevance of the taxonomies that classify exports by technological intensity in this context. It is shown that specialization {{in high-tech}} exports typically does not appear in tandem with indigenous technological capabilities in developing countries. The analysis of intra-product imports suggests that the bulk of high-tech exports can actually be attributed to the effect of increasingly international fragmentation of production systems in electronics on trade statistics. It is confirmed in an econometric framework that while domestic technological capabilities have some influence on export performance in electronics, it is the propensity to import electronics components that accounts for by far the largest proportion of cross-country differences in specialization in electronics <b>exports.</b> The <b>paper</b> concludes with some implications for policy and future research. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{intermediary}} {{is found}} in between the manufacturer and customer and connects the parties in situations where {{it may be too}} difficult, time consuming and simply not profitable for them to engage in direct export. The intermediary functions as a bridge between the manufacturer and the customer, and is employed on markets where they have a better ability to handle the export process than manufacturers. There is a cluster of so-called trading houses 1 in Gothenburg, Sweden, consisting of intermediaries specializing in export of forestry products to distant markets. This study aims to provide an understanding of why these intermediaries handle <b>export</b> of <b>paper</b> products and will furthermore focus specifically on Nigeria as export market. A case study of one of these trading houses has been carried out, based on interviews with the Managing Director and three employees. An important explanation of the existence of trading houses is their role as financers of high-risk transactions and thus their relations with the bank. An interview with a trade finance expert at Svenska Handelsbanken was therefore included to give insights into the financial aspects of intermediaries’ role. The following three aspects can explain the result of this thesis; intermediaries can enjoy economies of scale and scope when <b>exporting</b> <b>paper</b> to Nigeria, they have a better capacity of handling barriers to trade and they can lower transaction cost. The case company’s competitive advantage are embedded in six factors; economies of scale and scope, experience and network, good reputation, financing, risk taking and handling of the institutional framework The result implies that certain characteristics of the Nigerian market give rise to a need for intermediaries. As long as the market is distant, relatively small and barriers to trade prevail, the role of the intermediary is likely to remain viable...|$|R
