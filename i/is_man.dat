25|$|The {{description}} of Nebuchadnezzar II in the Book of Daniel (2nd century BC) greatly influenced the medieval European concepts. Daniel 4 depicts God humbling the Babylonian king for his boastfulness; stricken mad and ejected from human society, he grows {{hair on his}} body and lives like a beast. This image was popular in medieval depictions of Nebuchadnezzar. Similarly, late medieval legends of Saint John Chrysostom (died 407) describe the saint's asceticism as making him so isolated and feral that hunters who capture him cannot tell if he <b>is</b> <b>man</b> or beast.|$|E
25|$|This {{etymology}} {{is consistent}} with the Jewish conception of divine simplicity. It is not God that changes through our prayer—Man does not influence God as a defendant influences a human judge who has emotions and is subject to change—rather it <b>is</b> <b>man</b> himself who is changed. It is further consistent with Maimonides' view on Divine Providence. Here, Tefillah is the medium which God gave to man by means of which he can change himself, and thereby establish a new relationship with God—and thus a new destiny for himself in life; see also under Psalms.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is clear}} that nothing would prevent a {{singular}} term occurring in a syllogism—so {{long as it was}} always in the subject position—however, such a syllogism, even if valid, is not a categorical syllogism. An example is Socrates <b>is</b> a <b>man,</b> all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal. Intuitively this is as valid as All Greeks <b>are</b> <b>men,</b> all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> mortal therefore all Greeks are mortals. To argue that its validity {{can be explained by the}} theory of syllogism would require that we show that Socrates <b>is</b> a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> the equivalent of a categorical proposition. [...] It can be argued Socrates <b>is</b> a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to All that are identical to Socrates <b>are</b> <b>men,</b> so our non-categorical syllogism can be justified by use of the equivalence above and then citing BARBARA.|$|R

25|$|Many Jewish {{scholars}} such as Rabbi Saadia Gaon, Rabbi Bahya ibn Paquda, and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi have elaborated on {{the issues}} of idolatry. One of the oft-cited discussions is the commentary of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) on idolatry. According to the Maimonidean interpretation, idolatry in itself is not a fundamental sin, but the grave sin is the belief that God can be corporeal. In the Jewish belief, the only image of God <b>is</b> <b>man,</b> one who lives and thinks; God has no visible shape, and it is absurd to make or worship images; instead man must worship the invisible God alone.|$|E
25|$|The first {{congregation}} {{is mainly}} {{represented by the}} urban area population and emerged {{during the period of}} the Republic of Turkey. For many decades, this group of people belonged to the political left and presumed the Aleviness just as an outlook on the individual human life rather than a religious conviction by persistently renouncing the ties of the Batiniyya-Alevism with Twelver political branch of Shia Islam. The followers of this congregation, who later {{turned out to be the}} very stern defenders of the Erdoğan Çınar hold ritual unions of a religious character and have established cultural associations named after Pir Sultan Abdal as well.

500|$|The poem {{served as}} a sort of {{opposite}} to the popular idea that The Waste Land {{served as a}}n expression of disillusionment after World [...] War I, even though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. World War II itself has a direct mention in only a few of Eliot's writings. However, World War II does affect the poem, especially with the disruption caused by the war being reflected within the poem as a disruption of nature and heaven. The poem describes society in ways similar to The Waste Land, especially with its emphasis on death and dying. The place is connected to where Eliot's family originates, and, as such, is also the place where his family will symbolically end. In {{the second part of the}} poem, nature is experiencing disorder, and it is suggested that humans too may burn, and also that reason, knowledge, and science cannot save people. The errors of our past become the reasons for war and conflict and we need to become humble in order to escape the destruction. However, darkness consumes the rulers of the world and society. This is, in part, due to Adam's fall, and the resulting concept of original sin. Christ is our savior and we need to seek redemption to overcome our human failings. Eliot states that he has been involved with fighting for humanity and trying to help mankind learn what is important. Only through Christ <b>is</b> <b>man</b> able to be redeemed.|$|E
