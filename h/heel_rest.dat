50|$|The AW50F is {{a folding}} stock variant which fires the {{multi-purpose}} Raufoss Mk 211 cartridge and other rounds. Most {{of the rifle}} {{is made in the}} United Kingdom; the barrels are sourced from three different manufacturers: Lothar Walther, Border and Maddco. The weapon's stock folds for portability. It has a fully adjustable bipod and buttstock <b>heel</b> <b>rest.</b> Four sling loops allow shoulder and hand carrying of the rifle.|$|E
60|$|Think of it! Think of it! I crucified {{upon the}} ice, my <b>heels</b> <b>resting</b> upon a little ledge; my fingers {{grasping}} excrescences {{on which a}} bird could scarcely have found a foothold; round and below me dizzy space. To climb back whence I came was impossible, to stir even was impossible, since one slip and I must be gone.|$|R
30|$|When in ready {{position}} the <b>heels</b> <b>rest</b> {{lightly on the}} floor with weight on the balls of the feet. The feet are shoulder width apart. Ball held in front of the waist in the fingertips of two hands. Fingers spread wide with thumbs and little finger on 'Line'. Thumbs Close together at the rear. Elbows held close to the body. Head is stationary and erect (Martin Spencer). Eyes are fixed on the target (Additional file 1 : Step 1).|$|R

50|$|The Sperry ball turret {{was very}} small {{in order to reduce}} drag, and was {{typically}} operated by the smallest man of the crew. To enter the turret, the turret was moved until the guns were pointed straight down. The gunner placed his feet in the <b>heel</b> <b>rests</b> and occupied his cramped station. He would put on a safety strap and close and lock the turret door. There was no room inside for a parachute, which was left in the cabin above the turret. A few gunners wore a chest parachute.|$|R
60|$|There {{he found}} the Euphuist in the same elegant posture of abstruse {{calculation}} which he had exhibited on the preceding evening, his arms folded in the same angle, his eyes turned up to the same cobwebs, and his <b>heels</b> <b>resting</b> {{on the ground as}} before. Tired of this affectation of indolent importance, and not much flattered with his guest's persevering in it to the last, Halbert resolved at once to break the ice, being determined to know what circumstance had brought to the tower of Glendinning a guest at once so supercilious and so silent.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947, Doyle {{challenged}} Sugar Ray Robinson for the World Welterweight Title. Robinson had {{the advantage}} in every round except the sixth, when he was staggered twice and hurt. A single left hook from Robinson ended the fight. [...] "That punch knocked Jimmy rigid.... With <b>heels</b> <b>resting</b> against the canvas as if hinged, Doyle's body went down. It struck {{the floor with a}} thud, like a rigid mass falling. His head crashed against the padded canvas, and as the referee started the count. Doyle raised his head and rested on his elbows.... The referee counted to ten. Doyle was out." ...|$|R
60|$|Candida and Marchbanks {{are seated}} at the fire. The reading lamp is on the mantelshelf above Marchbanks, who {{is sitting on the}} small chair reading aloud from a manuscript. A little pile of manuscripts and a couple of volumes of poetry are on the carpet beside him. Candida is in the easy chair with the poker, a light brass one, upright in her hand. She is leaning back and looking at the point of it curiously, with her feet {{stretched}} towards the blaze and her <b>heels</b> <b>resting</b> on the fender, profoundly unconscious of her appearance and surroundings.|$|R
30|$|The seated push-up test is {{a method}} of {{assessing}} {{the strength of the}} triceps, shoulder and scapular muscles. The test involves pushing the body up out of a seated position, and slowly lowering it back into the seat. The participant was placed with the knees out straight and the <b>heels</b> <b>resting</b> on the floor or table. The participant had to push their body up from the table or floor until the elbows were straight, held for 20  seconds and then slowly lowered back into the seat. The reliability of revised push-up test protocol in people without disabilities was 0.80 to 0.96 (Hong et al. 2011).|$|R
60|$|The Orang cannot put {{its feet}} flat on the ground, but is {{supported}} upon their outer edges, the <b>heel</b> <b>resting</b> more on the ground, while the curved toes partly rest upon the ground by the upper side of their first joint, the two outermost toes of each foot completely resting on this surface. The hands are held in the opposite manner, their inner edges serving as the chief support. The fingers are then bent out in such a manner that their foremost joints, especially those of the two innermost fingers, rest upon the ground by their upper sides, while the point of the free and straight thumb serves as an additional fulcrum.|$|R
50|$|The slingback {{is similar}} to the pump in that it can have a rounded or pointed toe and usually has a heel, but it doesn't wrap {{all the way around the}} heel like pumps usually do. Instead, it has a narrow strap that is pulled up over the <b>heel,</b> leaving the <b>rest</b> of the <b>heel</b> exposed.|$|R
50|$|The puppies {{that are}} {{returned}} {{will have to}} go through health screenings and then formal training. The formal training may take 4 to 6 months and there are no visits from the puppy raiser. The important aspect of formal training is for the dogs to respond and understand directional commands. The dogs will learn how to safely cross the street, stop at curbs, stop or guide their owner through obstacles and overhead obstacles also known as clearance. They continue to practice commands such as forward, <b>heel,</b> and <b>rest</b> that they learned with their former puppy raiser family. Once the formal training is completed and the dogs have successfully graduated, they are then partnered up with their new owner.|$|R
6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Thank {{you for a}} {{handsome}} compliment. I have a big dog; {{and he is the}} best fellow I know. If you knew how much uglier you are than a chow, you wouldn't start those comparisons, though. [Rising] Well, if you have nothing for me to do, I am going to leave your <b>heel</b> for the <b>rest</b> of the day and enjoy myself. What would you recommend me to do with myself? ...|$|R
6000|$|The Molly Swash {{was still}} under her canvas, though very little sufficed for her present purposes. She was {{directly}} off Whitestone, and was making easy stretches across the passage, or river, as it is called, having nothing set but her huge fore-and-aft mainsail and the jib. Under this sail she worked like a top, and Spike sometimes fancied she travelled too fast for his purposes, the night air having thickened the canvas as usual, until it [...] "held the wind as a bottle holds water." [...] There was nothing in this, however, to attract the particular attention of the ship-master's widow, a sail, more or less, being connected with observation much too critical for her schooling, nice as the last had been. She {{was surprised to find}} the men stripping the brig forward, and converting her into a schooner. Nor was this done in a loose and slovenly manner, under favour of the obscurity. On the contrary, it was so well executed that it might have deceived even a seaman under a noon-day sun, provided the vessel were a mile or two distant. The manner in which the metamorphosis was made was as follows: the studding-sail booms had been taken off the topsail-yard, in order to shorten it to the eye, and the yard itself was swayed up about half-mast, to give it the appearance of a schooner's fore-yard. The brig's real lower yard was lowered on the bulwarks, while her royal yard was sent down altogether, and the topgallant-mast was lowered until the <b>heel</b> <b>rested</b> on the topsail yard, all of which, in the night, gave the gear forward very much the appearance of that of a fore-topsail schooner, instead of that of a half-rigged brig, as the craft really was. As the vessel carried a try-sail on her foremast, it answered very well, in the dark, to represent a schooner's foresail. Several other little dispositions of this nature were made, about which it might weary the uninitiated to read, but which will readily suggest themselves to the mind of a sailor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not there," [...] {{answered}} Miriam quietly; [...] "indeed, I followed pretty {{closely on}} the <b>heels</b> of the <b>rest</b> of the party. But {{do not be}} alarmed on Hilda's account; the Virgin is bound to watch over the good child, {{for the sake of}} the piety with which she keeps the lamp alight at her shrine. And besides, I have always felt that Hilda is just as safe in these evil streets of Rome as her white doves when they fly downwards from the tower top, and run to and fro among the horses' feet. There is certainly a providence on purpose for Hilda, if for no other human creature." ...|$|R
60|$|Perrault and Francois, having {{cleaned out}} their {{part of the}} camp, hurried to save their sled-dogs. The wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them, and Buck shook himself free. But it was only for a moment. The two men were {{compelled}} to run back to save the grub, upon which the huskies returned to {{the attack on the}} team. Billee, terrified into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice. Pike and Dub followed on his <b>heels,</b> with the <b>rest</b> of the team behind. As Buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of the tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him. Once off his feet and under that mass of huskies, there was no hope for him. But he braced himself to the shock of Spitz's charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.|$|R
5|$|Chamberlain {{made the}} First Team of the All-America squad and led his Jayhawks into the NCAA finals against the Tar Heels of North Carolina. In that game, Tar Heels coach Frank McGuire used several unorthodox tactics to thwart Chamberlain. For the tip-off, {{he sent his}} {{shortest}} player, Tommy Kearns, in order to rattle Chamberlain, and the Tar <b>Heels</b> spent the <b>rest</b> of the night triple-teaming him, one defender in front, one behind, and a third arriving {{as soon as he}} got the ball. With their fixation on Chamberlain, the Jayhawks shot only 27% from the field, as opposed to 64% of the Tar Heels, and trailed 22–29 at halftime. Later, North Carolina led 40–37 with 10 minutes to go and stalled the game: they passed the ball around without any intention of scoring a basket. After several Tar Heel turnovers, the game was tied at 46 at the end of regulation. In the first overtime each team scored two points, and in the second overtime Kansas froze the ball in return, keeping the game tied at 48. In the third overtime, the Tar Heels scored two consecutive baskets, but Chamberlain executed a three-point play, leaving KU trailing 52–51. After King scored a basket, Kansas was ahead by one point, but then Tar Heel Joe Quigg was fouled on a drive with 10 seconds remaining and made his two foul shots. For the final play, Dick Harp called for Ron Loneski to pass the ball into Chamberlain in the low post. The pass was intercepted, however, and the Tar Heels won the game. Nonetheless, Chamberlain, who scored 23 points and 14 rebounds, was elected the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Cherry has speculated, however, that this loss was a watershed in Chamberlain's life, because it was the first time that his team lost despite him putting up impressive individual stats. Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful of his life.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} details {{a procedure}} for the systematic design of custom foot orthotics based on simulation models and their validation through experimental and clinical studies. These models may ultimately {{be able to}} replace the use of empirical tables for designing custom foot orthotics and enable optimal design thicknesses based on the body weight and activities of end-users. Similarly, they may facilitate effortless simulation of various orthotic and loading conditions, changes in material properties, and foot deformities by simply altering model parameters. Finally, these models and the corresponding results may also {{form the basis for}} subsequent design {{of a new generation of}} custom foot orthotics. ^ Two studies were carried out, the first involving a methodical approach to development of engineering analysis models using the FEA technique. Subsequently, for model verification and validation purposes, detailed investigations were executed through experimental and clinical studies. The results were within 15 % difference for the experimental studies and 26 % for the clinical studies, and most of the probability values were greater than α = 0. 05 accepting our null hypothesis that the FEA model data versus clinical trial data are not significantly different. The accuracy of the FEA model was further enhanced when the uniform loading condition was replaced with a more realistic pressure distribution of 70 % of the weight in the <b>heel</b> and the <b>rest</b> in the front portion of the orthotic. This alteration brought the values down to within 22 % difference of the clinical studies, with the P-values once again showed no significant difference between the modified FEA model and the clinical studies for most of the scenarios. ^ The second study dealt with the development of surrogate models from FEA results, which can then be used in lieu of the computationally intensive FEA-based analysis models in the engineering design of CFO. Four techniques were studied, including the second-order polynomial response surface, Kriging, non-parametric regression and neural networking. All four techniques were found to be computationally efficient with an average of over 200 % savings in time, and the Kriging technique was found to be the most accurate with an average % difference of below 0. 30 for each of the loading conditions (light, medium and heavy). ^ The two studies clearly indicate that engineering modeling, analysis and design using FEA techniques coupled with surrogate modeling methods offer a consistent, accurate and reliable alternative to empirical clinical studies. This powerful alternative simulation-based design framework can be a viable and valuable tool in the custom design of orthotics based on an individual’s unique needs and foot characteristics. With these capabilities, the CFO prescriber would be able to design and develop the best-fit CFO with the optimal design characteristics for each individual customer without relying upon extensive and expensive trial and error ad hoc approaches. Such a model could also facilitate the inspection of robustness of resulting designs, as well as enable visual inspection of the impact of even small changes on the overall performance of the CFO. By adding the results from these studies to the CFO community, the prescription process may become more efficient and therefore more affordable and accessible to all populations and groups. ...|$|R
