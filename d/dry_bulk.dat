5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying <b>dry</b> <b>bulk,</b> reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear and tear during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady {{reduction in the number}} of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|On 31 January 2012, the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China officially banned <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> {{carriers}} with capacity exceeding 300,000 tons {{from entering}} Chinese ports {{in order to}} protect the domestic freight industry. Prior to this, only one of the new very large ore carrier chartered by Vale, Berge Everest, had unloaded Brazilian iron ore at a Chinese port — the ship arrived at Dalian on 28 December 2011 — but this was assumed to be a bureaucratic fluke as no Chinese port has regulatory approval to receive <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> carriers of that size.|$|E

30|$|As {{noted in}} this table, 10.8 % of the {{vehicles}} surveyed were running empty. However, this percentage closely reflects the type of vehicle. Some vehicles, such as tautliners, are quite versatile, and present empty running factors of less than 10 %.

Finding backhaul freight is more difficult for these specialised vehicles.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{work was}} done to Teollisuuden Voima Oyj. Purpose was to study the ef-fects of certain {{additives}} on the flow properties of the ion exchange resin. Purpose was to improve the flow properties of the <b>bulk</b> and the <b>dried</b> <b>bulk.</b> Spent ion ex-change resin has caused problems by forming blockages in pipelines, when pumped into the waste treatment unit. The other purpose of this thesis {{was to get the}} <b>dried</b> <b>bulk's</b> characteristics so that the amount of bitumen could be decreased. Bitumen is used, when dried ion exchange resin and inert are prepared for the final disposal. In the theory section of this thesis, soluble and insoluble impurities of boiling water reactor were discussed. Also condensate purification and ion exchange were intro-duced. Rheology was studied to explain the particle flow and viscosity. The process-es that are related to the subject were surveyed. Thesis was implemented in TVO's water chemistry laboratory. The main analysis was carried out with a viscosity instrument, Viscometer DV-E. The bulk was done from fresh unused ion exchange resin and inert material. Also drying test and en...|$|R
40|$|Biochar {{is known}} as huge carbon storage in the soil. In the soil, biochar absorbs CO 2 from air and keep them for hundred years. In {{addition}} to prevention, reducing emission and green house effects, Biochar also contributes to soil productivity such as physical and chemical property improvement of the soil. How biochar amends soil physical properties combined with some tillage systems are imperative to find out. This study aimed to {{determine the influence of}} biochar and tillage systems on some soil physical properties. Treatment arranged in a factorial randomized block design with three replications. The treatment of biochar effect consist of four levels; 0, 10, 15, and 20 t ha- 1 Biochar. The tillage systems were three levels; no,minimum, and conventional tillage. The results showed that we found an interaction effect on the biochar application with tillage systemson <b>dried</b> <b>bulk</b> density, soil porosity, and soil permeability. No interaction was found on aggregate stability indexes and soil water holding capacity at water content at - 0. 3 and - 15 bar of water potential (pF 2. 54 and 4. 2, accordingly).

25|$|Like {{all of the}} Great Lakes, Lake Michigan {{is today}} used as a major mode of {{transport}} for bulk goods. In 2002, 162 million net tons of <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo were moved via the Lakes. This was, in order of volume: iron ore, grain and potash. The iron ore {{and much of the}} stone and coal are used in the steel industry. There is also some shipping of liquid and containerized cargo, but most container vessels cannot pass the locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway because the ships are too wide. The total amount of shipping on the lakes has been on a downward trend for several years.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the dry {{and liquid}} bulk {{segments}} have generated {{most of the}} canal's revenues. Bulk cargo includes dry goods, such as grains (corn, soy, and wheat, among others), minerals, fertilizers, coal, and liquid goods, such as chemical products, propane gas, crude oil, and oil derivatives. Recently, containerized cargo has replaced <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> as the canal's main income generator, moving it to second place. Vehicle carriers have become the third-largest income generator, replacing the liquid bulk segment. Shipping industry analyses conducted by the ACP and top industry experts indicate that the canal expansion will be beneficial to both the canal and its users because of the demand that will be served by allowing the transit of more tonnage.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of air-drying on the remineralization of demineralized bovine dentine was examined in wet <b>bulk</b> samples, in <b>dried</b> <b>bulk</b> samples {{as well as}} in wet thin sections. Bulk samples of bovine dentine were first demineralized in an acidic gel (pH = 5) at 37 degrees C for 3 weeks. After 24 -hour pre-treatment of either air-drying or immersion in water, the bulk samples were remineralized in a solution containing 1. 5 mM Ca, 0. 9 mM phosphate and 10 ppm F- (pH = 7) at 37 degrees C for 2, 4 or 8 days. Separately thin sections prepared from demineralized bulk dentine were immersed in water for 24 h and were also exposed to the remineralization solution for 2, 4 or 8 days. The results show that air-drying of the bulk samples increased remineralization of dentine considerably; the microradiographic parameters (1 (d), Delta Z and 1 (a)) show that the degree of remineralization ranks: thin wet sections > <b>bulk</b> <b>dried</b> > <b>bulk</b> wet. Especially, the remineralization inside lesions was greatly enhanced in thin sections and dried samples. It is presumed that the increased remineralization in dried samples is caused by a 'sponge effect', in which the remineralization fluid is sucked up in a dried shrunken lesion, resulting in fast and deep penetration of remineralization solution and/or presumably increased nucleation...|$|R
