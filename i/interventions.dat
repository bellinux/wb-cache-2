40|$|Both {{cognitive}} <b>intervention</b> {{and physical}} exercise benefit cognitive function in older adults. It {{has been suggested}} that combined cognitive and physical <b>intervention</b> may induce larger effects than cognitive or physical <b>intervention</b> alone, but existing literature has shown mixed results. This meta-analysis aimed at assessing the efficacy of combined <b>intervention</b> on cognition by comparing combined <b>intervention</b> to control group, cognitive <b>intervention</b> and physical exercise. Eligible studies were controlled trials examining the effects of combined <b>intervention</b> on cognition in older adults without known cognitive impairment. Twenty interventional studies comprising 2667 participants were included. Results showed that the overall effect size for combined <b>intervention</b> versus control group was 0. 29 (random effects model, p = 0. 001). Compared to physical exercise, combined <b>intervention</b> produced greater effects on overall effect size (0. 22, p < 0. 01), while no significant difference was found between combined <b>intervention</b> and cognitive <b>intervention.</b> Effects of combined <b>intervention</b> were moderated by age of participants, <b>intervention</b> frequency and setting. The findings suggest that combined <b>intervention</b> demonstrates advantages over control group and physical exercise, while evidence is still lacking for superiority when compared combined <b>intervention</b> to cognitive <b>intervention.</b> More well-designed studies with long follow-ups are needed to clarify the potential unique efficacy of combined <b>intervention</b> for older adults.

Spiritual <b>interventions</b> focus on developing a sense of meaning, purpose and hope for the person in their current life experience. Spiritual <b>interventions</b> involve listening to the person's story and facilitating the person to connect to God, a greater power or greater whole, perhaps by using meditation or prayer.

Spiritual <b>interventions,</b> along with psychosocial <b>interventions,</b> emphasize the importance of engagement, however, spiritual <b>interventions</b> focus more on caring and 'being with' the person during their time of crisis, rather than intervening and trying and 'fix' the problem. Spiritual <b>interventions</b> tend to be based on qualitative research and share some similarities with the humanistic approach to psychotherapy.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} context of an <b>intervention</b> programme, {{including}} possible competing demands between an <b>intervention</b> and other health service assignments, and to develop a measure of <b>intervention</b> intensity. Methods: Data used include questionnaires and interviews with <b>intervention</b> staff, protocols, and reports from the <b>intervention</b> programme, and cross-sectional health surveys. A new <b>Intervention</b> Intensity Score (IIS) is used as an indicator of the intensity of the <b>intervention.</b> Results: Initially the intensity of support and activity of the programme was high and some cardiovascular risk factors such as cholesterol and daily smoking declined. There were favourable allocations of resources in the setting and enthusiasm. Later, disturbing changes in the organisation, competing demands within Primary Health Care (PHC), and an incipient decline of the <b>intervention</b> intensity occurred. These changes accelerated and finally the <b>intervention</b> intensity faded out, parallel to unfavourable risk factor changes. The <b>Intervention</b> Intensity Score (IIS) is useful as an indicator in the interpretation of programme effectiveness.

MethodsWe combined information gained from a literature review, stakeholder focus groups, an expert group, review of local resources and mapping to the Analysis Grid for Environments Linked to Obesity (ANGELO framework) in an <b>intervention</b> development process. The study took place in 2007 in Birmingham, UK. ResultsContextual information from the stakeholder focus groups was essential for informing <b>intervention</b> development. The expert group defined guiding principles for the <b>intervention.</b> Informing <b>intervention</b> design by assessing existing local resources addressed <b>intervention</b> sustainability.
