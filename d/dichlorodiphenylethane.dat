40|$|Breast-milk {{samples from}} 101 mothers from the basin of Rio Atoya, Nicaragua, were {{collected}} on two occasions within the first trimester of lactation. Milk samples were analyzed for 13 organochlorine pesticides: (1) p^p'-dichlorophenyldichloroethylene; (2) p,p^- dichlorophenyltrichloroethane; (3) p,//-dichlorophenyldichlorodiene; (4) a-hexachlorocyclohexane; (5) P-hexachlorocyclohexane; (6) y-hexachlorocyclohexane; (7) 8 -hexachlorocyclohexane; (8) toxaphene; (9) dieldrin; (10) endrin; (11) aldrin; (12) heptachlor; and (13) heptachlor-epoxide. Organochlorines of the <b>dichlorodiphenylethane</b> class (i. e., p,p'- <b>dichlorodiphenylethane</b> and p,p'-dichlorodiphenylethane) were found in all samples and at the highest mean concentrations observed in the study. Chemicals in the hexachlorocyclohexane family (i. e., a- and 5 -hexachlorocyclohexane) were not found at all (0...|$|E
40|$|Polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) and <b>dichlorodiphenylethane</b> (DDE) methyl sulfone (MSF) metabolites possess high affinities for binding two homologous 16, 000 Da homodimeric receptor {{proteins in}} the lung (Clara cell secretory protein, CCSP) and the uterus (uteroglobin, UG), leading to selective bioaccumulation of MSFs in these tissues. As marine mammals are highly exposed to organochlorines, concentrations of PCBs, PCB MSFs, DDT, and DDE MSF were analyzed in blubber, lung, and uterus samples from harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) morbillivirus epizootic victims to investigate uterine and lung MSF accumulation. Mean uterus concentrations of PCB MSFs and DDE MSF in harbor seals were 0. 61 and 0. 04 microg/g lipid weight and in striped dolphins 0. 05 and 0. 01 microg/g lipid weight. Mean lung concentrations of PCB MSFs and DDE MSF in harbor seals were 0. 96 and 0. 02 microg/g lipid weight and in striped dolphins 0. 16 and 0. 01 microg/g lipid weight. To ascertain whether uterine and lung bioaccumulation of MSFs is possible {{due to the}} presence of CCSP and UG in seals, CCSP and UG proteins in uterine flushings and in uterine and lung and epithelial tissue from Baltic gray and ringed seals were characterized using gel electrophoresis and Western blotting techniques. UG- and CCSP-like proteins with molecular weights of 16, 000 Da were resolved in all samples. This is the first demonstration of this protein in any marine mammalian species. The toxicological implications of MSF binding with UG and CCSP in marine mammals are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Long-lived apex predators, such as marine mammals, are {{particularly}} {{at risk from}} effects of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), e. g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and <b>dichlorodiphenylethanes</b> (e. g. DDT), due to bioaccumulation and biomagnification. POPs are lipophilic compounds that tend to accumulate in the lipid-rich blubber. In marine mammals, POPs enter the body almost exclusively through the diet. In the present study, the levels of PCBs and DDTs in the blubber of striped dolphin stranded in North Sardinia were determined. Our results showed that pollutant concentration are related to age and sex of the individuals. Considering the well known harmful consequences of bioaccumulation of POPs in marine mammals, further {{studies are needed to}} determine which POPs might be linked to effects on health...|$|R
25|$|Many {{pesticides}} can {{be grouped}} into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into <b>dichlorodiphenylethanes,</b> cyclodiene compounds, {{and other related}} compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, {{but they have been}} phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate. Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates. Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., atrazine), ureas (e.g., diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., alachlor). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system. Triazines interfere with photosynthesis. Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the concentrations of}} twenty PCB congeners, p,p 0 -DDT, and its two main metabolites, p,p 0 -DDE, p,p 0 -TDE, As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn found in common chameleon eggs from nine diﬀerent nests located in Southwest Spain. Of the heavy metals and arsenic, Zn and Cu exhibited the highest concentrations in egg contents (ranging from 10 100 to 12 950 and from 567 to 706 ng g— 1 wet weight basis [w. w. ], respectively) and eggshells (ranging from 5605 to 13 290 ng g— 1 w. w. for Zn and from 1487 to 4361 ng g— 1 w. w. for Cu). Total PCB concentrations in egg contents ranged from 32 to 52 ng g— 1 w. w. and were higher than total <b>dichlorodiphenylethanes</b> concentrations (ranging from 0. 67 to 1. 9 ng g— 1 w. w., calculated as the sum of p,p 0 -DDT plus p,p 0 -DDE and p,p 0 -TDE). Comparison of {{the data from the}} present study with the data from a study conducted in 1997 revealed a large decrease in Pb concentration and a twofold increase in PCB concentrations. Taking into account all the pollutants investigated, the contamination level found in common chameleon eggs from Southwest Spain was generally lower than has been reported in the literature for eggs of diﬀerent reptile species. However, it should be borne in mind that most of the data found in the literature refer to highly polluted areasPeer reviewe...|$|R
