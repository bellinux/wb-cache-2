40|$|Abstract Introduction: The {{real-time}} {{measurement of}} active power delivered to patients during the electrosurgical act {{is still an}} engineering challenge. Besides, there is no electrosurgical unit on the market capable of doing it according to the normative requirement. Methods This work presents the design of an electronic structure capable to probe the electrosurgical equipment output electrical signals, using low-costs very common resistors, and High Frequency distortions compensation circuits, and process them to provide an analogue signal proportional to the active power, allowing the knowledge {{and control of the}} energy delivered to the biological tissue. The reading circuits and the active power calculation method are presented. The power calculation is performed in two stages. The first one consists of a multiplier circuit that uses the readings voltage and current quantities to determine the instantaneous output power, and the second stage is formed by an <b>integrating</b> <b>circuit</b> which determines the average power value, resulting in a rippled continuous voltage, proportional to the active power delivered to the patient or biological tissue. Results Practical tests of the compensation technical are statistically evaluated by means of linear regressions. Results of 23 tests are summarized in a way to demonstrate de effectiveness of the proposed system.

40|$|The pick-up {{amplification}} stage {{to be used}} for the CODD in the PS is presently under redesign. It appears that the constraints for the circuit are very {{similar to those of the}} transverse feedback project. The AB/BDI group and in particular its PI section has kindly agreed to fulfil the RF group constraints so as to obtain a common design with a common control interface. The reliability aspect is not treated here. Nevertheless radiation has been considered. At the locations foreseen for the pick-ups (SS 2, 94, 98), the annual dose measured on the vacuum chamber (ref: CERN-TIS- 2002 - 06 -TE) is about 1000 Gray per year. This value is to be compared to the 100 Gy considered as the critical dose for electronic circuits. The radiation problem has been solved for the CODD pick-ups using distance and shield (active circuits 2 meters below the floor composed of concrete slabs). The same lay out will be applied for the dampers with the drawback of the capacitive plates being loaded with a low impedance - 5 meters long- cable.

A developed dimmable circuit and the rearrangement of fluorescent trigger circuit in the platform linked together consist of this illumination simulation system. Integrating with the control on temperature and humidity, the expected environmental conditions including the sunshine illumination, temperature and humidity for botanic physiology measurement can be implemented. Many literatures confirm that various wavelengths of light will resulted in different responses on the physiology of a plant. The products from photosynthesis processes in a plant vary with segments of light spectrum absorbed. Therefore, a sturdy plant must grow with full spectrum of illumination. Since the popular and energy-saving illumination source-LED is with single specific wavelength and is unable to satisfy the full spectrum requirement for the photosynthesis processes, this approach chooses dimming fluorescent light source as illumination device. For illumination simulation, the illumination values in a greenhouse are the specification of the developed system. For realization, the dimming light circuit adjusts the amplitude, the angle, and the frequency etc. as illumination control. In this research it is verified that the dominant factor for illumination control is the load power, thus the dimming light system developed will be accomplished by implementing the amplitude adjustment.
