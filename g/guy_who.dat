After giving up 128.4 rushing {{yards a game}} in 2007, the Crimson Tide only allowed 78.8 yards per game in 2008. “As far as one <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> has changed our team more than any, you’d {{have to go with}} Terrence,” offensive lineman Mike Johnson said.

Allen Iverson criticized the policy: [...] "They're targeting <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> dress like me, <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> dress hip-hop ... I think they went way overboard." ...|$|R
5|$|Intimidation is an {{important}} element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Angel Beats! Track Zero, Hinata is a bright, {{dependable}} <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> {{is the closest}} to Otonashi. He always tries to save his friends if he can and is a reliable force in the team. He and Yui constantly irritate one another on a daily basis, but deep down, he cares for Yui, as shown when he helps her pass on by telling her he would marry her. He is a talented baseball player, and his regret in life was his failure to catch a baseball, which cost his team an important baseball game. He nicknamed Yuri as Yurippe when they co-founded the SSS as {{he did not feel}} comfortable calling her Yuri, because his mother has the same name. He has shown romantic feelings towards Yuri in Track Zero, although he finds himself getting attracted to Yui much later in the series. He died from getting hit by a truck. He uses an RPK-74 and an S 645.|$|E

According to the surviving members of the Haute Cour, with Sibylla's death Guy lost the authority he held as her husband, and the crown passed to Isabella. The Ibelins hastily divorced Isabella from Humphrey, and married her to Conrad, who now claimed the kingship. However, Guy continued to demand recognition as king.|$|E

25|$|The New York Times {{music critic}} Anthony Tommasini, who ranked Schubert as the fourth {{greatest}} composer, wrote of him:You {{have to love}} the <b>guy,</b> <b>who</b> died at 31, ill, impoverished and neglected except by a circle of friends who were in awe of his genius. For his hundreds of songs alone – including the haunting cycle Winterreise, which will never release its tenacious hold on singers and audiences – Schubert is central to our concert life.... Schubert's first few symphonies may be works in progress. But the Unfinished and especially the Great C major Symphony are astonishing. The latter one paves the way for Bruckner and prefigures Mahler.|$|E
