5|$|From March 2013, {{concerns}} over further currency war diminished, though in November several journalists and analysts warned {{of a possible}} fresh outbreak. The likely principal source of tension appeared to shift once again, this time not being the U.S. versus China or the Eurozone versus Japan, but the U.S. versus Germany. In late October U.S. treasury officials had criticized Germany for running an excessively large current account surplus, thus acting as a <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the global economy.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E
5|$|New York Dolls is the 1973 debut studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. By {{the time of}} the album's recording, the band had {{developed}} a following by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, they were unappealing to record companies because of their onstage cross-dressing and vulgarity, while most record producers were reluctant to work with them. For shock value, the group was photographed in exaggerated <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the album cover.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 5.5 million Axis troops {{attacked}} the Soviet Union. In addition to Hitler's stated purpose of acquiring Lebensraum, this large-scale offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) {{was intended to}} destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers. The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were concerned about how much longer the war would <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.|$|E
5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers <b>drag</b> <b>on,</b> the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E

5|$|The victory {{strengthened}} {{the morale of}} the Albanians. There were few, if not any, officers and soldiers who deserted afterwards. The battle of Albulena has been seen as Skanderbeg's most brilliant victory over the Ottomans. However, it also marked the high point of the Albanian resistance, beginning a new phase in Skanderbeg's quarter-century long war which would include its fiercest Ottoman invasions. Even though Skanderbeg himself had died in January 1468, the war would <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> until 1478 and later in the same year the main Albanian fortress at Krujë fell, finally effecting the annexation of Skanderbeg's Albania by the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|To his surprise, Wellesley {{found the}} entire {{combined}} army before him. Nevertheless, he resolved to attack at once, believing {{that if he}} waited for Stevenson, the Marathas would {{have the chance to}} slip away and force the pursuit to <b>drag</b> <b>on.</b> Wellesley was also eager to forge a reputation for himself, and despite his numerical disadvantage, he was confident that the Maratha’s irregular forces would be swept aside by his disciplined troops, and only Scindia’s regular infantry could be expected to stand and fight.|$|E
5|$|While these {{guns were}} {{considered}} an improvement by the Navy over {{that of the}} South Carolinas, their placement remained problematic as even in calm water, they were extremely wet and thus difficult to man. The forward guns were moved into the superstructure after sea trials. The casemate-mounted secondary armament was one deck below the main deck and provided {{the majority of the}} complaints from shipping water from the forward positions and breaking the flow of the bow wave imparting extra <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the design.|$|E

5|$|Experience with {{previous}} battlecruiser designs {{led to the}} adoption of a continuous upper deck, which raised the level of the deck aft. This was necessary because the aft decks of earlier designs were usually awash when steaming at high speed, even in calm seas. The ships were also equipped with a bulbous bow to reduce <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the hull, the first time the feature was used in the German Navy. The ships as designed required a crew of 46 officers and 1,140 enlisted sailors. Service as a squadron flagship would increase that number by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. The vessels carried a number of small boats, including two picket boats, one barge, two launches, two cutters, and three yawls.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at the UN, {{although}} the UN members and US were initially divided {{on how to}} respond to Chinese intervention in Korea, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire soon rallied the UN members towards US. Immediately afterward, a UN resolution that condemned China as an aggressor was passed on February 1. In the opinion of historian Bevin Alexander, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire had damaged the international prestige it had built from its earlier military successes, and this later made it difficult for China to either join the UN or to deny US support for Taiwan. The Korean War, which ultimately ended at the 38th parallel, would <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> for another two bloody years due to the Chinese demand for all UN forces to be withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Eugene and Jonathan Coachman. The match started with Eugene hitting an arm <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> Coachman and hitting {{numerous}} headbutts. An unknown {{woman in a}} bikini {{came out to the}} ringside area with some cookies, Coachman offered cookies to Eugene. The woman lured Eugene out of the ring and Eugene went over and grabbed some cookies. As Eugene went to grab more cookies, Coachman slammed Eugene's head into the cookie tray. A spot in the match saw Garrison Cade come out to ringside with a stuffed animal, which prompted Cade to tear up said toy animal. Cade tried to hold Eugene so Coachman could get the advantage, however, Eugene was able dodge the attack, as Coachman ended up hitting Cade instead. Eugene Rock bottomed Coachman and pinned him for the win.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins as}} Crono, Marle, and Lucca attend a {{political}} {{meeting between the}} Kingdom of Guardia and Porre. An assassin attacks; the party pursues him to the Denadoro Mts., where Lucca's prototype Time Egg backfires and sends them to the future. They find Belthasar there, who has established a research facility called Chronopolis. He warns of a new threat to the timeline, and sends the party to the Ocean Palace ruins of 11,995B.C. to investigate. They find Magus, still searching for Schala and feuding with Dalton. They confront a mysterious villain who resurrects Schala and robs the early Masamune, still embedded in the husk of the Mammon Machine. Its theft changes history, causing the Mystics' war in the Middle Ages to <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> another 50years, led by the illusionist Kasmir. The party retrieve Frog (named Glenn in Crimson Echoes) from 605A.D. and meet with Belthasar.|$|E
5|$|While the US X Corps {{was being}} {{evacuated}} {{from the eastern}} front, the US Eighth Army had already retreated to the 38th parallel {{on the western front}} {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River. With the entire UN front collapsing, the race to the Yalu was ended with the communist forces of China recapturing much of North Korea. The Korean War would <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> for another two and a half years before the armistice was signed on 27 July 1953. Besides the loss of North Korea, the US X Corps and the ROK I Corps later reported a total of 10,495 battle casualties, of which 4,385 were from the US Marines, 3,163 were from the US Army, 2,812 were from South Koreans attached to American formations and 78 were from the British Royal Marines. Outside of the combat losses, the 1st Marine Division also reported 7,338 non-battle casualties due to the cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, the blackmouth {{catshark}} {{is one of}} the most abundant sharks over the upper and middle continental slope. It is nomadic in nature and may be found alone or in groups. Relatively slow, this shark swims with strong eel-like (anguilliform) undulations of its body. It often cruises just above the sea floor, perhaps taking advantage of the ground effect (a reduction in the <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> a wing when close to the ground) to save energy. It has also been seen resting motionless on the bottom. Known predators of the {{blackmouth catshark}} include the kitefin shark (Dalatias licha) and the European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus). Parasites that have been documented from this species include the tapeworm Ditrachybothridium macrocephalum and the protist Eimeria palavensis.|$|E
