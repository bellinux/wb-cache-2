We set out to differentiate those services that are truly effective and are perceived as beneficial by franchisees from those that may have little effect or may even be perceived as counterproductive. Our survey targeted franchisors in the U. S. and in Germany, comparing the most mature <b>franchise</b> <b>market</b> globally to one that is relatively young. System disruption was found to be dependent on the maturity of the market, as little differentiation is provided in the very mature U.

Finally, different types of services have varying levels of effectiveness in the less mature <b>franchise</b> <b>market</b> in Germany. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{adopts a}} qualitative, case study {{approach}} {{to examine the}} market and partner selection processes of retailers operating internationally via franchising. Despite the increasing prevalence of franchising as an entry mode for international retailers, little research exists that considers how these firms choose <b>franchise</b> <b>markets</b> and <b>franchise</b> partners. The paper proposes a conceptual framework {{of the market and}} partner selection process that exhibits opportunistic and strategic behavior. Firms adopting a strategic approach undergo a market screening process before market attractiveness factors ultimately lead to the market selection decision. In the strategic partner selection process that follows, finance, business know-how, local knowledge, a shared understanding of the business and brand, and, ultimately, chemistry between the partners are the key factors influencing partner selection. In the case of an opportunistic approach to market and partner selection, the process reverses, with partner selection directly influencing <b>market</b> selection.

40|$|International audienceIn many countries, franchisors {{have to face}} an {{increasing}} competition and a progressive saturation of the market. A {{way for them to}} face these problems, differentiate their offers from these of the competitors and survive, is to innovate. Nevertheless, innovation within the particular context of franchising has not been explored in depth. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to work on the three following questions using the French <b>franchising</b> <b>market</b> as the source of our illustrations. What are the main features of the innovations within the franchising sector? Are there real innovations in the franchising industry as suggested by the franchisors in their advertisement? And, which actions can favour the innovations within the franchising chains? The concept of “Orchestrated Solutions”, which recently appeared in the retailing sector, will also be analyzed within the case of franchising in order to see if it can lead to a competitive advantage...|$|R

500|$|The film {{received}} mostly negative reviews, in {{part because}} of their theory that Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation was part of the <b>franchise's</b> <b>marketing</b> scheme at the time of release. This led The New York Times Vincent Canby to begin his review by proclaiming, [...] "Product merchandising marches on." [...] Another reviewer claimed to have seen almost every collectible within the film's first twenty minutes. The film was produced to serve as the franchise introduction of the Care Bear Cubs and the Care Bear Cousin Cubs, who also had their own line of toys from Kenner. The plushes, measuring 11" [...] in height, consisted of Bedtime Cub, Cheer Cub, Funshine Cub and Share Cub; the line of Care Bear Cousin Cubs included Li'l Bright Heart Raccoon, Li'l Proud Heart Cat and Li'l Swift Heart Rabbit. Kenner announced the introduction of the Cubs in 1985, shortly before the film opened, and showcased them at the American International Toy Fair in February 1986.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough the {{literature}} has provided ample {{evidence for the}} decisiveness of the franchisor–franchisee relationship in explaining organizational success or failure, performance effects of franchisee–franchisee relationships remain largely unexplored. Yet {{a growing body of}} research indicates that by building interfranchisee relationships, franchisees can form advice networks in the chain. Such networks offer privileged access to resources such as knowledge, information, and best practices that help individual franchisees to become more productive. In this context, we study linkages between a franchisee's centrality in franchisee relationships and various individual performance outcomes, using comprehensive data from franchisees in 3 different chains in the largest European <b>franchise</b> <b>market,</b> France. We find that conditional on the specific governance structure of each chain, the results document a strong impact of centrality in advice networks on franchisee performance. Accordingly, we offer theoretical contributions concerning knowledge-sharing processes in franchise chains, and managerial implications as regards more effective cooperation management in practice, from the perspective of both a franchisee and a franchisor...|$|R
