40|$|Noncustodial fathers have an {{essential}} role to play [...] both financially and emotionally [...] {{in the lives of}} their children.

Many of these fathers are poor themselves and face multiple barriers, including low education levels, limited work experience, and criminal records, which impede their success in the labor market as well as their ability to provide for their children. Working Dads: Final Report on the <b>Fathers</b> <b>at</b> Work Initiative presents findings from P/PV's evaluation of <b>Fathers</b> <b>at</b> Work, a national demonstration funded by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, designed to help low-income noncustodial fathers increase their employment and earnings, become more involved in their children's lives, and provide them with more consistent financial support. The <b>Fathers</b> <b>at</b> Work programs offered a unique combination of job training and placement, child support and fatherhood services at six well-established community-based organizations in Chicago, IL; New York, NY; Philadelphia, PA; Richmond, CA; and Roanoke, VA. Our findings suggest that the programs produced important benefits for participants, including increased earnings and child support payment. The report details the specific strategies <b>Fathers</b> <b>at</b> Work programs used and explores the policy implications of this research...|$|R
