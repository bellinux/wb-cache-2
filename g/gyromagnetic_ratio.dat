5|$|The heavy isotope 15N {{was first}} {{discovered}} by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents {{one of the}} lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>ratio,</b> (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called δ15N.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen is {{the most}} {{frequently}} imaged nucleus in MRI because it is present in biological tissues in great abundance, and because its high <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>ratio</b> gives a strong signal. However, any nucleus with a net nuclear spin could potentially be imaged with MRI. Such nuclei include helium-3, lithium-7, carbon-13, fluorine-19, oxygen-17, sodium-23, phosphorus-31 and xenon-129. 23Na and 31P are naturally abundant in the body, so can be imaged directly. Gaseous isotopes such as 3He or 129Xe must be hyperpolarized and then inhaled as their nuclear density is too low to yield a useful signal under normal conditions. 17O and 19F can be administered in sufficient quantities in liquid form (e.g. 17O-water) that hyperpolarization is not a necessity. Using helium or xenon {{has the advantage of}} reduced background noise, and therefore increased contrast for the image itself, because these elements are not normally present in biological tissues.|$|E

To overcome this difficulty, a technique called renormalization has been devised, producing finite results in very close agreement with experiments. It {{is important to note}} that a criterion for theory being meaningful after renormalization is that the number of diverging diagrams is finite. In this case the theory is said to be renormalizable. The reason for this is that to get observables renormalized one needs a finite number of constants to maintain the predictive value of the theory untouched. This is exactly the case of quantum electrodynamics displaying just three diverging diagrams. This procedure gives observables in very close agreement with experiment as seen e.g. for electron <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

500|$|When {{a neutron}} {{is put into}} a {{magnetic}} field produced by an external source, it is subject to a torque tending to orient its magnetic moment parallel to the field (hence its spin antiparallel to the field). [...] Like any magnet, the amount of this torque is proportional both to the magnetic moment and the external magnetic field. [...] Since the neutron has spin angular momentum, this torque will cause the neutron to precess with a well-defined frequency, called the Larmor frequency. It is this phenomenon that enables the measurement of nuclear properties through nuclear magnetic resonance. The Larmor frequency can {{be determined by the}} product of the <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>ratio</b> with the magnetic field strength. Since the sign of γn is negative, the neutron's spin angular momentum precesses counterclockwise about the direction of the external magnetic field.|$|E

2500|$|A non-zero spin is thus always {{associated}} with a non-zero magnetic moment (μ) via the relation , where γ is the <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>ratio.</b> It is this magnetic moment that allows the observation of NMR absorption spectra caused by transitions between nuclear spin levels. Most nuclides (with some rare exceptions) that have both even numbers of protons and even numbers of neutrons, also have zero nuclear magnetic moments, and they also have zero magnetic dipole and quadrupole moments. Hence, such nuclides do not exhibit any NMR absorption spectra. Thus, [...] {{is an example of}} a nuclide that has no NMR absorption, whereas , , [...] and [...] are nuclides that do exhibit NMR absorption spectra.

2500|$|However, a proton and neutron {{will have}} lower energy when their spins are parallel, not anti-parallel. Parallel spin {{alignment}} does not infringe upon the Pauli Exclusion Principle. The lowering {{of energy for}} parallel spins {{has to do with}} the quark structure of these two nucleons. Therefore, the spin ground state for the deuteron (the deuterium nucleus, or the 2H isotope of hydrogen)—that has only a proton and a neutron—corresponds to a spin value of 1, not of zero. The single, isolated deuteron therefore exhibits an NMR absorption spectrum characteristic of a quadrupolar nucleus of spin 1, which in the [...] "rigid" [...] state at very low temperatures is a characteristic ('Pake') doublet, (not a singlet as for a single, isolated 1H, or any other isolated fermion or dipolar nucleus of spin [...] ).
