500|$|During {{a routine}} press event, journalists, {{who had been}} briefed by Schmidt, {{questioned}} Krupinski and his deputy Karl Heinz Franke about Rudel. In this interview, the generals compared Rudel's past as a Nazi and Neo-Nazi supporter to the career of prominent Social Democrat leader Herbert Wehner, {{who had been a}} member of the German Communist Party in the 1930s, and who had lived in Moscow during World War II, where he was allegedly involved in NKVD operations. Calling Wehner an extremist, they described Rudel as an honorable man, who [...] "hadn't stolen the family silver or anything else". When these remarks became public, the Federal Minister of Defense Georg Leber, complying with §50 of the [...] (Military law), ordered the generals into early retirement as of 1 November 1976. Leber, however, a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), was heavily criticized for his actions by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) opposition, and the scandal contributed to the minister's retirement in early 1978. On 3 February 1977, the <b>German</b> <b>Bundestag</b> debated the scandal and its consequences. The Rudel Scandal subsequently triggered a military-tradition discussion, which the Federal Minister of Defense Hans Apel ended with the introduction of [...] "Guidelines for Understanding and Cultivating Tradition" [...] on 20 September 1982.|$|E

2500|$|Mixed member {{proportional}} representation (MMP) is a two-tier system that combines a single-district vote, usually first-past-the-post, with a compensatory regional or nationwide party list proportional vote. The system aims {{to combine the}} local district representation of FPTP and the proportionality of a national party list system. MMP {{has the potential to}} produce proportional or moderately proportional election outcomes, depending on a number of factors such as the ratio of FPTP seats to PR seats, the existence or nonexistence of extra compensatory seats to make up for overhang seats, and election thresholds. It was invented for the <b>German</b> <b>Bundestag</b> after the Second World War and has spread to Lesotho, Bolivia and New Zealand. [...] The system is also used for the Welsh and Scottish assemblies where it is called the additional member system.|$|E

He accepts that there is reason for the Jewish community to be concerned, but argues that any increase in antisemitic incidents is attributable to classical antisemitism. Proponents of the new antisemitism concept, he writes, see an organizing principle that allows them to formulate a new concept, but it is only in terms of this concept that many of the examples cited in evidence of it count as examples in the first place. That is, the creation of the concept may be based on a circular argument or tautology. He argues that it is an unhelpful concept, because it devalues the term [...] "antisemitism," [...] leading to widespread cynicism about the use of it. People of goodwill who support the Palestinians resent being falsely accused of antisemitism.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conclusion}} of the final settlement {{cleared the way for}} the unification of East and West Germany. Formal political union occurred on 3 October 1990, preceded by the GDR declaring its accession to the Federal Republic through Article 23 of West Germany's Basic Law (meaning that constitutionally, East Germany was subsumed into West Germany); but affected in strict legality through the subsequent Unification Treaty of 30 August 1990, which was voted into their constitutions by both the West <b>German</b> <b>Bundestag</b> and the East German Volkskammer on 20 September 1990. [...] These votes simultaneously extinguished the GDR and affected fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law (including the repeal of the very Article 23 under which the GDR had recently declared its post-dated accession). On 2 December 1990, all-German elections were held {{for the first time since}} 1933. The [...] "new" [...] country stayed the same as the West German legal system and institutions were extended to the east. The unified nation kept the name Bundesrepublik Deutschland (though the simple 'Deutschland' would become increasingly common) and retained the West German [...] "Deutsche Mark" [...] for currency as well. Berlin would formally become the capital of the united Germany, but the political institutions remained at Bonn for the time being. Only after a heated 1991 debate did the Bundestag conclude on moving itself and most of the government to Berlin as well, a process that took until 1999 to complete, when the Bundestag held its first session at the reconstructed Reichstag building. Many government departments still maintain sizable presences in Bonn as of 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Under mixed-member {{proportional}} representation, {{a type of}} Additional Member System, forty of the AMs {{are elected}} from single-member constituencies on a plurality voting system (or first past the post) basis, the constituencies being equivalent to those used for the House of Commons and twenty AMs are elected from regional closed lists using an alternative party vote. There are five regions: Mid and West Wales, North Wales, South Wales Central, South Wales East and South Wales West (these {{are the same as}} the pre 1999 European Parliament constituencies for Wales), each of which returns four members. The additional members produce a degree of proportionality within each region. Whereas voters can choose any regional party list irrespective of their party vote in the constituency election, list AMs are not elected independently of the constituency element; rather, elected constituency AMs are deemed to be pre-elected list representatives for the purposes of calculating remainders in the d'Hondt method. Overall proportionality is limited by the low proportion of list members (33% of the Assembly compared with 43% in the Scottish Parliament and 50% in the <b>German</b> <b>Bundestag)</b> and the regionalisation of the list element. Consequently, the Assembly as a whole has a greater degree of proportionality (based on proportions in the list elections) than the plurality voting system used for British parliamentary elections, but still deviates somewhat from proportionality. The single transferable vote system had been considered for the Assembly by the Labour Party as early as 1995–96, but according to the evidence given to the Richard Commission by Ron Davies, a former Welsh Secretary, ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{widespread}} calls from public figures, governments and organizations to the Iranian government {{to release the}} Bahá'ís, especially after the trial was announced on February 11, 2009.

[...] Later congressman Mark Kirk of Illinois offered a resolution {{on the subject of}} the trial condemning the government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of its Bahá'í minority; the resolution was co-sponsored by other Representatives. A Senatorial resolution has been introduced by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, cosponsored by Sam Brownback, Kansas; Robert Menendez, New Jersey; Olympia Snowe, Maine; and Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island. In Canada, Deepak Obhrai, Canadian Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, found the announcement of the trial very troubling, which was echoed by Lawrence Cannon, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs. In Germany, German chairman of the CSU Group in the Bundestag, Peter Ramsauer stated that he had [...] "deep concern". In the United Kingdom, British Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell also expressed concern over the trial. The Presidency of the European Union (EU), with the support of the EU associated countries denounced the trial, which was echoed by the President of the European Parliament. In Australia, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spoke to the subject, as did Mark Weitzman, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Task Force Against Hate. In the Netherlands, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen said the Netherlands was seriously concerned, fears that the trial will not be fair and has asked for an independent observer. The Canadian Parliamentary Sub-Committee on Human Rights has adopted a strongly worded motion February 24 which was forwarded to the full committee on the 26th. On the same day the UK Board of Deputies president, Henry Grunwald QC, has written to Foreign Secretary David Miliband with a renewed call to the government to support the persecuted Bahá’i community in Iran. Repeating steps taken in 2006 following the UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Religion reports of the time, in April 2009 the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Lower House of the Spanish Congress of Deputies unanimously approved a resolution concerning the [...] "systematic" [...] persecution being exerted on the Bahá'í community. In May 2009 a motion from the Australian House of Representatives expressed [...] "serious concern" [...] there was no access to legal representation or due legal process, that charges of [...] "spying, insulting religious sanctities, and propaganda against the Islamic Republic, and that these charges could attract the death penalty". The Representatives rose in motion calling on Iran [...] "to respect rights to freedom of religion and the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression and association, in accordance with international human rights conventions" [...] and [...] "to release the seven Baha’i detainees without delay." [...] Six members of Parliament from both major parties spoke in support of the motion: Leichhardt Turnour, Cowan Simpkins, Hindmarsh Georganas, O’Connor Turckey, Isaacs Dreyfus, and Longman Sullivan.
