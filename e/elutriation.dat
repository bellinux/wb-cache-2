50|$|The basic {{principle}} of separating the cells inside CCE is {{the balance between}} centrifugal force and the counter flow drag force. When the cells enter the <b>elutriation</b> chamber, all the cells will stay at {{the outer edge of}} the chamber due to centrifugal force. Then when we increase the flow rate of the buffer solution, due to the special design of the CCE, the solution tends to push the cells towards the middle of the CCE: we call this counter flow drag force. As the flow rate of the buffer solution increase, when the counter flow drag force outweigh the centrifugal force the smaller cells will be driven by the net force and leave the chamber first. In contrast the larger cells will stay within the <b>elutriation</b> chamber. So the cells escape from the <b>elutriation</b> chamber can be collected in the exit of the system.|$|E

40|$|An <b>elutriation</b> {{apparatus}} {{has been}} proposed for determining the settling velocity distributions of suspended solids in combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The apparatus consisted {{of a series of}} interconnected cylindrical settling chambers, through which the sample was drawn using a peristaltic pump attached to the outlet of the last settling chamber. Since the diameters of the cylin-ders were progressively increasing, sediment with different settling velocities settled in different cylinders. By measuring the amount of sediment in each cylinder, the settling velocity distribution was deduced. The apparatus was tested using samples from a CSO outfall in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The test results showed that the apparatus performed well for determining settling characteristics of suspended solids and chemical distribution in different settling fractions. The effectiveness of polymer addition to enhance flocculation and settling of CSOs was also tested in this apparatus. The <b>elutriation</b> apparatus proposed here offers several advantages over the traditional methods (i. e., settling columns) of measurements of settling velocity distributions.

One of the tasks supported by this funding at Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNNL) was In-Tank <b>Elutriation.</b> <b>Elutriation</b> is the process whereby physical separation occurs based on particle size and density. This report satisfies {{the first phase of}} Task WP_ 1. 3. 1. 1 In-Tank <b>Elutriation,</b> which is to assess the feasibility of this method of separation in waste tanks at Hanford Site and SRS. This report includes an analysis of scoping tests performed in the Engineering Development Laboratory of SRNL, analysis of Hanford's inadvertent <b>elutriation,</b> the viability of separation methods such as <b>elutriation</b> and hydrocyclones and recommendations for a path forward. This report will demonstrate that the retrieval of Hanford salt waste tank S- 112 very successfully decreased the tank's inventories of radionuclides. Analyses of samples collected from the tank showed that concentrations of the major radionuclides Cs- 136 and Sr- 90 were decreased by factors of 250 and 6 and their total curie tank inventories decreased by factors of 60, 000 and 2000. The total tank curie loading decreased from 300, 000 Ci to 55 Ci. The remaining heel was nearly all innocuous gibbsite, Al(OH) {sub 3 }. However, in the process of tank retrieval approximately 85 % of the tank gibbsite was also removed. Significant amounts of money and processing time could be saved if more gibbsite could be left in tanks while still removing nearly all of the radionuclides. There were factors which helped to make the <b>elutriation</b> of Tank S- 112 successful which would not necessarily be present in all salt tanks. 1. The gibbsite particles in the tank were surprisingly large, as much as 200 {micro}m. The gibbsite crystals had probably grown in size over a period of decades. 2. The radionuclides were apparently either in the form of soluble compounds, like cesium, or micrometer sized particles of actinide oxides or hydroxides. 3. After the initial tank retrieval the tank contained cobble which is not conducive to <b>elutriation.</b> Only after the tank contents were treated with thousands of gallons of 50 wt% caustic, were the solids converted to sand which is compatible with <b>elutriation.</b> Discussions between SRNL and PNNL resulted in plans to test <b>elutriation</b> in two phases; in Phase 1 particles would be separated by differences in settling velocity in an existing scaled tank with its associated hardware and in Phase 2 additional hardware, such as a hydrocyclone, would be added downstream to separate slow settling partciels from liquid. Phase 1 of in-tank <b>elutriation</b> was tested for Proof of Principle in theEngineering Development Laboratory of SRNL in a 41 " diameter, 87 gallon tank. The tank had been previously used as a 1 / 22 scale model of Hanford Waste Tank AY- 102. The objective of the testing was to determine which tank operating parameters achieved the best separation between fast- and slow-settling particles. For Phase 1 testing a simulated waste tank supernatant, slow-settling particles and fast-settling particles were loaded to the scaled tank. Because this was a Proof of Principle test, readily available solids particles were used that represented fast-settling and slow-settling particles. The tank contents were agitated using rotating mixer jet pumps (MJP) which suspended solids while liquids and solids were drawn out of the tank with a suction tube. The goal was to determine the optimum hydraulic operating conditions to achieve clean separation in which the residual solids in the tank were nearly all fast-settling particles and the solids transferred out of the tank were nearly all slow-settling particles. Tests were conducted at different pump jet velocities, suction tube diameters and suction tube elevations. Testing revealed that the most important variable was jet velocity which translates to a downstream fluid velocity {{in the vicinity of the}} suction tube which can suspend particles and potentially allow their removal from the tank. The optimum jet velocity in the vicinity of the sucti 9 on tube was between 1. 5 and 2 ft/s (4 - 5 gpm). During testing at lower velocities a significant amount of slow-settling particles remained in the tank. At higher velocities a significant amount of fast-settling particles were elutriated from the tank. It should be noted that this range of velocities is appropriate for this particular geometry and particles. However, the principle of In-Tank <b>Elutriation</b> was proved. In-tank <b>elutriation</b> has the potential to save much money in tank closure. However, more work, both analytical and experimental, must be done before an improved version of the process could be applied to actual waste tanks. It is recommended that testing with more prototypic simulants be conducted. Also, scale-up criteria for <b>elutriation</b> and the resulting size of pilot scale test equipment require investigation during future research. In addition, it is recommended that the use of hydrocyclones be pursued in Phase 2 testing. Hydrocyclones are a precise and efficient separation tool that are frequently used in industry...|$|E
