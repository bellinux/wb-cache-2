5|$|Speaking on the {{evolving}} relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack {{believes that the}} season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe's life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe would drop anything for Clark, but now that Chloe has other priorities, it makes Clark realize how valuable she is to him. The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can <b>finally</b> <b>have</b> a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark's secret, as well as keeping {{the fact that she}} is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe's heart that Clark occupied for so long.|$|E

They believe that Satan will <b>finally</b> <b>have</b> to bear the {{responsibility}} for the sins of the believers of all ages, and that this was foreshadowed on the Day of Atonement when the high priest confessed the sins of Israel over the head of the scapegoat (Leviticus 16:21).|$|E
25|$|When Madison {{left office}} in 1817 at age 65, he retired to Montpelier, his tobacco {{plantation}} in Orange County, Virginia, {{not far from}} Jefferson's Monticello. Dolley, who thought they would <b>finally</b> <b>have</b> a chance to travel to Paris, was 49. As with both Washington and Jefferson, Madison left the presidency a poorer man than when elected. His plantation experienced a steady financial collapse, due to the continued price declines in tobacco and also due to his stepson's mismanagement.|$|E

Jeane reveals in a fast-forwarded cutscene that their father had sexually abused her all her life, thus forcing her to become a prostitute to survive and become a killer.

Boy Scout, Cliff Elliot, stirs the pot as he tries to cling to the last shreds of patriotism and earn his Eagle Scout Award.

25|$|Warren {{was able}} to {{investigate}} the inside of these gates. Warren's Gate and the Golden Gate simply head towards {{the centre of the}} Mount, fairly quickly giving access to the surface by steps. Barclay's Gate is similar, but abruptly turns south as it does so; {{the reason for this is}} currently unknown. The double and triple gates (the Huldah Gates) are more substantial; heading into the Mount for some distance they each <b>finally</b> <b>have</b> steps rising to the surface just north of the al-Aqsa Mosque. The passageway for each is vaulted, and has two aisles (in the case of the triple gate, a third aisle exists for a brief distance beyond the gate); the eastern aisle of the double gates and western of the triple gates reach the surface, the other aisles terminating some way before the steps – Warren believed that one aisle of each original passage was extended when the al-Aqsa Mosque blocked the original surface exits.|$|E
25|$|Both Gold and Belle set off {{to search}} for Gideon's heart. Henry helps Emma escape from Gideon (knocking him out with a fire extinguisher) with Emma placing a {{protection}} spell to contain him temporarily. The others realize that Fiona has crafted the perfect trap: If Gideon kills Emma, Light will be destroyed. And if Emma kills Gideon, she will turn dark and Light will still be destroyed. Regina consoles Emma and encourages her to find another way like she always does. Emma attempts to hold off Gideon as Gold finds Gideon's heart. When Gold finds Gideon's heart he is tempted by {{a manifestation of the}} Darkness, which takes the form of his Enchanted Forest counterpart, Rumplestiltskin. The Dark One manifestation tells him to let Gideon kill Emma so he can <b>finally</b> <b>have</b> it all: power and love. The manifestation reminds Gold of what Fiona told him, that if Emma dies his Dark Magic will increase exponentially. After it's all over he can spend 100 years exploring the world with Belle, and spend the next 200 years destroying it. Gold resists and chooses {{to do the right thing}} and tries to use Gideon's heart to stop him from killing Emma. However Fiona's spell keeps him from being able to free Gideon and instead Gideon's heart stops beating and dims. The manifestation taunts Gold before disappearing and Gold heads out to Belle who consoles him for trying to do the right thing. Back at the intersection, Emma and Gideon fight with Emma acknowledging her role as the Savior to protect those she loves, protect the innocent and to spread light and hope no matter what the cost. Realizing what she must do, Emma throws down her sword and Gideon apologizes and kills her releasing an enormous blast of light magic, ending the Final Battle.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{his long}} army career, Dwight Eisenhower {{and his wife}} never had a house to call their own, with the couple moving from army post to army post. After he became Columbia University's {{president}} in 1948, Mamie requested that they <b>finally</b> <b>have</b> a place to call their own. A married couple that were friends with the Eisenhowers, George and Mary Allen, had recently purchased a small farm around Gettysburg, and recommended the area. In 1950, they found a [...] "run-down farm" [...] {{on the outskirts of}} Gettysburg, and purchased the farm and its [...] for $40,000 (equal to $ today) from one Allen Redding, who had owned the farm since 1921. Eisenhower stated that he could feel the [...] "forgotten heroisms" [...] that occurred on the grounds as the Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E

500|$|This {{petition}} is {{reproduced in}} Kernaghan, [...] (1857), pp. 12–14]. [...] At {{a time when}} a sense of Canadian nationality was tenuous in the northwest, that region relied on the Red River Trails and its successor steamboat and rail lines as an outlet for its products and a source of supplies. [...] An active Manifest Destiny faction in Minnesota sought to exploit these commercial ties as a means of acquiring northwestern Canada for the United States. [...] This pressure prompted Canada to take over the Hudson's Bay Company territory in return for monetary and land compensation. It contributed to Canadian Confederation and the establishment of Manitoba. It also led to the decision that there should be an all-Canada route for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Not until completion of that line in 1885 did Manitoba and the northwest <b>finally</b> <b>have</b> reliable and efficient access to eastern Canada by a route located entirely on Canadian soil.|$|E

500|$|The {{turn of the}} 20th century saw {{a rise in the}} {{popularity}} of Fauré's music in Britain, {{and to a lesser extent}} in Germany, Spain and Russia. He visited England frequently, and an invitation to play at Buckingham Palace in 1908 opened many other doors in London and beyond. He attended the London premiere of Elgar's First Symphony, in 1908, and dined with the composer afterwards. Elgar later wrote to their mutual friend Frank Schuster that Fauré [...] "was such a real gentleman– the highest kind of Frenchman and I admired him greatly." [...] Elgar tried to get Fauré's Requiem put on at the Three Choirs Festival, but it did not <b>finally</b> <b>have</b> its English premiere until 1937, nearly fifty years after its first performance in France. Composers from other countries also loved and admired Fauré. In the 1880s Tchaikovsky had thought him [...] "adorable"; Albéniz and Fauré were friends and correspondents until the former's early death in 1909; Richard Strauss sought his advice; and in Fauré's last years, the young American, Aaron Copland was a devoted admirer.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers were {{critical}} of what Votta called [...] "a really regrettable sequence where Emma leaves a pamphlet about losing her virginity on Schue's desk {{and then they}} <b>finally</b> <b>have</b> sex". Bell characterized it as [...] "weird and uncomfortable, and the reasoning was horrendously misogynistic", and VanDerWerff thought that making it part of the post-Nationals victory montage as [...] "a little too creepy, at best". Votta thought that though the victory segment [...] "should feel joyous", it instead feels [...] "awkward and emotion-less". Will's being awarded [...] "Teacher of the Year" [...] was called [...] "surprising" [...] by Strecker, who hearkened back to him having [...] "discovered that he wasn't so good" [...] at teaching Spanish [...] "a few months ago". Bell asked how it was [...] "possible" [...] for Quinn to so rapidly recover her ability to walk and then dance, something also touched on by VanDerWerff, who was again critical of [...] "Fox's rampant abuse of the Twitter hashtag thing" [...] by displaying onscreen hashtags during the episode. Strecker praised Jesse's scenes, and said she [...] "couldn't stop cracking up".|$|E
500|$|The episode premiered to near {{universal}} critical acclaim.

This episode is nearly everything a Fringe fan could have asked for... Besides the awesomeness with the Bishops, Olivia finally returns to taking an active role in an episode... But {{the most important thing is}} that the overarching Fringe plot finally progressed, and it's going in a pretty damn good direction". Jane Boursaw from TV Squad enjoyed the episode because it had a [...] "few reveals and a nice cliffhanger." [...] She liked the interactions between Walter and Peter, and also praised the scene between Olivia and Newton. Josh Wigler of MTV was pleased that the [...] "mystery of the week" [...] also tied into the ongoing plot, and that answers were provided to certain mysteries, such as why Walter's behavior and personality is [...] "a little...off.
