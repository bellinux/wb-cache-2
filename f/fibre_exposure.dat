40|$|Objectives Studies {{of workers}} in two US cohorts of {{asbestos}} textile workers exposed to chrysotile (North Carolina (NC) and South Carolina (SC)) found increasing risk of lung cancer mortality with cumulative <b>fibre</b> <b>exposure.</b> However, the risk appeared to increase more steeply in SC, possibly {{due to differences in}} study methods. The authors conducted pooled analyses of the cohorts and investigated the exposure-disease relationship using uniform cohort inclusion criteria and statistical methods. Methods Workers were included after 30 days of employment in a production job during qualifying years, and vital status ascertained through 2003 (2001 for SC). Poisson regression was used to estimate the exposure-response relationship between asbestos and lung cancer, using both exponential and linear relative rate models adjusted for age, sex, race, birth cohort and decade of follow-up. Results The cohort included 6136 workers, contributing 218 631 person-years of observation and 3356 deaths. Cumulative exposures at the four study facilities varied considerably. The pooled relative rate for lung cancer, comparing 100 f-yr/ml to 0 f-yr/ml, was 1. 11 (95 % CI 1. 06 to 1. 16) for the combined cohort, with different effects in the NC cohort (RR 1. 10, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 16) and the SC cohort (RR 1. 67, 95 % CI 1. 44 to 1. 93).

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the relationship of mortality from lung cancer and other selected causes to asbestos exposure levels. Methods: A cohort of 1539 male workers from a chrysotile mine in China was followed for 26 years.

Individual cumulative <b>fibre</b> <b>exposures</b> (f-yr/ml) were estimated based on converted dust measurements and working years at specific workshops. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for lung cancer, gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, all cancers and nonmalignant respiratory diseases (NMRD) stratified by employment years, estimated cumulative <b>fibre</b> <b>exposures,</b> and smoking, were calculated.

40|$|Abstract—/As {{part of an}} ongoing, industry-wide {{study in}} the {{manufacture}} of refractory ceramic fibres (RCF), time weighted average (TWA) exposures have been collected at five facilities according to a standardised protocol. Work activities were grouped into dust zones (DZs). Persons to be sampled were randomly selected according to a protocol designed to assure that at least one sample was collected annually from each DZ; each work shift is also sampled at least annually. TWA exposures calculated over a sampling period of at least 360 min were included in the data set. DZs were combined into one of three groups (DZGs) : fibre production; vacuum processes; other. The data were analysed to identify any differences by DZG between airborne <b>fibre</b> <b>exposures,</b> by the shift worked at each facility, and across all facilities. There were no statistically significant shift-related differences detected between airborne <b>fibre</b> <b>exposures</b> across the five RCF facilities when analysed as a group. Within four of the facilities, no shift-related differences were detected between airborne fibre exposures; however, at one facility, first and third shift exposures were statistically different. No documentation related to job activities was found to account for the observation. The data generally support the use of a single exposure estimate for each DZG in each of these facilities, regardless of shift worked. Researchers reconstructing exposure and not able to determine the shift worked by study subjects may find these results useful, but are cautioned that substantial differences in exposure across shifts may exist in other types of manufacturing. ! © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. —...|$|R

However, there is little data that relates specifically to wearing asbestos gloves or mitts, particularly when used in hot environments such as those found in glass manufacturing. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the likely personal exposure to asbestos fibres when asbestos mitts were used.

We examined effects of asbestos (chrysotile) fibre on the proliferation of PHA-stimulated lymphocytes and the PHA binding activity of lymphocytes in vitro.

The enhancement of PHA binding activity by chrysotile fibre was observed on CD 8 + but not on CD 4 + cells.

The association of metallic dust exposure, such as beryllium and aluminium, and sarcoidlike pulmonary disorders is well known.

Recently, we observed the association of sarcoidlike granulomatous reaction and occupational history of glass <b>fibre</b> <b>exposure.</b> We hypothesized {{that there might be}} a relationship between MMMF exposure and the development of sarcoidlike granulomas. Therefore, the records of 50 sarcoidosis patients—who visited our outpatient clinic between 1996 and 1999 —were reviewed. This revealed that 14 cases recalled a history of exposure to either glass fibres or rock wool, both MMMF fibres. The available obtained tissue specimens (n= 12) were reviewed. In six cases electron microscopy qualitative analysis of small fragments of the tissue revealed among others silica, aluminium and sometimes titanium. A distinct relation between fibre deposits fibre deposits and granulomas was found. These findings indicate that in susceptible people MMMF exposure might be related to a chronic granulomatous disease similar to chronic beryllium disease...|$|E
40|$|Mortality {{reports on}} {{asbestos}} exposed cohorts which gave information on exposure levels from which (as a minimum) a cohort average cumulative exposure could be estimated were reviewed. At exposure levels seen in occupational cohorts {{it is concluded}} that the exposure specific risk of mesothelioma from the three principal commercial asbestos types is broadly in the ratio 1 : 100 : 500 for chrysotile, amosite and crocidolite respectively. For lung cancer the conclusions are less clear cut. Cohorts exposed only to crocidolite or amosite record similar exposure specific risk levels (around 5 % excess lung cancer per f/ml. yr); but chryso-tile exposed cohorts show a less consistent picture, with a clear discrepancy between the mortality experience of a cohort of chrysotile textile workers in Carolina and the Quebec miners cohort. Taking account of the excess risk recorded by cohorts with mixed <b>fibre</b> <b>exposures</b> (generally, 1 %), the Carolina experience looks uptypically high. It is suggested that a best estimate lung cancer risk for chrysotile alone would be 0. 1 %, with a highest reasonable estimate of 0. 5 %.

40|$|A {{short and}} a long fibre sample of amosite {{asbestos}} were tested for their effects on cells of the human Type 2 alveolar epithelial cell-line A 549 in vitro. The long amosite sample was found to cause a rapid detachment of the epithelial cells live from their substratum. At the highest dose, on average 28 % of the cells present were detached in this way. Studies on the mechanism of the detachment injury showed {{that it did not}} involve oxidants since it was not ameliorated by scavengers of active oxygen species. Neither was the effect reduced by treatment of the fibres with the iron chelator Desferal. Treatments reported to increase the interaction between fibres and cells, serum and poly-L-lysine, did not influence the detachment injury, nor did lung lining fluid. Conversely, the fibronectin tripeptide RGD alone could cause detachment which suggested that a fibronectin-binding integrin was involved. This receptor could be reduced in activity by long <b>fibre</b> <b>exposure,</b> leading to detachment. The detaching effect of fibre could be mimicked by the protein kinase C activator PMA, and so the second messenger system of the cell could also be involved.

40|$|A small {{cohort of}} 194 men with low {{exposure}} to fibrous tremolite (mean 0. 75 f/ml y) in the mining and milling of vermiculite in South Carolina experienced 51 deaths 15 {{years or more}} from first employment. The SMR (all causes) was 1. 17 reflecting excess deaths from circulatory disease. There were four deaths from lung cancer and 3. 31 expected (SMR 1. 21, 95 % CI 0. 33 - 3. 09). Three of the four deaths were in the lowest exposure category (less than 1 f/ml y); no death was attributed to mesothelioma or pneumoconiosis. These findings contrast with those in Montana where the vermiculite ore was heavily contaminated with fibrous tremolite. A radiographic survey of 86 current and recent South Carolina employees found four with small parenchymal opacities (greater {{than or equal to}} 1 / 0) and seven with pleural thickening. These proportions were not higher than in a non-exposed group and much lower than had been observed in Montana. Examination of sputum from 76 current employees showed that only two specimens contained typical ferruginous bodies, confirming low cumulative <b>fibre</b> <b>exposure.</b> Any possible adverse effects of work with vermiculite, minimally contaminated with fibrous or non-fibrous tremolite, were thus beyond the limits of detection in this workforce...|$|E

The vital status of the entire cohort was ascertained to the end of 1989. Of the 504 deaths that occurred between 1970 and 1989, 61 were attributed to lung cancer (cases). Individually matched controls were randomly selected from the remaining deaths. Attempts were made to locate and interview the surviving families of the cases and controls. The families of three lung cancer cases could not be located and no matched controls were found for another three cases. Included in the final analysis were 55 cases and 98 controls. Estimates of individual exposure to MMVF were based on employment records and industrial hygiene surveys. Data on smoking and histories of employment outside the MMVF industry were obtained from telephone interviews and employment records. Relative risks were calculated for cigarette smoking and exposure to MMVF. No increased risk of lung cancer was found associated with exposure to MMVF, and analysis by cumulative <b>fibre</b> <b>exposure</b> did not indicate any trend. As expected, cigarette smoking was found to be responsible for the observed increase in mortality from lung cancer in this group of MMVF workers, and the risk increased with increasing pack-years of cigarette smoking...|$|E
40|$|Malignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} (MPM) is a locally aggressive neoplasm, principally linked to asbestos <b>fibres</b> <b>exposure.</b> Strong evidences associate this pollutant with induction of DNA breaks, aberrant chromosomes segregation and important chromosomal rearrangements, considered crucial events in malignant transformation. A considerable contribution to cellular transformation in MPM is also {{given by the}} presence of high genomic instability, {{as well as by the}} increased DNA methylation, and consequent decreased expression, of tumor-suppressor genes. In this study we first demonstrated that MPM cells are characterized by a decreased methylation level of pericentromeric DNA sequences which can justify, at least in part, the genomic instability observed in this neoplasia. Concomitantly, we found a paradoxical increased expression of DNMT 1, the most expressed DNA methyltransferases in MPM cells, DNMT 3 a and all five isoforms of DNMT 3 b. Thus, we compared two experimental strategies, DNMT 1 silencing and usage of a demethylating agent (5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine or Decitabine), both theoretically able to revert the locally hypermethylated phenotype and considered potential future therapeutic approaches for MPM. Interestingly, both strategies substantially decrease cell survival of MPM cells but the antitumor activity of Decitabine, differently from DNMT 1 silencing, is mediated, at least in part, by a p 53 -independent p 21 upregulation, and is characterized by the arrest of MPM cells at the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle. These results indicate that the two approaches act probably through different mechanisms and, thus, that DNMT 1 silencing can be considered an effective alternative to Decitabine for cancer treatment...|$|R

The Ca 2 +- and Sr 2 +-activation properties of single mechanically skinned skeletal muscle fibres from the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of the short-nosed echidna were determined. Sigmoidal curves fitted to force response data plotted {{as a function of}} pCa (–log[Ca 2 +]), had a mean slope of 4. 32 ± 0. 28 and a mean pCa 50 and pCa 10 value of 6. 18 ± 0. 01 and 6. 41 ± 0. 02 respectively (n = 20). The mean pSr 50, pSr 10 and slope values of curves fitted to the force-response data after activation with Sr 2 + were 4. 80 ± 0. 03, 5. 29 ± 0. 07 and 2. 75 ± 0. 18 respectively (n = 20).

The effects of ATP were determined by measuring the relative changes of miniature endplate potentials (mEPPs) and voltage responses to step current pulses in individual muscle <b>fibres.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to ATP (20 μm) prolonged the mEPP falling phase by 31 ± 7. 5 % (values ±s. d., n= 3 fibres). Concurrently, the input resistance increased by 31 ± 2. 0 % and the time course of the voltage responses increased by 59 ± 3. 0 %. Analogous effects were observed using 2 and 5 μmATP, and on regions distal from the neuromuscular junction, indicating that physiologically relevant levels of ATP enhanced electrical signalling over the entire muscle fibre. The effects of extracellular ATP were blocked by 200 μmanthracene- 9 -carboxylic acid, a chloride channel inhibitor, and reduced concentrations of extracellular chloride, indicating that ATP inhibited chloride channels. A high affinity agonist for P 2 Y receptors, 2 -methylthioadenosine- 5 ′-O-diphosphate (2 MeSADP), induced similar effects to ATP with an EC 50 of 160 ± 30 nm. The effects of 250 nm 2 MeSADP were blocked by 500 nmMRS 2179, a specific P 2 Y 1 receptor inhibitor, suggesting that ATP acts on P 2 Y 1 receptors to inhibit chloride channels.

In some Cappodocian villages there is strong evidence that erionite, and possibly related minerals, are responsible for the high level of mesothelioma found there. So, although mesothelioma clusters have not been reported in Kandovan, it is a plausible hypothesis that many cases of mesothelioma in Iran may be due to naturally occurring fibrous zeolites. Methods: A detailed study of Iranian geology was made to determine similarities between the Kandovan region and Cappadocia, ‘inter-mountain zones’ in the Western US and Mexico. Areas where mesothelioma cases probably attributable to erionite exposure have been found. Results:Although there is a long history of asbestos use in Iran many cases of mesothelioma do not present with positive asbestos exposure histories. Since fibrous zeolites are so widespread, why have not more mesotheliomas attributable to them been found throughout Iran? Various possible reasons were explored including misdiagnosis, poor surveillance, a general lack of awareness that this tumor may be linked to mineral <b>fibre</b> <b>exposure.</b> There is also the analytical problem of identifying fibrous erionite in lung tissue. Conclusions:There is every reason to believe mesotheliomas due to fibrous zeolite including erionite will be found in Iran.

A three phase 50 / 30 μm PDV/DVB/CAR fibre was used for the extraction process. The optimal sealing time for volatiles reaching equilibrium from whole fruit in the headspace of the chamber was 20, 16, 8 and 16 hours for lemon, lime, mandarin, and orange respectively. Optimum <b>fibre</b> <b>exposure</b> times for whole fruit were 2, 4, 2 and 2 hours for lemon, lime, mandarin, and orange respectively. Three chamber volumes (500, 1000 and 2000 ml) were evaluated for the collection of VOCs with the 500 ml chamber being selected. The 500 ml chamber produced the highest quality peak areas and quantity of extracted volatiles. As a result of fruit respiration, the percentage of oxygen (O 2) of all citrus fruit species in 500 ml chamber decreased from 21. 8 % to 18. 8 % in the 20 hours sealing time, while carbon dioxide (CO 2) contents increased to 2. 9 % also in the 20 hours sealing time. The results of this study showed the feasibility of this technique for identifying VOCs from four of the citrus fruit species and its potential as a routine method for physiological studies on citrus fruit or on other fruit species...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to review published data on the carcinogenicity of asbestos fibres with regard to the elucidation of a potential risk originating from exposure to man-made vitreous fibres (MMVF). Steps in the comparison of the two fibre classes are characterization of the fibres, pulmonary deposition, biodurability and biopersistence and a review of the cancer risk from asbestos fibres after inhalation in rats and humans. Various dust samples of chrysotile, crocidolite, and amosite were used as reference materials in studies with experimental animals. These fibres are normally thinner and shorter than MMVF. These differences in dimensions cause differences in. the deposition in the airways. In addition, significant dissimilarities exist in the deposition pattern between rats and humans. Data from biopersistence studies show that focusing only on fibres longer than 20 æm and using weighted half-time for a characterization of risk may be misleading. Inhalation experiments with rats need <b>fibre</b> <b>exposure</b> concentrations over 100 times higher to match the lung cancer risk of asbestos workers, and about 1000 times higher to reach the same mesothelioma risk. Also, the striking difference between the low lung burden of amphibole fibres of asbestos workers with mesothelioma and the more than 1000 times higher lung burden of rats with a low mesothelioma risk demonstrates the low sensitivity of the inhalation test model for the carcinogenic potency even of crocidolite fibres. It can be concluded that the rat inhalation model is also not sensitive enough to predict the cancer risk of other fibre types for humans...|$|E
40|$|Poster presentationIntroduction: Malignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} (MPM) is the commonest form of mesothelioma. Asbestos and erionite <b>fibre</b> <b>exposure</b> are notable causes of MPM. Combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin {{is the cornerstone}} chemotherapy in clinical management of MPM with a median overall survival of 12 months far from satisfactory. Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid in tumours, but non-essential in normal cells. Arginine-degrading enzymes (arginase and arginine deiminase) {{have been used to}} treat different cancers with inability to synthesize arginine. BCT- 100 is a pegylated arginase which is currently undergoing formal phase I/II clinical trials in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma at Queen Mary Hospital with encouraging results. The effect of BCT- 100 has not been investigated in MPM. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of BCT- 100 in MPM in vitro and in vivo. Method: A panel of MPM cell lines (H 28, 211 H, H 226, H 2052 and H 2452) was used. The effect of BCT- 100 on cell viability and protein expression was studied by Crystal Violet assay and Western blot respectively. The in vivo effect of BCT- 100 was investigated with nude mice xenograft models. Results: BCT- 100 reduced cell viability with IC 50 values ranges from 13 - 22 mU/ml in different MPM cell lines after 72 hours incubation. BCT- 100 suppressed tumor growth in H 226 and 211 H nude mice xenografts in a dose dependent manner. The median survival was significantly increased accompanied with induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in BCT- 100 treatment group when compared with control group in both xenografts. Conclusion: BCT- 100 (pegylated arginase) reduced cell viability in vitro. BCT- 100 also suppressed tumor growth and increased median survival which is partially mediated by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vivo.

40|$|Regenerative Ca 2 + {{waves and}} {{oscillations}} indicative of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) activity were induced in fully polarized, fluo- 3 -loaded, intact frog skeletal muscle <b>fibres</b> by <b>exposure</b> to hypertonic Ringer solutions. The calcium waves persisted in fibres exposed to EGTA-containing solutions, during sustained depolarization of the membrane potential or following treatment with the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) -blocker nifedipine. The waves were {{blocked by the}} ryanodine receptor (RyR) -specific agents ryanodine and tetracaine, and potentiated by caffeine. In addition to these pharmacological properties, the amplitudes, frequency and velocity of such hypertonicity-induced waves closely resembled those of Ca 2 + waves previously described in dyspedic skeletal myocytes expressing the cardiac RyR- 2. Quantitative transmission and freeze-fracture electronmicroscopy demonstrated a reversible cell shrinkage, transverse (T) -tubular luminal swelling and decreased T-sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) junctional gaps in fibres maintained in and then fixed using hypertonic solutions. The {{findings are consistent with}} a hypothesis in which RyR-Ca 2 + release channels can be partially liberated from their normal control by T-tubular DHPR-voltage sensors in hypertonic solutions, thereby permitting CICR to operate even in such fully polarized skeletal muscle fibres...|$|R
40|$|Graft {{copolymerization}} of {{acrylic acid}} onto bleached jute fibre {{has been studied}} in aqueous solution with redox initiation system KzSzOniFeSOa. The bleached and grafted jute fibres were dyed with reactive dyes viz. Reactive Red 2, Reactive Orange 14, Reactive Blue 4 and Reactive Brown 10. It has been observed {{that the percentage of}} dye exhaustion decreases with the increase of grafting percentage. The colour fastness of dyed fibre with light, acid and alkali perspiration, and washing and spotting tests, has been assessed. For all cases grafted fibre possesses better colour fastness. The tensile strength of grafted jute <b>fibre</b> with prolonged <b>exposure</b> to sunlight, to sunlight has been measured. The grafted fibre shows greater tensile strength than that of bleached fibre...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{survey of}} the working {{conditions}} at a Danish slag wool production factory during the early technological phase in the 1940 s is presented. No exposure data, however, are available for that period. So, a full-scale simulation of the past production of slag wool has been performed. Air monitoring {{was carried out in}} the working area around the cupola furnace. The aim was to measure exposure to air pollutants other than <b>fibres.</b> Such <b>exposure</b> might have confounded a possible association between lung cancer and <b>exposure</b> to <b>fibres,</b> in the early technological phase of slag wool production. The simulation experiment demonstrated exposure to PAH, a known lung carcinogen. The effect of other concurrent exposures is difficult to assess. Time-weighted average concentrations of particulate material ranged between 12. 9 and 49. 1 mg m ~ 3 at the upper decks around the cupola. Corresponding concentrations of the dominant metals zinc and lead were 4. 4 - 22. 7 mgZnm " 3 and 0. 9 - 4. 7 mg Pb m " 3. Significant concentrations of PAH up to 269 /<g PAH m " 3 (4 /jg BaP m" 3) occurred during ignition of the cupola furnace. The carbon monoxide level reached 270 ppm also during ignition. ...|$|R
