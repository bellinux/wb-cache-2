50|$|In {{the home}} {{computer}} market the PET line was soon outsold by machines that supported high-resolution color graphics and sound, mainly the Apple II (which shipped in June 1977), Atari 400/800 (1979), and, in particular, Commodore's own bestselling VIC-20 (1980/81). Commodore released a High Resolution <b>Graphic</b> <b>board</b> for the PET using the Thomson EF936x graphics chip with {{a resolution of}} 512×512 pixels. In addition, the Apple II, TRS-80 Model I, and Atari 400 (via 3rd party expansions)/800 could all be expanded {{to a maximum of}} 48 kB of RAM while the PET was limited to 32 kB.|$|E
50|$|Without the High Resolution <b>Graphic</b> <b>board,</b> the PET's {{graphics}} capabilities {{were limited}} to a character set hardwired in ROM. On many of the PET range's home computer rivals, the look-up address of the character graphics could be changed and pointed to RAM, where new characters could be defined by a programmer to create custom graphics shapes. From a programming point of view, this was a relatively simple method of producing good-looking graphics, which used negligibly more RAM than a standard character display, and significantly less RAM than bitmap graphics. Additionally, BASIC programs often could not achieve acceptable speed animating bitmap graphics, but since this technique only involved moving character objects on the screen, BASIC could achieve acceptable performance, and programs written in assembly language could be even faster using this pseudo-sprite technique than using bitmap graphics modes. Many BASIC and assembly language programs were made this way even on bitmap-capable machines. The PET's lack of a remappable character set is a major weakness in the machine's design.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{present study}} aimed {{to compare the}} {{postoperative}} contrast sensitivity functions between wavefront-guided LASIK eyes and their contralateral wavefront-guided PRK eyes. METHODS: The participants were 11 healthy subjects (mean age= 32. 4 ± 6. 2 years) who had myopic astigmatism. The spatial contrast sensitivity functions were measured before and three times after the surgery. Psycho and a Cambridge <b>graphic</b> <b>board</b> (VSG 2 / 4) were used to measure luminance, red-green, and blue-yellow spatial contrast sensitivity functions (from 0. 85 to 13. 1 cycles/degree). Longitudinal analysis and comparison between surgeries were performed. RESULTS: There was no significant contrast sensitivity change during the one-year follow-up measurements neither for LASIK nor for PRK eyes. The comparison between procedures showed no differences at 12 months postoperative. CONCLUSIONS: The present data showed similar contrast sensitivities during one-year follow-up of wave-front guided refractive surgeries. Moreover, one year postoperative data showed no differences in the effects of either wavefront-guided LASIK or wavefront-guided PRK on the luminance and chromatic spatial contrast sensitivity functions...|$|E

40|$|The {{cardboard}} company Kappa <b>Graphic</b> <b>Board</b> produces {{several kinds}} of cardboard with various weights and thicknesses. If the thickness is above a certain value (namely 1. 7 mm), the cardboard is composed of three layers which are glued together, and is called heavy weight cardboard. The three layers are produced on different machines; the production speed depends on {{the thickness of the}} layers. In this paper we restrict our analysis to heavy weight cardboard. The objective is to find a composition of the layers such that the throughput time is minimized. The problem is solved by means of an LP-model in which the objective function is a linearized working hours function; also a number of constraints are linearized. The results of the calculations indicate {{that it is possible to}} decrease the total number of working hours in the production process without a large increase of production costs.

40|$|Pure tonal vocalizations, or 2 ̆ 2 {{whistles}} 2 ̆ 2, {{from five}} species of dolphins {{native to the}} western North Atlantic were examined and compared. The five species of dolphins were Tursiops truncatus, Lagenorhynchus acutus, Stenella plagiodon, Stenella longirostris, and Globicephala melaena. ^ Recordings made from 1964 - 1977 in locations ranging from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean were scrutinized {{for the presence of}} whistle vocalizations and all such whistles with suitable signal/noise levels were selected and re-recorded. Whistles were spectrographically analyzed and printed on lithographic paper. Each whistle was then individually measured and quantified using a minicomputer and <b>graphic</b> <b>board.</b> Six parameters were measured: beginning frequency, ending frequency, maximum frequency, minimum frequency, total duration in seconds, and number of inflection points. Comparisons within and between species were made with the use of discriminant analysis. ^ The generalized pattern for each species 2 ̆ 7 whistle repertoire was described using parameter means and coefficients of variation (C. V.). All five species exhibited a consistent pattern in the relative values for C. V. Maximum frequency had the lowest C. V. for all five species, while duration and number of inflection points had the highest C. V. for all five species. Recording samples from all species contained rhythmic repetitions of identical whistles. These repeated whistles may be a form of signature whistles. ^ Comparisons within and between species 2 ̆ 7 whistle patterns indicated significant species-specific differences. T. truncatus and G. melaena whistles were both highly distinctive from other species and from one another. The whistles of L. acutus, S. plagiodon, and S. longirostris were less distinctive, but still different enough to be discriminable. The relative degrees of species distinctiveness were broadly correlated with taxonomic and zoogeographic relations. Differences among sympatric species were greater then differences among allopatric species. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} (1) luminance {{contrast sensitivity}} functions (CSF) in the spatial (SCSF) and temporal domains (TCSF) and (2) chromatic red/green (R/G) and blue/yellow (B/Y) CSFs in 11778 LHON carriers with no visual complaints. Methods: The subjects, carriers (n= 27) and age–matched controls (n = 30), were tested monocularly {{in a darkened}} room. CSFs were measured with PSYCHO for Windows v 2. 36 (Cambridge Research Systems), with a VSG 2 / 4 <b>graphic</b> <b>board</b> and a Sony FD Trinitron monitor, calibrated with a CS 1000 Minolta spectrophotometer. The SCSF was measured with horizontal sinusoidal gratings at 0. 3, 2, 6 and 12 cpd; the TCSF at 2, 10, 20 and 33 Hz using sinusoidal modulation of a 30 degree field with a superimposed spatial Gabor function. R/G and B/Y CSFs were determined with horizontal sinusoidal gratings of 0. 3, 0. 7 and 2 cpd, after equiluminance correction. The u'v' (CIE 1976) chromaticity coordinates were: D 6500 : 0. 198, 0. 468; Red: 0. 258, 0. 454; Green: 0. 133, 0. 469; Blue: 0. 210, 0. 397 and Yellow: 0. 188, 0. 551. A non–parametric statistical analysis (Mann–Whitney Rank Sum test with alpha= 0. 05) was performed. Results:Differences between the carriers and controls were statistically significant for all spatial frequencies of both chromatic and luminance spatial contrast modulation tests, {{but not for the}} temporal CSFs. R/G equiluminance settings of carriers differed from controls (p< 0. 001), requiring higher luminance in the green. However, the B/Y equiluminance settings of carriers and controls were not statistically different. Conclusions:Pre–clinical functional losses have been shown to exist in LHON carriers (Sadun and cols., ARVO 2002). In the same line, we now report luminance and chromatic CS losses in the carriers of the MtDNA 11778 mutation. The CS losses affected all spatial frequencies, without preferential impairment of either the magno– or parvocellular pathways. An important finding is that the blue system is spared in LHON, as indicated by the equiluminance data...|$|E

40|$|Eska <b>Graphic</b> <b>Board</b> is a {{cardboard}} factory which requires {{large amounts of}} energy in the form of heat for the production of graphical cardboard. Currently, Eska has on-site gas powered boilers to produce heat and a combined-heat-and-power (CHP) system to produce a combination of heat and electricity. To make these installations more sustainable, a plan was made to use the waste of the factory left over from recycled paper, to be used in producing energy. This waste consists mainly of plastics and non-recyclable organic matter and is known as ‘rejects’. These rejects {{can be used as a}} fuel source for several power plants. Using rejects as a fuel can be the best sustainable option in handling this type of waste. When following the “ladder of Lansink” (SenterNovem, 2008 a); rejects can not practically be reduced or prevented directly because this depends on the resource. Also, rejects can not be reused or recycled, because of the ever changing composition. The best option would then be in using rejects as fuel to produce energy, otherwise the energy contained in the rejects would be lost. Using reject as a fuel source to fulfill Eska’s energy needs can change a gas to energy power plant into a waste to energy power plant. As a result, there will be reduced dependency on natural gas as fuel source. There are several options in using rejects to produce energy; these are on-site and export options. Tauw bv is called upon to investigate the benefits and/or the drawbacks of this major change and to investigate which option is the most suitable in producing energy while using rejects as a fuel source. The main aim of this research is to analyze several solutions in handling the waste of the cardboard factory and to determine the most sustainable option. The cost or profit (environmental, financial), will be determined by handling the cardboard factory’s ‘reject’ waste in different scenarios over time. Of the option of on-site on-site energy production using rejects as fuel; an on-site boiler produces the lowest amounts of CO 2 per produced GJ due to its high efficiency. The second best option is the on-site CHP-system. A gasification installation produces the highest amount of CO 2 compared to the other two options, but the difference in emission between all of these options is minimal. ...|$|E
