40|$|There {{are several}} {{scientific}} approaches for {{the determination of}} cellular growth influences of known or novel substances under in vitro conditions, among which colourimetric absorption measurement {{is considered to be}} one of the convenient methods. [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 - (4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium] (MTS) assay is one of the commonly used colourimetric absorption assays based on the ability of dehydrogenase from viable cells to produce the brown soluble formazan detectable at 490 nm. Here we have tested the possible growth influence of <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate on two human cancer cell lines, the K 562 chronic myelogenous leukaemia and T 47 D breast carcinoma cells, based on the MTS assay. We found that <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate possessed an inhibitory effect when added at 16 - to 125 -μM concentrations, but <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate became growth stimulatory when its concentration was further increased to 1000 μM. In addition, a dose-dependent increase in absorbance at the same wavelength was observed when we repeated the experiments without the addition of MTS and phenazine methosulfate. When we further repeated the cell growth determinations using adenosine triphosphate content assay for K 562 and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay for T 47 D, <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate showed a consistent dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect. Morphological investigation after methylene blue staining clearly demonstrated that <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate, at a concentration of 1000 μM, is cytotoxic to T 47 D cells. Interestingly, a consistent increment for the absorbance at 490 nm was further observed with increased <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate concentration either in the presence or absence of MTS even in a cell-free environment. Thus we conclude that <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate is actually growth inhibitory and even cytotoxic at high concentrations towards the K 562 and T 47 D cancer cells and the paradoxical proliferative activity of <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate on these two cancer cell lines using the MTS assay was solely due to the oxidation of initial pale green <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> to brownish <b>iron</b> (III) during incubation in the aqueous condition.
