50|$|An F1 hybrid (or filial 1 hybrid) is {{the first}} <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> of {{offspring}} of distinctly different parental types.

50|$|The {{offspring}} of distinctly different parental types produce a new, uniform phenotype {{with a combination}} of characteristics from the parents. In fish breeding, those parents frequently are two closely related fish species, while in plant and animal breeding the parents often are two inbred lines.

50|$|Hybrid pollination, {{a type of}} {{controlled}} pollination in which the pollen comes from a different strain (or species), {{can be used to}} increase crop suitability, especially through heterosis. The resulting hybrid strain can sometimes be inbred and selected for desired traits until a strain that breeds true by open pollination is achieved. The result is referred to as a inbred hybrid strain. To add some confusion, the term hybrid inbred applies to hybrids that are made from selected inbred lines that have certain desired characteristics (see inbreeding). The latter type of hybrid is sometimes designated F1 hybrid, i.e. the first hybrid (<b>filial)</b> <b>generation</b> whose parents were (different) inbred lines.|$|E

50|$|Genetic markers can {{aid in the}} {{development}} of new novel traits that can be put into mass production. These novel traits can be identified using molecular markers and maps. Particular traits such as color, may be controlled by just a few genes. Qualitative traits (requires less that 2 genes) such as color, can be identified using MAS (marker assisted selection). Once a desired marker is found, it is able to be followed within different <b>filial</b> <b>generations.</b> An identifiable marker may help follow particular traits of interest when crossing between different genus or species, with the hopes of transferring particular traits to offspring.|$|R
50|$|Generally, the {{monohybrid}} cross {{is used to}} determine the dominance relationship between two alleles. The cross begins with the parental (P) generation. One parent is homozygous for one allele, and the other parent is homozygous for the other allele. The offspring make up the first <b>filial</b> (F1) <b>generation.</b> Every member of the F1 generation is heterozygous and the phenotype of the F1 generation expresses the dominant trait. Crossing two members of the F1 generation produces the second <b>filial</b> (F2) <b>generation.</b> Probability theory predicts that three quarters of the F2 generation will have the dominant allele's phenotype. And the remaining quarter of the F2s will have the recessive allele's phenotype. This predicted 3:1 phenotypic ratio assumes Mendelian inheritance.|$|R
50|$|Mendel {{worked with}} seven {{characteristics}} of pea plants: plant height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. Taking seed color as an example, Mendel showed {{that when a}} true-breeding yellow pea and a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred their offspring always produced yellow seeds. However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared {{at a ratio of}} 1 green to 3 yellow. To explain this phenomenon, Mendel coined the terms “recessive” and “dominant” in reference to certain traits. (In the preceding example, the green trait, which seems to have vanished in the first <b>filial</b> <b>generation,</b> is recessive and the yellow is dominant.) He published his work in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible “factors”—now called genes—in predictably determining the traits of an organism.|$|E
5000|$|Breeders of {{designer}} crossbreds borrow the technical language from hybrid plant breeding: A first generation, 50-50 crossbred is an F1 cross.

[...] The breeding of two crossbreds of the same combination of breeds, creating a F2 cross, an animal that is still a 50-50 cross, {{but it is the}} second <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> of the combination. [...] A F2 cross bred to an F2 cross creates a F3 cross. Similarly, a F2 animal bred to an F1 animal creates a F2b backcross.

[...] In dog breeding, three generations of reliable documented breeding can be considered a [...] "breed" [...] rather than a crossbreed.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the point}} of view of animal and plant breeders, there are several kinds of hybrid formed from crosses within a species, such as between {{different}} breeds.Single cross hybrids result from the cross between two true-breeding organisms which produces an F1 hybrid (first <b>filial</b> <b>generation).</b> The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.Double cross hybrids result from the cross between two different F1 hybrids (i.e., there are four unrelated grandparents).Three-way cross hybrids result from the cross between an F1 hybrid and an inbred line.Triple cross hybrids result from the crossing of two different three-way cross hybrids.Top cross (or [...] "topcross") hybrids result from the crossing of a top quality or pure-bred male and a lower quality female, intended to improve the quality of the offspring, on average.|$|E

40|$|Pollen effect (xenia) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in modifying biochemical constituents of maize (Zea mays L.) kernels. The objectives of this study were to i) evaluate the effect of <b>filial</b> <b>generations</b> on certain genetic estimations; ii) compare general (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects obtained from Griffing’s diallel analyses between parental (F 0) and F 1 generations; iii) determine the relationships between pollen effect and genetic estimations; and iv) examine the possible utility of pollen effect for improving kernel-quality traits (protein and oil contents). We conducted two experiments (F 0 in 2011 and F 1 in 2013) and examined kernel protein and oil contents. Individual pollen effects (IPE) and specific individual pollen effects (SIPE) were computed. The results showed that entries (E) and <b>filial</b> <b>generations</b> (G) and E × G interaction variances were significant for both protein and oil contents, whereas changes in genetic estimates between generations were highly variable. The signs and magnitudes of GCA effects were similar and highly correlated (r > 0. 80) between F 0 and F 1 generations for all four diallel methods. In addition, GCA effects were highly correlated with IPE estimates for all four diallel methods. Specific combining ability (SCA) estimates between F 0 and F 1 generations were moderately correlated (r = 0. 50) in Method IV for oil and highly negatively correlated (r = - 1. 00) in Method III for protein content. Heterosis analyses showed that hybrids could not be evaluated on the basis of the F 0 generation to predict their F 1 performances. Individual pollen effects between generations showed higher correlation for protein content (r = 1. 00) than for oil content (r = 0. 40). Specific individual pollen effects of parents were also slightly higher for protein content (r = 0. 74) than for oil content (r = 0. 62). We concluded that the direct or indirect utilization of pollen effect (xenia) was possible for parental evaluation but not suitable for hybrid evaluation for kernel oil and protein contents...|$|R

It shows a basic karyotype composed of 2 n = 54 chromosomes, in addition to as many as seven supernumerary chromosomes, also known as B-chromosomes. These additional small chromosomes are frequently heterochromatic, vary in number and morphology, and generally have no homology with the A complement. Intensive studies have investigated the function, origin and inheritance of these supernumerary chromosomes. The present study aimed to determine the inheritance pattern of the B-chromosomes resulting from directed cross-fertilization of P. lineatus, Prochilodontidae isolated from the Mogi-Guacu River, Pirassununga, SP. These cross-fertilization experiments were performed at CEPTA/ICMBio in Pirassununga. The transmission patterns of these micro-chromosomes agreed (K(B) = 0. 48) with the expectation of regular meiotic behavior following a Mendelian transmission model (K(B) = 0. 5).

The genotypes of wheat available were determined by test crosses while their origin was found where possible. The frequent use of certain carrier varieties as parents had contributed to the spread of necrotic genes. All wheat varieties, selections and species studied (about 500) were classified into 3 genotype classes (Ne 1 -carriers, Ne 2 -carriers, non-carriers) with indication of the strength of the necrosis gene. In designing a wheat-crossing programme a breeder could thus ascertain whether the first <b>filial</b> <b>generation</b> would become necrotic and usually also the allelic combination of the first <b>filial</b> <b>generation.</b> The occurrence of carrier and non-carrier lines in several varieties was shown to provide sometimes the possibility of avoiding necrosis...|$|E
