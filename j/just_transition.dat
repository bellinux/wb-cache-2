5000|$|<b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> is a {{framework}} that has been developed by the trade union movement to encompass a range of social interventions needed to secure workers' jobs and livelihoods when economies are shifting to sustainable production, including avoiding climate change, protecting biodiversity, among other challenges. It has been endorsed internationally by governments in different arenas, including the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which adopted conclusions on this matter in 2013 and tripartite (union-employer-government) [...] "Guidelines on a <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> towards environmentally-sustainable economies and societies for all" [...] in 2015. The Paris Climate Agreement also contains references to a <b>Just</b> <b>Transition,</b> where government commit to ensure that workers are accompanied in the transformation {{through the creation of}} decent work opportunities.|$|E
5000|$|Definition and {{evolution}} of the <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> concept A summary of this evolution is contained {{in an article published}} by the International Journal on Labour Research In 1998, a Canadian union activist, Brian Kohler, published what was going {{to become one of the}} first mentions of the <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> concept in a union newsletter. It constituted an attempt to reconcile the union movement’s efforts to provide workers with decent jobs and the need to protect the environment. As Kohler had clearly stated previously: “The real choice is not jobs or environment. It is both or neither.” In ten years, the union movement perception of environmental challenges has evolved and with it the definition, boundaries and scope of the “just transition” needed. Today, “Just Transition” can be understood as the conceptual framework in which the labour movement captures the complexities of the transition towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, highlighting public policy needs and aiming to maximize benefits and minimize hardships for workers and their communities in this transformation. In a document prepared by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> is defined as a “tool the trade union movement shares with the international community, aimed at smoothing the shift towards a more sustainable society and providing hope for the capacity of a green economy to sustain decent jobs and livelihoods for all” (ITUC, 2009b). It is important to note that <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> is a supporting mechanism of climate action, and not inaction. <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> is not in opposition to, but complements environmental policies. This comforts the idea that environmental and social policies are not contradictory but, on the contrary, can reinforce each other. This approach to the <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> concept was unanimously adopted at the 2nd ITUC Congress, in 2010, when the Congress declared “Just Transition” to be “the” approach to fight climate change: 5. Early mentions of <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> can also be found in ICFTU: ‘Plough to Plate’ Approaches to Food and Agriculture, 2000; ICFTU: Fashioning A New Deal - Workers and Trade Unions at the World Summit for Sustainable Development, 2002. International Journal of Labour Research 2010 Vol. 2 Issue 2 142 Congress is committed to promoting an integrated approach to sustainable development through a <b>just</b> <b>transition</b> where social progress, environmental protection and economic needs are brought into a framework of democratic governance, where labour and other human rights are respected and gender equality achieved (ITUC, 2010). Other Global Union Federations, representing workers in specific economic sectors, joined this policy approach. The International Transport workers’ Federation (ITF) adopted, at its 2010 Congress, a resolution stating that “while the urgent adoption of these policies is vital to tackle climate change, the ITF and its affiliates must defend the interests of transport workers by fighting to ensure that these policies are implemented in a way which protects jobs and creates new ones through a process of just transition” (ITF, 2010). Federations of industrial workers have also voiced their positions on <b>Just</b> <b>Transition.</b> The International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers’ Unions (ICEM), for example, states that “with a <b>Just</b> <b>Transition,</b> we can build a public consensus to move towards more sustainable production” (ICEM, 2009). The <b>Just</b> <b>Transition</b> framework is a package of policy proposals which addresses the different aspects related to the vulnerability of workers and their communities: uncertainties regarding job impacts, risks of job losses, risks of undemocratic decision-making processes, risks of regional or local economic downturn, among others. A concept whose use has broadened ...|$|E

5000|$|Finally, Left Renewal {{outlines}} {{their approach}} to environmental sustainability as a movement to achieve climate justice, primarily through forms of eco-socialism. It is heavily argued that the intersection between society and environment cannot be separated, and that an internationalist perspective of climate justice is needed that recognises that all people {{are part of a}} global ecosystem irrespective of ethnicity, gender, or sexuality. As a logical conclusion to this, the group argues that people can only resolve climate change by achieving climate justice; again, providing a simple summation of, [...] "None of us are free, until we are all free". This follows on to the argument that the interests of the environment, and the working class, should never be pitted against one another, and that working toward a <b>just</b> <b>transition</b> in collaboration with and alongside the working class, is needed in order to [...] "uncover a renewable world". The statement concludes by outlining that solutions to climate change cannot come from green-capital partnerships, and top-down market solutions, but must come from people organising in their workplaces and their communities. As such, the group opposes consumer taxes, such as ‘cap and trade’ mechanisms, and cross-class compromises with big business and capital.|$|E
5000|$|Environment Victoria {{had been}} campaigning for {{the closure of}} Hazelwood power station since 2005 and has pushed for {{alternative}} baseload generation through: biomass energy, wave energy, geothermal energy, new combined cycle gas fired generation plants, new cogeneration facilities, or increased imports of baseload electricity from interstate. In January 2005, the Clean Energy Future Group together with Environment Victoria released the report [...] "Toward Victoria's Clean Energy Future", a plan to cut Victoria's Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity by 2010. It largely focused on cleaner alternatives to Hazelwood, and warned that continued support of coal-fired power development would lock the State into CO2 emissions that would dwarf any current proposed measures for reducing emissions. Following the 2014 Hazelwood mine fire, Environment Victoria worked with locals in the Latrobe Valley to ensure national attention to the pollution disaster by generating media coverage and urging an inquiry into the fire; releasing a report by Harvard University researchers about the hidden health costs of Hazelwood; appearing at both inquiries, cross-examining both government regulators and ENGIE executives and ensuring mine rehabilitation was on the agenda; and petitioning the mine owner to pay its firefighting bill to the Country Fire Authority. It afterwards entered into a campaign to improve coal mine rehabilitation efforts in Victoria {{and to ensure that}} mine rehabilitation bonds cover the actual costs of rehabilitation. in 2015, it started a petition signed by thousands of Victorians to call on the French government to phase out Hazelwood. In May 2016 the petition postcards were handed to French Environment Minister Segolene Royale on tv, which led to her response announcement that ENGIE would disengage from Hazelwood. Environment Victoria currently closely follows the Hazelwood closure process, engaging with LaTrobe Valley communities and campaigning for a <b>just</b> <b>transition</b> for the Valley.|$|E

Even where responsibility and equity negotiations have taken place they have tended to occur at the nation state scale through global institutions and events.
