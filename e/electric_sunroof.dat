25|$|In Europe, only 1152 {{examples}} of this model were sold through the official Mazda network. Only one spec was available and it included twin oil-coolers, <b>electric</b> <b>sunroof,</b> cruise control and the rear storage bins {{in place of the}} back seats. It also has the stiffer suspension and strut braces from the R models. Germany top the sales with 446 cars, while UK is second at 210 and Greece third with 168.

25|$|For the North American market, Camrys were {{produced}} in Georgetown, Kentucky by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky. Introduced in 1991 as a 1992 model year, automatic transmission {{became the only}} option on all but the base and sport model Camrys, whereas previously, a manual transmission was available on the majority of trim levels. In addition to the DX and LE trims, 1992 saw the addition of an XLE luxury trim and the SE sport trim. The SE model differs from the LE and XLE in appearance {{with the addition of}} a standard V6 engine, alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, and black side mirrors as well as the sports suspension from the Lexus ES 300. The range-topping XLE was equipped with leather upholstery along with an <b>electric</b> <b>sunroof</b> and power adjustable driver's seat. The station wagon body styles were offered in a new seven-seat guise, compared to five in the regular wagon and sedan. These station wagon body variants were also made in right-hand drive configuration for export to Japan, badged as Scepter. Wagons were also produced in Australia. This generation of Camry was featured on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1992 and 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Torino added {{several new}} options and {{features}} for 1974. Gran Torino 2-doors now were available with [...] "opera windows", a popular option during the mid-1970s, while Brougham models had these {{as a standard}} feature. All 2-door Torinos had fixed rear windows unlike the 1972–73 models. The Torino was becoming more luxury oriented and new luxury features were available. These included a leather-wrapped steering wheel, split bench seat, an <b>electric</b> <b>sunroof,</b> and speed control with steering wheel controls. Gran Torino hardtops and sedans had a new rear fender skirt option, to give the Torino a longer, lower look. The trim was revised on 1974 models; moldings now ran on the rocker panels instead of the lower doors. Brougham and Sport models had an extra chrome molding that ran on the lower fender edge between the front wheelwell and bumper; this gave the appearance of bumper-to-bumper chrome. Squires had no lower body moldings. All 1974 Torinos featured the seat belt-interlock system, as mandated by the U.S. government. This short-lived safety system would be removed after the 1974 model year. The competition suspension was no longer offered, and the only suspension option was a revised heavy-duty suspension package. This option was available on all Torinos except the Elite, and included a larger front sway bar and heavy-duty front and rear springs. Heavy-duty shocks and a rear sway bar were included in this package on 2-door and 4-door sedan models only; station wagons did not include these features.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{methods of}} sunroof {{operations}} involve controllers with mechanic or electric buttons, which produce noises and lack flexibility. This paper devised a controller for <b>electric</b> <b>sunroofs</b> with CAN-USB converters and tablet PCs. The CAN-USB converter was implemented to bridge communication between tablet PCs and sunroofs. The tablet PC {{served as a}} control interface and an application was developed to control sunroofs by using the UDS protocol. A C language compiler was embedded in to support customized operations. This approach provides functionality of reprogramming for sunroof operations and offers sound-proof actions...|$|R

5000|$|Specification of all later cars was high, {{with many}} {{featuring}} air conditioning (particularly {{as a result}} of a special offer operated by Volvo in the United Kingdom in 1995, where £100 deleted the standard <b>electric</b> glass <b>sunroof</b> from the car's specification in favour of air conditioning and 15" [...] alloy wheels, identical to those fitted to Volvo 850 CD models, albeit with lower-profile tyres), remote central locking, electric aerial, electric windows, electric door mirrors and heated front seats.|$|R

50|$|Thanks to {{the high}} floor {{in the rear of}} the vehicle, the engine and gearbox are placed in the centre for the third axle. It works with the SCR {{technology}} using AdBlue. All axles are from ZF. Due to the use of larger wheel size 295/70 tires the bus has an extended wheel arch. Behind the front axle there is a storage possibly for snow chains. Two illuminated steps provide access {{to the high}}er floor level at the rear. All seats are located on the raised floor and are equipped with safety belts, while those located on the side of the stairs have additional armrests and handles. Above the seats in the low floor part of the bus there are shelves for luggage on the ceiling. The higher door has wheelchair access.
