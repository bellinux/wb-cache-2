A 90 deg turn cooling wedge passage with cylindrical pin-fins is used to model the trailing edge.

5000|$|The long sharp <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> {{made them}} useful {{for a variety}} <b>of</b> purposes. After <b>blades</b> are flaked, they are often {{incorporated}} as parts of larger tools, such as spears. Other times, the simple shape and sharpness serves the designed role. Blades were often employed in the impression process of material culture, assisting ancient humans in imprinting ornate designs into other parts of their material culture. Scrapers, used for hide working or woodworking, or burins, used for engraving, are two common such examples.|$|R

When {{viewed from the}} side, the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> a figure skate is not flat, but curved slightly, forming an {{arc of a circle}} with a radius of [...] This {{curvature}} {{is referred to as the}} rocker <b>of</b> the <b>blade.</b> The sweet spot <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> is below the ball of the foot. This spot is usually located near the stanchion <b>of</b> the <b>blade,</b> and is the part <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> where all spins are spun on. The blade is also hollow ground; a groove on the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> is on the side closest to the skater; the outside <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> is on the side farthest from the skater. In figure skating, it is always desirable to skate on only one <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blade.</b> Skating on both at the same time (which is referred to as a flat) may result in lower skating skills scores. The apparently effortless power and glide across the ice exhibited by elite figure skaters fundamentally derives from efficient use <b>of</b> the <b>edges</b> to generate speed.|$|R
