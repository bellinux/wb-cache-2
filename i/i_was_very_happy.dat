But I didn't think I {{would be able to}} do it in one night, I thought I'd have to do it across maybe three {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring out. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with the guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E
500|$|Mills {{left the}} club on 23 May 2002 to become first-team coach and reserve-team manager at First Division club Coventry City, {{as part of}} the {{management}} team of Gary McAllister and Eric Black. In 2002–03, Mills' reserves finished bottom of the Premier Reserve League Southern Division in 14th place. He spoke to Telford United regarding the managerial vacancy at the Football Conference club in May 2003, but decided to stay at Coventry saying he was happy at the club. Mills later spoke of his regret at leaving Tamworth for Coventry, saying: [...] "It was the biggest decision I've ever made in football. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> at Tamworth and we were winning most games".|$|E

On 25 June 1996 Fox Lorber released The Killer along with Hard Boiled as a double feature on home video. The Killer {{was released}} on DVD by The Criterion Collection on 1 April 1998 in the original Cantonese language track with English subtitles. Bonus features on DVD included the trailer, production notes, and a commentary track. Woo was {{very happy with the}} film being included in the Criterion Collection stating, [...] "it was great because it would let people know what [...] are about...when I saw that Criterion Collection selected The Killer, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> as The Killer and Bullet in the Head are my two favourites".|$|E

500|$|In {{his role}} as producer, Iwakami took a mostly {{hands-off}} approach. Due to Puella Magi Madoka Magica being an original series rather than an adaptation based on an already existing work, he described the main goal solely as [...] "coming up with a high-quality piece of entertainment." [...] After helping to recruit the staff, he allowed them mostly free rein in developing the actual content of the story, providing minimal guidance from himself. After viewing the character designs that Aoki created, he became fully assured that he could trust the creative talent of the team. In an interview with Anime News Network after the series finished airing in Japan, Iwakami summed up his philosophy as [...] "I don't matter much; it's up to those talents to do their work. If something comes to a stand-still I might intervene, but they {{did an excellent job}} and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> seeing the results in episode one." ...|$|E
2500|$|During World War II and the Korean War, Marian Anderson entertained {{troops in}} {{hospitals}} and bases. In 1943, she sang at Constitution Hall {{at the invitation of}} the DAR to an integrated audience as part of a benefit for the American Red Cross. She said of the event, [...] "When I finally walked onto the stage of Constitution Hall, I felt no different than I had in other halls. There was no sense of triumph. I felt that it was a beautiful concert hall and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> to sing there." [...] By contrast, the District of Columbia Board of Education continued to bar her from using the high school auditorium in the District of Columbia.|$|E
2500|$|Cross {{played for}} the St Kilda Saints in Australia as a batsman in the 2008/09 season. He won the prestigious Jack Ryder Medal, {{presented}} to the Player of the Year in the Victorian Premier League. During his stint with the club, Cross scored 541runs {{at an average of}} 41, with a highest score of 111. Although primarily a batsman, Cross occasionally bowled, taking six wickets with best figures of 4/41. He was surprised to receive the award, and said that [...] "This was my fourth spell with St Kilda and each time I've thoroughly enjoyed my cricket. I set myself a challenge this winter of focusing on my batting, improving my technique and doing my best for the club. Everything seemed to click and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with my own performance and that of the team. My focus now is to continue to do well during Lancashire’s pre-season fixtures, and push for first team selection." [...] Despite his promising winter, Cross was less successful in the 2009 season than desired: he did not play any first-class cricket and scored fewer runs in the one-day competitions than hoped. However, Cross captained Lancashire's secondXI and was a regular in their top order. Under his leadership, the team progressed to the final of the Second XI Championship and the semi-final of the SecondXI Trophy.|$|E
