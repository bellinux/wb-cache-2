On contrary to the (semi-) static virtual topology in <b>joint</b> <b>planning,</b> the <b>joint</b> operation approach maintains a dynamic virtual topology.

The article then assesses the impact of the contemporary debate in the United States between traditionalists, complex systems advocates and integrationists concerning the centre of gravity’s status in the military art. The article goes on to analyse the influence of the integrationists in transforming the centre of gravity into an ‘element of design’ in recent American <b>joint</b> <b>planning</b> doctrine. The article considers the implications for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) of the evolving relationship in military theory between the centre of gravity, complex systems science and operational design. Finally, four recommendations are made on how the ADF might use a combination of centre of gravity analysis and operational design to improve its future <b>joint</b> <b>planning</b> doctrine...|$|R

This project analyzed the effectiveness of the Joint OPLANS with respect to contracting relationships in a contingency contracting environment. Conclusions and recommendations for the formal, detailed inclusion of CCSPs within the JPP include: The CCSP should be formally detailed in the Deliberate Planning Process (DPP) and Crisis Action Planning (CAP) Process from the National-level to the small unit-level; The formal, detailed inclusion of CCSPs within the planning process at the Joint-level would be a force-multiplier in terms of proactive vice reactive planning to contingencies within the Joint arena; and, Utilizing the experience of Contracting Officers (COs) within <b>Joint</b> <b>planning</b> cells would result in the ability to leverage time and provide the COCOM flexibility and responsiveness early on in the planning process {{within the framework of the}} CCSP.
