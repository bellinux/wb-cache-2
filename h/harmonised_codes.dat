40|$|Plasmodium falciparum 1 –deoxy–D–xylulose– 5 –phosphate reductoisomerase (PfDXR) is a {{key enzyme}} in the {{synthesis}} of isoprenoids in the malaria parasite, using a pathway that is absent in the human host. This enzyme is receiving attention {{as it has been}} validated as a promising drug target. However, an impediment to the characterisation of this enzyme has been the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of the enzyme in a soluble and functional form. The expression of PfDXR from the codon <b>harmonised</b> <b>coding</b> region, under conditions of strongly controlled transcription and induction, resulted in a yield of 2 – 4 mg/L of enzyme, which is 8 to 10 –fold higher than previously reported yields. The kinetic parameters Km, Vmax and kcat were determined for PfDXR using an NADPH–dependent assay. Residues K 295 and K 297, unique to species of Plasmodium and located in the catalytic hatch region; and residues V 114 and N 115, essential for NADPH binding, were mutated to resemble those found in E. coli DXR. Interestingly, these mutations decreased the substrate affinity of PfDXR to values resembling that of E. coli DXR. PfDXR-K 295 N, K 297 S and PfDXR-V 114 A, N 115 G demonstrated a decreased ability to turnover substrate by 4 –fold and 2 -fold respectively in comparison to PfDXR. This study indicates a difference {{in the role of the}} catalytic hatch in capturing substrate by species of Plasmodium. The results of this study could contribute to the development of inhibitors of PfDXR. National Research Foundation Grant awarded to AB (Thuthuka Programme) and a SAMI Grant awarded to GLB.

40|$|This report, CUAC Regulatory Review, {{critically}} {{examines the}} Victorian energy consumer protection framework contained in legislative and regulatory instruments. The key findings and recommendations of CUAC’s report provide a timely evidentiary review of ￼the subtle losses already experienced by Victorian consumers and anticipates {{the loss of}} further consumer protections. This review has been conducted {{through the lens of}} new technologies, the evolving energy market and the new <b>Harmonised</b> Energy Retail <b>Code.</b> High disconnection rates, wrongful disconnections, a growing number of Victorian consumers experiencing hardship and household financial difficulties are increasingly the norm in the Victorian community. The Essential Services Commission of Victoria’s Inquiry into the Financial Hardship Arrangements of Energy Retailers is a welcomed paper paying special attention to the consumer protections relating to energy bill payment difficulties, hardship, and disconnection. CUAC’s report identifies significant gaps in the current consumer protection framework experienced by Victorians. Key findings and recommendations from the Analysis of Key Consumer Protections section of the report are discussed below. For CUAC, it is important to review the regulatory framework to determine if it is able to effectively address and respond to current and ongoing changes in the energy market. This is to ensure sound consumer protections. CUAC’s review questions whether the National Energy Customer Framework and the new <b>Harmonised</b> Energy Retail <b>Code</b> are able to effectively respond to the substantial and complex changes that have occurred in the energy market, whilst maintaining a level of consumer protection previously experienced by Victorian consumers. Consumer protection is underpinned by the clear outline of consumer expectations and energy retailer responsibilities. CUAC has found that these key elements are not present in either the National Energy Retail Rules or the new <b>Harmonised</b> Energy Retail <b>Code.</b> CUAC has found that poor drafting and the lack of clear definition of terms make interpreting provisions in a consistent manner challenging. This leaves the Victorian consumer in an increasing position of disadvantage.  ...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{hospital}} based posts in which nurses take over clinical work previously done by junior doctors is growing. Accountability for {{the scope of}} such new roles and the standards of practice which apply to them are still unclear. When analysed together and compared, the regulations arising from the professional bodies (GMC and UKCC), civil law concerning certain wrongs to patients, and employment law are sometimes contradictory and hard to interpret. The resulting uncertainties about appropriate management for clinical roles evolving between the professions, coupled with an increasingly litigious public, put the nurses and consultants involved at risk of complaints and of disciplinary and legal action. Drawing on our current research into changing clinical roles at the medical-nursing interface, we suggest strategies to reduce risk. Doctors and nurses should be equal partners in planning and managing these new posts, patients should be informed adequately {{about the nature of}} the postholder's role and training, significant changes in the work of such postholders should be formally acknowledged by the employer and relevant insurers, individuals taking up new roles should have access to legal advice and support to cover legal risk, and national regulatory bodies need to work together to <b>harmonise</b> their <b>codes</b> of practice in relation to changing clinical roles between the professions...|$|R

They were originally based on Sanhuri’s codes to varying degrees. Yet, common law principles derived either from English common law or Islamic customary usages are unidentified and thus ignored. Here, this lacuna is rectified through a comparative analysis of the primary data (eg, cases, statutes and arbitral award decisions), adding common law and uncodified Islamic custom to MENA law codes. The purpose of this comparative analysis is to allow common legal principles found at civil, common and Islamic law to be distilled {{in the service of}} creating a new harmonised international commercial arbitration law code (HICALC) or uniform Arab arbitration law (UAAL) for adoption in the MENA. 1 These principles already form part or all of the legal systems in the MENA. They can be readily assimilated into a <b>harmonised</b> or uniform <b>code.</b> Would this new <b>harmonised</b> <b>code</b> lead to higher arbitral award enforcement in the MENA? According to the evidence the answer is yes. The author understands that at the present time the HICALC articles are ambitious and as such they are a beginning point and can initially be taken as a harmonised international commercial arbitration common rule (HICACR). A brief overview of the history of harmonisation is given. An assessment of the status of the laws and traditions of the MENA was carried out. A comparative analysis of the relevant differences and similarities of the case study countries (Egypt and the United Arab Emirates) was carried out to show the gaps in the laws and areas requiring reform. An analysis of enforcement of arbitral awards was carried out. The unique problems that ICA and IIA encounter in the MENA as derived from an analysis of cases and the laws therein are expounded in consideration of matters pertaining to enforcement. A comparative analysis of universal principles which must be included in a new code, including custom, was carried out. An analysis of the unique features and unique needs of the MENA was carried out in order to inform the Draft Article Provisions. An analysis of important international legal instruments dealing specifically with international arbitration and the gaps therein is given. The draft articles for a HICALC or uniform Arab arbitration law were derived {{as a result of these}} multiple layers of analysis. The matters of compétence de la compétence, expropriation, interest, public policy and sovereign immunity are highlighted as the most important areas requiring urgent reform. The results of this research are suggested Draft Article Provisions for a model Harmonised International Commercial Arbitration Law Code (HICALC) or a uniform Arab arbitration law. Future drafters may refer to and revise these articles for implementation. The synthesis of theory and practice addresses doctrinal matters that arise in international investment arbitrations and international commercial arbitration, with a focus on investor–State arbitrations. This synthesis provides a new theoretical conception of the jurisprudence of international arbitration, particularly in regard to the matters of res iudicata, precedent and expansion of arbitral tribunal powers and jurisdiction.

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the political and economic transition, the legal context has been rather favourable to industrial relations. In the process of <b>harmonising</b> the Labour <b>Code</b> with EU standards, many laws were revisited, and many new ones created. The Labour Code has been significantly expanded to include many new provisions concerning discrimination, collective bargaining, trade unions and strikes. The labour market is still showing the effects of the political and economic transition process: a low employment rate, high share of informal employment, high unemployment rate and a very unfavourable structure of participants in the labour market. The number of those leaving the country (particularly young people) searching for a better life is worrying.

40|$|The {{operational}} {{and plant}} assessment experience indicates {{that in the}} majority of cases where high temperature failure occurs, defects predominate in the vicinity of weldments. Cracking occurs in service due to reduced creep ductility of HAZ and weld metal in service, combined with the action of multi-axial stress fields that reduce the creep ductility further. The structural integrity and residual life assessment of high temperature components require defects detected or assumed to exist through minimum allowable limits of detectable flaws. It relies on information obtained from the material's high temperature tensile, uniaxial creep, crack initiation and growth properties. The information derived from experiments needs to be validated and <b>harmonised</b> following a <b>code</b> of practice (CoP) that data variability between different institutions can be reduced to a minimum. Similar and dissimilar weld behaviour and assessment of components at high temperatures is reviewed. Experimental crack growth data is presented supported with metallographic damage assessment.

The information derived from experiments needs to be validated and <b>harmonised</b> following a <b>Code</b> of Practice that data variability between different institutions {{can be reduced to}} a minimum. The present paper reports on a Code of Practice (CoP) being prepared {{within the framework of the}} partially European Commission funded project CRETE. The novel aspect of the presented CoP is the inclusion of component relevant industrial specimen geometries. It covers testing and analysis of Creep Crack growth (CCG) in metallic materials at elevated temperature using six different cracked geometries that have been validated in. It aims to give advice on testing, measurements and analysis of creep crack growth data for a range of creep brittle to creep ductile materials using component service relevant specimen geometries and sizes. The CoP may be used for material selection criteria and inspection requirements for damage tolerant applications. In quantitative terms, these types of tests can be used to assess the individual and combined effects of metallurgical, fabrication, operating temperature, and loading conditions on creep crack growth life. Further issues will be addressed including material properties, damage and crack growth related constraint effect, stress relaxation and stress-strain fields, residual stresses, partitioning displacement, analysis of elasticcreep, elastic compliance measurements.

40|$|To enhance {{competition}} in the construction industry, EU policies have created and <b>harmonised</b> functional building <b>codes.</b> Moreover, many actors advocate the construction industry moves towards a lean production, process-based way of working for quality and cost reasons. Here, Timber Framed Engineering approaches are considered to have a competitive and environmental advantage. There is however underlying concerns that conservatism in the construction industry, and lack of timber engineering skills, may be obstacles to change. This paper therefore assesses whether EU construction policy innovation contributed to innovation at the firm level. Timber framed innovators in six European countries were identified, and their sources of innovation assessed. The results indicate that timber framed firms have become actors in the construction industry. Firms have made product, process and organisation innovations. All case firms have similar sources for innovation. The common factor that triggers the firms to innovate is business opportunities that arise from demographic changes in the environment outside the firm, such as environmental sustainability and affordable housing for lower income groups. To address these opportunities, the case firms implicitly recognised that traditional project and site-based construction approaches are an incongruity. The firms have consequently established in-house prefabrication, including developed of lean production processes to ensure quality as well as effectiveness. The firms have all recognised that a fundamental barrier to their business {{was the lack of}} timber framed engineering competencies in their customers' organisations. Accordingly, a business necessity for the case firms was developing construction design competencies. Firms benefited from governmental policy instruments that support timber framed R&D and knowledge transfer. However, firms also gained new knowledge from their own experiences, which they also use in their operations. Accordingly, policy instruments are not a sole or dominant source for innovation in the case firms. Nonetheless, the change in building codes has been a pre-requisite the firms' commercial developments. Innovation Innovation source Timber frame Construction EU policy...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, a growing concern {{developed}} around the trade of equipment designed for nuclear use and nuclear-related dual-use items that may be diverted to non-peaceful uses. Trade data sources and tools presented hereafter can enhance understanding of nuclear related trade from different perspectives. One perspective is nuclear safeguards. Since 2007, the Joint Research Centre has been supporting the IAEA in finding and evaluating collections of open source data on trade. We identified, and documented in a catalogue of trade data, sources stemming from declarations made by importers and exporters to customs authorities. Customs data are collected nationally, processed and published in transactional or aggregated formats by decision of individual States. Bringing these data together results in a large collection that creates a global geographical view on trade, covers all commodities, and reports trade in quantitative form over several years. The data are retrieved by <b>Harmonised</b> System (HS) <b>codes,</b> the taxonomy of goods designed and maintained by the World Customs Organization. HS codes introduce approximations {{in the description of}} the trade making the data of no immediate use to safeguards. Their use requires first mapping items of interest to safeguards verifications to HS codes. To this goal, correspondence tables have been developed by trade analysts and experts of the Harmonised System. To make these tables easy-to-use, we have designed and developed a software tool named The Big Table (TBT) which supports: (a) searching a collection of reference documents relevant to nuclear trade (legal documents and handbooks); (b) selecting items of interest to specific safeguards verifications; (c) mapping items to HS codes by means of correspondence tables. These steps are preliminary to data retrieval from sources on trade described above. These data sources and TBT are currently in use at IAEA¿s Trade and Technology Analysis Unit, for safeguards purposes. Other perspective uses of trade data pertain to the area of export controls. Potential uses include the estimation of trade flows of controlled items to inform the design of export control policies, as well as verifications on compliance with export controls regulations. In this paper we present firstly a collection of data sources on global trade. The paper will then tackle in some detail the first perspective, i. e. the use of trade data to support safeguards with a focus on the TBT software tool for nuclear trade analysis. Other perspectives on the use of trade data will then be briefly outlined. JRC. E. 9 -Nuclear security (Ispra...|$|R
