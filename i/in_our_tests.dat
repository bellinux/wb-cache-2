30|$|As {{with the}} binary {{reception}} model, we cannot simply use {{the positions of}} the nodes <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>testbed</b> to calculate received signal strengths as there is too little correlation between received signal strength and distance.

We have therefore measured the (average) received signal strengths between all pairs of nodes <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>testbed.</b> We use this information as the received signal strengths <b>in</b> <b>our</b> simulations. Furthermore, we have experimentally determined the SNR threshold of the CC 1000 radio on the Tnodes to be approximately 5 [*]dB.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we analyze several metamor-phic virus generators. We {{define a}} {{similarity}} index {{and use it}} to precisely quantify the degree of metamorphism that each generator produces. Then we present a detec-tor based on hidden Markov models and we consider a simpler detection method based on our similarity index. Both of these techniques detect all of the metamorphic viruses <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>test</b> set with extremely high accuracy. In addition, we show that popular commercial virus scan-ners do not detect the highlymetamorphic virus variants <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>test</b> set. ...|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we present}} first the UKF {{algorithm}} {{that is used}} for updating the GM components and then five different GM generating methods that we use also <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>tests</b> section for comparison.|$|E
30|$|The above {{analysis}} {{results are consistent}} with our experimental results.

30|$|We built three {{data sets}} to {{construct}} the DNA duplex stability priors: one positive single-strand binding data set, one positive double-strand binding data set, and one background data set. The positive data sets are constructed from 226 known binding sites <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>test</b> data set by splitting the known binding sites into single- and double-strand binding sets according to the binding preference of each TF. The background data set is generated as follows. For each verified binding site <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>test</b> set, we randomly select 20 genomic locations (from the same promoter sequence) with the average binding site of length 12, which results in a background set that is 20 {{times larger than the}} test set.|$|R
30|$|In the {{remainder}} of the project, we have chosen to use 2400 MHz. The choice of this frequency has both practical (the sensor nodes <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>test</b> lab operate on 2400 MHz) as technical (this ISM band is free to use globally) reasons.|$|R

30|$|Consider {{also that}} the {{additional}} latency due to the over-the-air data transmission is not included <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>tests,</b> thus {{it is really important}} to keep the measured latency value as small as possible in order to have an acceptable service in operation.|$|E
30|$|To {{limit the}} impact of {{inaccurate}} skeleton/pose estimation, we use manually marked key points <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>tests</b> for Dataset-A.
