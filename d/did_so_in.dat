5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> {{such a way as}} to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E

Early in the season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to tally at least 40 points, 10 assists and five blocked shots in a game since Alvan Adams <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> the 1976–77 season. With a healthy Wade leading the league in scoring and the Heat making a push for a playoff position, Wade was elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star game appearance.|$|E
5|$|Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> {{defiance}} of the local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government, and that the Junta left their usual moderation {{for the safety of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|As local {{hostilities}} {{between the}} loyalists and revolutionaries escalated in the build-up to the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Crèvecœur {{decided to return}} to France; scholars have suggested that he <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> order to secure his legal claim to his patrimony. Upon his arrival in New York City in 1778, Crèvecœur found himself under suspicion of being a Revolutionary spy and was detained; whilst in detention, he suffered a nervous collapse. He was released to travel in September 1780, and traveled to London after landing in Ireland. There, he sold the manuscript of Letters to publishers Davies & Davis before leaving for France.|$|E

5|$|At the NCAA Outdoor Championships that year, he {{won three}} {{separate}} national titles, beating all {{opposition in the}} 100m, 200m, and 4×100 meter relay races. This achievement made him {{the first man to}} win the three races at an NCAA Championships since John Carlos <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> 1969. Dix's time of 9.93seconds in the 100m was a world-leader at that point of the season, and was just 0.01 behind Ato Boldon's NCAA record. For these accomplishments, he was again named USATF's Athlete of the Week.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school. They finally <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School building. This fusion of institutions resulted in the birth of the modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E
5|$|Historical markers {{concerning}} Hines' exploits have occasionally included mistaken information.

In addition, a marker by the Confederate Monument of Bowling Green in Bowling Green's Fairview Cemetery says that Hines died before he could go to the dedication ceremony in 1876, when in reality he died in 1898 and is buried a few hundred feet away.|$|E

5|$|Intrigued by the article, Valiente wrote {{a letter}} to Williamson in 1952, who in turn put her in contact with Gardner. Valiente and Gardner wrote several letters back-and-forth, with the latter {{eventually}} suggesting that she meet him at the home of his friend and fellow Wiccan Edith Woodford-Grimes ("Dafo"), who lived not far from Bournemouth, in the Christchurch area. Before she left the meeting, Gardner gave her a copy of his 1949 novel, High Magic's Aid, in which he describes a fictionalised account of Wiccan initiates in the Middle Ages; he allegedly <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> order to gauge her opinion on ritual nudity and scourging, both of which were present in his tradition of Gardnerian Wicca.|$|E

5|$|Lenin never {{witnessed}} {{this violence}} or {{participated in it}} first-hand, and publicly distanced himself from it. His published articles and speeches rarely called for executions, but he regularly <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> his coded telegrams and confidential notes. Many Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Cheka's mass executions and feared the organisation's apparent unaccountability. The Party tried to restrain its activities in February 1919, stripping it of its powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official martial law, but the Cheka continued as before in swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Michigan's 541 yard {{offensive}} {{performance was}} the second straight week the offense gained more than 500 yards of offense, and {{was the second}} highest total of the season, only beaten by the previous week's total of 581 yards against Minnesota. Denard Robinson's 337 yards of passing were one yard shy of his career high; he threw for 338 yards against Notre Dame on Sept. 10, 2011. Michigan started a season 6–0 {{for the first time}} since 2006. Jordan Kovacs had two solo tackles for a loss, both on fourth down.
