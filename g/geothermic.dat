The area Colter described is now widely believed to be immediately west of Cody, Wyoming, and though little thermal activity exists there today, other reports from around the period when Colter was there also indicate observations similar to those Colter had originally described. The exact location of Colter’s Hell remains partially contested, as the name could have been applied to several different areas prone to <b>geothermic</b> activity. It is commonly believed that Colter’s Hell referred to {{the region of the}} Stinking Water, now known as the Shoshone River, particularly the section running through Cody.

40|$|Diese Dissertation ist auf den Internetseiten der Hochschulbibliothek online verfügbar. <b>Geothermics</b> as a {{discipline}} of Geophysics deals with {{the description of the}} thermal regime, its variation in time, and the associated processes. These processes can be quantified by their characteristic thermal signature observed in temperature records. Heat transfer in the Earth’s crust occurs primarily by thermal diffusion. On the other hand, heat advection due to groundwater flow in general is a more efficient transport mechanism. Therefore, the subsurface temperature field can be a sensitive indicator of even small flow rates. The challenge is to isolate the desired thermal signature from interfering signatures. This is achieved by eliminating the thermal signatures of all other processes and factors from the temperature data which may be caused by heterogeneity of thermal rock properties, heat generation, and transient variations of the ground surface temperature. Otherwise, these signatures may be misinterpreted leading to false conclusions. This work focuses on quantifying groundwater flow (Darcy flow) and eliminatin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the major}} {{assumptions}} underlying the science of <b>geothermics</b> over the last 100 years has been that heat istransported through the Earth's crust only by conduction, except {{in the immediate vicinity}} of active volcanoes. In old shields this assumption may be justifiable, but in sedimentary basins the ability of water to move through permeable aquifers provides a means of heat ransport that may under certain conditions be as effective as conduction. The thermal history of a basin depends on its tectonic origin and the circumstances of its development. The dissipation of excess heat associated with basin formation and the transfer of the continuous heat supply from the basement depend on the thermal properties of the strata nd their water content. In some basins widespread contrasts of heat flow are observed, both laterally and vertically, suggesting forced convection by water migration. In basins where part of the surface is above sea-level a hydrological drive may be inferred from the topographic surface. In sub-sea basins this drive is not available in the same form. Nevertheless, patterns of heat-flow variation have been observed for which some form of water flow seems to be the most probable xplanation...|$|R
40|$|In densely {{populated}} countries {{there is a}} growing and compelling need to use underground for different and possibly coexisting technologies to produce ‘‘low carbon’’ energy. These technologies include (i) clean coal combustion merged with CO 2 Capture and Storage (CCS); (ii) last-generation nuclear power or, in any case, safe nuclear wastes disposal, both ‘‘temporary’’ and ‘‘geological’’ somewhere in Europe (at least in one site) : Nuclear wastes are not necessarily associated to nuclear power plants; (iii) safe natural gas (CH 4) reserves to allow consumption also when the foreign pipelines are less available or not available for geopolitical reasons and (iv) ‘‘low-space-consuming’’ renewables in terms of Energy Density Potential in Land (EDPL measured in [GW h/ha/year]) as <b>geothermics.</b> When <b>geothermics</b> is exploited as low enthalpy technology, the heat/cool production could be associated, where possible, to increased measures of ‘‘building efficiency’’, low seismic risks building reworking and low-enthalpy heat managing. This is undispensable to build up ‘‘smart cities’’. In any case the underground geological knowledge is prerequisite. All these technologies have been already proposed and defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA) Road Map 2009 as priorities for worldwide security: all need to use underground in a rational and safe manner. The underground is not renewable in most of case histories [10, 11]. IEA recently matched and compared different technologies in a unique ‘‘Clean Energy Economy’’ improved document (Paris, November 16 – 17, 2011), by the contribution of this vision too (see reference). In concert with ‘‘energy efficiency’’ improvement both for plants and buildings, in the frame of the ‘‘smart cities’’ scenarios, and the upstanding use of ‘‘energy savings’’, the energetic planning on regional scale where these cities are located, are strategic for the year 2050 : this planning is strongly depending by the underground availability and typology. Therefore, if both literature and European Policy are going fast to improve the concept of ‘‘smart cities’’ this paper stresses the concept of ‘‘smart regions’’, more strategic than ‘‘smart cities’’, passing throughout a discussion on the synergic and conflicting use of underground to produce energy for the ‘‘smart regions’’ as a whole. The paper highlights the research lines which are urgent to plan the soundest energy mix for each region by considering the underground performances case by case: a worldwide mapping, by GIS tools of this kind of information could be strategic for all the ‘‘world energy management’’ authorities, up to ONU, with its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the G 20, the Carbon Sequestratio...|$|R
30|$|Minimizing {{exploration}} risk in deep <b>geothermics</b> is {{of great}} economic importance. Especially, knowledge about temperature and permeability of the reservoir is essential. We test the potential of an outcrop analogue study to minimize uncertainties in prediction of the rock properties of a fractured reservoir in the Upper Rhine Graben. Our results show that although mineralogical composition, clay content, grain size, and fabric type are basically comparable, porosity and quartz cementation are not. Young’s modulus, as observed in the outcrop closest to the reservoir is about twice as high (~  64  GPa) as observed in the reservoir (~  34  GPa). Most importantly, however, the parameters that describe the fracture system, which are essential to predict reservoir permeability, differ significantly. While the outcrops are dominated by perpendicular fracture sets (striking NE–SW and NW–SE), two different conjugate fracture sets (striking NW–SE and N–S) occur in the reservoir. Fracture apertures, as reported from the FMI, are one order of magnitude wider than in the outcrop. We conclude that our outcrop analogue study fails to predict important properties of the reservoir (such as permeability and porosity). This must be {{in part because of}} the tectonically complex setting of the reservoir. We propose that analogue studies are important, but they must be treated with care when attempting to predict the controlling parameters of a fractured reservoir.|$|R

These systems, which take advantage {{from the fact that the}} ground temperature is almost constant, are able to exchange heat with the ground with relatively shallow boreholes (depth typically about 100 m and generally lower than 200 m).

This outcome is not only devoted to geothermal aims, but also open to all geological uses. The resulting database will be easily accessible, upgradeable, and able to synthesize geological knowledge of the underground thermal properties. In this way, a useful tool for territorial planning and environmental control is obtained and will be made available. Knowledge about the physical and thermal parameters has to be supported by thematic maps. The work done suggests a methodological approach able to define the features that mainly influence the ability of the ground to “geoexchange”.

The electricity market in Chile comprises two main independent systems: the Northern Interconnected Power Grid (SING) and the Central Interconnected Power Grid (SIC). Currently, the primary Chilean energy source is imported fossil fuels, whereas hydropower represents the main indigenous source. Other renewables such as wind, solar, biomass and <b>geothermics</b> are as yet poorly developed.
