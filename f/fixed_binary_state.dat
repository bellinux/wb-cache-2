40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{a special kind of}} complex systems which depend on an {{arbitrary}} (and usually large) number n of random Boolean variables. The so-called complex stochastic Boolean systems often appear in many different scientific, technical or social areas. Clearly, there are 2 n <b>binary</b> <b>states</b> associated to such a complex system. Each one of them is given by a binary string u = (u 1,…,un) ∈ { 0, 1 }n of n bits, which has a certain occurrence probability Pr{u}. The behavior of a complex stochastic Boolean system is determined by the current values of its 2 n binary n-tuple probabilities Pr{u} and by the ordering between pairs of them. Hence, the intrinsic order graph provides a useful representation of these systems by displaying (scaling) the 2 n binary n-tuples which are ordered in decreasing probability of occurrence. The intrinsic order reduces the complexity of the problem from exponential (2 n binary n-tuples) to linear (n Boolean variables). For any <b>fixed</b> <b>binary</b> n-tuple u, this paper presents a new, simple algorithm enabling rapid, elegant determination of all the binary n-tuples v with occurrence probabilities {{less than or equal to}} (greater than or equal to) Pr{u}. This algorithm is closely related to the lexicographic (truth-table) order in { 0, 1 }n, and this is illustrated through the connections (paths) in the intrinsic order graph.

40|$|Markovian memory {{embedded}} in a binary system is shaping its evolution {{on the basis of}} its current state and introduces either clustering or dispersion of <b>binary</b> <b>states.</b> The consequence is directly observed in the lengthening or shortening of the runs of the same <b>binary</b> <b>state</b> and also in the way the proportion of a state within a sequence of state measurements scatters about its true average, which is quantifiable through the Markovian self-transition probabilities. It is shown that the Markovian memory can even imitate the evolution of a random process, regarding the long-term behavior of the frequencies of its <b>binary</b> <b>states.</b> This situation occurs when the associated <b>binary</b> <b>state</b> self-transition probabilities are balanced. To exemplify the behavior of Markovian memory, two natural processes are selected. The first example is studying the preferences of nonhuman troglodytes regarding handedness. The Markovian model in this case assesses the extent of influence two contiguous individuals may have on each other. The other example studies the hindering of the quantum state transitions that rapid state measurements introduce, known as the Quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Based on the current methodology, simulations of the experimentally observed clustering of states allowed for the estimation of the two self-transition probabilities in this quantum system. Through these, one can appreciate how the particular hindering of the evolution of a quantum state may have originated. The aim of this work is to illustrate as merits of the current mathematical approach, its wide range applicability and its potential to provide a variety of information regarding the dynamics of the studied process...|$|R
