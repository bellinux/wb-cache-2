40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} effect of orally administered genistein on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and N-desmethyl imatinib in rats. Twenty-five healthy male SD (Sprague-Dawley) rats were randomly divided into five groups: A group (control group), B group (multiple <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> 100 [*]mg/kg genistein for consecutive 15 days), C group (multiple <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> 50 [*]mg/kg genistein for consecutive 15 days), D group (a single <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> 100 [*]mg/kg genistein), and E group (a single <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> 50 [*]mg/kg genistein). A single <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> imatinib is administered orally 30 [*]min after administration of genistein (100 [*]mg/kg or 50 [*]mg/kg). The pharmacokinetic parameters of imatinib and N-desmethyl imatinib were calculated by DAS 3. 0 software. The multiple <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> 100 [*]mg/kg or 50 [*]mg/kg genistein significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased the AUC 0 -t and Cmax of imatinib. AUC 0 -t and the Cmax of N-desmethyl imatinib were also increased, but without any significant difference. However, the single <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> 100 [*]mg/kg or 50 [*]mg/kg genistein has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib and N-desmethyl imatinib. Those results indicated that multiple <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> genistein (100 [*]mg/kg or 50 [*]mg/kg) induces the metabolism of imatinib, while single <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> genistein has no effect...|$|R
5|$|The {{metabolism}} of bupropion {{is highly}} variable: the effective <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> bupropion received by persons who ingest {{the same amount}} of the drug may differ by as much as 5.5times (with a half-life of 12–30hours), while the effective <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> hydroxybupropion may differ by as much as 7.5times (with a half-life of 15–25hours).

5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} administration {{are considered to}} be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140mg/kg loading dose followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E
5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} high <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, {{or damage}} to dopamine neurons, which {{is characterized by}} dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E
