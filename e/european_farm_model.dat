40|$|Given {{that current}} European Union {{policy is to}} stimulate and {{facilitate}} multifunctional agriculture (<b>European</b> <b>farm</b> <b>model),</b> {{it would be useful}} to know why farmers decide to go multifunctional. This paper presents the results of research into the factors determining the adoption of multifunctional activities. It is based on a survey of 495 farms throughout the Netherlands. Binomial logit models were estimated for multifunctional activities in general and for four specific activities. It was found that trust in the government is an important explanatory factor for participation in nature conservation and tourism, but is less important for services and on-farm sales. Farm location is important for nature conservation, services, and tourism. But farmers see tourism as an invasion of `farmership¿.

40|$|The {{historical}} role of <b>European</b> <b>farming</b> {{in southern}} and central Africa {{is a delicate}} matter that has received {{a great deal of}} attention among scholars over the years. Going through this vast literature a striking consensus emerges: success or failure of <b>European</b> <b>farming</b> in southern Africa was to a large extent depending on their access and control over labour. These propositions have so far never been systematically and empirically tested. This paper is an attempt to do that by analyzing the ‘wage-burden’ European settler farmers faced. The wage-burden is identified by measuring wage shares (total amount paid in the form of wages as a share of total profits) on <b>European</b> <b>farms</b> in colonial Africa. Based on archival documents we construct time-series for value of output, transportation costs, investments and wage shares for European tobacco and tea farms in colonial Malawi. Our estimates show that the wage burden decreased significantly after 1930 s, i. e. the European farmers were able to capture a larger part of the rent over time. We argue that the developments cannot be explained by domestic colonial policies, but changes in regional migration patterns, which had a significant impact on the supply of farm labour...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Agricultural Economics Research Institute has {{calculated}} the production {{costs of the}} major agricultural products since the 1970 s. The calculations are {{used to examine the}} development of production costs, and they are based on the <b>farm</b> <b>models.</b> These <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> are constructed partly on the basis of information compiled from bookeeping farms and on the basis of various standards and recommendations. The models describe a situation where a farm has specialised in a production of one product. The <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> represent the conditions in Southern Finland and a level of agriculture more efficient than average. Therefore, the production costs calculated {{on the basis of these}} models do not descride the average production costs of farm products in Finland. The production methods and yields of the <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> have now been revised to correspond to the current situations. The calculations consist of the production of milk, beef, pork, piglets, eggs, bread grain, feed grain, oil plants and sugar beets. The calculations are made for each product produced on farms of different sizes and so they show the effect of the farm size on the production costs. The total number of models presented in this report is 50. The cost structures of the models are based on the production costs determined at the price and cost level of the year 1996. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The production costs of agricultural products according to <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> The production costs of agricultural products according to <b>farm</b> <b>model...</b>|$|R

40|$|Analysis of Financial Subsidies Allocated by the Common Agricultural Policy in <b>European</b> <b>Farms</b> in Reducing Economic-Territorial Inequalities by Indexes of Concentration. As a {{consequence}} of the European Union (EU) enlargement in 2004 there has been a reshaping of funds allocated by the EU both in favour of an endogenous rural development, part of Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and also in terms of direct payments towards ag-commodities financed by Pillar 1 of the CAP. The European Commission, in order to evaluate the impact, role and function of the CAP, has set up an annual survey on a sample of <b>European</b> <b>farms</b> belonging to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). By using the FADN dataset for the period 2004 - 2012 in 25 EU Member States, this paper has assessed by indexes of concentration whether funds allocated by Pillars 1 and 2 of the CAP have reduced economic disparities in some EU Member States.

The results highlight that impacts on the relative competitiveness of organic farms will depend strongly on the national implementation of the 2003 CAP reform and will often differ by farm type. In general, the impact will be more beneficial to organic farms in countries that have opted for full rather than partial decoupling, and in countries which have implemented the Single Farm Payment {{on the basis of}} regional flat rate payments rather than on the basis of historical, individual farm references.

40|$|Maatalouden liiketaloustieteen pro gradu -tutkielma, jonka ohjaajana toimi professori Matti Ylätalo. Tutkimus tehtiin MTTL:ssäMaatalouden rakennekehityksen yksi keino on tilakoon kasvattaminen lisäpeltoa hankkimalla. Suomen olosuhteissa on yleistä, että lisäpeltoa ei ole saatavissa läheltä. Mitä kannattaa maksaa kaukana olevasta pellosta? Asiaa on selvitetty maatalouden taloudellisessa tutkimuslaitoksessa laskemalla etäisyyden aiheuttamat kustannukset maidontuotantoa ja viljanviljelyä harjoittavilla tiloilla. Tulosten perusteella pellon etäisyys on merkittävä kustannustekijä, ja sen tulisi vaikuttaa pellosta maksettavaan hintaan ja vuokraan. Esimerkiksi 16 lehmän maitotilalla 5 hehtaarin sijainti 10 km:n päässä aiheuttaa vuodessa lähes 1000 markan lisäkustannuksen hehtaaria kohden. Viljatilalla vastaava lisäkustannus on vuodessa noin 500 mk/ha. Ero johtuu pääosin siitä, että viljanviljelyssä pellolla käyntikertoja on vähemmän. Tutkimuksessa selvitettiin myös aktiivitilojen lisäpellon hankintaa vuosina 1995 ja 1996. Tulosten mukaan etelän viljatilat maksoivat lisäpeltohehtaarista keskimäärin 17 750 mk ja maitotilat 15 500 mk. Keskimääräinen etäisyys talouskeskuksesta lisäpellolle oli viljatilalla 2, 0 km ja maitotilalla 1, 5 km. Kaukana olevia peltoja mieluummin vuokrattiin kuin ostettiin. Oletettavasti johtuen sijaintitekijästä, maitotilat saavat vuokrattua peltoa lähempää ja halvemmalla kuin viljatilat. Lisäpellon etäisyydellä ei ollut selvää vaikutusta pellosta maksettavaan hehtaarihintaan. Tämä lienee pitkälti seurausta siitä, että peltoa tulee myyntiin kysyntään nähden liian vähän: jos lisäpeltoa haluaa, siitä on maksettava käypä markkinahinta. Lisäpeltoa hankitaan harvoin yli 12 kilometrin etäisyydeltä tilan talouskeskuksesta. Kun osto tai vuokraus tehdään näin kaukaa, etäisyys jo ennestään hallinnassa olevalle pellolle on useimmiten lyhyt. Tällöin etäisyydestä aiheutuvaa haittaa pienentää se, että samalla suunnalla olevia peltoja voidaan viljellä samoilla käyntikerroilla. Monissa tapauksissa kaukana sijaitsevan pellon viljelykierto poikkeaa tilan muiden peltojen viljelykierrosta siten, että peltoa pyritään kesannoimaan enemmän kuin tilan muita peltoja tai sitä käytetään pelkästään rehuviljan tuotantoon. This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with the costs caused by the distance to additional arable land {{as well as the}} effects of the distance on the purchase and rent prices paid for additional arable land. First, the costs were calculated by means of the <b>farm</b> <b>models.</b> The models used were dairy <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> with 16 and 32 cows as well as cereal <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> with 40 and 80 hectares. The cost of the distance for the dairy <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> was calculated according to the labour input of silage and for the cereal <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> according to the labour input for feed barley, using the labour input norms for agriculture calculated by the TTS Institute. The locations of the arable land at distances of five to ten kilometres from the economic centre were examined. In the case of dairy <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> of 16 cows and cereal <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> of 40 ha the additional arable land area was 5 ha, {{and in the case of}} dairy <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> of 32 cows and cereal <b>farm</b> <b>models</b> of 80 ha it was 10 ha. The purchasing and use of additional arable land were examined by means of a questionnaire sent to the bookkeeping farms in order to determine whether the distances between the additional arable land, the economic centre of the farm, and the earlier arable land areas influenced the price paid for the arable land. In the <b>farm</b> <b>model</b> study the cost of the distance per hectare was the lowest in the cereal <b>farm</b> <b>model</b> of 80 ha with the additional area of 10 ha. As the distance grew from five to ten kilometres, the cost increased from FIM 190 to 415 per hectare. Correspondingly, the cost of the distance in the case of a cereal <b>farm</b> <b>model</b> with 40 ha varied between FIM 214 and 493 per hectare. The cost of the distance was the highest in the dairy <b>farm</b> <b>model</b> of 16 cows with the additional arable land area of 5 hectares. In this case the cost varied between FIM 444 and 940 per hectare. In the case of the larger dairy <b>farm</b> <b>model</b> (32 cows) the cost of the distance was between FIM 355 and 766 per hectare. The results of the questionnaire indicated that the distance to the additional arable land had no effect on the prices paid. However, both the purchasing and renting of additional land decreased considerably when the distance was longer than the 8 - 12 kilometres, and land was purchased or rented at longer distances only in a few individual cases. The questions concerning the use of additional arable land indicated that when the additional land was located relatively far away from the farmers had become adjusted to the fact that the crop rotation of the additional land differed from that of the other arable land areas. The additional area was either monotonously under fodder cereals or it was set aside more frequently than the other parcels of the farm. The comparison of the acquisition of additional arable land between milk producers and cereal producers indicated that in areas A and B milk producers purchased additional land closer to the economic centre and at a lower price than cereal producers. Instead, in areas C 1 and C 2 milk producers showed considerable willingness to expand and acquired additional land even further away than the other farmers of the area. When the future willingness to expand was asked, the farmers were prepared to increase their arable land area by means of additional land located even further away. On average, milk producers were prepared to acquire additional land located relatively close to their economic centres, but cereal producers were more willing to both rent and purchase land located at a longer distance than other farmers. In all production lines farmers are prepared to rent arable land at a longer distance than in the case of purchasing the land in the future, too. vMTT Taloustutkimu...|$|R
