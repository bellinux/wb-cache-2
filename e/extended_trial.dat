25|$|Sperry was a miner at Bagworth {{colliery}} who was 27 {{before he}} appeared in senior cricket. He made his first-class debut for Leicestershire in a single match in 1937 when he made little impression, failing to take a wicket and not being required to bat. In 1938, with the decline and imminent retirement of George Geary, {{who had been the}} mainstay of the bowling attack since before the First World War, Leicestershire gave Sperry an <b>extended</b> <b>trial</b> {{in the second half of}} the season and he responded with 27 wickets.|$|E

On the tour of South Africa, he missed three {{consecutive}} ODIs when tour selectors and fellow players Ian Healy and Steve Waugh voted him off the team. In all, Taylor had only played in 11 of Australia's 19 ODIs for the season, scoring 281 runs at 25.55. Taylor requested an <b>extended</b> <b>trial</b> as opener for the ODI side to help consolidate his captaincy of both teams.|$|E
25|$|The Chappell {{brothers}} played grade cricket for Glenelg {{and they}} batted {{together for the}} first time in a semi final against Port Adelaide in early 1966. Later that year, Ian was chosen for the Test tour to South Africa, which opened up a place in the South Australian team. Greg seized the opportunity by scoring 101*, 102* and 88 for his club, then made his first-class debut against Victoria at Adelaide Oval, aged 18. Hampered by a throat infection, Chappell still managed 53 and 62* to earn an <b>extended</b> <b>trial</b> in the team. The remainder of the season brought another 386 runs in 14 innings, including a maiden century against Queensland.|$|E

25|$|Midway {{through the}} season though, reports came out {{suggesting}} that two Major League Soccer teams were interesting in Chhetri, along with his international teammate Steven Dias. These two MLS sides were rumored to be the Los Angeles Galaxy and D.C. United. However, on 25 January 2009, Chhetri arrived in Coventry, England to begin a trial at Coventry City of the Football League Championship, thus rejecting MLS. Four days later though, Coventry City manager Chris Coleman {{said that they would}} not be following their interest in Chhetri. Four months later though, Chhetri said that he would go back to Coventry City in June 2009 for another <b>extended</b> <b>trial.</b> That never materialized however.|$|E
25|$|The stocky, redheaded Cosier was a middle-order batsman {{who often}} {{attacked}} the bowling when a more judicious method was {{the order of}} the day. Given an <b>extended</b> <b>trial</b> at international level over four seasons, he never really established himself as a Test batsman, although he was vice-captain of Australia for a brief period. He had two major highlights at Test level – a hundred on his Test debut at Melbourne against the West Indies in 1975–76, and a 168 against Pakistan the following season. Test bowlers were quick to exploit his technical deficiencies, in particular a very short backlift and abbreviated footwork. Cosier was all brute force with little finesse, but he did try to modify his technique somewhat during the 1978–79 Ashes series, when he was incongruously used as an opener.|$|E

By December, after receiving successful treatment, he was reported to be considering a return to football, either as a player or in a coaching role. He linked up with Lincoln City, managed by former Halifax Town team-mate Peter Jackson, for a week's training to assess his fitness levels, and after an <b>extended</b> <b>trial</b> period, signed a short-term playing contract to run from 2 January 2009 {{until the end of the}} season. He would also be involved with coaching the reserve team. Horsfield made his debut on 12 January against Brentford, setting up the equaliser for fellow debutant Anthony Elding in a 2–2 draw. After the game, he declared he was [...] "glad to be back playing". He scored his first goal for the club on 27 January 2009, in a 2–1 win against Gillingham, describing the long range shot [...] "one of my sweetest strikes". Horsfield played regularly during his time with Lincoln, but scored only that one goal, and at the end of the season the club decided not to renew his contract.|$|E

2500|$|The {{early months}} of 1938 saw Nicolae Iorga joining the {{national}} unity government of Miron Cristea, formed by Carol II's right-wing power base. A Crown Councillor, he then threw his reluctant support behind the National Renaissance Front, created by Carol II as {{the driving force of}} a pro-fascist but anti-Guard one-party state (see 1938 Constitution of Romania). Iorga was upset by the imposition of uniforms on all public officials, calling it [...] "tyrannical", and privately ridiculed the new constitutional regime's architects, but he eventually complied to the changes. In April, Iorga was also {{at the center of a}} scandal which resulted in Codreanu's arrest and eventual extrajudicial killing. By then, the historian had attacked the Guard's policy of setting up small commercial enterprises and charity ventures. This prompted Codreanu to address him an open letter, which accused Iorga of being dishonest. Premier Armand Călinescu, who had already ordered a clampdown on Guardist activities, seized Iorga's demand for satisfaction as an opportunity, ordering Carol's rival to be tried for libel—the preamble to an <b>extended</b> <b>trial</b> on grounds of conspiracy. An unexpected consequence of this move was the protest resignation of General Ion Antonescu from the office of Defense Minister.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{appropriateness}} of a software platform for rapid MRI {{assessment of the}} amount of salvageable brain tissue after stroke is critical for both the validity of the Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficits (<b>EXTEND)</b> Clinical <b>Trial</b> of stroke thrombolysis beyond 4. 5 hours and for stroke patient care outcomes. Aims The objective of this research is to develop and implement a methodology for selecting the acute stroke imaging software platform most appropriate for the setting of a multi-centre clinical trial. Methods A multi-disciplinary decision making panel formulated the set of preferentially independent evaluation attributes. Alternative Multi-Attribute Value Measurement methods were used to identify the best imaging software platform followed by sensitivity analysis to ensure the validity and robustness of the proposed solution. Results Four alternative imaging software platforms were identified. RApid processing of PerfusIon and Diffusion (RAPID) software was selected as the most appropriate for the needs of the <b>EXTEND</b> <b>trial.</b> A theoretically grounded generic multi-attribute selection methodology for imaging software was developed and implemented. Conclusions The developed methodology assured both a high quality decision outcome and a rational and transparent decision process. This development contributes to stroke literature in the area of comprehensive evaluation of MRI clinical software. At the time of evaluation, RAPID software presented the most appropriate imaging software platform for use in the <b>EXTEND</b> clinical <b>trial.</b> The proposed multi-attribute imaging software evaluation methodology is based on sound theoretical foundations of multiple criteria decision analysis and can be successfully used for choosing the most appropriate imaging software while ensuring both robust decision process and outcomes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Advanced imaging may refine patient {{selection}} for ischemic stroke treatment but delays to acquire and process the imaging have limited implementation. AIMS: We examined {{the feasibility of}} imaging selection in clinical practice using fully automated software in the <b>EXTEND</b> <b>trial</b> program. METHODS: CTP and perfusion-diffusion MRI data were processed using fully-automated software to generate a yes/no 'mismatch' classification that determined eligibility for trial therapies. The technical failure/mismatch classification error rate and time to image and treat with CT vs. MR-based selection were examined. RESULTS: In a consecutive series of 776 patients from five sites over six-months the technical failure rate of CTP acquisition/processing (uninterpretable maps) was 3 · 4 % (26 / 776, 95 %CI 2 · 2 - 4 · 9 %). Mismatch classification was overruled by expert review in an additional 9 · 0 % (70 / 776, 95 %CI 7 · 1 - 11 · 3 %) due to artifactual 'perfusion lesion'. In 154 consecutive patients at one site, median additional time to acquire CTP after non-contrast CT was 6 · 5 [*]min. Subsequent RAPID processing time varied from 3 - 10 [*]min across 20 trial centers (median 5 [*]min 20 [*]s). In the <b>EXTEND</b> <b>trial,</b> door-to-needle times in patients randomized {{on the basis of}} CTP (n[*]=[*] 47) were median 78 [*]min shorter than MRI-selected (n[*]=[*] 16) patients (P[*]<[*] 0 · 001). CONCLUSIONS: Automated CTP-based mismatch selection is rapid, robust in clinical practice, and associated with faster treatment decisions than MRI. This technological advance has the potential to improve the standardization and reproducibility of interpretation of advanced imaging and extend use to practice settings beyond highly specialized academic centers.

40|$|Amon Asgharpour, Jianfeng Cheng, Stephen J Bickston VCUHS Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Virginia Commonwealth University Health Center, Richmond, VA, USA Abstract: The {{advent of}} anti-tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) therapies revolutionized {{the treatment of}} inflammatory bowel disease. Adalimumab is a subcutaneous anti-TNF agent indicated for use in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn&# 39;s disease and those with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. In both diseases, {{it can be used}} for both induction of remission and for maintenance of remission. This review focuses on its use in Crohn&# 39;s disease as described in the EXTEND (Extend the Safety and Efficacy of Adalimumab through Endoscopic Healing) trial. Several clinical trials using traditional instruments to measure clinical response have had endoscopic substudies looking for endoscopic healing. The <b>EXTEND</b> <b>trial</b> is the first to use mucosal healing on endoscopy as a primary endpoint for patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn&# 39;s disease and baseline ulcerative disease treated with continuous adalimumab. In this well designed trial, the primary endpoint was narrowly missed, but the secondary endpoints further the notion that mucosal healing should be a more mainstream measure of drug efficacy. How this will translate from clinical trials to the clinic is not yet clear, but identifying noninvasive markers for mucosal healing, and understanding the implications of mucosal healing for safety, resource utilization, and quality of life are all worthy targets for further study. The aim of this review is to understand the role of mucosal healing, safety profile, and efficacy in patients treated with anti-TNF therapy, with particular attention to adalimumab and the <b>EXTEND</b> <b>trial.</b> Keywords: Crohn&# 39;s disease, tumor necrosis factor, adalimumab, clinical trials, inflammatory bowel diseas...|$|R
