40|$|The {{fight against}} Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing plays {{a crucial role}} in the attempt to move towards {{sustainable}} fisheries. IUU fishing is a global problem that continues to be out of control. Its value has been assessed to amount worldwide to be between ¿ 10 to 20 billion (Agnew et al., 2009), which is more than twice the value of annual landings by the EU fleet (¿ 6. 8 billion in 20043). These estimates are probably rather conservative, but certainly IUU fishing represents the major source of fishing mortality (Figure 3. 1. 1. 1). Such estimates are, however, probably very conservative, but nevertheless represent the major source of fishing mortality. Escaping control, IUU fishing threatens marine ecosystems, impedes management schemes for sustainable fisheries, and has a negative effect on socio-economic development. Moreover, globalisation has had major affects on the food supply chain. It has removed production from direct consumer control, increased competition, lengthened the food supply chain, and made it less transparent. There has been an associated increase in awareness in traceability issues to deal with food safety, quality assurance and animal welfare. Illegal activities extend into the supply chain, as has become evident by fraud cases in the US and Europe where fish has been sold under false labels (for examples see Annex 1). Such practice leads to consumer misinformation and hampers efforts to ensure consumer protection. Consumer protection is currently mainly assured by <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>labelling</b> of products and such a system is prone to fraudulent activities. Increasing dependence on product imports and complex marketing patterns further impede efforts to regulate and control the fisheries sector. Increasingly, certification procedures that endorse sustainable fisheries, such as awarded by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or consumer oriented websites describing fishery status, such as the NOAA Fishwatch program ([URL] are employed to provide information on fishery products. However, such certification is also susceptible to fraud. Therefore, to fight illegal fishing activities and ensure sustainability, fairness and transparency in the fisheries sector, as well as for the information and protection of consumers, a traceability system is required. Traceability is defined by the CODEX Alimentarius Commision (CAC 2006) and according to ISO 22005 : 2007 as the ¿ability to follow the movement of a food through specified stages(s) of production, processing, and distribution and for the EU laid down in Regulation (EC) No. 178 / 2002. Any such system in the fisheries sector should be effective throughout the food supply chain (¿from ocean to fork¿), and be supported by independent control measures to verify the species and origins of fish and shellfish caught. Consequently there is an urgent need to identify traceability markers that can be used throughout the food supply chain, from on-board samples, to processed product, and which exhibit minimal variance. Furthermore, it is likely that traceability tools will in many cases need to be applied within a sufficiently robust forensic framework (Ogden 2008) to promote legal enforcement. JRC.

40|$|NHS Trust {{provides}} aseptic {{services to}} the Trust under Section 10 exemption. The aseptic service focuses on TPN for neonates, paediatrics and Bone Marrow Transplant patients, and cytotoxics for patients throughout the Trust. Four years ago, difficulties with recruiting technical staff provided the opportunity to review the skill mix of staff in the Unit. Aseptic preparation {{at that time was}} performed by qualified pharmacy technicians (MTOs), with assistants (ASCs) carrying out support functions such as assembly of ingredients, delivery of chemotherapy to the user areas, receipt of goods into the department, clerical duties and environmental monitoring. Discussion around service provision centred on whether the staffing structure could be redesigned to incorporate an Assistant Technical Officer grade. It was anticipated that these would be unqualified people, with a leaning towards practical scientific subjects, who could be trained inhouse to carry out specific aseptic preparation activities using pharmaceutical isolators. A job description was drawn up after taking advice from Human Resources. Other Areas The key elements lay in drawing a clear distinction between the new ATO role and the existing MTO role. It is clear in the job descriptions that MTOs are not only qualified to work in other areas of pharmacy, but also that the range of their skills enables them to carry out more skilled activities in the aseptic unit, such as preparation <b>and</b> checking of <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>labels.</b> The MTOs could also perform in-process checks, which at that time was not incorporated in the ATO job description. Two ATO positions were advertised, and the successful candidates both had prior experience in related areas- one had worke...|$|R

40|$|Using {{inconsistent}} terminology, e. g. having different {{terms in}} <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> e. g. <b>labels</b> <b>and</b> menu items in a user interface {{is believed to}} be confusing to users. However, few empirical studies exist on this particular topic. In this paper we show how users' interaction with an interface is affected by inconsistent terminology. An experimental eye-tracking study with 30 participants was conducted where the participants were shown a user interface and a task description. The terminology in the interface and task description was manipulated to be either consistent or inconsistent. The results show that terminological inconsistencies led to a significantly higher number of visual fixations, more time needed to perform the task, and more returns to the task description. The conclusion is that inconsistent use of terms create unnecessary cognitive workload for the user that can be avoided by ensuring terminological consistency within a system...|$|R

Nonproprietary (also known as copy, or generic) medicines, which base their authorization and use on the proprietary <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>label,</b> are often viewed {{as a means to}} help lower the cost and, thus, increase patient access. If these medicines fail to meet quality standards, such as good manufacturing practice and bioequivalence (in humans), they are then defined as substandard copies and can pose serious risks to patients in terms of safety and efficacy. Potentially noncontrolled or different manufacturing process and excipients in nonproprietary medicines may result in poor batch-to-batch reproducibility (accurate and consistent quantity of each ingredient in each capsule/tablet) and lower quality. Substandard, nonproprietary copies of medicines that are immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive are of concern to patients due to their possible untoward safety and lack of efficacy events. This article reviews the potential risks associated with nonproprietary medicines that do not meet the regulatory requirements of the United States Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, or the World Health Organization. The clinical implications for patients are described. This article focuses on nonproprietary medicines for multiple sclerosis, particularly fingolimod, that are not identical to proprietary versions and could thus fail to meet efficacy expectations or have different impact on the safety of patients with multiple sclerosis.

40|$|IUU fishing {{has been}} a major {{nuisance}} in Nordic fisheries for many years, and it has proved difficult {{to get rid of the}} problem by governmental controls alone. Engaging consumers and the market however, could be a supplement to public actions, and make the loopholes smaller for this kind of black market economy. Ecolabeling is a tool which could contribute to responsible behaviour throughout the industry, and give the consumer the option of making informed choices. For the industry however, choosing the most relevant ecolabel can be difficult as there are several labels available on the market, and they emphasize different aspects of the sustainability concept. In this book prepared for the Nordic Council of Ministers by Det Norske Veritas a review of the most relevant ecolabels is presented, as well as an assessment of each label against a defined set of criteria. The intention of this publication is thus that it could be of assistance for businesses which are considering which ecolabels to choose for their products, and also to stimulate further discussions and professional development in the Nordic seafood sector in the realms of <b>documentation,</b> <b>labelling</b> <b>and</b> tracing...|$|R

The aim of the presentation is to describe <b>and</b> discuss the <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> assessment practice in Swedish preschools in a didactic perspective. The question is: What, how <b>and</b> why <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> assessment are used in Swedish preschools? The selection includes preschools in both urban and rural municipalities. A reflexive textual and abductive analysis is used. A wide variety of <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> assessment forms emerge in different preschools. Assessments are interwoven {{in the construction of}} the documents. Examples of documentation are Individual development plans, portfolio, pedagogical documentation, standardized documents like TRAS, StegVis <b>and</b> START. The <b>documentation</b> provides a sample of developmental-psychological assessments, knowledge assessments, personal assessments, self-assessments and centre-performance-focused assessments. Assessment <b>and</b> <b>documentation</b> can be interpreted as both summative and formative. Content and form vary and the functions of <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> assessment emerges as focused on both qualification, socialisation and subjectification (subjektifiering). The concept of transformative assessment can articulate and define teachers' interactions among different types of <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> assessment in a didactic perspective. The presentation highlights how the <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> assessment of children varies depending on where the children grow up and attend preschool – a diversified normalisation emerges.
