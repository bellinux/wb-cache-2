5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> {{to assume}} that the average Joe/Jane is neither a college {{graduate}} nor a high school drop-out. It is, however, difficult {{to determine whether or not}} the average American has some college education as the population is split between those who did and did not attend college. Over the past half century the educational attainment of the US population has significantly increased.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{since the}} Supreme Court has {{recognized}} voting {{as a fundamental}} right, the Equal Protection Clause places very tight limitations (albeit with uncertain limits) on the states' ability to define voter qualifications; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to say that qualifications beyond citizenship, residency, and age are usually questionable.|$|E
25|$|The basic or {{classical}} twin-design {{contains only}} identical and fraternal twins raised in their biological family. This represents only a sub-set {{of the possible}} genetic and environmental relationships. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to say, therefore, that the heritability estimates from twin designs represent {{a first step in}} understanding the genetics of behavior.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to {{say that}} SA and New Guinea are linguistically the poorest {{documented}} parts of the world. However, in the early 1960s fairly systematic efforts were launched in Papua New Guinea, and that areamuch smaller than SA, to be sureis in general much better documented than any part of indigenous SA of comparable size.|$|E
25|$|It was Laplace {{who found}} the first answers {{explaining}} the remarkable dance of the Galilean moons (see below). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> {{to say that this}} general field of study has remained very active since then, with plenty more yet to be understood (e.g., how interactions of moonlets with particles of the rings of giant planets result in maintaining the rings).|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to {{say that}} {{scholars}} remain slightly puzzled that the effective and simple penannular brooch developed in this direction, though it is presumed that the reuniting of the terminals of pseudo-penannular brooches was partly to strengthen the brooch. In many penannular brooches, {{the gap between the}} terminals is now too narrow for the pin to pass through; whether this was always the case is uncertain.|$|E

25|$|If the {{prevailing}} fashion be {{to reject the}} long sleeve, and to partially display the arm, let the glove advance considerably above the elbow, and there be fastened with a draw-string or armlet. But this should only be the case when the arm is muscular, coarse, or scraggy. When <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair,</b> smooth, and round, it will admit of the glove being pushed down to a little above the wrists.|$|E
25|$|He had {{personally}} opposed {{the use of}} violence against both companies and laborers in labor disputes, and had favored the elevation of African Americans from an inferior social position to one of equality. As neither principle was actively supported by successful politicians of either party, either before or after his term as governor, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to attribute the principles to him personally, and to note that he was out-of-step with his nineteenth century contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe's {{target was}} {{therefore}} 253 to win (in 47 overs), or 252 to tie. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> that their target was increased, {{even though they}} had the same number of overs to bat as West Indies, as West Indies would have batted more aggressively in their last few overs, and scored more runs, if they had known that their innings would be cut short at 47 overs. Zimbabwe were all out for 175, giving West Indies victory by 252nbsp&minus&nbsp&175 =nbsp&77nbsp&runs.|$|E

25|$|In bidding, Beasley adopted many of Culbertson's ideas, but was displeased {{with the}} strong twos and their {{negative}} response of two no trumps. As a result, so he claimed, he was the inventor (in 1936) of the artificial strong two clubs opening bid with its negative response two diamonds. For many years all the British bidding systems used this method of dealing with strong hands: Acol (both standard and Benjaminised), CAB, Two Clubs and Baron systems all used it. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to mention that others have also claimed authorship of this fruitful idea.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{allegedly}} overly unrealistic {{assumptions are}} one of the most common criticisms towards neoclassical economics. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to say that many (but not all) of these criticisms can only be directed towards a subset of the neoclassical models (for example, there are many neoclassical models where unregulated markets fail to achieve Pareto-optimality and there has recently been an increased interest in modeling non-rational decision making). Its disregard for social reality and its alleged role in aiding the elites to widen the wealth gap and social inequality is also frequently criticized.|$|E
25|$|Our current {{economic}} crisis calls for bold action to truly {{stimulate the economy}} and Renew America back to its greatness. The 9–9–9 Plan gets Washington D.C. {{out of the business}} of picking winners and losers, using the tax code to dole out favors, and dividing the country with class warfare. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair,</b> simple, transparent and efficient. It taxes everything once and nothing twice. It taxes the broadest possible base at the lowest possible rates. It is neutral with respect to savings and consumption, capital and labor, imports and exports and whether companies pay dividends or retain earnings.|$|E
25|$|On You're Fired, {{two of the}} panellists and the {{majority}} of the audience agreed with Sir Alan's decision, with Lucinda herself admitting <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fair</b> and the right decision to make.|$|R

60|$|His guests, {{excepting}} Creech, {{argued with}} him, explained, reasoned, showed him that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fair</b> to all concerned. Bostil finally acquiesced, {{but he was}} not happy. The plain fact was that he was frightened.|$|R
25|$|We {{claim that}} the {{defendant}} is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue {{as to whether he}} taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict that testimony, there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict that we may carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure. We do not think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.|$|E
25|$|Hephaestion’s {{exact age}} is not known. No concise {{biography}} {{has ever been}} written about him, likely stemming {{from the fact that}} he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander's companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion’s age as being similar to Alexander’s so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to assume that he was born about 356BC. He is said to have become a page in 343BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon. As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands' {{target was}} {{therefore}} 198 to win (in 36 overs), or 197 to tie. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> that their target was increased, {{even though they}} had the same number of overs to bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively in their first 28 overs, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralizes the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat they thought they would get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 minus& 122 = 75 runs.|$|E

25|$|R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, {{ex parte}} Coughlan is a seminal case {{decided by the}} Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 1999 which {{clarified}} the court's role in relation to cases which involve substantive legitimate expectations. The Court held that when reviewing a decision of a public authority which is contrary to a prior assurance or representation by the authority, its role is not always limited to assessing if the decision is Wednesbury unreasonable or irrational. In some situations, it is entitled to determine whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to compel the authority to fulfil its representation, or {{whether there is a}} sufficient overriding public interest which justifies allowing the authority to depart from the promise made.|$|E
25|$|The American middle class, {{at least}} those living the lifestyle, has become known {{around the world for}} {{conspicuous}} consumption. To this day, the professional middle class in the United States holds the world record for having the largest homes, most appliances, and most automobiles. In 2005, the average new home had a square footage of 2,434 square feet (roughly 226 square meters) with 58% of these homes having ceilings with heights in excess of nine feet on the first floor. As new homes only represent {{a small portion of the}} housing stock in the US, with most suburban homes having been built in the 1970s when the average square footage was 1,600, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to assume that these large new suburban homes will be inhabited by members of the professional middle class.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 Australian election, Mark Latham urged Australians to vote informally by handing in blank ballot {{papers for}} the 2010 election. He {{also stated that}} he doesn't feel <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> for the {{government}} to force citizens to vote if they don't have an opinion or threaten them into voting with a fine. An Australian Electoral Commission spokesman stated that the Commonwealth Electoral Act did not contain an explicit provision prohibiting the casting of a blank vote. How the Australian Electoral Commission arrived at this opinion is unknown; it runs contrary to the opinions of Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who wrote that voters must actually mark the ballot paper and deposit that ballot into a ballot box, and Justice Blackburn who was of the opinion that casting an invalid vote was a violation of the Act.|$|E
