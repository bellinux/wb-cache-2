Experience with brazing of hermetic vacuum components has identified the following parameters as influencing the outcome of hydrogen <b>furnace</b> <b>brazed</b> Kovar{trademark} to metallized alumina braze joints: (a) Mo-Mn metallization thickness, sinter fire temperature and porosity (b) Nil plate purity, thickness, and sinter firing conditions (c) peak process temperature, time above liquidus and (d) braze alloy washer thickness.

50|$|<b>Furnace</b> <b>brazing</b> is a {{semi-automatic}} process used {{widely in}} industrial brazing operations {{due to its}} adaptability to mass production and use of unskilled labor. There are many advantages of <b>furnace</b> <b>brazing</b> over other heating methods that make it ideal for mass production. One main advantage is {{the ease with which}} it can produce large numbers of small parts that are easily jigged or self-locating. The process also offers the benefits of a controlled heat cycle (allowing use of parts that might distort under localized heating) and no need for post braze cleaning. Common atmospheres used include: inert, reducing or vacuum atmospheres all of which protect the part from oxidation. Some other advantages include: low unit cost when used in mass production, close temperature control, and the ability to braze multiple joints at once. Furnaces are typically heated using either electric, gas or oil {{depending on the type of}} furnace and application. However, some of the disadvantages of this method include: high capital equipment cost, more difficult design considerations and high power consumption.|$|E

50|$|Vacuum {{furnaces}} is {{a relatively}} economical method of oxide prevention and is most often used to braze materials with very stable oxides (aluminum, titanium and zirconium) that cannot be <b>brazed</b> in atmosphere <b>furnaces.</b> Vacuum <b>brazing</b> is also used heavily with refractory materials and other exotic alloy combinations unsuited to atmosphere furnaces. Due {{to the absence of}} flux or a reducing atmosphere, the part cleanliness is critical when brazing in a vacuum. The three main types of vacuum furnace are: single-wall hot retort, double-walled hot retort, and cold-wall retort. Typical vacuum levels for brazing range from pressures of 1.3 to 0.13 pascals (10−2 to 10−3 Torr) to 0.00013 Pa (10−6 Torr) or lower. Vacuum furnaces are most commonly batch-type, and they are suited to medium and high production volumes.|$|R

40|$|Valeo Engine Cooling in Mjällby mainly {{produces}} truck coolers. At {{the production}} site, there is on-going work {{to phase out}} the automobile cooler manufacturing and concentrate the production to one facility. At {{the same time the}} main production flow needs to be improved. The purpose of this Master’s Thesis is to analyze the flow of coolers from the <b>brazing</b> <b>furnaces</b> through the different crimping and welding assembly stations, to find problem areas and implement changes to improve the situation. The analysis has pointed out three different areas: • The need to increase throughput of the <b>brazing</b> <b>furnaces</b> and lower the work in progress levels by reducing change-over times • The necessity to organize the crimping stock in FIFO and improve the layout • The importance of having a separate stock area assigned for manual welding assembly Currently, the <b>brazing</b> <b>furnaces</b> are operated 24 hours a day and this is still not sufficient to meet customer demands. Therefore, every extra hour of production that can be gained is valuable. The work with the change-overs in the <b>brazing</b> <b>furnaces</b> has resulted in a step-by-step guide to shorten the change-over time. It is based on the SMED methodology (Single Digit Minute Exchange of Die) and an analysis of shift reports from the furnaces. The yearly extra profit that would be made by implementing each step has been calculated to be between 2 and approximately 15 million SEK. The work is supposed to point out the importance of working on reducing the change-over times and show which actions are the most profitable. The actions include: reducing the number of belt speeds in the furnaces, having an end of line stock for all products, optimizing change-overs on the same belt speed and shorten the time used for changing belt speeds. Today, the crimping storage is very unorganized and difficult to overview. The plan is to store the cores in rows of wagons, instead of pallets, and to use the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. The stock levels fluctuate heavily over the week. To be able to dimension the new storage area the variations have been carefully analyzed. Two layout suggestions were created and compared. Both alternatives have advantages, but one of them was found to be superior due to higher safety and better stock organisation. The layout of a nearby water leak test station had to be changed in order to have the cell working as efficiently as today. The final layout alternative made this possible using a smaller area than today. The analysis of the main process flow showed that today there is no separate storage area for manual welding. Instead, these products are mixed within the robot welding assembly stock, and thereby complicating the work for the operators. A new storage area was needed with an area able to store 15 pallets. From the decision factors two layout alternatives were created. The chosen alternative is located closer to the manual welding cells and requires less extensive layout changes. To have everything working on the least possible area, the supply of tanks to a nearby crimping station had to be done with supply trains. These wagons were designed and built. They were also tested in a supply loop and at the crimping press with good results. Unfortunately, the wagons could not be added to the train loop since {{there was no room for}} the tanks in the service area. Still, it served as a good example of how much space is made available in a work cell by using small boxes and supply trains. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Technetium- 99 m, {{supplied}} in {{the form}} of 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generators, is the most widely used radioisotope for nuclear medical imaging. The parent isotope 99 Mo is currently produced in nuclear reactors. Recent disruptions in the 99 Mo supply chain [1] prompted the development of methods for the direct accelerator-based production of 99 mTc. Our approach involves the 100 Mo(p, 2 n) 99 mTc reaction on isotopically enriched molybdenum using small medical cyclotrons (Ep ≤ 20 MeV), which is a viable method for the production of clinically useful quantities of 99 mTc [2]. Multi-Curie production of 99 mTc requires a 100 Mo target capable of dissipating high beam intensities [3]. We have reported the fabrication of 100 Mo targets of both small and large area tar-gets by electrophoretic deposition and subsequent sintering [4]. As part of our efforts to further enhance the performance of molybdenum targets at high beam currents, we have developed a novel target system (initially de-signed for the GE PETtrace cyclotron) based on a pressed and sintered 100 Mo plate brazed onto a dispersion-strengthened copper backing. Materials and Methods In the first step, a molybdenum plate is produced similarly to the method described in [5] by compacting approximately 1. 5 g of commercially available 100 Mo powder using a cylindrical tool of 20 mm diameter. A pressure between 25 kN/cm 2 and 250 kN/cm 2 is applied by means of a hydraulic press. The pressed molybdenum plate is then sintered in a reducing atmosphere (Ar/ 2 % H 2) at 1, 700 oC for five hours. The resulting 100 Mo plates have about 90 – 95 % of the molybdenum bulk density. The 100 Mo plate is <b>furnace</b> <b>brazed</b> at ~ 750 oC onto a backing manufactured from a disperse on strengthened copper composite (e. g. Glidcop AL- 15) using a high temperature silver-copper brazing filler. This process yields a unique, mechanically and thermally robust target system for high beam power irradiation. Irradiations were performed on the GE PETtrace cyclotrons at LHRI and CPDC with 16. 5 MeV protons and beam currents ≥ 100 µA. Targets were visually inspected after a 6 hour, 130 µA bombardment (2. 73 kW/cm 2, average) and were found fully intact. Up to 4. 7 Ci of 99 mTc have been produced to date. The saturated production yield remained constant between 2 hour and 6 hour irradiations. Results and Conclusion These results demonstrate that our brazed tar-get assembly can withstand high beam intensities for long irradiations without deterioration.

40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) {{consists}} of 1080 conical tubes, which are furnace brazed themselves, manifolds, and surrounding structural jacket making almost four miles of braze joints. Subsequent furnace braze cycles are performed due to localized braze voids between the coolant tubes. SSME nozzle experiences extremely high heat flux (180 mW/sq m) during hot fire. Braze voids between coolant tubes {{may result in}} hot combustion gas escape causing jacket bulges. The nozzle can be disqualified for flight or result in mission failure if the braze voids exceed the limits. Localized braze processes were considered to eliminate braze voids, however, damage to the parent materials often prohibited use of such process. Being the only manned flight reusable rocket engine, it has stringent requirement on the braze process. Poor braze quality or damage to the parent materials limits the nozzle service life. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a laser brazing process to provide quality, localized braze joints without adverse affect on the parent materials. Gold (Au-Cu-Ni-Pd-Mn) based high temperature braze alloys were used in both powder and wire form. Thin section iron base superalloy A 286 tube was used as substrate materials. Different Laser Systems including CO 2 (10. 6 micrometers, 1 kW), ND:YAG (1. 06 micrometers, 4 kW). and direct diode laser (808 nm. 150 W) were investigated for brazing process. The laser process variables including wavelength. laser power, travel speed and angle of inclination were optimized according to bead geometry and braze alloy wetting at minimum heat input level, The properties of laser brazing were compared to that of <b>furnace</b> <b>brazing.</b> Microhardness profiles were used for braze joint property comparison between laser and <b>furnace</b> <b>brazing.</b> The cooling rate of laser brazing was compared to <b>furnace</b> <b>brazing</b> based on secondary dendritic arm spacing, Both optical and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were used to evaluate the microstructures of the braze materials and tube substrate. Metallography of the laser braze joint was compared to the furnace braze. SEM Energy Disperse X-Ray Spectra (EDX) and back scattered imaging were used to analyze braze alloy segregation. Although all of the laser systems, CO 2, ND:YAG, and direct diode laser produced good braze joint, the direct diode laser was selected for its system simplicity, compactness and portability. Excellent laser and braze alloy coupling is observed with powder alloy compared to braze alloy wire. Good wetting is found with different gold based braze alloys. The laser brazing process can be optimized so that the adverse affect on the parent materials can be eliminated. Metallography of the laser braze joint has shown that quality braze joint was produced with laser brazing process. Penetration of the laser braze to the substrate is at neglectable level. Zero penetration is observed. Microstructure examinations shown that no observable changes of the microstructure (grain structure and precipitation) in the HAZ area between laser braze and furnace braze. Wide gaps can be laser brazed with single pass for up to 0. 024 inches. Finer dendritic structure is observed in laser brazing compared with equiaxial and coarser grain of the <b>furnace</b> <b>brazing</b> microstructure. Greater segregation is also found in the furnace braze. Higher hardness of the laser braze joint comparing to furnace braze is observed due to the fast cooling rate and Finer microstructure in the laser brazing. Laser braze joint properties meet or exceed the furnace joint properties. Direct diode laser for thin section tube brazing with high temperature braze alloys have been successfully demonstrated. The laser's high energy density and precise control has shown significant advantages in reducing process heat input to the substrates and provide high quality braze joints comparing to other localized braze process such as torch, TIG, and MPTA processes.

Brazing was performed in a conventional atmosphere control <b>furnace.</b> The <b>brazing</b> temperatures and holding times employed {{in this study were}} 800 - 870 °C and 10 - 20 min, respectively. The qualities of the brazed joints were evaluated by ultrasonic test and the microstructure and phase constitution of the bonded joints were analyzed by means of metallography, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The mechanical properties of brazed joints were evaluated by microhardness and shear tests. The diffusion between Ti, Ag, Cu, Zn and Cd from substrate and braze alloy, developed a strong reaction between each other. A number of intermetallic phases, such as TiCu and Ti 2 Cu in the Ag-Zn solid solution matrix have been identified especially at 870 °C - 20 min.
