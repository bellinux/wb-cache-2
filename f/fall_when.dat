5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's <b>fall</b> <b>when</b> talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|In Asgard, Loki betrays {{and kills}} Laufey, {{revealing}} his true {{plan to use}} Laufey's attempt on Odin's life {{as an excuse to}} destroy Jotunheim with the Bifröst Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created {{in the wake of the}} bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to <b>fall</b> <b>when</b> Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; while on Earth, Jane and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.|$|E

25|$|Exacerbating this is {{the fact}} that {{intensive}} human use of grizzly habitat coincides with the seasonal movement of grizzly bears e.g. in the <b>fall,</b> <b>when</b> grizzly bears congregate near streams to feed on salmon when anglers are also intensively using the river.|$|E

60|$|And now {{we come to}} {{disassociation}} of personality. We {{never have}} this sense of <b>falling</b> <b>when</b> we are wide awake. Our wake-a-day personality has no experience of it. Then--and here the argument is irresistible--it must be another and distinct personality that <b>falls</b> <b>when</b> we are asleep, and that has had experience of such falling--that has, in short, a memory of past-day race experiences, just as our wake-a-day personality has a memory of our wake-a-day experiences.|$|R

These remained only sporadic {{until the}} <b>fall,</b> <b>when</b> an incident between {{one of the}} settlers, James Hubbard, and a noted Cherokee leader in the Overhill Towns, Noonday, brought the younger Overhill warriors into the fight and incited them all to more violence. This {{could be considered the}} start of a Southwest Indian War, fought by the Cherokee and later the Muscogee too.|$|E

The leaves grow in a rosette form, with new foliage emerging from the top and center of the crown.

25|$|During the election, Townsend {{was criticized}} for her choice of running mate; she picked retired Admiral Charles R. Larson, a novice {{politician}} who had switched parties {{only a few weeks}} before.

Townsend's popularity continued to <b>fall</b> <b>when</b> it was reported that much of her campaign money was given by out-of-state donors; Ehrlich remained on the attack while the lieutenant governor's poll numbers declined.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to chlorophylls, {{another group of}} yellow–orange pigments called carotenoids are {{also found in the}} photosystems. There are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids. They help transfer and dissipate excess energy, and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green, like during the <b>fall,</b> <b>when</b> the leaves of some land plants change color. β-carotene is a bright red-orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts, like chlorophyll a. Xanthophylls, especially the orange-red zeaxanthin, are also common. Many other forms of carotenoids exist that are only found in certain groups of chloroplasts.|$|E
