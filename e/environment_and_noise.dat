The study concluded {{the impact on the}} <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> pollution would be minimal. Plans for the airport included a single runway suitable for regional jets and larger mainline aircraft.

40|$|Abstract Presence of {{background}} noise in speech impacts {{the performance of}} automatic speech recognition (ASR). Adverse noisy environments are also known to induce so-called Lombard effect (LE), where speakers adjust their speech production {{in order to preserve}} intelligible communication. LE leads to further ASR degradation, often stronger than the one due to noise. Recently, a set of techniques reducing the impact of <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> LE have been introduced. In this paper, these algorithms are incorporated in a novel ASR setup and evaluated on neutral and Lombard speech corrupted by noise samples from a newly acquired car noise database. It is shown that the proposed scheme provides considerable performance improvement over the baseline and state-of-the-art approaches for all considered car <b>environments</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> levels, reaching 4 – 17 % absolute word error rate (WER) reduction...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{sub-band}} energy based end-ofutterance algorithm that is capable of detecting the time instant when the user has stopped speaking. The proposed algorithm finds the time instant at which many enough sub-band spectral energy trajectories fall and stay for a pre-defined fixed time below adaptive thresholds, i. e. a non-speech period is detected {{after the end of the}} utterance. With the proposed algorithm a practical speech recognition system can give timely feedback for the user, thereby making the behaviour of the speech recognition system more predictable and similar across different usage <b>environments</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> conditions. The proposed algorithm is shown to be more accurate <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> robust than the previously proposed approaches.

A number of studies have measured overall building condition and its connection to student performance; these have consistently shown that students attending schools in better condition outperform students in substandard buildings by several percentage points.

The proposed algorithm is able to supply stable the power according to operation mode. Furthermore, the SPMS manages electric load (sailing and communication equipment, TV, fan, etc.) and reduces operating times of the generator. In this paper, the proposed algorithm is realized and executed by using LabVIEW. As a result, the hour for operating the generator is minimized...|$|E

40|$|The non-Markovian {{nature of}} quantum systems {{recently}} turned to {{be a key}} subject for investigations on open quantum system dynamics.

Typically, in these studies, a structured reservoir is required to make non-Markovian dynamics emerge. Here, we investigate the dynamics of a qubit interacting with a bosonic bath and under the injection of a classical stochastic colored noise. A canonical Lindblad-like master equation for the system is derived by using the stochastic wave function formalism. Then, the non-Markovianity of the evolution is witnessed by using themeasure of Andersson, Cresser, Hall, and Li. We evaluate the measure for three different noises and study the interplay between <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> pump necessary to generate quantum non-Markovianity, as well as the energy balance of the system.

The quantum noise study of this system is particularly important in fault tolerant quantum computation where a very high fidelity is demanded. Here, we present a time evolution study of a two level system (TLS) interacting with a laser pulse and the electromagnetic vacuum based on the multimode Jaynes-Cummings model. We develop a diagrammatic formalism in which one can easily identify the coherent Rabi oscillation of the TLS and its relaxation from corresponding diagrams. In the small time limit (t≪ T_ 1), where the noise level is small but still an issue to fault tolerant quantum computing, this method gives a quantitative evaluation of the quantum noise of the TLS under an optical control with an arbitrary pulse shape. Furthermore, this approach can be naturally extended from the Markovian to the non-Markovian regime, resulting in dynamics different from that obtained in the optical Bloch analysis. All these calculations are done without any stochastic assumption. Comment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, it {{is known}} that not only {{thermodynamics}} elements influence swine productivity, but also the interaction with the aerial environment along with the noise level must be taken into account. This research studied the acoustic environment inside a pig nursery housing using average noise level distribution maps as a function of ambient temperature and relative humidity. The structural environment was divided in 2 m 2 cells. Noise level, air dry bulb temperature and relative humidity were recorded at piglet height in the centre of each cell. The results were mapped and the resulting nursery noise level was found to be 12. 49 dB. However, a positive correlation between thermal <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> level was not found. From the results, it was possible to estimate the room noise level due to presence of piglets at around 12. 49 dB.

One of the promising applications of renewable energy technology is the installation of wind turbine that has been identified as having potential for wide-scale application in Hong Kong. Locally, wind turbines are seldom installed in building developments. The barriers include limited installation space available, the heavily obstructed external <b>environments</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> vibration problems. The apposite places for the installation would be on the roof/rooftop of low-rise buildings located in low-density zones. Relevant wind data and output power generated on-site, which may be quite site-dependent, are essential for modelling and evaluating the wind energy conversion system. Long-term measured wind data are crucial to the study of wind energy potential. This work studies the wind data and micro-wind turbine used in dense urban terrain and low-density area. Technical data including wind speed and output power were analyzed and reported. To achieve 1 % of total building energy consumption generated from wind power, 17 micro-wind turbines are required to be installed in this institutional building located in low-density zone. Practical application: Wind turbine is one of the typical applications of renewable energy technology. However, micro-turbines are not popularly installed in building developments. This work analyses the measured wind data and the energy performance of micro-wind turbines installed in an institutional building. The findings provide the on-site measured data for design and assessment of micro-wind turbines installed in building blocks. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R

40|$|Retinal optic flow {{produced}} by self-motion {{is a function}} of both the linear translation of the observer and the rotation of viewpoint due to eye and head movements. A challenge in analyzing optic flow is identifying the translational and rotational components. Previous psychophysical work has found that extra-retinal input from eye movements helps the human visual system extract observer translation direction (heading) from optic flow with a rotational component. However, heading can also be accurately perceived in the absence of extra-retinal feedback when optic flow is sufficiently rich. We developed a Bayesian ideal observer model to account for such results. Given an input velocity field, the model computes the likelihoods of different combinations of heading and rotation, assuming a rigid <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> in velocity measurements. The likelihood function from optic flow is combined with a likelihood function representing extra-retinal information about eye movements, and the maximum of the resulting function is interpreted as the observer's perceived heading and rotation. With plausible noise assumptions, the model can simulate human heading perception across a range of conditions, including: simulated vs actual eye rotations, environments with various depth structures, and the presence of independently moving objects...|$|E

Differences between samplings within group were observed for all parameters considered. Only {{on the first day of}} machine milking, differences between groups occurred for total nitrogen, total protein and casein. Higher content of nitrogen fractions in the milk of EG was due to its lower milk production. In fact, daily production of nitrogen fractions was higher in CG than in EG. High variability for most parameters was observed during the first 5 days of machine milking in both groups.
