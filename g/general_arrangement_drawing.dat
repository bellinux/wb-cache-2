5000|$|The main {{factor that}} {{seemingly}} required the lower-drag [...] "coupled" [...] powerplant format for the He 177A, the diving attack mandate by the RLM, which Ernst Heinkel vehemently disagreed with since the original Greif's beginnings {{in the late}} 1930s, was rescinded by Göring himself some five months before the [...] "He 277's" [...] earliest-known February 1943 RLM approval date. The Heinkel firm started work on the He 177B as a straightforward, separately four-engined development of the 177A under the B-series designation at least {{as early as the}} late summer of 1943, when official Heinkel documents began referring to the He 177B, evidenced from an August 1943-dated, Heinkel factory-created <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> Typenblatt <b>drawing</b> of the He 177 V101 being labeled with the 8-177 RLM designation for the entire line of Greif airframes, and [...] "B-5" [...] elsewhere in the drawing's title block, as a fully RLM approved development of the original He 177 aircraft line, and not in any way directly related to the entirely separate He 277 advanced bomber design project, which by the summer of 1943 was considered to be Heinkel's Amerika Bomber aviation contract contender. The first development of the original He 177A to fly with four [...] "individual" [...] engines - using a quartet of He 219-style annular radiators to cool its likely-unitized Daimler-Benz DB 603 powerplants - was the second He 177B prototype, the He 177 V102, on December 20, 1943.|$|R

5000|$|Project: One of {{the most}} {{relevant}} developments of the new version is the General Arrangement module (FGA) for spaces and general ship arrangement definition, both in 2D or 3D environments, with all data stored in the FORAN database. The application allows generating the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>drawing</b> in an efficient way. On the other hand, the module for the probabilistic damage stability calculations (FSUBD) offers now the possibility to consider intermediate stages of flooding, according to SOLAS standard. The automatic assignment of spaces to subzones has also been improved.|$|E
5000|$|The main crew {{accommodation}} of the He 277 {{consisted of a}} heavily glazed and [...] "greenhouse"-framed clear view [...] "stepless" [...] cockpit, a common feature of many late-war German bomber airframes and new designs. Immediately aft of the heavily glazed nose, the cockpit glazing over the crew seating and pilot accommodation-enclosing upper section that was blended with the nose glazing's contours, protruding above the 277's forward dorsal fuselage decking level, with a rearward extension atop the fuselage that faired-in the forward upper dorsal turret's forward surface, extending rearwards to just forward of the inner engine cowls. The fuselage outlines themselves were deep, and almost slab-sided in cross-section, with its general sideview profile lines being strongly reminiscent of the smaller He 219 night fighter. This similarity with the 219 even extended to the depictions of the He 277's fuselage-mounted defensive armament emplacements as proposed by Heinkel, with one forward and two aft-facing [...] "steps" [...] along the slightly rounded dorsal and ventral surfaces of the fuselage, much like the smaller night fighter's earliest prototypes had, for the 277's manned aft dorsal and remote aft ventral turret defensive weapons mounts — the aft ventral emplacement being moved rearwards by roughly two meters, {{in comparison with the}} early He 219V-series prototypes, to accommodate the aft end of the He 277's bomb bay. The twin tail empennage assembly of the He 219 night fighter was also a likely inspiration for the 277's own similar unit, that added aerodynamic stability when compared to the 177A's single vertical tail — proven to be true from the first flights of the He 177B-series' four-engined He 177 V102 twin-tailed prototype from late December 1943 onwards — and made mounting a powered traversable defensive tail turret easier. Provision was shown on the Heinkel Typenblatt <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>drawing</b> for a quartet of ETC-family underwing hardpoint racks, two per wing panel {{on either side of the}} outboard pair of BMW 801 engines, potentially allowing external ordnance loads or drop tanks to extend the bomber's capabilities or range.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the same}} year, Rix Nicholas created {{one of her}} most {{extraordinary}} works, which would also be her largest canvas. Standing almost 2 m high, and 128 cm wide, Les fleurs dédaignées ('The despised flowers') is an [...] "unnerving" [...] and [...] "arresting" [...] portrait of a young woman in fashionable eighteenth-century clothing. Painted not with the artist's typical technique, but in a mannerist style, the subject faces the viewer yet is glancing away, her pose tense, expression unreadable, with a bunch of discarded flowers on the ground next to the hem of her enormous formal dress. Although portraying a young lady, the person chosen to sit was [...] "a Parisian professional model and a prostitute, apparently with a reputation for being moody and cantankerous". The pastiche created in this work is striking: a sixteenth-century artistic style, a composition comprising a seventeenth-century tapestry and an eighteenth-century dress, created by a twentieth-century artist. It certainly reflected the scope of Rix Nicholas's abilities and ambitions, and was painted with the specific intention of having it hung at the Paris Salon. When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927, it grabbed The Sydney Morning Herald critic's attention: For combination of grace, dramatic strength, and clearness in technique this picture would be difficult to surpass. There is nothing finicky about it; it tells its story with vivid directness. As a background to the figure Mrs. Rix Nicholas has set a piece of antique tapestry, so that the trees on either side lean in arch-wise over the head, the face and shoulders stand out clearly against an expanse of sky, and behind the body and limbs extends a countryside full of towers and rivers and trees. The quaint conventionality of this background accords exactly with the late eighteenth-century costume, all sprigged with roses and heliotrope; and the whole mass of detail harmonies sic perfectly with the type of the model's face. It is a cold, selfish face. The artist has brought out with revealing strokes an expression of vindictive malice which is for the moment resting there; and the hands, the fingers of one grasped tightly by the other, give a clear indication of nervous tension within. The treatment of flesh tones and the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement,</b> <b>drawing</b> attention gently but not too obtrusively to the columbines scattered on the polished floor—those are excellent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — For {{transportation}} of fluid, steam or air piping system is widely used. For installing the piping system pipes, flanges, piping supports, valves, piping fittings etc. are used, which are piping elements. They are manufactured as per Codes and standards. Equipment and piping layout design as per process requirement and available space. Above layout made {{out by the}} help of <b>General</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>drawing,</b> plant layout and P & ID. Then after flexibility providing to piping system, for compensate the different loads by the engineer. Stresses in pipe or piping systems are generated due to loads like expansion & contraction due to thermal load, seismic load, wind load, sustained load, reaction load etc. the stress analysis is done by help of software like CAESAR II. In this paper, a Flare pipe line is designed and 3 D modeling is prepared in PDMS software. Attention is focused for stress analysis by Caesar-II software. So that various stress values, forces and deflections are analyzed at each node to make the design at safe operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|A High Performance Power System (HIPPS) {{is being}} developed. This {{system is a}} coal-fired, {{combined}} cycle plant with indirect heating of gas turbine air. Foster Wheeler Development Corporation and a team consisting of Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation, Bechtel Corporation, University of Tennessee Space Institute and Westinghouse Electric Corporation are developing this system. In Phase 1 of the project, a conceptual design of a commercial plant was developed. Technical and economic analyses indicated that the plant would meet {{the goals of the}} project which include a 47 percent efficiency (HHV) and a 10 percent lower cost of electricity than an equivalent size PC plant. The concept uses a pyrolysis process to convert coal into fuel gas and char. The char is fired in a High Temperature Advanced Furnace (HITAF). The HITAF is a pulverized fuel-fired boiler/air heater where steam is generated and gas turbine air is indirectly heated. The fuel gas generated in the pyrolyzer is then used to heat the gas turbine air further before it enters the gas turbine. The project is currently in Phase 2 which includes engineering analysis, laboratory testing and pilot plant testing. Research and development is being done on the HIPPS systems that are not commercial or being developed on other projects. Pilot plant testing of the pyrolyzer subsystem and the char combustion subsystem are being done separately, and after each experimental program has been completed, a larger scale pyrolyzer will be tested at the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) in Wilsonville, AL. The facility is equipped with a gas turbine and a topping combustor, and as such, will provide an opportunity to evaluate integrated pyrolyzer and turbine operation. This report addresses the areas of technical progress for this quarter. A <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>drawing</b> of the char transfer system was forwarded to SCS for their review. Structural steel drawings were used to generate a three-dimensional model of the char transfer system including all pressure vessels and major piping components. Experimental testing at the Combustion and Environmental Test Facility continued during this quarter. Performance of the char burner, as benchmarked by flame stability and low NOx, has been exceptional. The burner was operated successfully both without natural gas and supplemental pulverized coal...|$|E
