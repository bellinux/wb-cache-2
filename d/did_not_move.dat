5|$|On October29, {{tropical}} storm watches and warnings were issued for {{portions of the}} Mexican coastline; however, these were canceled the following day due to the storm's rapid weakening.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E
5|$|Baroš joined Liverpool in 2002 in a {{transfer}} worth £3.2 million, although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> straight away due to delays in obtaining a work permit for him.

5|$|Robert Kirkman, {{the creator}} of the series of comic books of the same name, {{considered}} the idea of creating a television show based on the comic series, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> forward. Frank Darabont expressed interest in developing the series for television. In January 2010, AMC formally announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series adapted from The Walking Dead comic book. In the announcement, the executives stated that Darabont would serve as writer, director, and an executive producer alongside Gale Anne Hurd.|$|E

5|$|Soybean {{cultivation}}: The {{cultivation of}} soybeans {{began in the}} eastern half of northern China by 2000 BC, but is almost certainly much older. Liu et al. (1997) stated that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BC. By the 5th century, soybeans were being cultivated in much of eastern Asia, but the crop <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> beyond this region until well into the 20th century. Written records of the cultivation and use of the soybean in China date back {{at least as far as}} the Western Zhou Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The HV and the HVO {{completely}} {{pushed the}} VRS from Mostar, advancing further east along {{the slopes of}} the Velež Mountain and capturing high ground overlooking the city by 21 June. The ARBiH supported the eastward push from the city only in a secondary role. Even though the front lines <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> significantly to the east, the city of Mostar was relatively secure from future VRS attacks. The offensive is considered to have ended on 26 June, when the HVO captured the Merdžan Glava peak of the Velež Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E

5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, {{paving the way for}} the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal Campaign is also regarded by some as {{a turning point in the}} Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, {{the senator}} was still uncertain {{if he should}} take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted her husband to decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the Senate, that if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, {{he would have a}} lucrative legal career, but that if Nixon <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> up to the Vice Presidency, with Senator Knowland relatively young and in good health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California for many years to come. Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, the senator accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.|$|E

5|$|In October 2011 {{city and}} state {{officials}} announced an agreement in which the UN {{would be allowed to}} build a long-sought new office tower adjacent to the existing campus on the current Robert Moses Playground, which would be relocated. In exchange, the United Nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. The plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> forward.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{was asked}} to write a series called Riverboat, set in 1860s Mississippi. When he {{discovered}} that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued so much with them that he lost the job. He also considered moving to England around this time, as Sir Lew Grade of Associated Television wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company. Though he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move,</b> he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed $100,000, and became a producer {{for the first time}} on a summer replacement for the Tennessee Ernie Ford Show titled Wrangler.|$|E
5|$|The {{battered}} {{village of}} Charektar in Kelbajar {{had already seen}} extensive fighting in earlier weeks and was reinforced by both Azerbaijani and foreign fighters as the Armenian offensive commenced on March 27. However, instead of launching a simultaneous attack, only the units in Aghdaban and Narinclar moved out. Melkonian's armored column <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> out until later on and his units faced tenacious resistance on an embankment of entrenched defenses where his forces were forced to retreat. The troops in Vardenis began their assault shortly thereafter but their advance was slowed since they had to trek through the snowy passes of the Murov Mountains.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} Alien vs. Predator {{originated}} from the Aliens versus Predator comic book in 1989, and was hinted at when an Alien skull {{appeared in a}} trophy case aboard the Predator ship in Predator 2. Screenwriter Peter Briggs created the original spec screenplay in 1990–1991, {{which was based on}} the first comic series. In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although the company <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> forward with the project until 2002. The project was delayed chiefly because 20th Century Fox was working on Alien Resurrection. A draft penned by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox was rejected by producer John Davis, who hoped to give the film an original approach by setting it on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The film, {{produced}} through 20th Century Fox, is a co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom. Producer Simon Kinberg began {{developing the}} film after Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, which Drew Goddard adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct, {{but the film}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> forward. Scott replaced Goddard, and with Damon in place as the main character, production was approved. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately seventy days. Twenty sets were built on a sound stage in Budapest, Hungary, {{one of the largest}} in the world. Wadi Rum in Jordan was also used as a backdrop for filming.|$|E
5|$|The younger Del Valle and {{his family}} did not live on the ranch initially, instead {{settling}} in a house on what is now Olvera Street in Los Angeles. The Del Valle family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>move</b> back to Camulos, which he had expanded, until 1861. During this time, the ranch was overseen by José Antonio Salazar, Del Valle's majordomo. Although the rancho was associated with Ramona and Mexican California, the house was not constructed until after the United States acquired the territory and California was admitted as a state. The Del Valle family never lived there under Mexican rule.|$|E
