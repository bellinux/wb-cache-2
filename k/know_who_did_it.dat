5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{observed}} that religion plays an influential role in Marty's moral decisions. After Marty takes a forbidden bite from his sister Dara Lynn's chocolate Easter rabbit {{and refuses to}} own up, his mother is disappointed. She tells him: [...] "Dara Lynn don't know who ate the ear off her candy rabbit and I don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> but Jesus knows. And right this minute Jesus is looking down with the saddest eyes on the person who ate that chocolate." [...] Marty's very religious mother teaches him that people should not sin or they will be [...] "separated forever from God's love." ...|$|E
500|$|One filmed {{scene from}} [...] "The Head and the Hair" [...] was cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scene was {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season 1 DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) is visibly upset that someone added paper in the regular garbage and demands to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> as NBC recycles. Jack and Kenneth show up. Jack apologizes for throwing the paper in the regular garbage, which results in Pete telling him to go through the garbage by hand and [...] "fish out anything that's recyclable", as Jack is dressed as a page, in which he is participating on [...] "Bottoms Up" [...] day.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to a question in October 2015 about the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 shootdown and the U.S. intelligence community's [...] "confident" [...] assessment that pro-Russian separatists shot it down, Trump responded, [...] "Putin and Russia say they didn't <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> the other side said they did, no one really <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> probably Putin <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> Possibly it was Russia but they are totally denying it." [...] In the second presidential debate, Trump said {{that he did not know}} whether Russia is trying to influence the U.S. presidential election through hacking; he was however personally briefed on Russia's role in the hacks by U.S. officials. In the first presidential debate, Trump pondered that [...] "it could be Russia, but it could also be China"; he had at that time also been briefed about and discussed extensively with US intelligence officials the Russian government's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Edith, [...] "he has not confessed. But words {{drop from}} him which make us {{sure that he}} <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> I am certain that he saw <b>it</b> <b>done.</b> I don't {{mean to say that}} he saw the whole thing. The water, I suppose, was coming in all night." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kane {{interviewing}} for {{an article}} for Liberty (December 1938) told the interviewer that, [...] "Nobody <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> first. The credit always seemed {{to go to the}} inventor with the best publicity agent. The little man, too engrossed in his beloved work to advertise his exploits, was simply lost in the shuffle.|$|R
500|$|The {{first season}} of Veronica Mars {{features}} a different [...] "case of the week" [...] each episode, and the season-long mystery of Lilly Kane's murder. In addition {{to developing a}} separate mystery for each episode, the writers also had to provide clues {{that would lead to}} the murder's resolution in the season finale. The murder mystery plot was planned {{from the beginning of the}} season and the killer's identity remained the same throughout production. Thomas said that at the beginning of the season, [...] "I know the broad strokes, I <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> I know how it was done, I know the big arcs, but we're always filling in the details. Those are week to week. It's a week to week challenge in the writers room figuring out how much information we want to dole out to the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Santer {{explained}} that the killer [...] "may be revealed to the audience rather than the Square", preserving secrecy as the crew began filming episodes to be transmitted after the live broadcast. Actress Charlie Brooks, who plays Archie's former lover Janine Butcher, found the secrecy difficult to work with, explaining: [...] "In the episodes to be shown afterwards, you’re being told to look or speak a certain way, but not why." [...] Santer confirmed that the cast found the episode challenging, stating: [...] "They are as desperate to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> as the viewers", though believed they were all capable of coping with {{the pressure of the}} live episode. He {{explained that}} the cast typically film scenes in one take anyway, and observed that several EastEnders actors had formerly appeared in live broadcasts for other series. Cast members had just two dress rehearsals in advance of the live episode, and only one read-through of the entire episode.|$|E
500|$|Plans to {{broadcast}} {{the first ever}} live episode of EastEnders were announced by the BBC on 15 September 2009. Santer initially refrained from discussing the episode's plot, but commented that it would resolve a [...] "big storyline" [...] which would [...] "keep the audience (as well as the cast and crew) guessing until the very last moment." [...] Santer confirmed that Archie's killer would be revealed in the live episode, and that their identity would be kept secret until the night of broadcast, even from the cast member playing them. The EastEnders cast and crew had two weeks to rehearse the episode prior to its live transmission. The script was issued {{on the afternoon of}} 5 February 2010, written by Simon Ashdown. The first read-through took place on 8 February 2010, though producers held back the part of the script revealing Archie's true killer. Ten different possible endings were scripted and rehearsed, each showing one character confessing to the murder. The ten characters were Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), Max Branning (Jake Wood), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott), Peggy and Stacey. Santer reiterated that the actor playing the killer would only be told so thirty minutes before the broadcast. He explained that the killer [...] "may be revealed to the audience rather than the Square", preserving secrecy as the crew began filming episodes to be transmitted after the live broadcast. Brooks, who plays Archie's former lover Janine, found the secrecy difficult to work with, explaining: [...] "In the episodes to be shown afterwards, you're being told to look or speak a certain way, but not why." [...] Santer confirmed that the cast found the episode challenging, stating: [...] "They are as desperate to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> as the viewers." [...] Actor Charlie Clements, who played Bradley Branning, announced in November 2009 that he would be leaving the soap in 2010. It was later revealed that Bradley would make his last appearance in [...] "EastEnders Live", urged to flee Walford by his father Max and uncle Jack after becoming the prime suspect in the investigation into Archie's murder.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Kenneth Walton, {{the head}} of the FBI's Detroit office, told The Detroit News he knew what {{happened}} to Hoffa. “I’m comfortable I <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> but it’s never going to be prosecuted because… we would have to divulge informants, confidential sources.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, till lately; {{but when}} it did come back, I {{could not be sure}} what was {{recollection}} of fact, and what of my own fancy;' and he drew his brows together in painful effort. 'Did I <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> or did I only guess?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{a moment}} ago," [...] the Duchess {{reminded}} him, [...] "you spoke of being {{shot by the}} act of God. That, of course, {{was a form of}} speech.

6000|$|... "'Nobody <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> {{and nobody}} ever will find out,' thought Mr. Bob-cat, {{but all the}} time he knew that he had left his honor behind, and this made him more sneaky than ever. He never would meet any one face to face. You know that is {{something}} that one who has lost his honor never can <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> wasn't long before all his neighbors knew that he was without honor, and so would {{have nothing to do with}} him. They shunned him. He grew to be more and more of a sneak. And {{all the time he}} believed that no one knew what he had done or where he had left his honor.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{all over}} now, Jip, an' {{the only way}} to fix things is by keepin' mighty {{straight}} after this.

6000|$|... .... The {{stranger}} from Frisco {{with the}} claw-hammer coat, who put {{up at the}} Gag House last Thursday, and {{was looking for a}} chance to invest, was robbed the other night of three hundred ounces of clean dust.

6000|$|... "I {{think you}} <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> If you do, beg him to tell, Dan. It's {{so hard to}} have 'em all hate me for nothing. I don't think I can bear it much longer. If I had any place to go to, I'd run away, though I love Plumfield dearly; but I'm not brave and big like you, so I must stay and wait till some one shows them that I haven't lied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{was seven}} years old," [...] he chuckled. [...] "My mother was {{stewardess}} on the Flyin' Cloud. I was born at sea. I was boy when I was twelve, on the Herald o' the Morn, when she made around in ninety-nine days--half the crew in irons most o' the time, five men lost from aloft off the Horn, the points of our sheath-knives broken square off, knuckle-dusters an' belayin'-pins flyin', three men shot by the officers in one day, the second mate killed dead an' no one to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> an' drive! drive! drive! ninety-nine days from land to land, a run of seventeen thousand miles, an' east to west around Cape Stiff!" ...|$|R

[...] Now {{it was well}} known that old Mrs. Twentyman, Larry's mother, was fond of young turkeys, and that her poultry-yard had suffered. Larry, in his {{determination}} to be a gentleman, had always laughed at his mother's losses. But now to be accused in this way was terrible to his feelings! He made a rush as though to jump over the hedge, but Lord Rufford again intercepted him. [...] "I didn't think, Mr. Twentyman, that you'd care for what such a fellow as that might say." [...] By this time Lord Rufford was off his horse, and had taken hold of Larry.|$|R

That wouldn't be honest. I've got to think of some other way of saving those Ducks." ...|$|E
50|$|There are two aspects, one, {{giving to}} a large {{charitable}} organization obscures the beneficiary of a donation from the benefactor, the other is giving anonymously to obscure the benefactor both from the beneficiary and from everyone else. There are many reasons this is done. Anonymous charity {{has long been a}} widespread and durable moral precept of many ethical and religious systems, as well as being in practice a widespread human activity. A benefactor may not wish to establish any relationship with the beneficiary, particularly if the beneficiary is perceived as being unsavory. Benefactors may not wish to identify themselves as capable of giving. A benefactor may wish to improve the world, as long as no one <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> out of modesty, wishing to avoid publicity.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Vander Zalm filed {{a freedom}} of {{information}} request for government disclosure on chemtrails. The former premier further appeared in an online video by Press for Truth elaborating on his belief in the conspiracy theory, stating [...] "we don't <b>know</b> <b>who's</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> we don't <b>know</b> what it is they're putting into the sky, we think it's aluminium, barium, and strontium, but we don't know for sure. No one talks. Governments don't tell us and they have to know. They can't do that in the sky above us without the provincial and the federal government being aware." [...] Vander Zalm has furthermore expressed concerns over smart meters, stating that he believes they are intended as a secret means for governments to spy on people.|$|R
5000|$|Sophisticated robbers {{shoot the}} {{security}} guards at the Ute Casino, turn off the electricity and then steal the cash bagged and ready {{to be picked up}} for deposit to the bank. Cap Stoner is killed outright, while young Teddy Bye is severely wounded, but immediately suspected by the FBI as the [...] "inside man" [...] for the robbery. Chee returns from a long vacation in Alaska to be drawn into the investigation at the request of Officer Manuelito, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not believe Bye is guilty. Roy Gershwin draws Leaphorn into the investigation by saying that he <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> leaving a list of three names with Leaphorn. Why does he choose Leaphorn, and not the police or the FBI? The FBI announces that the perpetrators fled in an airplane stolen from Mr. Timms.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was another}} loon, a mother bird, on a {{different}} lake, whose two eggs had been carried off by a thieving muskrat; {{but she did not}} <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> for Musquash knows how to roll the eggs into water and carry them off, before eating, where the mother bird will not find the shells. She came swimming down to meet us the moment our canoe entered the lake; and what she seemed to cry was, [...] "Where are they? O where are they?" [...] She followed us across the lake, accusing us of robbery, and asking the same question over and over.|$|E

If they choose to institute an inquiry they must do so, but I shall take no steps in the matter, and it is unlikely in the extreme that we shall ever <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> I shall pay you all winning money, for {{that you did not}} win was no fault of yours.

5000|$|Historian James Loewen {{notes that}} lynching {{emphasized}} the helplessness of blacks: [...] "the {{defining characteristic of}} a lynching is that the murder takes place in public, so everyone <b>knows</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> yet the crime goes unpunished." [...] Ostensibly prompted by black attacks or threats to white women, scholars and journalists have shown that lynchings arose out of economic competition and desire by competing whites for social control. African American civil rights activist Ida B. Wells-Barnett conducted {{one of the first}} systematic studies of the subject. She found blacks were [...] "lynched for anything or nothing" [...] - for wife-beating, stealing hogs, being [...] "saucy to white people", sleeping with a consenting white woman - for being {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time. It was a system of social terrorism.|$|R
2500|$|On October 4, 1986, {{while walking}} along Park Avenue to his {{apartment}} in Manhattan, Rather was attacked and punched from behind by a man <b>who</b> demanded to <b>know</b> [...] "Kenneth, what is the frequency?" [...] while a second assailant chased and beat him. As the assailant pummeled and kicked Rather, he kept repeating the question. In describing the incident, Rather said, [...] "I got mugged. Who understands these things? I didn't and I don't now. I didn't {{make a lot of}} it at the time and I don't now. I wish I <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> and why, but I have no idea." [...] Until the crime was resolved years later, Rather's description of the bizarre crime led some to doubt the veracity of his account, although the doorman and building supervisor who rescued Rather fully confirmed his version of events.|$|R
