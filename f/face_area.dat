25|$|Not much {{is known}} about the exact {{function}} of these areas in the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. The areas activated during TOT may vary depending {{on the nature of the}} target word. For example, if the target word is a person's name, the fusiform <b>face</b> <b>area</b> will likely show activation as the rememberer processes the person's face. Problems like this make it difficult to determine what areas are specifically implicated in TOT states, and which are a byproduct of other cognitive functions. However, some inferences can be made about the roles of these structures based on theories of their functions derived from other studies of these structures, unrelated to TOT. It is hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex operate as a circuit to detect conflict, and may perform this role in detecting the conflict between the feeling of knowing the target word and the recall failure. The anterior cingulate cortex is also implicated in emotion and may show activation because of the emotional response to the tip of the tongue state. The posterior medial parietal cortex, bilateral lateral parietal cortex, and the bilateral superior prefrontal cortex are involved in retrieval and evaluation, and therefore may play a role in the metacognitive processes involved in the tip of the tongue phenomenon such as the evaluation of one's own knowledge and the probability of retrieval.|$|E

40|$|Face {{recognition}} mechanisms need {{to extract}} information from static and dynamic faces. It has been {{hypothesized that the}} analysis of dynamic face attributes is performed by different <b>face</b> <b>areas</b> than the analysis of static facial attributes. To date, {{there is no evidence}} for such a division of labor in macaque monkeys. We used fMRI to determine specializations of macaque <b>face</b> <b>areas</b> for motion. <b>Face</b> <b>areas</b> in the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus responded to general object motion; <b>face</b> <b>areas</b> outside of the superior temporal sulcus fundus responded more to facial motion than general object motion. Thus, the macaque face-processing system exhibits regional specialization for facial motion. Human <b>face</b> <b>areas,</b> processing the same stimuli, exhibited specializations for facial motion as well. Yet the spatial patterns of facial motion selectivity differed across species, suggesting that facial dynamics are analyzed differently in humans and macaques...|$|R

2500|$|Functional imaging {{has also}} been used to study the {{detection}} of mental state information in Heider-Simmel-esque animations of moving geometric shapes, which typical humans automatically perceive as social interactions laden with intention and emotion. [...] Three studies found remarkably similar patterns of activation during the perception of such animations versus a random or deterministic motion control: mPFC, pSTS, fusiform <b>face</b> <b>area</b> (FFA), and amygdala were selectively engaged during the ToM condition. [...] Another study presented subjects with an animation of two dots moving with a parameterized degree of intentionality (quantifying {{the extent to which}} the dots chased each other), and found that pSTS activation correlated with this parameter.|$|E
2500|$|Pareidolia {{can cause}} people to {{interpret}} random images, or patterns of light and shadow, as faces. A 2009 magnetoencephalography study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early (165 ms) activation of the fusiform <b>face</b> <b>area</b> {{at a time and}} location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a slightly faster time (130 ms) that is seen for images of real faces. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon. [...] A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fMRI responses for real objects. These results indicate that the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects.|$|E

[...] A common (yet false) {{belief is that}} blood drawn automatically warrants a double-minor. There is no such rule; this is, however, the precedent {{that has been in}} place for years. [...] Referees may use their discretion to assess only a minor penalty even though blood was drawn. [...] They may also assess a double-minor when blood is not drawn, if they believe that the player was sufficiently injured or that the offending player used excessively reckless action with his stick. [...] If a player, while in the action of [...] "following through" [...] on a shot, strikes an opposing player in the head or <b>face</b> <b>area</b> with his stick, high sticking is not called unless the referee can determine that the player taking the shot was deliberately aiming to strike the opposing player. A penalty is also not called when the puck is hit by a high stick, but play will be stopped and the ensuing faceoff will take place at a spot which gives the non-offending team an advantage. Also, a goal that is scored by means of hitting the puck with a stick above the height of the crossbar will not be counted unless it is done by a player of the defending team. (Note that the requirements for high-sticking the puck for purposes of allowing/disallowing goal is different from the other forms of high-sticking.) ...|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{obstacles}} that individuals with ASD face in terms of facial processing may be derived from abnormalities in the fusiform <b>face</b> <b>area</b> and amygdala, which {{have been shown to}} be important in face perception as discussed above. Typically, the fusiform <b>face</b> <b>area</b> in individuals with ASD has reduced volume compared to normally developed persons. This volume reduction has been attributed to deviant amygdala activity that does not flag faces as emotionally salient and thus decreases activation levels of the fusiform <b>face</b> <b>area.</b> This hypoactivity in the fusiform <b>face</b> <b>area</b> has been found in several studies.|$|E

40|$|Attention modifies neural tuning for {{low-level}} features, but it {{is unclear}} how attention influences tuning for complex stimuli. We investigated this question in humans using fMRI and face stimuli. Participants were shown six faces (F 1 –F 6) along a morph continuum, and selectivity was quantified by constructing tuning curves for individual voxels. Face-selective voxels exhibited greater responses to their preferred face than to nonpreferred faces, particularly in posterior <b>face</b> <b>areas.</b> Anterior <b>face</b> <b>areas</b> instead displayed tuning for face categories: voxels in these areas preferred either the first (F 1 –F 3) or second (F 4 –F 6) half of the morph continuum. Next, we examined the effects of attention on voxel tuning by having subjects direct attention to one of the superim-posed images of F 1 and F 6. We found that attention selectively enhanced responses in voxels preferring the attended face. Together, our results demonstrate that single voxels carry information about individual faces and that the nature of this informa-tion varies across cortical <b>face</b> <b>areas.</b> Additionally, we found that attention selectively enhances these representations. Our findings suggest that attention may act via a unitary principle of selective enhancement of responses to both simple and complex stimuli across multiple stages of the visual hierarchy...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{parts of the}} brain that play a role in face perception. Rossion, Hanseeuw, and Dricot used BOLD fMRI mapping to {{identify}} activation in the brain when subjects viewed both cars and faces. The majority of BOLD fMRI studies use blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast to determine which areas of the brain are activated by various cognitive functions. They found that the occipital <b>face</b> <b>area,</b> located in the occipital lobe, the fusiform <b>face</b> <b>area,</b> the superior temporal sulcus, the amygdala, and the anterior/inferior cortex of the temporal lobe, all played roles in contrasting the faces from the cars, with the initial face perception beginning in the area and occipital face areas. This entire region links to form a network that acts to distinguish faces. The processing of faces in the brain is known as a [...] "sum of parts" [...] perception. However, the individual parts of the face must be processed first in order to put all of the pieces together. In early processing, the occipital <b>face</b> <b>area</b> contributes to face perception by recognizing the eyes, nose, and mouth as individual pieces. Furthermore, Arcurio, Gold, and James used BOLD fMRI mapping to determine the patterns of activation in the brain when parts of the face were presented in combination and when they were presented singly. The occipital <b>face</b> <b>area</b> is activated by the visual perception of single features of the face, for example, the nose and mouth, and preferred combination of two-eyes over other combinations. This research supports that the occipital <b>face</b> <b>area</b> recognizes the parts of the face at the early stages of recognition. On the contrary, the fusiform <b>face</b> <b>area</b> shows no preference for single features, because the fusiform <b>face</b> <b>area</b> is responsible for [...] "holistic/configural" [...] information, meaning that it puts all of the processed pieces of the face together in later processing. This theory is supported by the work of Gold et al. who found that regardless of the orientation of a face, subjects were impacted by the configuration of the individual facial features. Subjects were also impacted by the coding of the relationships between those features. This shows that processing is done by a summation of the parts in the later stages of recognition.|$|E
