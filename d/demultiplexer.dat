25|$|A DWDM {{terminal}} <b>demultiplexer.</b> At {{the remote}} site, the terminal de-multiplexer consisting of an optical de-multiplexer {{and one or}} more wavelength-converting transponders separates the multi-wavelength optical signal back into individual data signals and outputs them on separate fibers for client-layer systems (such as SONET/SDH). Originally, this de-multiplexing was performed entirely passively, except for some telemetry, as most SONET systems can receive 1,550nm signals. However, {{in order to allow}} for transmission to remote client-layer systems (and to allow for digital domain signal integrity determination) such de-multiplexed signals are usually sent to O/E/O output transponders prior to being relayed to their client-layer systems. Often, the functionality of output transponder has been integrated into that of input transponder, so that most commercial systems have transponders that support bi-directional interfaces on both their 1,550nm (i.e., internal) side, and external (i.e., client-facing) side. Transponders in some systems supporting 40GHz nominal operation may also perform forward error correction (FEC) via digital wrapper technology, as described in the ITU-T G.709 standard.|$|E
2500|$|Digital protocols, such as DMX512 {{have proved}} to be the answer since the late 80s.

[...] This converted the digital signal into a collection of 0 to +10 V or 0 to -10 V signals which could be connected to the individual analogue control circuits.|$|E

2500|$|A WDM {{system uses}} a {{multiplexer}} at the transmitter {{to join the}} several signals together, and a <b>demultiplexer</b> at the receiver to split them apart. With the right type of fiber {{it is possible to}} have a device that does both simultaneously, and can function as an optical add-drop multiplexer. [...] The optical filtering devices used have conventionally been etalons (stable solid-state single-frequency Fabry–Pérot interferometers in the form of thin-film-coated optical glass). As there are three different WDM types, whereof one is called [...] "WDM", the notation [...] "xWDM" [...] is normally used when discussing the technology as such.|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} OADM {{consists of}} three stages: an optical <b>demultiplexer,</b> an optical multiplexer, and between them a method of reconfiguring the paths between the <b>demultiplexer,</b> the multiplexer {{and a set of}} ports for adding and dropping signals. The <b>demultiplexer</b> separates wavelengths in an input fiber onto ports. The reconfiguration can be achieved by a fiber patch panel or by optical switches which direct the wavelengths to the multiplexer or to drop ports. The multiplexer multiplexes the wavelength channels that are to continue on from <b>demultiplexer</b> ports with those from the add ports, onto a single output fiber.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, a <b>demultiplexer</b> (or demux) is {{a device}} taking a single input signal and {{selecting}} {{one of many}} data-output-lines, which {{is connected to the}} single input. A multiplexer is often used with a complementary <b>demultiplexer</b> on the receiving end.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We propose two {{orthogonal}} {{approaches to}} logarithmic cyclic shifter design. The first method, called fanout splitting, replaces multiplexers {{in a conventional}} design with <b>demultiplexers</b> which have two fanouts driving the shifting and non-shifting paths separately. The use of <b>demultiplexers</b> has a two-fold effect; it cuts the accumulated wire load on the critical path from O(N log 2 (N)) to O(N), and reduces the switching probabilities on the inter-stage long wires from 1 / 4 to 3 / 16. We then perform cell order optimization to further improve the delay, and formulate it as an integer linear programming problem. For the 64 -bit case, the two approaches together reduce the total delay by 67. 1 % and dynamic power consumption by 17. 6 %, respectively...|$|R
