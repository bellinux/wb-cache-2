25|$|The Maxwell–Cremona {{correspondence}} {{has been}} used to obtain polyhedral realizations of polyhedral graphs by combining it with a planar graph <b>drawing</b> <b>method</b> of W. T. Tutte, the Tutte embedding. Tutte's method begins by fixing one face of a polyhedral graph into convex position in the plane. This face will become the outer face of a drawing of a graph. The method continues by setting up a system of linear equations in the vertex coordinates, according to which each remaining vertex should be placed at the average of its neighbors. Then as Tutte showed, this system of equations will have a unique solution in which each face of the graph is drawn as a convex polygon. The result is almost an equilibrium stress: if one assigns weight one to each interior edge, then each interior vertex of the drawing is in equilibrium. However, it is not always possible to assign negative numbers to the exterior edges so that they, too, are in equilibrium.|$|E

Its <b>drawing</b> <b>methods</b> {{lay the foundation for}} drawing other ruled surfaces, such as cones, with dual space <b>drawing</b> <b>methods.</b> In this paper, new methods are introduced for drawing cylinders. The underlying principle of these methods is the application and extension (variation) of the dual De Casteljau algorithm [11]. Based on this, a comprehensive study is carried out for the creation of cylinders. The dual De Casteljau algorithm is adjusted by adding boundary conditions to draw cylinders with smooth closed trajectories. The dual space <b>drawing</b> <b>methods</b> of the circular cylinder with boundary conditions and segment construction are also discussed. Rena Din...|$|R

2500|$|Desktop Window Manager {{is the new}} {{windowing}} system which handles the drawing of all content to the screen. Instead of windows drawing directly to the video card's memory buffers, contents are instead rendered to back-buffers (technically Direct3D surfaces), which are then arranged in the appropriate Z-order, then displayed to the user. This <b>drawing</b> <b>method</b> uses significantly more video memory than the traditional window-drawing method used in previous versions of Windows, which only required enough memory to contain the composite of all currently visible windows at any given time. With the entire contents of windows being stored in video memory, a user can move windows around the screen smoothly, without having [...] "tearing" [...] artifacts be visible while the operating system asks applications to redraw the newly visible parts of their windows.

By analysing features provided by many graphics systems, we identify object-oriented mechanisms best suited to implementing them, thus identifying mechanisms best suited to building graphics systems and applications.

We claim the design is more general, simpler and more flexible than existing graphics systems since it uses fewer, simpler mechanisms to provide greater functionality. 1 Why Isn't Graphics Object-Oriented? One of the first examples used in teaching object-oriented programming is a MacDraw-like drawing program.

40|$|Graph {{drawing is}} an {{important}} area of information visualization which concerns itself with the visualization of relational data structures. Relational data like networks, hierarchies, or database schemas can be modelled by graphs and represented visually using graph drawing algorithms. Most existing graph drawing algorithms do not consider the size of nodes when creating a drawing. In most real world applications, however, nodes contain information which has to be displayed and nodes thus need a specific area to display this information. The required area can vary significantly between di#erent nodes in the same graph. In this paper we present an algorithm for the layering step of hierarchical graph <b>drawing</b> <b>methods</b> that is {{able to take the}} sizes of the nodes into account. It further allows the user to choose between compact drawings with many temporary (dummy) nodes and less compact drawings with fewer dummy nodes.
