Irradiation is an approved treatment to control quarantine insect pests in 17 fruits and 7 vegetables for export from Hawaii to the US mainland. The commercial X-ray irradiation facility, Hawaii Pride LLC, has been shipping tropical fruits and vegetables to the US mainland using irradiation since 2000. Hawaiian purple sweet potato is the highest volume product with annual exports of more than 12 million lbs (5, 500 tonnes). The advent of generic radiation treatments for tephritid fruit flies (150 Gy) and other insects (400 Gy) has accelerated commodity <b>export</b> <b>approvals</b> and facilitated adoption by foreign trading partners. Current impediments to wider adoption include the labeling requirement, the 1 kGy limit for fresh horticultural products, and non-acceptance of phytosanitary irradiation in Japan and the European Union. USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has restricted the use of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for irradiated fresh fruits exported to the US due to possible increased radiotolerance in the target insects.

The plaintiffs in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing {{too little to}} enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports. Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and NCGA-recommended <b>export</b> <b>approvals,</b> but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, {{and at the time}} was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports. For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US. That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection. China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.

5000|$|The usual {{sense in}} which this term is (loosely) used, is in {{reference}} to a particular attack, brute force key search [...] - [...] especially in explanations for newcomers to the field. Indeed, with this attack (always assuming keys to have been randomly chosen), there is a continuum of resistance depending {{on the length of}} the key used. But even so there are two major problems: many algorithms allow use of different length keys at different times, and any algorithm can forgo use of the full key length possible. Thus, Blowfish and RC5 are block cipher algorithms whose design specifically allowed for several key lengths, and who cannot therefore be said to have any particular strength with respect to brute force key search. Furthermore, US export regulations restrict key length for exportable cryptographic products and in several cases in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., famously in the case of Lotus Notes' <b>export</b> <b>approval)</b> only partial keys were used, decreasing 'strength' against brute force attack for those (export) versions. More or less the same thing happened outside the US as well, as for example in the case of more than one of the cryptographic algorithms in the GSM cellular telephone standard.|$|E

40|$|In 2005, the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) {{compiled}} an Ecological Assessment Report for the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery (CRFFF). The {{report was}} {{submitted to the}} Australian Government Department of the Environment and Water Resources (DEW) for assessment against the 'Guidelines for the Ecologically Sustainable Management of Fisheries', developed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In November 2005, DEW accredited the CRFFF as an approved Wildlife Trade Operation (WTO) allowing export of native species harvested in the fishery. Continued <b>export</b> <b>approval</b> in the CRFFF is contingent upon the fishery meeting a number of recommendations that DEW applied {{as part of its}} accreditation. These recommendations cover a range of issues relevant to the sustainable management of the fishery, including sustainable harvest levels, bycatch, ecological impacts, compliance, research, monitoring and assessment. This document addresses the specific recommendation for DPI&F "to undertake a risk assessment to identify other coral reef fin fish most at risk from the fishery. " Other coral reef fin fish species (OS) include all species defined as coral reef fin fish in the Fisheries Regulation 1995 (Appendix 1), other than coral trout (Plectropomus and Variola spp.) and red-throat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus). Given the requirement to address DEW's recommendations, and the Queensland Government's commitment to manage fisheries sustainably, DPI&F facilitated a two-day stakeholder meeting in January 2007 to conduct an assessment to identify the ecological risks to OS in the CRFFF. This document rationalises and provides recommendations on the risk ratings determined through the workshop and further stakeholder consultation. The results of this risk assessment will feed into future assessments and reviews of the fishery as recommended by DEW. The relevant recommendations are highlighted in Appendix 2...|$|E
40|$|In 1992, Australian Commonwealth, State, Territory {{and local}} governments {{committed}} to an ecologically sustainable development (ESD) approach {{to the use of}} natural resources. Fisheries resources were (see Green et al. 1991) and still are (see Fletcher et al. 2003) considered to be one of many specific natural resource foci that fall squarely under the ESD umbrella. Queensland's commitment to managing fishery resources under ESD principles is embedded in the Fisheries Act 1994 : 1) The main purpose of the Act is to provide for the use, conservation and enhancement of the community's fisheries resources and fish habitats in a way that seeks to - a) apply and balance the principles of ecologically sustainable development; and b) promote ecologically sustainable development. 2) In balancing the principles, each principle is to be given the relative emphasis appropriate in the circumstances. To prompt continued progress towards ESD in Australian fisheries, the Commonwealth Government introduced the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act 1999) and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection Act) Act 2001. Following these legislative changes, in order to obtain <b>export</b> <b>approval,</b> fisheries management agencies must demonstrate (through ecological assessment submissions) that their fishery management regimes comply with the objectives of ecologically sustainable development. The Australian Government Department of the Environment and Heritage (DEH) is the Commonwealth Government department currently auditing the fishery management agency submissions (unless states have in place accredited alternative audit processes). All submissions must be based on and satisfy the Australian Governments 'Guidelines for the Ecologically Sustainable Management of Fisheries', which are publicly available at [URL] The guidelines cover a number of individual objectives broadly relating to impacts to target species; bycatch and byproduct species; endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species; ecologically threatened communities; and the marine ecosystem generally. This document represents the Queensland Government's ecological assessment submission to DEH for the Queensland Coral Fishery (referred to throughout as the QCF).

40|$|Background: The rise of genomic {{studies in}} Africa – not least due to {{projects}} funded under H 3 Africa – {{is associated with}} the development of a small number of biorepositories across Africa. For the ultimate success of these biorepositories, the creation of cell lines including those from selected H 3 Africa samples would be beneficial. In this paper, we map ethical challenges in the creation of cell lines. Discussion: The first challenge we identified relates to the moral status of cells living in culture. There is no doubt that cells in culture are alive, and the question is how this characteristic is relevant to ethical decision-making. The second challenge relates to the fact that cells in culture are a source of cell products and mitochondrial DNA. In combination with other technologies, cells in culture could also be used to grow human tissue. Whilst on the one hand, this feature increases the potential utility of the sample and promotes science, on the other it also enables further scientific work that may not have been specifically consented to or approved. The third challenge relates to ownership over samples, particularly in cases where cell lines are created by a biobank, and in a different country than where samples were collected. Relevant questions here concern the <b>export</b> of samples, <b>approval</b> of secondary use and the acceptability of commercialisation. A fourth challenge relates to perceptions of blood and bodily integrity, which may be particularly relevant for African research participants from certain cultures or backgrounds. Finally, we discuss challenges around informed consent and ethical review. Summary: In this paper, we sought to map the myriad of ethical challenges that need to be considered prior to making cell line creation a reality in the H 3 Africa project. Considering the relative novelty of this practice in Africa, such challenges will need to be considered, discussed and potentially be resolved before cell line creation in Africa becomes financially feasible and sustainable. We suggest that discussions need to be undertaken between stakeholders internationally, considering the international character of the H 3 Africa project. We also map out avenues for empirical research...|$|R

BMC Medical Ethics, 15 (1) : 60, doi: 10. 1186 / 1472 - 6939 - 15 - 60. The original publication is available at [URL] The rise of genomic studies in Africa - not least due to projects funded under H 3 Africa - is associated with the development of a small number of biorepositories across Africa. For the ultimate success of these biorepositories, the creation of cell lines including those from selected H 3 Africa samples would be beneficial. In this paper, we map ethical challenges {{in the creation of}} cell lines. Discussion:	The first challenge we identified relates to the moral status of cells living in culture. There is no doubt that cells in culture are alive, and the question is how this characteristic is relevant to ethical decision-making. The second challenge relates to the fact that cells in culture are a source of cell products and mitochondrial DNA. In combination with other technologies, cells in culture could also be used to grow human tissue. Whilst on the one hand, this feature increases the potential utility of the sample and promotes science, on the other it also enables further scientific work that may not have been specifically consented to or approved.
