500|$|In his writing, Villani {{states that}} he {{considers}} Florence to be the [...] "daughter and creation of Rome," [...] but asserts Rome's decline and Florence's rise as a great city compelled him to lay out a detailed history of the city. To emphasize the imperial greatness of Florentine history, Villani also asserted {{that the city was}} given a second founding when it was rebuilt by Charlemagne (r. 800–814 as Holy Roman Emperor)—which was absent from the Chronica de origine civitatis. Historian J. K. Hyde writes that the idea of Florence being the daughter of Rome would have given the Florentines a sense of destiny, while the second founding by Charlemagne provided historical context for alliance with France, which Hyde calls [...] "the touchstone of Guelphism". Villani's reasoning for Rome's decline was the schisms of the Church and rebellion against the papal institution, while the ascension of OttoI, Holy Roman Emperor (r. 962–973) allowed for the conditions of Florence's rise against enemies of papal authority, such as Florentine-conquered Fiesole. Villani was certain that the Republic of Florence had experienced a great setback on its path to glory with the defeat of the Guelphs by the Ghibellines at the Battle of Montaperti in 1260. Despite this, Villani states that the paramount prosperity and tranquility of the city by 1293 was evidenced by the fact that its gates were no longer locked at night and that indirect taxes such as the gate fee (common in times of war) were not levied. Historian Felicity Ratté states that the validity of this comment should be heavily scrutinized considering the Florence statutes of 1290 that <b>designated</b> <b>employment</b> for individuals in charge of locking the city gates. Villani also contradicts himself by writing of a night attack on Florence in 1323 which clearly demonstrates the fact that the gates were locked at night.|$|E

40|$|The {{employment}} alternatives {{available to}} disabled workers in various countries {{throughout the world}} were compared. Using a six-level model in which level 1 <b>designated</b> no <b>employment</b> and level 6 indicated competitive employment with no accommodation or shelter, the researchers examined the following employment practices: competitive employment (involving quota systems, government grants and tax credits to employers, and/or government subsidies); fully integrated employment (including supported employment and affirmative action); semi-integrated employment; and segregated employment. The use and relative effectiveness {{of each of these}} strategies both in the United States and abroad were compared. It was concluded that despite the well-documented failure of sheltered workshops in helping disabled workers become "job ready, " they have been widely used in the United States as transitional places of employment.

5000|$|Interest groups, {{such as the}} STORM Coalition, are {{concerned}} that the proposed Highway 400 employment corridor is counterintuitive to the “complete communities” concept of the Places to Grow Act and Growth Plan. They have criticized the transition of greenfield areas in the County of Simcoe for newly <b>designated</b> <b>employment</b> purposes given that thousands of hectares of land {{in other parts of the}} GGH are already designated for employment uses. Opponents of this development have noted that economic corridor provisions in the amended Growth Plan have been introduced prior to undertaking any Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is required under the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan. An EIA is needed to determine what effects development of the Highway 400 employment corridor might have on the fragile ecology of the Lake Simcoe watershed, given the scale of new infrastructure required to support this project. [...] The increased burden of phosphorus and water runoff into Lake Simcoe implied by the introduction of the Simcoe Sub-area Amendment is another prominent concern among environmental commentators. Studies have shown that development targets in the amended Growth Plan could result in an additional 14,328 kg of phosphorus entering Lake Simcoe every year.|$|E

50|$|The EB-5 Regional Center Program was {{established}} by the United States Congress to stimulate economic growth through foreign investment and is overseen by USCIS.

Through the EB-5 Program, a person and their immediate family can obtain permanent residency in the United States by investing $500,000 into a Regional Center project located in a Targeted Employment Area which creates a minimum of 10 jobs for American workers.

40|$|Since 1994 the Treuhandanstalt has {{publicly}} put out for tender employment projects {{in accordance with}} § 249 h of the Employment Promotion Act and has allocated them on a competitive basis. As the allocation of these projects to private companies has always been called for but only rarely put into practice, the Treuhandanstalt therefore acts as a forerunner. The effects of this allocation process are {{the main focus of}} this article. With reference to the current discussion of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} active labour market policy, the requirements which have to be fulfilled for publicly supported employment and which provide the basis for the evaluation of the Treuhandanstalt's process of invitation to tender are named. The effects on the following requirements are discussed individually: efficiency and refunding, interlinking of labour market policy and regional structural policy and creation of transitions into the primary labour market, both on an individual and a project level. This analysis includes previously unpublished details from the Treuhandanstalt on their tendering process as well as results of interviews with experts. The results can be summarised as follows: - The inclusion of competition has a clearly positive effect on efficiency and the refunding rate of the projects. Decisive for this are economies and the reduction of displacement and substitution effects. - The process reinforces the interlinking of labour market policy and regional structural policy in the first place through procedural integration of central parties. - On the individual level, transitions into regular employment could be promoted amongst other things through the effects of acquaintance and reputation. From the data available, however, this effect does not seem to differ greatly from projects which were not put out to tender. - On the project level, possibilities of transition into the primary labour market, for example through setting up small businesses, are judged with scepticism. Although the tendering process does in principle create favourable conditions, the possibilities of setting up small businesses appear to be limited, as the market potential in restoration, demolition and dismantling work is largely exhausted. The concluding chapter is devoted to the question of the applicability of the Treuhand model for a larger sphere of labour promotion projects. § 249 <b>designates</b> an <b>employment</b> subsidy for work in the fields of environment, social services and youth assistance.
