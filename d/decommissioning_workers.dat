30|$|Based on {{the created}} 4 D BIM model relationships, {{resources}} including material, equipment, and human {{were added to}} related schedules. In addition, resource cost information such as human work rate and material unit price was also included. With the added resources and cost information, 5 D BIM model relationships for the OOGP decommissioning options were developed. When adding cost to schedules, two ways can usually be used. One is to assign estimated cost directly to a related task, {{the other is to}} assign resources like equipment, material, and labor to a related activity. Before resource assignment, the work rate and unit price of each resource are defined. For example, during preparation stage of OOGP <b>decommissioning,</b> <b>workers</b> are needed to empty and clean all the pipes and tanks on the platform. Therefore, labor named cleaner is defined. Then work rate (person per day) and unit price (dollars per person per day) are added to the cleaner. Finally, according to resource plan, cleaners are assigned, for instance, as pipe cleaning.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to develop {{chemical}} protective clothing for use by DOE decontamination and <b>decommissioning</b> <b>workers</b> that is sufficiently water vapor permeable to keep the workers cool, thereby enhancing their productivity. This report describes the results of Phase II of a two-phase project to complete development of the novel permselective material and to test protective clothing made from the fabric. In Phase I a novel material incorporating a nonporous hydrophilic polyvinylacohol (PVA) layer, which is water vapor permeable but relatively impermeable to organic vapors, was developed. The results of the Phase I tests showed that the chemical resistance of the MTR material is {{comparable to that of}} Saranex/Tyvek materials, and that the comfort properties are closer to those of Tyvek (as measured in terms of CLO and permeability). Chemical resistance was measured using permeation tests against liquid dichloromethane. Comfort properties were ascertained by measuring the water vapor transmission of the material and by sweating manikin tests on whole protective suits. In addition, a cost/benefit analysis demonstrated that use of MTR's material technology could result in significant improvements in work productivity and cost savings if protective clothing items made from the new material were used more than once. In Phase II, MTR undertook a program to optimize the performance and production engineering for the new material technology. A partnership was formed with Kimberly-Clark Corporation to assist with a detailed evaluation of the MTR technology, and MTR used the services of Mr. Jeff Stull, President of the consulting firm International Personnel Protection, Inc., who conducted a detailed economic and application analysis for the developed fabric. The protective fabric manufacturing steps were simplified significantly, resulting in a 30 % reduction in manufacturing costs and eliminating the necessity for capital investment in production equipment. Protective suits were prepared in collaboration with Kimberly-Clark Corporation and heat stress testing with human test subjects was carried out by the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE). The tests confirmed that the MTR protective fabric is significantly more comfortable than non-breathable materials. A cost analysis was developed from the properties of the optimized protective fabric and the results of the of the IUOE field study to determine the potential for the MTR material technology within the chemical protective clothing market. A detailed assessment of the specific chemical protective clothing applications for which the material can be used and its competitiveness with existing material technology, based both on expected performance and material/end item costs, was prepared. Three specific market opportunities identified for the novel protective fabric are: (1) liquid splash protective clothing for hazardous waste site operations, (2) liquid splash protective clothing for emergency response, and (3) Class 3 NFPA 1994 -compliant protective clothing for civilian use during chemical terrorism incidents...|$|E
40|$|It is time {{to reconsider}} {{entombment}} of nuclear reactors and other facilities. <b>Decommissioning</b> <b>worker</b> exposure and safety, transportation, cost, potential loss of LLW disposal capacity, and need for strong technical basis are shared drivers for the renewed interest in developing the entombment D&D option. Entombment relies on retarding the release of radionuclides {{for a very long}} period, a number of factors must be considered prior to selection and implementation of entombment. A technical basis for addressing and evaluating these factors with associated stakeholder acceptance of the technology is needed before entombment becomes an accepted D&D option...|$|R
40|$|Models to be {{used for}} {{analyses}} of economic risks from events which occur during U. S. LWR plant operation are developed in this study. The models include capabilities to estimate both onsite and offsite costs of LWR events ranging from routine plant forced outages to severe core-melt accidents resulting in large releases of radioactive material to the environment. The models have been developed for potential use by both the nuclear power industry and regulatory agencies in cost/benefit analyses for decision-making purposes. The new onsite cost models estimate societal losses from power production cost increases, new plant capital costs, plant decontamination costs, and plant repair costs which may be incurred after LWR operational events. Early <b>decommissioning</b> costs, plant <b>worker</b> health impact costs, electric utilit...|$|R
40|$|Deactivation and Decommissioning Focus Area is {{responsible}} for developing, demonstrating, and facilitating the deployment of improved and innovative technologies for decommissioning the Department of Energy’s surplus facilities. The ultimate success of the Office of Science and Technology {{is tied to the}} deployment of superior technologies, and their associated cost reduction of the Department of Energy’s deactivation and <b>decommissioning</b> projects, improved <b>worker</b> safety, reduction in radiation dose to workers, and acceleration of project schedules. Through December 1998, the Deactivation and Decommissioning Focus Area deployed thirty-two improved/innovative technologies in more than eighty instances by Department of Energy site contractors, nuclear utilities, and commercial decommissioning firms (see Table I). The number of innovative/improved technology deployments and deployment locations is expected to grow as 1) additional demonstration results are provided to the end users, 2) end users observe other Department of Energy deactivation and decommissioning projects using the innovative/improved technologies, and (3) as successfully demonstrated technologies are deployed as part of th...|$|R
40|$|<b>Workers</b> <b>decommissioning</b> the Fukushima-Daiichi {{nuclear power}} plant damaged from the Great East Japan Earthquake and {{resulting}} tsunami {{are at risk of}} injury with possible contamination from radioactive heavy atoms including actinides, such as plutonium. We propose a new methodology for on-site and rapid evaluation of heavy-atom contamination in wounds using a portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) device. In the present study, stable lead was used as the model contaminant substitute for radioactive heavy atoms. First, the wound model was developed by placing a liquid blood phantom on an epoxy resin wound phantom contaminated with lead. Next, the correlation between the concentration of contaminant and the XRF peak intensity was formulated considering the thickness of blood exiting the wound. Methods to determine the minimum detection limit (MDL) of contaminants at any maximal equivalent dose to the wound by XRF measurement were also established. For example, in this system, at a maximal equivalent dose of 16. 5 mSv to the wound and blood thickness of 0. 5 mm, the MDL value for lead was 1. 2 ppm (3. 1 nmol). The radioactivity of 239 Pu corresponding to 3. 1 nmol is 1. 7 kBq, which is lower than the radioactivity of 239 Pu contaminating puncture wounds in previous severe accidents. In conclusion, the established methodology could be beneficial for future development of a method to evaluate plutonium contamination in wounds. Highlights: Methodology for evaluation of heavy-atom contamination in a wound was established. A portable X-ray fluorescence device enables on-site, rapid and direct evaluation. This method is expected to be used for evaluation o...|$|R
