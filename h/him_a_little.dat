5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E

25|$|The {{company was}} founded by a {{partnership}} between Michael Marks, a Polish Jew from Słonim (Marks {{was born into a}} Polish-Jewish family, a Polish refugee living in the Russian Empire, now in Belarus), and Thomas Spencer, a cashier from the English market town of Skipton in North Yorkshire. On his arrival in England, Marks worked for a company in Leeds, called Barran, which employed refugees (see Sir John Barran, 1st Baronet). In 1884 he met Isaac Jowitt Dewhirst while looking for work. Dewhirst lent Marks £5 which he used to establish his Penny Bazaar on Kirkgate Market, in Leeds. Dewhirst also taught <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> English. Dewhirst's cashier was Tom Spencer, a bookkeeper, whose second wife, Agnes, helped improve Marks' English. In 1894, when Marks acquired a permanent stall in Leeds' covered market, he invited Spencer to become his partner.|$|E
25|$|In prison, Bunyan had {{a copy of}} the Bible and of John Foxe's Book of Martyrs, as well as writing materials. He {{also had}} at times the company of other preachers who had been imprisoned. It was in Bedford Gaol that he wrote Grace Abounding and started work on The Pilgrim's Progress, as well as penning several tracts that may have brought <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> money. In 1671, while still in prison, he was chosen as pastor of the Bedford Meeting. By that time there was a mood of {{increasing}} religious toleration in the country and in March 1672 the king issued a declaration of indulgence which suspended penal laws against nonconformists. Thousands of nonconformists were released from prison, amongst them Bunyan and five of his fellow inmates of Bedford Gaol. Bunyan was freed in May 1672 and immediately obtained a licence to preach under the declaration of indulgence.|$|E
25|$|Zimmer Comes to the Front With an Indoor GameCharley Zimmer, the good-natured and gentlemanly catcher of the Cleveland Club has invented and {{patented}} {{an indoor}} game of base ball {{that ought to}} make <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fortune. It promises {{to become one of}} the greatest toys of the age. A regular game can be played. The ball is pitched from an ingenious device and goes straight over the plate. If a hit isn't made or the ball struck at all the 'catcher' gets it. All the 'players' are in position, and there are regular catches in the outfield and pick-ups in the infield. The bat is a curious contrivance, and it takes good judgment to operate it. A fast or slow ball can be pitched, and the batter is liable to be 'fooled' by changes of pace. Nothing like it was ever seen before in toy games. The invention is to be shown in Hudson's window after Thanksgiving, and will surely attract great attention.|$|E

25|$|Fisher was {{considered}} {{by those who}} met {{her to be a}} strong, witty businesswoman who was not afraid to speak her mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech {{at a meeting of the}} National Negro Business League. In her speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about her life growing up. She said she was a 57 year old woman who was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and that for her to be successful she had to believe in herself and no one else. Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16 room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out her recipes freely, but noted that she couldn't teach the common sense needed to cook her food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately 100,000 dollars. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia.|$|E

500|$|According to Approaching The Possible by Jo Storm, {{the season}} 2 episode [...] "1969" [...] showed that Hammond climbed the {{military}} ladder [...] "by being shrewd, intelligent, and [...] {{possessed of a}} long vision" [...] despite being a [...] "spouted bottom-line pragmatis". Don S. Davis described General Hammond as initially [...] "hard-nosed and straight-ahead", and later as seemingly [...] "stern and straight-laced". Recognizing the need to fulfill the role as a General, Davis still tried to [...] "bring a few levels to him that show some understanding and that make <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more likeable." [...] The welfare {{of the men and}} women under Hammond's command is paramount in the general's mind. Besides knowing that people may not return from his sanctioned missions, General Hammond has to decide when to forgo rescue attempts to not put more lives in danger, even if he [...] "always does so reluctantly and with regret". As shown in [...] "Chain Reaction", Hammond would rather leave the military quietly than risk the careers and lives of his staff and his family, [...] "which must go against all his blustery Texas background".|$|E
500|$|Although not {{exceptional}} in size at , , Taylor was {{a physical}} fullback. He sought contact on every play, accordant with his philosophy: [...] "Football is a contact sport. You've {{got to make}} them respect you. You've got to punish tacklers. You've got to deal out more misery than the tacklers deal out to you." [...] He was widely acknowledged by his peers {{as one of the}} toughest and meanest players in the NFL. Former quarterback Bobby Layne listed him as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke said, [...] "In 15 years with the pros, he's one of the toughest men I ever played against—and we were on the same team. He'd hurt you when you tackled him." [...] He was difficult to tackle, as he fought for every extra yard. Giants linebacker Sam Huff proposed a rule change specifically in Taylor's case; per NFL rules, piling-on after a play invokes an unnecessary roughness penalty, but Huff argued, [...] "You gotta pile on <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to keep him down." ...|$|E
500|$|Naming the {{characters}} after {{members of his}} own family, Homer was named after Groening's father Homer Groening, who himself had been named after ancient Greek poet Homer. Very little else of Homer's character was based on him, and to prove that the meaning behind Homer's name was not significant, Groening later named his own son Homer. According to Groening, [...] "Homer originated with my goal to both amuse my real father, and just annoy <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit. My father was an athletic, creative, intelligent filmmaker and writer, and the only thing he had in common with Homer was a love of donuts." [...] Although Groening has stated in several interviews that Homer was named after his father, he also claimed in several 1990 interviews that a character in the 1939 Nathanael West novel The Day of the Locust was the inspiration for naming Homer. Homer's middle initial [...] "J", which stands for [...] "Jay", is a [...] "tribute" [...] to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, who got their middle initial from Jay Ward.|$|E

500|$|After Mutimir's {{death in}} 890 or 891, {{the rule of}} Serbia was {{inherited}} by Mutimir's three sons Pribislav, Bran and Stefan (called the Mutimirović), headed by the eldest son, Pribislav. However, Pribislav's reign only lasted less than a year, ending when his cousin Petar returned to Serbia from Croatia and won a battle against Pribislav. Petar acquired the Serbian throne in ca. 892. Mutimir's three sons then left Serbia for Croatia where they sought refuge and help. In ca. 894, Bran tried to oust Petar with Croatian help but was unsuccessful; he was captured and blinded (according to political mutilation culture). In ca. 896, Klonimir left Bulgaria and marched an army into Serbia, entering the Serbian city of Destinikon ( [...] , also spelled Destinika and [...] ), {{with the intent of}} seizing the throne. This city's exact location is undetermined, as De Administrando Imperio only lists it as one of eight fortified cities (καστρα) of baptized Serbia (not counting those of the maritime Serbian principalities). Klonimir was likely supported by the Bulgarians, which shows that Petar had bad relations with Bulgaria. However, Klonimir was unsuccessful, and the powerful Petar slew <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> while afterwards, Petar was recognized as the ruler of Serbia by Bulgarian Tsar Symeon, resulting in a twenty-year peace and alliance.|$|E
500|$|Wilde spent mid-1897 with Robert Ross in {{the seaside}} village of Berneval-le-Grand in {{northern}} France, where he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol, narrating {{the execution of}} Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity; it moves from an objective story-telling to symbolic identification with the prisoners as a whole. No attempt is made to assess the justice of the laws which convicted them, but rather the poem highlights the brutalisation of the punishment that all convicts share. Wilde juxtaposes the executed man and himself with the line [...] "Yet each man kills the thing he loves". Wilde too was separated from his wife and sons. He adopted the proletarian ballad form, and the author was credited as [...] "C33", Wilde's cell number in Reading Gaol. He suggested that it be published in Reynolds' Magazine, [...] "because it circulates widely among the criminal classes– to which I now belong– for once I will be read by my peers– a new experience for me". It was an immediate roaring commercial success, going through seven editions {{in less than two}} years, only after which [...] "" [...] was added to the title page, though many in literary circles had known Wilde to be the author.

I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E
