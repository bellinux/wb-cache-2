5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a <b>gear</b> <b>stick,</b> and the car crashes and spins if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E
25|$|The gearbox was a four-speed manual transmission, an {{advanced}} feature on an inexpensive {{car at the}} time. The <b>gear</b> <b>stick</b> came horizontally out of the dashboard with the handle curved upwards. It had a strange shift pattern: the first {{was back on the}} left, the second and third were inline, and the fourth (or the S) could be engaged only by turning the lever to the right from the third. Reverse was opposite first. The idea was to put the most used gears opposite each other— for parking, first and reverse; for normal driving, second and third. This layout was adopted from the H-van's three-speed gearbox.|$|E
25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} rear, mounted {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a <b>gear</b> <b>stick</b> between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the front seats. The filler neck sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The spare wheel was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectable.|$|E

50|$|The {{gear box}} is mounted under the frame {{in front of}} the rear axle. The gears are changed through two <b>gear</b> <b>sticks</b> {{in front of the}} driver. The truck has 3 gears forward and reverse. It was able to reach 20 km/h. The fuel {{consumption}} was 4 kg of petrol per 100 km and it was able to climb 12° angle.|$|R
50|$|Mitsuoka {{wanted to}} make the MC-1 easy to take care of. There is even an owner's manual on Mitsuoka's website. The {{interior}} is simple, a large speedometer with some sensors, <b>gear</b> shifting <b>stick,</b> steering wheel and a seat. The body is mostly plastic. The 'doors' are fabric. For 2004, the MC-1 was slightly redesigned by adding a slit under the headlights.|$|R
500|$|The DB9 Carbon Black, as {{its name}} suggests, has a black paint finish and {{matching}} interior. This includes a black center console and interior door handles on the inside, and black grills, a black tailpipe, and black [...] 10-spoke wheels on the outside. The interior also has numerous add-ons to make the car more sporty, including silver stitching for the leather and a polished glass <b>gear</b> <b>stick.</b> The exhaust has been modified to create a different sound {{to add to the}} sporty feel. The Carbon Black is only available as a six-speed semi-automatic.|$|E
500|$|A Full Scale arcade {{version was}} {{released}} alongside the standard arcade version in 1993. This version {{was designed to}} give the player a more realistic driving experience. Players (a passenger could sit in the car next to the driver) sat inside an adapted red Eunos Roadster, the Japanese right-hand-drive version of the Mazda MX-5 Miata, and controlled the same car on-screen. The game was played {{in front of a}} [...] wide, front-projected triple screen (which benefited from dimmed ambient lighting), with the wheel, <b>gear</b> <b>stick</b> and pedals functioning as the controls. The ignition key was used to start, the speed and RPM gauges were functional, and fans blew wind on the player from inside the air vents. Speakers concealed inside the car provided realistic engine and tyre sounds; overhead speakers provided surround music. The P.C.B. was located under the bonnet of the car.|$|E
500|$|Gran Trak 10 is a single-player racing {{video game}} in which the player drives a race car along a race track, shown from above. The player {{controls}} the car with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and <b>gear</b> <b>stick,</b> as in a real car. The gear shifting requires the player to shift between reverse, first, second, and third gears as needed, but the pedals are digital controls rather than analog, so the player cannot control his speed by applying differing levels of pressure. The steering wheel turns the car only while it is being turned, rather than having a neutral [...] "straight" [...] position. Braking does not stop the car instantly and turning while braking will cause the car to skid. The course is defined on the screen by walls of white dots representing pylons, which if hit stop the car and spin it. There is only a single track layout. The track contains one black path representing an oil slick, which prevents the player's car from turning. At {{the top of the}} screen are two numbers; the number on the right is the remaining time in the game, starting at 78 and counting down by 2s, while the number on the left is the number of checkpoints the player has passed, and counts up by 2s.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, Hurst {{transmission}} shifters {{and other products}} had become legendary in auto racing, particularly in drag racing, and among custom car makers. Many automobile enthusiasts replaced flimsy factory shifters (and steering column shifters, as well) with Hurst floor shifters to obtain better control of gear selection, particularly for competitive driving. As automotive historian Mike Mueller noted, [...] "If you didn't have a Hurst shifter in your supercar, you were a mild-mannered loser." [...] General Motors' official policy {{up to that time}} had prohibited the use of the names of outside vendors on GM products. Pontiac Division manager Elliot [...] "Pete" [...] Estes convinced the corporation that having the Hurst name on its cars' shifters would be an effective sales tool. Various Pontiac models had already been equipped with Hurst shifters from the factory, but the Hurst name did not actually appear on Pontiac shifters until 1965. Hurst's shifters were so good that U.S. automakers were forced to offer Hurst branded <b>gear</b> <b>sticks</b> on their muscle car models, although at the time they preferred manufacturing their own parts rather than outsourcing.|$|R
50|$|Totally new, narrower, {{body and}} cab. The inline engine {{permitted}} a much narrower bonnet than the Meteorite's wide vee. The gearbox was similar {{but the main}} <b>stick</b> (<b>gear</b> lever) gave six speeds (5 plus overdrive) with a single stick for all winch and PTO control functions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stick at it," [...] Gerald cried, {{rising in}} his place a little. [...] "Look, there's only one post lower than the last one that we passed. They get higher all the time, ahead. You can almost see {{the road in front}} there. Now, in with your <b>gear</b> again, and <b>stick</b> at it." ...|$|R
500|$|There {{were some}} improvised scenes. These {{included}} {{a scene in}} the beginning of the episode where Alan and Joanna are in a middle of a field and the scene begins with a low-angle shot. Later, when Alan is [...] "humping" [...] Joanna, the scene suddenly becomes a crane shot. This is because the crew at the time had a crane camera after they had finished filming the final scenes in series 2 where Alan, Joanna and Martin are teetering over the edge of a cliff in the stolen camper van. The camper van scenes were the hardest to shoot, especially the scene where the van explodes, as this had to be done in one take. Another problem was the smell of the van, which Pippa Haywood said, [...] "smelt of old dogs." [...] The van also suffered other problems such as bits of the steering wheel and <b>gear</b> <b>stick</b> coming off. Julian Rhind-Tutt commented that the scene where Alan and Boyce talk together for the last time was one of the most moving scenes in the whole of Green Wing. The wedding was shot at Hall of Bayham Abbey in Kent, where the crew had difficulty filming due to bad weather. The show also features a guest appearance from Jeremy Sheffield near the end of the episode as Sue's new boyfriend.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanically, the Mk III C's {{transmission}} {{was a major}} improvement {{from the}} older car. [...] A new 6-speed gearbox built by X-Trac {{was part of the}} package, replacing the previous 5-speed. [...] This gearbox was further enhanced by the option of a pneumatically actuated gear change system developed by Megaline which was activated by paddles behind the steering wheel, rather than by a traditional <b>gear</b> <b>stick.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Series 2 (1981–1983) had {{integrated}} plastic-covered bumpers, wide black rubber {{body side}} moldings, wraparound taillights and updated engine control components. While marginally longer overall, {{the new model}} was [...] lighter in federalized trim. The four-speed manual option was dropped for 1981 as well, while the gas tank grew larger and the dashboard was redesigned, including a shorter <b>gear</b> <b>stick</b> mounted closer to the driver. In 1983, the 130mph speedometer returned for the RX-7. The GSL package provided optional four-wheel disc brakes, front ventilated (Australian model) and clutch-type rear limited slip differential (LSD). Known as the [...] "FB" [...] in North America after the US Department of Transportation mandated 17 digit Vehicle Identification Number changeover. For various other markets worldwide, the 1981–1985 RX-7 retained the 'SA22C' VIN prefix. In the UK, the 1978–1980 series 1 cars carried the SA code on the vehicle VIN but all later cars (1981–1983 series 2 & 1984–1985 series 3) carried the FB code and these first generation RX7's are known as the [...] "FB". The license-plate surround looks much like Buhrer's [...] "Styling Impressions." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>sticks</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{found between the}} front seats of the vehicle, either on the center console (sometimes even quite far up on the dashboard), the transmission tunnel (errorenously called a console shifter when the floor shifter mechanism is bolted to the transmission tunnel with the center console {{to cover up the}} shifter assembly when used with a rear or front wheel drive vehicle), or directly on the floor. Some vehicles have a column shift where the lever is mounted on the steering column—this arrangement was almost standard practice in American vehicles from about 1939 until relatively recently. It had the added benefit of allowing for a full width bench-type front seat (though some models with bucket seating as an option include it). It has since fallen out of favor, although it can still be found widely on North American-market pick-up trucks, vans, emergency vehicles (both law enforcement and EMS - the column shifter is retained where a floor shifter is unfeasible due to mounting the mobile data terminal and 2-way radio), and [...] "full-size" [...] US sedans such as the Ford Crown Victoria. A dashboard mounted shift was common on certain French models such as the Citroën 2CV and Renault 4. Both the Bentley Mark VI and the Riley Pathfinder had their gear lever {{to the right of the}} right-hand drive driver's seat, alongside the driver's door, where it was not unknown for British cars to also have their handbrake. (Left-hand drive models received a column shift.) ...|$|R
50|$|All {{players are}} {{required}} to have their Para ice hockey equipment follow the standard that has been set by HECC (the Hockey Equipment Certification Council Inc.), including their sledges, sticks, helmet, skates (if applicable), and other protective <b>gear.</b> The <b>sticks</b> for Para ice hockey players have a blade curved at one end {{in a manner similar}} to regular ice hockey, and generally six to eight metal teeth at the opposite end of the blade for maneuvering and propulsion. Movement is achieved by using the metal teeth as a means to grip the ice and push oneself forward. The metal teeth cannot be too pointy nor protrude farther than 1 cm beyond the stick, to prevent damage to the ice or injury of other players.|$|R
5000|$|The {{probable}} {{cause for the}} crash of Flight 365 {{was determined to be}} [...] "The pilot slowed the aircraft and it stalled while the pilot prepared to be number one on landing as advised by Phuket approach control. It appears that he was worrying and not sure whether he could make number one landing because the pilot of number two aircraft in sequence gave warning that the number one aircraft ahead was above him and could not descend passing through his level. The pilot added power and raised the <b>gear</b> after <b>stick</b> shaker activated but didn't execute a recovery before hitting the sea." [...] In addition to pilot error, the air traffic controller was blamed for failing to keep Flight 365 and the Dragonair 737 adequately separated.|$|R

50|$|The {{spontaneous}} powwow lasted three days, wherein {{an isolated}} incident between police officers and Wampanoag people occurred. Complaints of excessive noise from the singing and drumming were made, and officers dispersed tribal members in response. However, on the last day, when about a dozen men were singing and drumming around the fire, another noise complaint was registered and every available Mashpee officer was called to Twelve Acres. They showed up in riot <b>gear</b> with <b>sticks,</b> dogs, helmets, and shields and began to arrest the men. The campsite was destroyed, Natives were manhandled, cursed at with racial epithets, beat, cuffed and stuffed {{into the back of}} the police cruiser. The last man to be put {{into the back of the}} car had the door slammed on his leg several times, followed by all of the men being maced before the doors were shut. In total, nine men were arrested on charges of disturbing the peace, and some had charges of battery and disorderly conduct.|$|R
5000|$|Later, on January 16, 2015, Front Row {{announced}} that Whitt {{would join the}} team, in the No. 35 Ford, the third full-time team car. [...] Speed <b>Stick</b> <b>GEAR,</b> who had sponsored him for four races at Swan and seven at BK, followed him to Front Row in a ten-race deal, along with Rinnai Tankless Water Heaters for an undisclosed number of races. Whitt finished the year 31st in points {{for the second straight}} year, while improving his career best finish to 13th in the GEICO 500 at Talladega.

50|$|On January 7, 2014, Swan Racing {{announced}} that their new second full-time {{team would be}} numbered 26. Former Red Bull Racing and JR Motorsports driver Cole Whitt was hired to drive the 26, after running seven late season races for the team in 2013. New investor Anthony Marlowe was listed as the owner. The car was sponsored by Speed <b>Stick</b> <b>GEAR</b> in the 2014 Daytona 500, and several other early-season races. Whitt qualified {{for each of the}} first eight races, and recorded a single top-20 (at Auto Club Speedway).

40|$|A flight {{evaluation}} {{was made}} of the mechanical hydraulic flight control system and the electrohydraulic stability augmentation system installed in the HL- 10 lifting body research vehicle. Flight tests performed in the speed range from landing to a Mach number of 1. 86 and the altitude range from 697 meters (2300 feet) to 27, 550 meters (90, 300 feet) were supplemented by ground tests to identify and correct structural resonance and limit-cycle problems. Severe limit-cycle and control sensitivity problems were encountered during the first flight. Stability augmentation system structural resonance electronic filters were modified to correct the limit-cycle problem. Several changes were made to control <b>stick</b> <b>gearing</b> to solve the control sensitivity problem. Satisfactory controllability was achieved by using a nonlinear system. A limit-cycle problem due to hydraulic fluid contamination was encountered during the first powered flight, but the problem did not recur after preflight operations were improved...|$|R
40|$|A {{simulator}} {{evaluation of}} a remotely piloted research vehicle was conducted at NASA Ames Research Center's Dryden Flight Research Facility to determine the utility of a visual display when studying the influence {{of changes in the}} lateral <b>stick</b> <b>gearing</b> gains during landing approaches. The test vehicle used in this study was a highly maneuverable aircraft technology (HiMAT) aircraft, which is a 0. 44 scale version of an envisioned small, single seat fighter airplane. Handling qualities ratings and comments obtained from pilots using a simulated visual display of a runway scene and a simulated instrument landing system (ILS) display were compared with the results of actual flight tests. The visual display was found to provide an adequate representation of the test vehicle in a visual landing approach, and it improved the roll response cues provided to the pilot. The handling qualities ratings and comments for flight and simulation visual landing approaches correlated well. The ILS simulation results showed reduced correlation compared with the flight results for ILS approaches. Handling qualities criteria for remotely piloted research vehicles are also discussed in this paper...|$|R
