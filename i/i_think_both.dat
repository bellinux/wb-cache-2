500|$|However, in a {{subsequent}} interview with the Los Angeles Times that appeared a month later, Eastwood suggested {{that he would not}} necessarily vote for Trump and instead appeared agnostic regarding the 2016 presidential election. The Times Rebecca Keegan asked, [...] "So when you say you’re not {{on either side of the}} aisle, does that mean you’re not voting for Trump?" [...] Eastwood replied, [...] "I’m totally an enigma. I’m just astounded. I hate to pick up the paper. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> individuals and both parties backing the individuals have a certain degree of insanity." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the early}} stages of filming, stars Connelly and Bowie found it {{difficult}} to interact naturally with the puppets they shared most of their scenes with. Bowie told Movieline [...] "I had some initial problems working with Hoggle and the rest because, for one thing, what they say doesn't come from their mouths, but {{from the side of the}} set, or from behind you." [...] Connelly remarked, [...] "it was a bit strange , but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> Dave [...] and I got over that and just took it as a challenge to work with these puppets. And by the end of the film, it wasn't a challenge anymore. They were there, and they were their characters." ...|$|E
500|$|MDOT has {{indicated}} {{that it has not}} requested jurisdiction, but rather if it assumed control of the route, the community would need to support a through-route. Several proposals have arisen, including creating a [...] "spur" [...] from US41/M-28 through the east end of Ishpeming to meet CR480 west of Negaunee. This spur would pass through recently reopened former mining [...] "caving grounds", and to the south of the Mather A & B Mine complex. According to Gerry Corkin, Marquette County Board Chairman, [...] "the land that was purchased by Ishpeming and Negaunee, the mining company land, this has the potential to help in the development of that if this is compatible. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> cities will be interested in taking a look at what the land uses are and where this [...] would push through." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2005, it was {{revealed}} Elliott {{had been working on}} a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong direction. You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{noted that}} in order for Thai {{corruption}} to be addressed, the Thai people must first confront certain biases and beliefs they hold due to their cultural and religious background. He asked of the Thai people [...] "Can Thailand automatically become a land of free speech without the draconian lese majeste law and the Computer Crimes Act, when many people are intolerant of anything negative said about the monarchy, and about themselves, and won't hesitate to file a libel charge, advocate censorship or take the matter into their own hands violently? Will Thailand become a land of free speech and criticism if many people in the media who engage in criticism of others on a daily basis can't take criticism or accusations themselves?" [...] "As people continue to fight and call for democracy, equality and free speech, it's imperative they examine such values at a personal level and not be mistaken in thinking that the only struggle is an external one. Sometimes, I fear that it might be easier {{to get rid of the}} external and visible tyranny than the tyranny that exists invisibly deeply within us. And to make it more complicated, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> external and internal tyranny are intertwined." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, Mrs. Bloomfield, I {{must leave}} you to judge {{of that for}} yourself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> them <b>both</b> {{agreeable}} men; but {{there is so much}} caprice in a woman's tastes, that I decline thinking for others." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ling's {{examination}} {{of these two}} [...] "paths" [...] led her to conclude, [...] "I'm not sure which path is more difficult, but while they couldn't be more different, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they're <b>both</b> traveling in the same direction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not my secret. But I'll {{see what}} I can do, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> you and Jon {{ought to be}} told. And now I'll say good-bye." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But I'm saying it. See here, Billie Sheldon, {{my uncle}} owns this team and Pat Donahue is manager. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they <b>both</b> like me a little. Now I don't {{want to see}} you lose your place. Perhaps----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we {{are pretty}} well {{agreed on the}} point that she had best go home.

6000|$|... "Dodo!" [...] said Celia, in {{her quiet}} staccato; then kissed her sister, whose arms encircled her, {{and said no}} more. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they <b>both</b> cried a little in a furtive manner, while Dorothea ran down-stairs to greet her uncle.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is just as}} well {{it should}} not be so here,' {{continued}} Mr. Audley, 'for nonsense is not always a cure, and the talk would be mischievous; besides, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> are unconscious.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] cried Mrs. Jarvis, as {{they drove}} from the door, [...] "this may be good breeding, but, for my part, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> the doctor and Mrs. Ives behaved very rudely, with the crying and sobbing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Little Jane's last {{thought had}} been to wish with all her might, that [...] "God would bless the dear, kind girl up there, and give her all she asked."

6000|$|... "I should scarce believe, fair mistress," [...] said Roland, indignantly, [...] "that {{the vane}} of your favour turned {{only to a}} Catholic wind, {{considering}} that it points so plainly to George Douglas, who, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is <b>both</b> kingsman and Protestant." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I’ve never {{considered}} {{myself to be}} a runaway success at anything I’ve done, including parenthood," [...] Pollard wrote in 2005.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> these notions false; {{and yet the}} last, {{which has}} the show of respect to Providence, is the worst; for it supposes Providence to be indigent and empty, {{as if it had}} not {{wherewith}} to furnish all the creatures it had made, but was fain to be parsimonious in its gifts, and distribute them by piece-meal, for fear of being exhausted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get thyself {{washed and}} shaved, then," [...] said Tressilian; [...] "reform thy dress {{as well as}} thou canst, and fling away these {{grotesque}} trappings; and, so thou wilt be secret and faithful, thou shalt follow me for a short time, till thy pranks here are forgotten. Thou hast, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>both</b> address and courage, and I have matter to do that may require both." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it seems}} to me very often, in such cases, as if it were to escape the excitement. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you're <b>both</b> keyed up pretty sharply by nature, Miss Bessie," [...] said the doctor, with the {{personal}} kindness he felt for the girl, and the pity softening his scientific spirit.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a risk. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{we shall}} <b>both</b> need courage, {{but if you}} are willing I need not hesitate. I will try to make a good farmer's wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We aren't very {{agreeable}} together, are we? Upon my word <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you'd better <b>both</b> go." [...] Silverbridge immediately got up {{from his}} chair; upon which Dolly also moved.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, {{that man}} is not my son,' {{answered}} Heathcliff, pushing me aside. 'But I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your nurse is in a hurry, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> you {{and she would be}} the better for a little rest.

6000|$|... 3. I sang of {{the dancing}} stars, [...] 25 I sang of the daedal Earth, And of Heaven--and the giant wars, And Love, and Death, and Birth,-- And then I changed my pipings,-- Singing how down the vale of Maenalus [...] 30 I pursued a maiden and clasped a reed. Gods and men, {{we are all}} deluded thus! It breaks in our bosom and then we bleed: All wept, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> ye now would, If envy or age had not frozen your blood, [...] 35 At the sorrow of my sweet pipings.|$|E
60|$|In the {{excitement}} of that final day <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>both</b> Eve and I completely forgot all about Mr. Bundercombe. It was not until {{we were on our}} way back from a motor tour through the outlying parts of the district that we were forcibly reminded of his existence. Quite close to Little Bildborough, the only absolutely hostile part of my constituency, we came upon what was really an extraordinary sight. Our chauffeur of his own accord drew up by the side of the road. Eve and I rose in our places.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; no. I {{wish the}} title could have passed over my head, Silverbridge, {{and gone to}} you at once. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we <b>both</b> should have been suited better.

60|$|ANSWER. One may, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> say, <b>Both</b> his {{laughs and}} cries, May well be guess'd at by his wat'ry eyes.

2500|$|Subsequently, Hansard {{indicated}} that they were no longer a romantic couple. He said, [...] "Of course, we fell into each other's arms.

We are just really good friends." ...|$|R
