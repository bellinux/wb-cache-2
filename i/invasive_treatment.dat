40|$|AbstractMinimally <b>invasive</b> {{percutaneous}} <b>treatment</b> robots {{have become}} a popular area in medical robotics. Minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>treatments</b> {{are an important part}} of modern surgery; however percutaneous treatments are a difficult procedure for surgeons. They must carry out a procedure that has limited visibility, tool maneuverability and where the target and tissue surrounding it move because of the tool. Robot technology can overcome those limitations and increase the success of minimally <b>invasive</b> percutaneous <b>treatment.</b> In this paper we will present a review of the current state-of-the-art in robotic insertion needle for minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>treatments,</b> focusing on the limitations and challenges still open for their use in clinical application...|$|R

30|$|Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} is {{a common}} severe and chronic facial neuralgia which requires accurate diagnosis and effective therapy. With typical clinical symptoms, normal neurological signs, normal CT and MRI findings, the patient was diagnosed as classic trigeminal neuralgia. As the patient was drug resistant, some <b>invasive</b> <b>treatments</b> were considered. Peripheral branch neurolysis was chosen for its minimal invasiveness, convenience, low risk and not affecting further <b>invasive</b> <b>treatments.</b> According to the anatomic data and the diagnostic test results, infratrochlear, supratrochlear and lacrimal nerve were responsible, therefore, an unusual combination of infratrochlear, supratrochlear, and lacrimal radiofrequency thermocoagulation was implemented for this patient.|$|R
25|$|Active {{surveillance}} is {{observation and}} regular monitoring without <b>invasive</b> <b>treatment.</b> In {{the context of}} prostate disease this usually comprises regular PSA blood tests and prostate biopsies. Active surveillance is often used when an early stage, slow-growing prostate cancer is suspected. However, watchful waiting may also be suggested when the risks of surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy outweigh the possible benefits. Other treatments can be started if symptoms develop, or if {{there are signs that}} the cancer growth is accelerating (e.g., rapidly rising PSA, increase in Gleason score on repeat biopsy, etc.).|$|E
25|$|To {{demands for}} {{detailed}} revelation {{of his personal}} positions on abortion, Calderón responded that he voted for life. Calderón's administration sought to maintain moderate positions on social policy and supported Mexican legislation guaranteeing abortion for rape victims, when pregnancy endangers a woman's life or in cases of severe fetal deformity; has publicly advocated the legalization of small quantities of cocaine and other drugs for addicts who agree to undergo treatment; and has approved a right-to-die initiative for ill patients to refuse <b>invasive</b> <b>treatment</b> or extraordinary efforts to prolong their lives. As for his economic policies, he supports balanced fiscal policies, flat taxes, lower taxes, and free trade.|$|E
2500|$|Physicians use fMRI {{to assess}} how risky brain surgery or similar <b>invasive</b> <b>treatment</b> is for a patient and to learn how a normal, diseased or injured brain is functioning. They map the brain with fMRI to {{identify}} regions linked to critical functions such as speaking, moving, sensing, or planning. This is useful to plan for surgery and radiation therapy of the brain. Clinicians also use fMRI to anatomically map the brain and detect the effects of tumors, stroke, head and brain injury, or diseases such as Alzheimer's, and developmental disabilities such as [...] Autism etc..|$|E
