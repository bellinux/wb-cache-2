With the 1832 Anatomy Act, the body was first kept in a building called the 'dead house', {{on the west side}} of the burial ground (see diagram above). If unclaimed after 72 hours it could be sold to a licensed anatomy school. The Act also provided for the donation of bodies.|$|E

25|$|The {{bombs were}} planted in Tiffin {{carriers}} on bicycles, a pattern {{similar to the}} 13 May 2008 Jaipur bombings. Many of the blasts targeted the city bus service of AMTS (Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service), ripping apart portions of the vehicles. Two blasts took place inside the premises of two hospitals, about 40minutes after the initial series of blasts. One of the blasts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> occurred when injured victims of the initial series of blasts were being admitted there. Another bomb was found and defused {{on the following day}} in the Hatkeshwar area. Two live bombs were also retrieved from Maninagar, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's constituency.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{accident}} {{happened during the}} day and there were people present in the proximity of the track, the rescue units were notified about the situation almost instantly. The first rescue unit, which consisted of firefighters stationed in Studénka, arrived at {{the accident}} site only seven minutes after the alarm was issued. There were a total of 20 firefighter rescue units (altogether 100 firefighters and 40 firefighter engines) rescuing the passengers. Twenty ambulances together with helicopters transported the injured into all the nearest hospitals in Ostrava, Nový Jičín, Frýdek-Místek, Opava, Bílovec, Olomouc and Valašské Meziříčí. Thanks to cooperation within the Integrated rescue system (Integrovaný záchranný systém), all the injured were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> within two hours of the accident.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, {{following}} Romania's {{entry into}} World War I, Rainer returned to Bucharest and rejoined Marta, being called up for medical {{service as a}} Colonel. During the 1916 counteroffensive, the Rainers set up surgery wards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> that had become full to overflowing with wounded from the Battle of Turtucaia and the zeppelin attack on Bucharest. Later, during Bucharest's occupation by the Central Powers, Francisc Rainer established temporary hospitals in schools. He continued teaching under the German administration, so that his students would not miss a year, but was also obliged to teach separate courses for German students. He managed to prevent the occupying authorities from requisitioning the faculty's possessions. Viewed as political suspects, the Rainers were singled out for internment in Bulgaria, but spared by Minovici's intervention on his behalf. Marta Rainer, who managed war hospitals, organized teams of surgeons to help deal with the humanitarian crisis, and operated non-stop during the extremely cold winter of 1917–1918.|$|E

25|$|Between 1975 and 1979, after South Vietnam {{had fallen}} to North Vietnam, {{millions}} of Cambodians emigrated to Thailand to avoid the Khmer Rouge. In response MSF set up its first refugee camp missions in Thailand. When Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia in 1989, MSF started long-term relief missions to help survivors of the mass killings and reconstruct the country’s health care system. Although its missions to Thailand to help victims of war in Southeast Asia could arguably be seen as its first war-time mission, MSF saw its first mission to a true war zone, including exposure to hostile fire, in 1976. MSF spent nine years (1976–1984) assisting surgeries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> of various cities in Lebanon, during the Lebanese Civil War, and established a reputation for its neutrality and willingness to work under fire. Throughout the war, MSF helped both Christian and Muslim soldiers alike, helping whichever group required the most medical aid at the time. In 1984, as the situation in Lebanon deteriorated further and security for aid groups was minimised, MSF withdrew its volunteers.|$|E
25|$|A {{few minutes}} after Chávez's {{broadcast}} at 3:45 pm, gunfire erupted again and the march began to disperse slightly. As the demonstrators marched closer to the Llaguno Overpass, they could see Chavistas heavily armed, some with pistols. Police began to disperse the Chavista gunmen returning fire and few demonstrators began to follow behind them with pings of gunfire heard on the police armored vehicles, though the marchers fled shortly after as the violence grew. Only when Chávez emerged from the broadcast did he learn {{the extent of the}} violence. According to medical staff at the Vargas Hospital, the first to arrive at the hospital were opposition marchers. According to surgeons, the marchers {{had been shot in the}} back with handgun fire while fleeing and others were severely injured from 7.62×51mm NATO military rounds from Fal rifles, standard equipment of the National Guard defending Chávez. Later after police responded to pro-Chávez shooting, Chávez supporters then began being seen injured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals.</b> As a result of the confrontations, between 17 and 19 were left dead and around 60 injured, most killed between 3:20 pm and 3:55 pm.|$|E

2500|$|The {{final year}} (Year 6) {{of medical school}} {{is known as the}} [...] "Trainee Intern" [...] year, wherein a student is known as a [...] "Trainee Intern" [...] (commonly {{referred}} to <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> as a [...] "T.I."). Trainee interns repeat most rotations undertaken in years 4 and 5 but at a higher level of involvement and responsibility for patient care. Trainee interns receive a stipend grant from the New Zealand government (not applicable for international students). At the current time, this is $NZ 26,756/year (about $US 18,500). Trainee interns have responsibility under supervision for the care of about one-third the patient workload of a junior doctor. However, all prescriptions and most other orders (e.g., radiology requests and charting of IV fluids) made by trainee interns must be countersigned by a registered doctor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} in {{gaining access to}} certain medicines and treatments has led to healthcare playing an increasing role in Cuba's burgeoning black market economy, sometimes termed [...] "sociolismo".

[...] Prices for out-of-surgery X-rays have been quoted at $50 to $60. Such [...] "under-the-table payments" [...] reportedly {{date back to the}} 1970s, when Cubans used gifts and tips in order to get health benefits. The harsh economic downturn known as the [...] "Special Period" [...] in the 1990s aggravated these payments. The advent of the [...] "dollar economy", a [...] legalization of the dollar which led some Cubans to receive dollars from their relatives outside of Cuba, meant that a class of Cubans were able to obtain medications and health services that would not be available to them otherwise.|$|E
