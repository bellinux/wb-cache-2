2500|$|Ex parte H.V. McKay, {{commonly}} referred to as the Harvester case, is a landmark Australian labour law decision of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The case arose under the Excise Tariff Act 1906 which contained a proviso that excise would not be payable on products <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> paid [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] wages to its employees. The Court therefore had to consider what was a [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] wage for the purpose of the proviso.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike most {{series in}} motorsport, owing to NASCAR's short-track roots, each track usually offers {{their own safety}} car, {{typically}} from the manufacturer, but in recent years, {{it has been a}} local dealer or association of regional dealerships-provided Safety car. [...] Tracks that use Toyota safety cars will use a Toyota Camry Hybrid, while Ford tracks will use a Ford Mustang, while Chevrolet tracks use a Chevrolet Camaro and most Dodge tracks use a Dodge Challenger. [...] <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> is promoting a new vehicle, they will often use the new car instead of the standard-specification safety car.|$|E
5000|$|Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Olympus, Fuji, and Sigma {{do not use}} DNG {{in their}} cameras. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> camera <b>manufacturer's</b> cameras do not use DNG, their {{software}} is unlikely to support DNG unless that software is also sold independently of the cameras.|$|R
25|$|Compounding is the {{practice}} of preparing drugs in new forms. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> drug <b>manufacturer</b> only provides <b>a</b> drug as a tablet, a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated lollipop that contains the drug. Patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead.|$|R
50|$|From 1973 to 1978, the WRC only awarded <b>a</b> {{championship}} for <b>manufacturers.</b> Scoring {{was given}} for the highest placing entry for each <b>manufacturer.</b> Thus <b>if</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>manufacturer</b> was to place 2nd, 4th, and 10th, they would receive points for 2nd place only. However, the manufacturer would still gain an advantage in scoring from its other entries, as the points for the 4th and 10th place entries would be denied to other manufacturers.|$|R
2500|$|In 1975, the FDA {{said it had}} not {{actually}} given (and never did give) approval to any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would approve that indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> provided patient labeling and special packaging {{as set out in}} a FDA final rule published in 1975. To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: [...] "This drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive" [...] in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label. In the 1980s, off-label use of the Yuzpe regimen of certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills superseded off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive.|$|E

50|$|In {{consumer}} law, false {{designation of}} origin occurs when the manufacturer or seller lies about the country of origin or maker of its products. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> makes a product and then claims {{that it is a}} high end name brand product.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the required data, NHTSA also set standards for 30 other types of data if EDRs were voluntarily configured to record them. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> configured an EDR to record engine RPMs or ABS activity, then the EDR would have to record 5 seconds of those pre-crash data in half-second increments.|$|E
50|$|The E3 {{series is}} defined as three numbers {{consisting}} of 1.00, 2.20, 4.70. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> sold resistors with E3 series values {{in a range of}} 1 ohm to 10 megaohms, then the available resistance values (in ohm (Ω)) would be: 1, 2.2, 4.7, 10, 22, 47, 100, 220, 470, 1K, 2.2K, 4.7K, 10K, 22K, 47K, 100K, 220K, 470K, 1M, 2.2M, 4.7M, 10M.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the Act's {{whistleblower}} provision is to protect employees who {{do the right thing}} by speaking up when they believe their employer has violated a consumer product safety law. Specifically, <b>if</b> employees of <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> private labeler, distributor, or retailer of consumer products, may not have their employer retaliate against them for reporting potential violations of consumer product safety laws.|$|R
5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, <b>if</b> <b>an</b> automobile <b>manufacturer</b> is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high. He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|R
50|$|Positive recall is a {{term used}} in quality systems, most notably ISO9000. It defines the concept that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> {{producer}} or <b>manufacturer</b> has <b>a</b> product or process that requires inspection and it wishes to postpone the inspection process, it must have a system in place that will insure that the postponed inspection process {{will take place at}} some point prior to final product/process acceptance.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> has {{developed}} {{two versions of}} a product and wishes to know which will be more popular with consumers and should therefore {{be put on the}} market, presenting them jointly to the public will enable consumers to evaluate differences between them, while presenting them separately will better predict the consumer's actual experience of the product when and if it is actually put on sale.|$|E
50|$|Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act {{requires}} licensure {{of biological}} products that travel in interstate commerce in the United States. CBER may deny licensure or suspend or cancel a current license <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> does {{not comply with}} requirements. Unlicensed blood products used {{within the boundaries of}} a state are not unusual, and these products are subject to general regulations from other FDA legal authorities.|$|E
5000|$|WaterSense {{is not a}} {{regulatory}} program, but rather a [...] program. EPA develops specifications for water efficient products through a public process. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> makes a product that meets those specifications, the product is eligible for third-party testing to ensure the stated efficiency and performance criteria have been met. If the product passes the test, the manufacturer is rewarded {{with the right to}} put the WaterSense label on that product.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>manufacturer</b> code is <b>a</b> unique code {{assigned}} to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the GS1 Prefix. All products produced by a given company will use the same manufacturer code. EAN-13 uses what is called [...] "variable-length manufacturer codes." [...] Assigning fixed-length 5-digit manufacturer codes, as the UCC has done until recently, means that each manufacturer can have up to 99,999 product codes--and many manufacturers don't have that many products, which means hundreds or even thousands of potential product codes are being wasted on manufacturers that {{only have a few}} products. Thus <b>if</b> <b>a</b> potential <b>manufacturer</b> knows that it is only going to produce a few products, EAN-13 may issue it <b>a</b> longer <b>manufacturer</b> code, leaving less space for the product code. This results in more efficient use of the available manufacturer and product codes.|$|R
50|$|The most elaborate, but totally destructive, {{assay method}} is the fire assay, or cupellation. As applied to gold bearing metallics, as in {{hallmark}} assaying, {{it is also}} known as cupellation and can have an accuracy of 1 part in 10,000. In this process the article is melted, the alloys separated and constituents weighed. Since this method is totally destructive, when this method is employed for the assay of jewelry, it is done under the guise of random or selective sampling. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> single <b>manufacturer</b> deposits <b>a</b> lot of rings or watch cases, while most are assayed using the non-destructive methods a few pieces from the lot are randomly selected for fire assay.|$|R
50|$|He {{opined that}} even if the {{programs}} involved were more complex (and thus more deserving of copyright protection), the key question would be the purpose of the circumvention technology. Under his proposed framework, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> third party <b>manufacturer's</b> use of <b>a</b> circumvention technology was intended only to allow its products to interoperate with another manufacturer's—and not to gain any independent benefit from the functionality of the code being copied—then that circumvention would be permissible.|$|R

50|$|For consumers, when a {{manufacturer}} quotes consumption, emission or other statistics referencing WMTC, {{they can be}} compared directly against other manufacturers also referencing WMTC. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> does not reference this standard, then a consumer can only take on faith that the statistics offered are both representative and valid. Also, it seems the reliability of these (WMTC) tests might be accelerating {{the introduction of new}} technologies to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy - for the benefit of consumers.|$|E
5000|$|Ex parte H.V. McKay, {{commonly}} referred to as the Harvester case, is a landmark Australian labour law decision of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The case arose under the Excise Tariff Act 1906 which contained a proviso that excise would not be payable on products <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> paid [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] wages to its employees.

5000|$|In {{order to}} conduct its investigations, the NTSB {{operates}} under the [...] "party system", which utilizes {{the support and}} participation of industry and labor representatives with expertise specifically useful to its investigation. These individuals or organizations may be invited by the NTSB to become parties to the investigation, and participate {{under the supervision of}} the NTSB. [...] The NTSB has discretion over which organizations it allows to participate. [...] Only individuals with relevant technical expertise are allowed to represent an organization in an investigation, and attorneys and insurance investigators are prohibited by law from participating. [...] For example, <b>if</b> <b>an</b> aircraft <b>manufacturer's</b> employee has technical knowledge of the aircraft model involved, he or she may represent the <b>manufacturer</b> in <b>an</b> aircraft investigation.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the link between overall cigarette sales and payments to the Settling States noted above, there are provisions {{for changes in the}} payments required of particular companies due to changes in their market share. One such provision applies to market share losses by any OPM to other PMs. In general, an OPM losing market share pays less to the states; an OPM gaining market share pays more. Future payment obligations of SPMs—those arising after the initial payment made upon joining the MSA—occur only <b>if</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>manufacturer's</b> market share rises above the greater of (i) 100% of its 1998 market share, or (ii) 125% of its 1997 market share. Any future payments owed by SPMs are at a rate approximately equal to that paid by the OPMs.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a greater}} scope of {{opportunities}} as the industry changes. It trains managers to look beyond their current business activities and think [...] "outside the box". George Steiner (1979) {{is one of many}} {{in a long line of}} admirers who cite Levitt's famous example on transportation. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> buggy whip <b>manufacturer</b> in 1910 defined its business as the [...] "transportation starter business," [...] they might have been able to make the creative leap necessary to move into the automobile business when technological change demanded it.|$|R
5000|$|The MoU which {{defines the}} common {{external}} power supply {{as well as the}} related EC standardisation mandate both allow {{for the use of the}} common {{external power supply}} also with phones not equipped with a micro-USB receptacle. [...] "... MoU 4.2.1 ... <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> makes available an Adaptor from the Micro-USB connector of a Common EPS to a specific non-Micro-USB socket in the Mobile Phone, it shall constitute compliance to this article" [...] and, [...] "... An Adaptor can also be a detachable cable." ...|$|E
5000|$|In March 1978, a FDA Drug Bulletin {{was sent}} to all U.S. {{physicians}} and pharmacists which said: [...] "FDA has not yet given approval for any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive. The Agency, however, will approve this indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> provides patient labeling and special packaging. To discourage 'morning after' use of DES without patient labeling, FDA has removed from the market the 25 mg tablets of DES, formerly used for this purpose." ...|$|E
50|$|Reporting {{of adverse}} events {{from the point}} of care is {{voluntary}} in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event and medication error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report these events to the products’ manufacturers. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>manufacturer</b> receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations. The MedWatch site provides information about mandatory reporting.|$|E
5000|$|DTCP is a copy-control {{scheme for}} digital video devised by five {{companies}} (called the [...] "5C consortium"). HDCP {{is a similar}} copy-control scheme devices by only four companies (the [...] "4C consortium"). Both of these schemes restrict what a consumer can do with digital video; both require <b>a</b> license <b>if</b> <b>a</b> device <b>manufacturer</b> {{is going to be}} able to implement them; both constrain the functionality of products in which they are incorporated. Both cost money to implement—the licenses are not free. DTCP encrypts video transmitted over a digital bus called IEEE 1394 (or [...] "FireWire"). HDCP encrypts video transmitted over a different—and video-specific—bus called Digital Visual Interface ("DVI"). The encryption, in both cases, is meant to [...] "protect" [...] the content against the consumer, and to restrict playback of the content to [...] "authorized", licensed devices.|$|R
50|$|Charging station owners, or hosts, {{are less}} {{vulnerable}} to individual system suppliers - <b>if</b> <b>a</b> charging station <b>manufacturer</b> ceased to exist, the host could switch to another OCPP-based network. Giving charging station customers choice and flexibility to use any network on any charge station would, through market forces, encourage charging station manufacturers and network providers to compete on price, service, product features, and innovation - all of which encourages demand by charge station owners. The end result is a significant benefit to EV drivers as the charging station infrastructure expands.|$|R
5000|$|Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, [...] is a US Supreme Court case on US {{antitrust}} law which {{set out the}} [...] "Illinois Brick doctrine". It prohibited indirect purchasers of goods or services from recovering antitrust damages from antitrust violators. Thus, <b>if</b> <b>manufacturer</b> <b>A</b> sells bricks to contractor B who builds a house and sells it to customer C, and A engages in a price-fixing conspiracy with other brick manufacturers, C cannot sue A and recover damages for the overcharges resulting from the antitrust violation.|$|R
