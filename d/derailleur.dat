5|$|When the two entered Roubaix, Wegmuller {{ran over}} {{a plastic bag}} that flew {{out in front of}} him, which became jammed in his <b>derailleur.</b> Wegmuller was unable to change gears which was crucial for a sprint finish. He got {{assistance}} from his team car to remove the bag, but his gears still would not change. Knowing that a bicycle change would be suicidal to his chances, Wegmuller continued on his damaged bike; Demol continued to draft behind him.|$|E
5|$|On the Taaienberg, Tiesj Benoot (Lotto–Soudal) led the peloton, with Boonen {{right behind}} him. A ten-rider group {{broke away from}} the peloton over the climb, with Benoot and Boonen joined by Roelandts, Cancellara, Boom, Vanmarcke, Daniel Oss (BMC) and three other Etixx–Quick-Step riders (Terpstra, Štybar and Trentin). On the next climb, the Boigneberg, Cancellara's rear <b>derailleur</b> failed and it took more than a minute for his team to bring him a {{replacement}} bike, putting him a long way behind the other favourites. Shortly afterwards, the breakaway was caught by the chasing group; the combined group was then caught by another group that contained Sagan and Kwiatkowski to create a 20-man lead group, although Štybar soon suffered a puncture and fell out of the group. Cancellara, meanwhile, was in a group led by his teammates Yaroslav Popovych and Markel Irizar around two minutes behind.|$|E
25|$|<b>Derailleur</b> type {{mechanisms}} {{of a typical}} mid-range product (of the sort used by serious amateurs) achieve between 88% and 99% mechanical efficiency at 100W. In <b>derailleur</b> mechanisms the highest efficiency is achieved by the larger sprockets. Efficiency generally decreases with smaller sprocket and chainring sizes.|$|E
50|$|Today Campagnolo, Shimano, and SRAM are {{the three}} main {{manufacturers}} of <b>derailleurs,</b> with Italian manufacturer Campagnolo only making road cycling <b>derailleurs</b> and Shimano making both road and offroad. American manufacturer SRAM {{has been an important}} third, specializing in <b>derailleurs</b> for mountain bikes, and in 2006 they introduced a drivetrain system for road bicycles.|$|R
5000|$|... clamp : The vast {{majority}} of front <b>derailleurs</b> are mounted to the frame by a clamp around the frame's seat tube. <b>Derailleurs</b> are available with several different clamp diameters designed to fit different types of frame tubing. Recently, {{there has been a}} trend to make <b>derailleurs</b> with only one diameter clamp, and several sets of shims are included to space the clamp down to the appropriate size.|$|R
5000|$|E-type : This type front <b>derailleurs</b> do not clamp {{around the}} frame's seat tube, but instead are {{attached}} to the frame by a plate mounted under the drive side bottom bracket cup and a screw threaded into a boss on the seat tube. These <b>derailleurs</b> are usually found on mountain bikes with rear suspension components that do not allow space for a normal <b>derailleur's</b> clamp to go around the seat tube.|$|R
25|$|The {{overlapping}} ranges with <b>derailleur</b> gears {{mean that}} 24 or 27 speed <b>derailleur</b> gears may {{only have the}} same total gear range as a (much more expensive) Rohloff 14-speed hub gear. Internal hub geared bikes typically have a more restricted gear range than comparable derailleur-equipped bikes, and have fewer ratios within that range.|$|E
25|$|The {{seat tube}} {{also may have}} braze-on mounts for a bottle cage or front <b>derailleur.</b>|$|E
25|$|At a {{more typical}} 150W, hub-gears {{tend to be}} around 2% less {{efficient}} than a <b>derailleur</b> system assuming both systems are well maintained.|$|E

25|$|<b>Derailleur</b> {{efficiency}} is also compromised with cross-chaining, or running large-ring to large-sprocket or small-ring to small-sprocket. This cross-chaining also results in increased wear {{because of the}} lateral deflection of the chain.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{transmissions}} {{have been}} demonstrated and marketed for both <b>derailleur</b> and hub gear mechanisms, often accompanied by a warning to disengage auto-shifting if standing on the pedals. These have met with limited market success.|$|E
25|$|Technically, the {{bicycles}} {{were similar}} to the 1911 bicycles, only Stéphanois Panel experimented with a <b>derailleur</b> system. This was quickly forbidden afterwards by Tour organiser Henri Desgrange, and only allowed again in 1937.|$|E
5000|$|Through all {{years of}} production, various models of Simplex <b>derailleurs</b> were used.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Derailleurs</b> {{cannot be}} used, so an internal-gear hub is used if {{multiple}} gear ratios are required.|$|R

25|$|Honda {{has also}} built a {{downhill}} racing bicycle {{known as the}} Honda RN-01. It is not available for sale to the public. The bike has a gearbox, which replaces the standard <b>derailleur</b> found on most bikes.|$|E
25|$|Control cables are routed along mounts {{on the top}} tube, or {{sometimes}} inside the top tube. Most commonly, this includes the cable for the rear brake, but some mountain bikes and hybrid bicycles also route {{the front and rear}} <b>derailleur</b> cables along the top tube.|$|E
25|$|On {{a bicycle}} {{with only one}} gear change {{mechanism}} (e.g. rear hub only or rear <b>derailleur</b> only), the number of possible gear ratios {{is the same as}} the number of usable gear ratios, which is also the same as the number of distinct gear ratios.|$|E
5000|$|Shifters {{employing}} one convention {{are generally}} not compatible with <b>derailleurs</b> employing another, although exceptions exist, and adaptors are available.|$|R

25|$|In {{the context}} of road cycling, compact {{drivetrain}} typically refers to double cranksets with a smaller (usually 110mm) bolt circle diameter than the standard 130mm or Campagnolo's 135mm. As of 2006, {{all of the major}} component manufacturers such as Shimano and Campagnolo offer compact cranks in their midrange and high-end product lines. The compact crankset provides a compromise between the standard road double crankset (with 39/52 or 39/53 tooth chainrings) and the road triple (with 30/42/52 or 30/39/53 tooth chainrings). The compact crankset has two chainrings and typical ratios are 34/48, 34/50 and 36/50. This provides nearly the same lower gear ratios as a triple but without the need for a third chainring, a triple front <b>derailleur</b> and a long cage rear <b>derailleur.</b> Both Shimano and Campagnolo recommend and sell front derailleurs specifically designed for compact cranksets, claiming better shifting.|$|E
25|$|A single-speed bicycle {{is a type}} of bicycle with {{a single}} gear ratio. These {{bicycles}} are without <b>derailleur</b> gears, hub gearing or other methods for varying the gear ratio of the bicycle. Adult single-speed bicycles typically have a gear ratio of between 55 and 75 gear inches, depending on the rider and the anticipated usage.|$|E
25|$|Since cyclists' {{legs are}} most {{efficient}} over {{a narrow range}} of pedaling speeds, or cadence, a variable gear ratio helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use hub gears with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient <b>dérailleur</b> system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A <b>dérailleur</b> system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the chainring and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes {{have two or three}} chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.|$|E
50|$|From a {{mechanical}} viewpoint, up to 99% {{of the energy}} delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels (clean, lubricated new chain at 400W), although the use of gearing mechanisms reduces this by 1-7% (clean, well-lubricated <b>derailleurs),</b> 4-12% (chain with 3-speed hubs), or 10-20% (shaft drive with 3-speed hubs). The higher efficiencies in each range are achieved at higher power levels and in direct drive (hub gears) or with large driven cogs (<b>derailleurs).</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{is seldom}} {{any need to}} change both front and rear <b>derailleurs</b> {{simultaneously}} so it is generally more suitable for casual or inexperienced cyclists.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 Campagnolo {{introduced}} the Gran Sport, a more refined {{version of the}} then already existing, yet less commercially successful, cable-operated parallelogram rear <b>derailleurs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{down tube}} connects the head tube {{to the bottom}} bracket shell. On racing {{bicycles}} and some mountain and hybrid bikes, the <b>derailleur</b> cables run along the down tube, or inside the down tube. On older racing bicycles, the shift levers were mounted on the down tube. On newer ones, they are mounted with the brake levers on the handlebars.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, fixed-gear {{bicycles}} are single-speed. A <b>derailleur</b> for gear selection would introduce chain slack, which {{would interfere with}} braking. Gear selection can, however, be accomplished {{with the use of}} an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear 3-speed hub is a fixed-gear multi-speed arrangement. Most fixed-gear bicycles only have a front brake, and some have no brakes at all.|$|E
25|$|Factors {{which have}} been shown to affect the {{drive-train}} efficiency include the type of transmission system (chain, shaft, belt), the type of gearing system (fixed, <b>derailleur,</b> hub, infinitely variable), the size of the sprockets used, the magnitude of the input power, the pedalling speed, and how rusty the chain is. For a particular gearing system, different gear ratios generally have different efficiencies.|$|E

50|$|Most components, {{including}} the brakes, shifters, and <b>derailleurs,</b> were sourced from Shimano. The gruppo used change year-to-year, but later models used many Shimano 105 components.|$|R
