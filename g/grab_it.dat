5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

25|$|England won the toss, {{chose to}} bat {{and made an}} {{impressive}} start to their innings, with the opening stand being worth 133 in 39 overs. Michael Vaughan played some exquisite shots, bringing back memories of his performances against India and Australia in 2002 {{when he reached the}} top of the world rankings. It took a freakish dismissal to remove him, the ball getting caught in the trousers of the short leg fielder who then managed to <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> before it hit the ground. Vaughan had made 87, and was very disappointed to have to leave the crease when he had the potential to make a very large score.|$|E
25|$|As the 19th century dawned, Florida {{had been}} undisputed Spanish {{territory}} for almost 250 years, aside from 20 years of British control between the French and Indian Wars and the American Revolution. Although a sparsely inhabited swampland, expansionist-minded Americans {{were eager to}} <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> and already, in 1808, American settlers had invaded the westernmost tip of Florida and expelled the local Spanish authorities, after which Congress hastily passed a bill annexing it under {{the claim that the}} Louisiana Purchase had guaranteed the territory to the United States. During the War of 1812, American troops occupied and seized the area around Mobile Bay. Spain, then engulfed in war with France, did not react to either of these actions. Also taking advantage of the mother country's distraction, Spain's Latin American colonies rose up in revolt and Madrid was forced to denude Florida of troops to suppress the rebellions. The result of this was that law and order practically broke down in Florida and a horde of Indians, pirates, and other troublemakers began raiding across the border into the US. In 1818, Andrew Jackson led an army into Florida to quell the chaotic situation there. He arrested and hanged two British agents who had been encouraging Indian raids, leading to an outcry in London and calls for war. However, cooler heads prevailed and the situation did not escalate further. A year later, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams negotiated the Adams-Onis Treaty with Spain. The Spanish agreed to turn over the no-longer-defensible Florida to the US and also give up their extremely flimsy claims to the distant Oregon Territory, in exchange for which American claims on Texas were renounced (some Americans had also been claiming parts of that territory under the Louisiana Purchase). The heretofore vague border between the US and Spanish North America was also settled upon. Although American designs on Texas did not disappear, they were put on the backburner for the more immediately important Florida.|$|E
500|$|Prey is {{most often}} caught on the ground, though {{occasionally}} they take birds in flight. [...] Before striking, the kestrel characteristically bobs its head and tail, then makes a direct flight toward the prey to <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> in its talons. Much like the red-tailed hawk, American kestrels conserve energy in a hunt and pick their attacks with care as to position and odds of success. During the breeding season, the bird will carry large prey back to its mate or young. One study found that an American kestrel pair [...] "foraged in ways that minimized the costs of energy acquisition in its particular situation". For example, if the success rate for catching prey decreases significantly in a particular area, the bird will move to a different area.|$|E

500|$|Rahul {{tries to}} flirt with the woman, who starts {{communicating}} by singing parodies of Hindi film songs, and explains that the four men are trying to kidnap her. Rahul lends her his mobile phone {{so that she can}} contact her friends, but the men with her <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> and throw it from the train. Rahul is annoyed, but says nothing because the men are carrying weapons. Rahul tells the TTE about them, but they push the inspector into a river below a bridge. Panicked, Rahul learns that the men are her cousins, and that her name is Meenalochni [...] "Meena" [...] Azhagusundaram (Deepika Padukone).

500|$|Further {{disappointment}} followed as the American 4 x 100m relay team, with Gay as anchor, {{failed to}} qualify for the final. Darvis Patton and Gay failed to pass on the baton in the heat. Gay personally took responsibility for the dropped baton but Patton denied this was true, saying [...] "That's Tyson Gay. He's a humble guy, but I know it's my job to get the guy the baton and I didn't do that." [...] After stating his desire to win four Olympic gold medals (by adding the 400 metres to his repertoire) earlier in the year, Gay finished the 2008 Olympics without a single medal. Having failed to reach the finals of the 100m sprint or relay, he reflected upon his failure to make the podium in Beijing: [...] " [...] then I went to <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> and there was nothing. It's kind of the way it's been happening to me this Olympics." ...|$|E

500|$|At the 2012 NBA Draft Combine, White {{measured}} at 6'8" [...] {{and had the}} widest hands——of any player participating. [...] According to Iowa State head coach Fred Hoiberg, [...] "He's such a unique player and plays such a different style that it's difficult to compare him to anybody". [...] When asked who in the NBA he would compare White to. Kentucky Wildcats coach John Calipari {{had this to say}} about White: [...] "Here's a kid that would rather pass and get 15 assists than score a basket. It's amazing. And he plays tough, and he's got huge hands. So you'd better grab the ball with two because he'll <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> with one." [...] He was able to bench-press 185 pounds 30 times in pre-combine workouts. [...] That would have been a NBA combine record had he bench pressed. White was drafted by the Houston Rockets on June 28, 2012 with the 16th selection. He was represented by Andrew Vye and Andy Miller of the ASM Sports as his agents.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Crystal Grab", the {{contestant}}s must fight to collect all the Crystals in the arena. When a contestant is attacked, they will drop any Crystals they've gathered, allowing opponents to steal them. This mode {{can be played}} free-for-all or with teams. In [...] "Capture the Flag", two teams attempt to capture each other's flag {{and bring it back}} to their respective flags. Players must race to their opponents' side of the map and drive over their flag to <b>grab</b> <b>it.</b> They must then drive over their own flag's base to score a point from the flag they've captured. A flag that has been stolen can be dropped if the thief is hit with any weapon. Stolen flags that have been dropped can be returned to their respective bases. Due to the weight of the flags, any kart with a flag will be slowed down. The game ends when time runs out or when one of the teams has gotten enough points. This mode can only be played in teams. [...] "Steal the Bacon" [...] is a variation of [...] "Capture the Flag" [...] in which two teams fight over one flag that is situated {{in the middle of the}} arena. The teams must attempt to take the flag and bring it to their respective base.|$|E

2500|$|They forage in sun flecks and {{the gaps}} created by fallen trees, {{where there is}} enough light to see spider webs. [...] Several species have been {{observed}} searching for webs by flying up {{one side of a}} tree and down the other side. [...] When they locate one they hover in front of it. [...] To catch a spider they first fly backward, then quickly fly forward to <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> in their forelegs. [...] Then they back away again and perch to consume the spider, removing the legs before eating the body. [...] Though this careful forward-and-back approach minimizes contact with the web, they often preen after eating to remove any strands that do adhere to them.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Louis Menand {{thought that}} {{teachers}} assign the novel {{because of the}} optimistic ending, to teach adolescent readers that [...] "alienation is just a phase." [...] While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age, Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult, given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives. Others highlight the dilemma of Holden's state, in between adolescence and adulthood. Holden is quick to become emotional. [...] "I felt sorry as hell for..." [...] is a phrase he often uses. It is often said that Holden changes at the end, when he watches Phoebe on the carousel, and {{he talks about the}} golden ring and how it's good for kids to try and <b>grab</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Upon its release, I'm Serious {{received}} universal widespread {{critical acclaim}} from most music critics. Some critics, however, {{pointed to the}} fact that many of the tracks sounded the same and that a few were blatant rip-offs. Allmusic writer Jon Azpiri wrote [...] "T.I. claims to be the king of the South, but on I'm Serious he fails to show and prove. He does, however, have potential. If his talent ever matches his confidence, he may be headed for stardom." [...] Down-South gave the album a four out of five stars saying [...] "With his solo finally about to drop, this album should be his gateway into the mainstream arena. Overall, this album is all I expected plus more. I don't seen how anyone couldn't like it because it's [...] so much diversity.

2500|$|In {{a drunken}} revelry, some of Curly Bill's friends were firing pistols {{into the air}} on October 27, 1880, [...] in a dark vacant lot between Toughnut and Allen Streets, near where the Birdcage Theater now stands.

He said he put his arms around Brocius from behind to see if he had any other weapons, and White [...] "gave a quick jerk and the pistol went off." [...] White fell to the ground, wounded. When the pistol discharged, Wyatt buffaloed Brocius and arrested him. Brocius complained, [...] "What have I done? I have not done anything to be arrested for.” ...|$|E
2500|$|With Arthur {{out on his}} mission, Lancelot and Guinevere {{decided to}} seek out the dagger themselves, by using Merlin’s {{gauntlet}} that leads the two to a magical passageway that was located in the Vault of the Dark One. However, the passageway was also a deadly trap, as the Dark One emerges as pure darkness, and almost kills Lancelot, but he eventually survives, after Guinevere uses a torch to repel the Darkness. This would lead to a kiss between Lancelot and Guinevere. The two walk through the doorway and discover the Dagger, but couldn't <b>grab</b> <b>it</b> thanks to a protection spell placed on it by Rumplestiltskin, who in exchange for the gauntlet, offered the magical sands of Avalon, which can be used to fix anything that appears to be [...] "broken" [...] at their choosing. Unfortunately, despite Lancelot's warning not to accept it, Guinevere decided to accept the deal and goes back to Arthur. However, when she returns to Camelot, she is confronted by Arthur, who knew about her and Lancelot, and threw the enchanted sand of Avalon on her, making his wife obedient with whatever he wanted, and used more of the sand to create his Camelot empire.|$|E
