40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry {{is one of}} the most competitive businesses in the world. Supply chain in this industry has been directed towards the production of large batches to avoid lack of supplies, and the achievement of regulatory requirements, at the cost of high level of inventory, higher costs and <b>inventory</b> <b>write-off</b> due to expiration or other reasons. In recent years this industry is facing major changes and challenges such as intense globalization processes, increased competition and innovations in technologies, which has broadened and deepened risks in supply chain. The paper reports the results of the study of the risk in distribution processes of Slovenian pharmaceutical companies, which was conducted among five companies and aims to draw attention to risks that arise in supply chain, to emphasize the importance of their management and to present a model for an effective assessment of risk in companies, developed at the Faculty of Logistics...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by a $ 2. 2 billion <b>inventory</b> <b>write-off</b> by Cisco Systems, we {{investigate}} how duplicate orders can lead a manufacturer to err in estimating the demand rate and customers ’ sensitivity to delay, {{and to make}} faulty decisions about capacity investment. We consider a manufacturer that sells through two distributors. If a customer finds that his distributor is out of stock, then he will sometimes seek to make a purchase from the other distributor; if the latter is also out of stock, the customer will order from both distributors. When his order is filled {{by one of the}} distributors, the customer cancels any duplicate orders. Furthermore, the customer cancels all of his outstanding orders after a random period of time. Assuming that the manufacturer is unaware of duplicate orders, we prove that she will overestimate both the demand rate and the cancellation rate. Surprisingly, failure to account for duplicate orders can cause shortterm underinvestment in capacity. However, in long-term equilibrium under stable demand conditions the manufacturer overinvests in capacity. Our results suggest that Cisco’s write-off was caused by estimation errors and cannot be blamed entirely on the economic downturn. Finally, we provide some guidance on estimation in the presence of double orders.

40|$|Among practitioners, {{inventory}} {{is often}} {{thought to be}} the root of all evil in operations management. The stock market hates it, the media abhors it, and managers have come to fear it. But high inventory levels can also be the result of strategic buying and high-availability strategies. The problem is that when the market sees lots of inventory, it cannot tell whether it is because of poor or smart operations. We hypothesize that inventory has a signaling role. In our model, publicly- traded firms use inventory levels to signal their operational competence to the market. There is a separating equilibrium that leads some firms to maintain inventory levels below what their capability could achieve. We offer this as one explanation why, for example, stock-outs are pervasive even among operationally competent firms. We provide empirical evidence for the assumptions behind this inventory signaling hypothesis: (1) the market cannot tell the difference between “good” and “bad” inventory; and (2) the counterfactual: the market punishes firms when it can tell that their inventory is bad, such as when they write off supplies. Consistent with these assumptions, we find that inventory levels do not explain firm value. And on average, stocks suffer an abnormal negative return of 7 % in the month of announcing <b>inventory</b> <b>write-offs.</b> <b>Inventory,</b> signaling, operations management, asymmetric information...|$|R
40|$|Significant <b>inventory</b> <b>write-offs</b> have {{recently}} plagued ATI Technologies, {{a world leader}} in graphics and media processors. ATI's product-centric culture has long deterred attention from supply chain efficiency. Given that manufacturing lead time exceeds customer order lead time for its semiconductors, ATI relies heavily on their demand forecasting team to instigate supply chain activities. The PC business unit forecasting team translates market information into product-line forecast and also sets finished goods inventory levels intended to offset demand uncertainty. Today's inventory decisions are made in response to customer escalations, often ignoring financial implications. To add necessary rigor when setting these inventory levels, this thesis presents a model using wafer and unit cost, profit margin, product lifecycle stage and historical forecast error to categorize products into inventory risk levels. The resultant risk levels become a critical input to monthly demand-supply meetings with marketing, operations and senior executives - the outcome of which are wafer orders and assembly and test plans at the world's largest contract foundries and subcontractors. Finally, the 2006 acquisition of ATI by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) offers unforeseen flexibility, scale and challenges to the outsourced semiconductor supply chain. by Irene S. Hwang. Thesis (M. B.

40|$|Compaq Computer Corporation's High Performance Systems Division (HPSD) {{manufactures}} servers for mid-range and high-end server markets. It has {{a complex}} supply chain {{that includes the}} use of supplier hubs, outsourced memory module manufacturers, and stacked memory devices (chips). For this memory module supply chain, Compaq faces two major planning challenges. First, {{it is very difficult}} to get an accurate forecast of memory requirements. Second, the cost of memory continues to decline, on the order of 1 - 4 % per month, which results in a high inventory holding cost. A set of standard software tools is developed to assist analysts with determining the supply plan for memory from multiple suppliers. The purpose of these tools is to determine the minimum cost supply plan with an acceptable level of forecast risk. Two separate tools individually address cost and forecast challenges. The Cost Tool can consider up to nine cost categories across the supply chain network upstream from the factory. The tool is flexible, transparent, easily disseminated and easy to use. The Forecast Tool can track current supply activity and can forecast the next week's and next quarter's supply plan. The tool consists of a main menu worksheet and another worksheet for each quarter of the year in Microsoft Excel. It can be used for any commodity. It is flexible, easy to use and easily disseminated. Use of these tools should lead to more expeditious analyses of supply plans and forecasts while yielding estimates of the supply chain costs for a particular supply plan. A conceptual model for decreasing costs by combining supply chain costs with a standard purchasing price-parity point is presented. The purpose of this model is to provide purchasers another point of view based on total supply chain costs, including <b>inventory</b> <b>write-offs</b> due to decreasing memory prices and transportation costs. by Mitchell Abbott Malone.
