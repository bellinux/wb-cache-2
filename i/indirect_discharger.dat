Five sites were selected, one reference site which is upstream of heavy mining activities and four sites within heavy mining and processing activities. Standard techniques for water, sediment, invertebrate and fish sampling were used. Macro-invertebrates sampled were identified to family level whereas fish were identified to species level. Multivariate analysis used was cluster analysis by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) for both macro-invertebrates and fish. Three methods of ordination were used to analyze the biotic and abiotic data namely N-MDS, Correspondence Analysis (CA) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Cluster analysis of macro-invertebrates data revealed three major groups based on sampling period (low flow or high flow) and the last cluster according to the locality. Multidimensional scaling ordination of high and low flow for macro-invertebrate communities confirmed the groupings detected by cluster analysis. Cluster analysis for fish communities revealed two groups at 50 % similarity; the first group is the combination of reference and exposure sites for both high and low flow sampling regimes.

Three CW units were unplanted control (Ctrl) while three others were planted with Arundo donax L. (Ad) in floating racks. The rhizofiltration was carried out during 30 days in the early growing season. Total Cu concentration in the BME was 4. 4 mg Cu L− 1. Copper removal peaked within the 48 first hours after Bordeaux mixture addition in the Ad and Ctrl units (i. e. 92 and 81 % respectively).

At day 30, in the Ad units, Cu concentration remaining {{in the water and}} distributed between A. donax roots, shoots was respectively 3. 5, 33 and 0. 5 % of the initial Cu input. In the Ctrl units, Cu remaining in water was low (7 %) and Cu removal (93 %) could be partly explained by its immobilization in the Cu-rich biofilm (i. e. 207210 ± 18516 mg Cu kg− 1) coating the vat wall.

40|$|Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/ Fs) {{enter the}} {{environment}} {{primarily as a}} result of anthropogenic activities. Many of the congeners bioaccumulate and are considered potent toxicants capable of producing a wide spectrum of adverse health effects in biota and humans such as immunotoxicity, chloracne, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, disruption of the endocrine system, induction of enzymes, and anti-estrogenic effects. As a chemical class, they occur as byproducts of chemical manufacturing and incineration processes. Emissions from incineration of medical, municipal, and chemical wastes and certain facilities in central Europe provide the major source of PCDD/F to the environment. PCDD/Fs are delivered to lake systems by atmospheric emission and transport followed by deposition, direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>discharges,</b> and riverine inputs. Polychlorinated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) for example are characterized by low aqueous solubilities and vapor pressures, and resistance to extensive chemical and biological transformation. Their general hydrophobic nature results in high partition coefficients to abiotic and biotic particles. PCDD/Fs exist in the atmosphere as gases and particles although most measurements are dominated by the aerosol concentrations, especially the black carbon (BC) fraction. Once delivered to the water column, the primary removal processes are adsorption to or partitioning into particles and subsequent settling and accumulation in bottom sediments. The sorptive properties are largely controlled by the organic carbon (OC) content of particles, although BC may also play a role. Thus hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) will follow the path of the average clay-size particles and be focused into the more quiescent, depositional basins of the lake. Experience from the Laurentian Great Lakes shows that residence times for HOCs are about 2 - 4 times the fine-particle residence times of ~ 1 year. Once delivered to the bottom sediments, contaminant and particle burial is slowed by the effects of resuspension and mixing of surface sediments by aquatic organisms. Several studies have focused on the atmospheric transport, reactivity and deposition of these compounds but relatively few on their in-lake behavior. In this short paper, we provide preliminary information on the delivery and accumulation of PCDD/Fs as recorded in sediments from the Lake Maggiore (LM) (Italy). Our strategy was to obtain surface sediment from areas near riverine inputs and in the depositional basins, settling material in sediment traps at one site and preliminary air, aerosol and rain profiles.

40|$|The {{selection}} of a landfill leachate management strategy in order to shorten the aftercare period and reduce the leachate management cost is challenging. For decision making, {{it is important to}} understand 1) the main indicators of long-term leachate performance, 2) the target levels of these indicators must reach to indicate the end of the aftercare period and 3) the strategy to meet the target level of the indicators within the shortest time. The aim of this thesis is to establish a leachate emission prognosis tool for the determination of the length of the aftercare period and to use models to test the effects of different leachate management strategies on the length and overall leachate management costs of landfill aftercare. The first part of the research is a study of municipal landfill stabilization and emissions, made by systematically describing the long-term landfill leachate and gas (LFG) emission performance achieved by landfill simulators (landfill simulation reactors, LSRs). The results give a comprehensive picture of the waste biodegradation progress during the landfill aftercare period. The second part of the research is an evaluation of the feasibility of a biological on-site process to pretreat the leachate (mainly total nitrogen [TN] removal) for leachate recirculation, direct <b>discharge</b> and <b>indirect</b> <b>discharge</b> purposes from both technical and economic points of view. It is integrated with a case study of a cost estimation based on a real landfill condition as an important part of the study, conducted to define the applicability of the crucial leachate management alternatives. Based on the results of the LSR and biological leachate nitrogen removal studies, the possibility and feasibility of optimizing landfill leachate management and treatment were clarified by developing models for the estimation of long-term emissions from landfills of different sizes and evaluating the best options for leachate and nitrogen management during the aftercare period. The models developed can be used to express the importance of different target parameters and estimate the length of the aftercare period for a landfill that is effective at optimizing a cost-effective aftercare strategy. The modelling findings show that in conventional scenarios, without leachate recirculation, the aftercare period can last up to several centuries. With the highest leachate recirculation rate, the aftercare period can be shortened substantially, to 25 years and 75 years, in medium-sized and big landfills respectively; though this is technically more challenging to do for big landfills. These scenarios also showed that the lowest total and average (per m 3) leachate management costs can be achieved at about 60 % of the costs of conventional scenarios during the aftercare period...|$|R
40|$|The 2 June 2008 flood-producing {{storm on}} the Starzel river basin in South-West Germany is {{examined}} as a prototype for organized convective systems {{that dominate the}} upper tail of the precipitation frequency distribution and are likely responsible for the flash flood peaks in this region. The availability of high-resolution rainfall estimates from radar observations and a rain gauge network, together with <b>indirect</b> peak <b>discharge</b> estimates from a detailed post-event survey, provides the opportunity to study the hydrometeorological and hydrological mechanisms associated with this extreme storm and the ensuing flood. Radar-derived rainfall, streamgauge data and indirect estimates of peak discharges are used along with a distributed hydrologic model to reconstruct hydrographs at multiple locations. The influence of storm structure, evolution and motion on the modeled flood hydrograph is examined by using the "spatial moments of catchment rainfall" (Zoccatelli et al., 2011). It is shown that downbasin storm motion had a noticeable impact on flood peak magnitude. Small runoff ratios (less than 20 %) characterized the runoff response. The flood response can be reasonably well reproduced with the distributed hydrological model, using high resolution rainfall observations and model parameters calibrated at a river section which includes most of the area impacted by the storm...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} distribution in high resistivity soil around extended grounding electrodes {{has been described}} in the paper. The high-voltage polygon has been developed for experimental investigation. It {{is well known that}} direct or <b>indirect</b> lightning <b>discharges</b> could produce dangerous conditions for human body, as well as unwanted electromagnetic interferences among electrical and electronic systems. Therefore the electromagnetic characterization of earth electrodes under high pulse transient currents is an important highpoint in the design of a grounding system. The Marx generator was developed to generate impulse similar to lightning impulse. The potentials have been measured by the probe measurement system previously developed. Grounding resistance is the main characteristic of the grounding systems. From the literature analysis and experimental data {{it has been shown that}} steady state grounding resistance can differ from impulse grounding resistance. This phenomenon is caused by the ionization process and sparking occurring in the surrounding soil. Channel spark resistance is much less soil resistivity, therefore the soil resistivity and grounding resistance decrease. Calculations of potentials in the soil have been carried out using the finite element method. The experimental data have been compared with the results of the {{potential distribution}} calculation. It has been shown that the resulting spark channels in soils significantly affect the potential distribution. Accordingly, the sparking channels are to be considered while calculating the step voltage...|$|R
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of flash flood events {{gives us the}} unique opportunity to observe how catchments respond {{when most of the}} surface and subsurface hydrologic flow paths are active. These events often reveal aspects of hydrological behaviour that either were unexpected on the basis of weaker responses or highlight anticipated but previously unobserved behaviour (Archer et al., 2007; Delrieu et al., 2005). Characterizing the response of a catchment during flash flood events, thus, may provide new and valuable insight into the rate-limiting processes for extreme flood response and their dependency on catchment properties and flood severity. Flash flood events, however, are difficult to monitor because they develop at space and time scales that conventional measurement networks of rain and river discharges are not able to sample effectively (Creutin and Borga, 2003). As these events are locally rare, they are also difficult to capture during classical field-based experimentation, designed to last a few months over a given region, or on experimental catchments with drainage areas of a few km 2. This explains why the investigation of flash flood events is by necessity event-based and opportunistic as opposed to driven by observations from carefully designed field campaigns. Post-event surveys play therefore a critical role in gathering essential observations concerning flash floods. Traditionally, <b>indirect</b> peak <b>discharge</b> estimates and collection of rainfall maxima have been used to document these events, as well as to provide an answer to the questions that are invariably asked after a major flood: Why did such a major flood occur? and How frequently might such a flood be expected to occur? Collectively, these studies contributed to the establishment of regional peak discharges envelope curves and to the development of more understanding of regional behaviour of extreme floods. However, focus on peak discharges and point rainfall maxima alone provides limited insight into the hydrological controls of flash flood response. Flash flood monitoring requires rainfall estimates at small spatial scales (1 km or finer) and short time scales (15 - 30 minutes, and even less in urban areas). These requirements are generally met by weather radar networks. This is shown schematically in Figure 1, which reports typical monitoring scales of weather radar systems and raingauge networks together with the time and space scales of a number of flash flood generating storms observed in Europe in the last 15 years (Borga, 2007). Rapidly increasing availability of good quality weather radar observations is greatly expanding our ability to measure and monitor the rainfall distribution at the space and time scales which characterise the flash flood events (Borga et al., 2007). These technical advances have the potential to enhance the information content of post-event surveys. Realising this potential calls {{for the development of a}} methodology for flash flood response survey which goes beyond the collection of <b>indirect</b> peak <b>discharge</b> estimates by focusing on three concepts, which are revised in this short commentary...|$|R
40|$|Flooding is {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in Europe and, in terms of economic damage, the most costly one. To plan an effective flood risk management process, a continuous flow of data about discharge and river water level as well as the capability of forecasting in advance their evolution are needed. Satellite data have been widely used in this field, offering a great support to in-situ measurements, which are often available only at a small spatial scale or, in the worst situation, completely missing. Information about soil moisture variation can provide an <b>indirect</b> estimation of <b>discharge,</b> especially useful in poorly gauged areas. In this paper we investigated such a capability by combining information about soil water content variation, in terms of a Polarization Ratio Variation Index (PRVI), recently implemented on Aqua - Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSRE) data, with discharge measurements of the Danube River Basin collected in a few rain gauge stations in Hungary...|$|R
40|$|The 2 June 2008 flood-producing {{storm on}} the Starzel river basin in South-West Germany is {{examined}} as a prototype for organized convective systems {{that dominate the}} upper tail of the precipitation frequency distribution and are likely responsible for the flash flood peaks in Central Europe. The availability of high-resolution rainfall estimates from radar observations and a rain gauge network, together with <b>indirect</b> peak <b>discharge</b> estimates from a detailed post-event survey, provided the opportunity to study in detail the hydrometeorological and hydrological mechanisms associated with this extreme storm and the ensuing flood. Radar-derived rainfall, streamgauge data and indirect estimates of peak discharges are used along with a distributed hydrologic model to reconstruct hydrographs at multiple locations. Observations and model results are combined to examine two main questions, (i) assessment {{of the distribution of}} the runoff ratio for the 2008 flash flood and how it compares with other less severe floods; and (ii) analysis of how the spatial and temporal distribution of the extreme rainfall, and more specifically storm motion, controls the flood response. It is shown that small runoff ratios (less than 20 %) characterized the runoff response and that these values are in the range of other, less extreme, flood events. The influence of storm structure, evolution and motion on the modeled flood hydrograph is examined by using the "spatial moments of catchment rainfall". It is shown that downbasin storm motion (in the range of 0. 7 – 0. 9 m s&minus; 1 ) had a noticeable impact on flood response by increasing the modeled flood peak by 13 %...|$|R
40|$|The coastal {{pollution}} {{is an issue}} of concern for Mauritius. Since the past two decades, agricultural activities have contributed to pesticide and fertilizer run off in coastal waters. Over the recent years, the major urban and industrial growth in Mauritius have also contributed to water pollution by <b>indirect</b> wastewater <b>discharge</b> containing contaminants into rivers. As polluted water is hazardous to both marine life and human beings, it is of national interest to analyse the levels of water pollutants and the factors effecting these levels. This paper aims at developing a statistical model to evaluate the extent of {{coastal pollution}} in urbanized and agricultural regions in Mauritius. The study was carried out at two stations: St-Louis River (an urbanized industrial area) and Tamarin River (an agricultural area). A multifactor statistical model was formulated and analysed for the experimental data on the chemical and physical variables collected at the two sites for the estuary and downstream at each station, during 2001 and 2005 randomly spread over summer and winter seasons. The model is highly efficient in depicting the independent as well as the interactive effects of seasonality, time-interval, strategic locations and activities on the levels of different variables. A series of interesting conclusions were drawn from the analysis of the model. One major derivation was that the seasonal factor and time-interval had a significant effect (p-values < 0. 01) on the levels of chromium, lead and nitrates at both the stations. However, the direction and magnitude were different with respect to each variable over the strategic locations. Moreover, considerable interactive effect between various factors regarding salinity was detected. These conclusions among others raise concern...|$|R
