5|$|In the {{multiplayer}} mode, players {{compete in}} multiplayer matches online or over a {{local area network}} (LAN), {{in which they can}} band together to complete cooperative missions, or split up into teams to battle against one another. At the time the game was released, online gameplay was free over the services offered by Parallax Online, which also <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of players' statistics and rankings, while Voice chat is available, although reviewers advised it to be used only on broadband or LAN.|$|E
5|$|From 1974 to 1977, Oceanside police <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of over 1,000 {{accidents}} {{that occurred}} along SR 76. A citizen action {{group known as}} Concerned Citizens for Highway 76 formed soon after. Caltrans began holding hearings again in 1979, proposing the building of an expressway {{as opposed to a}} freeway or to widening Mission Avenue. At one hearing, local officials criticized the delay, while others criticized the routing, the decision to build an expressway instead of a freeway, and building a route through an environmentally sensitive area. In May 1980, the state Assembly Transportation Committee approved a resolution that requested an answer from the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, and Caltrans as to why certain projects, including SR76, had not been started.|$|E
5|$|From {{as early}} as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was {{expected}} to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt. In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives. Right up {{to the end of the}} Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed. The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of troop movements in painted books.|$|E
30|$|Tracking the {{basketball}} during dribbling {{was a very}} challenging task. Moreover, the partial or total occlusion made the tracking much more difficult when the player dribbled the ball behind the back or between the legs, {{as can be seen}} in the video “basketball_ 2.” In the 7 th frame, when {{the basketball}} was blocked by his leg, the CAM-Shift and the PF lost its position, while the VAPF and the proposed tracker <b>kept</b> <b>tracking</b> it. And in the 33 rd and 34 th frames, when dribbled behind the back, the basketball was blocked by the back, but the proposed tracker had predicted this correctly and <b>kept</b> <b>tracking</b> the ball when it appeared again.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} session was brief, as rain <b>kept</b> the <b>track</b> closed until 2 p.m. Green flag conditions only lasted 53 minutes, {{and the track}} closed for rain at 3:21 p.m.|$|R
50|$|Pole day dawned {{cool and}} damp. Overnight rain <b>kept</b> the <b>track</b> closed until shortly after 12 noon. During the first {{practice}} session, Tony Kanaan reached 223.224 mph, the fastest lap of the month.|$|R
5|$|INC {{created an}} Election control room, headed by Randeep Surjewala, {{to keep track}} of all the events and {{information}} related to campaigning. The war room was located at 15, Rakabganj Road and <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of 160 Lok Sabha constituencies where the party needed to boost its preparations. The Congress party initiated its election campaign in January 2014. It gave extra focus to the new middle class of India which was above the poverty line but not enough rich to be in middle class. This new economic class comprises 700 million people out of the country's total population of 1.2 billion. This class includes railway coolies, servants, rickshaw-pullers, labourers, fishermen, guards and other people who earn their living by doing minor chores.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Hague and Brandle {{started to go}} bad in late 1931, during construction of Jersey City Medical Center, an important project to Hague. Leo Brennan, a contractor approved by Hague without consulting Brandle, who was building a backup power station for the hospital, refused to work with Brandle's card-file system, by which he <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of union members and blacklisted those whom he disliked. The annoyed Brandle called a strike, but Brennan's workers refused; the police shut down the site after a brawl, but Brennan got court approval to continue. To placate Brandle, who threatened a strike that would stop all construction work on the center, Hague paid off Brennan and hired another contractor that Brandle had approved.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player campaign mode, Descent 3 features an online multiplayer mode where numerous players can compete {{against each other in}} eight different game types. Notable game types include Anarchy, where the objective is to kill as many opponents as possible, Capture the Flag, where two to four teams compete against each other to capture opposing flags, and Monsterball, in which players must shoot and guide a ball into their opponents' goal. Aspects such as time limit, number of players, map to play on, and selection of what weapons are allowed, among others, can be customized to match player preference. The game also features an observer mode which allows players to watch a multiplayer game as a spectator and a co-operative mode that allows players to work together to complete campaign missions. Multiplayer games support the DirectPlay, IPX, and TCP/IP protocols. Online gameplay was also possible over Parallax Online, an online gaming service which <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of players' statistics and rankings.|$|E
50|$|Rain <b>kept</b> the <b>track</b> closed until 2:11 p.m. Team Penske {{borrowed}} a Reynard chassis from Roberto Guerrero's team, and Al Unser, Jr. {{took his first}} laps in the car. In 44 laps, Unser posted a top lap of 218.050 mph.|$|R
50|$|Rain <b>kept</b> the <b>track</b> closed until 3:45 p.m. Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Thiago Medeiros {{suffered}} crashes. The brief {{session was}} ended at 5:52 p.m., as rain fell again. Sam Hornish, Jr. (224.381 mph) was the fastest {{car of the}} day.|$|R

5|$|The European Winter of 1941-1942 was {{the coldest}} {{of the twentieth}} century. On 30 November, von Bock {{reported}} to Berlin that the temperature was –45 °C (–49 °F). General Erhard Raus, commander of the 6th Panzer Division, <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of the daily mean temperature in his war diary. It shows a suddenly much colder period during 4–7 December: from –36 to –38 °C (–37 to –38 °F). Other temperature reports varied widely. Zhukov said that November's freezing weather stayed around –7 to –10°C (+19 to +14°F) Official Soviet Meteorological Service records show the lowest December temperature reached –28.8°C (–20°F). These numbers indicated severely cold conditions, and German troops were freezing with no winter clothing, using equipment that was not designed for such low temperatures. More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. Frozen grease {{had to be removed}} from every loaded shell and vehicles had to be heated for hours before use. The same cold weather, typical for the season, hit the Soviet troops, but they were better prepared.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, Hutton volunteered for the army and was recruited to the Army Physical Training Corps as a sergeant-instructor. Although no first-class cricket was played during the war, league and charity cricket matches continued and Hutton played several high-profile matches in 1940. But in March 1941, his future in cricket was threatened by a serious injury. On the last day of a commando training course in York, Hutton fell in the gymnasium when a mat slipped from under him. He suffered a fractured left forearm and dislocated his ulna at the wrist. By the summer, surgery and rest initially looked to have repaired the injury; Hutton returned to his unit and resumed cricket, scoring a century in one game. However, he began to suffer increasing pain and underwent more surgery to graft bone from his legs onto the injured arm. A first operation failed, but the second attempt at the end of 1941 eventually proved successful. The surgery left him with a left arm almost two inches shorter than the right. He was discharged from the army in the summer of 1942 and, after a period of recovery, began work as a civilian for the Royal Engineers, inspecting the condition of government-owned properties. Hutton's recovery and return to cricket was closely followed by the wartime press, which <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of many pre-war cricketers.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Cleveland's {{return to}} office, hard times struck {{the nation with}} the Panic of 1893. A {{businessman}} in Youngstown, Robert Walker, had lent money to McKinley in their younger days; in gratitude, McKinley had often guaranteed Walker's borrowings for his business. The governor had never <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> {{of what he was}} signing; he believed Walker a sound businessman. In fact, Walker had deceived McKinley, telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones. Walker was ruined by the recession; McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893. The total owed was over $100,000 and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney. Instead, McKinley's wealthy supporters, including Hanna and Chicago publisher H. H. Kohlsaat, became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid. Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property {{in the hands of the}} fund's trustees (who included Hanna and Kohlsaat), and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money. All of the couple's property was returned to them by the end of 1893, and when McKinley, who had promised eventual repayment, asked for the list of contributors, it was refused him. Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley, whose popularity grew. He was easily re-elected in November 1893, receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War.|$|E
50|$|Rain <b>kept</b> the <b>track</b> closed until nearly 1 p.m. Only {{three cars}} made {{attempts}} all afternoon, {{but none of}} them were run to completion. Johnny Rutherford went out for his second attempt in a Foyt entry, but never completed a lap due to mechanical problems.|$|R
50|$|Rain <b>kept</b> the <b>track</b> closed until 3 p.m. The {{session was}} ended about 10 minutes early when Scott Sharp crashed in turn 1. Hélio Castroneves turned the fastest lap {{of the day}} (221.156 mph). Buddy Rice was among the top 5 {{for the first time}} all week.|$|R
50|$|Ongais' crash <b>kept</b> the <b>track</b> {{closed for}} 40 minutes as crew rescued {{him from the}} car and cleared the debris. Two other yellows closed the track for another 10 minutes, and the day {{came to a close}} at 6 p.m. without a single {{qualifying}} attempt made.|$|R

25|$|The {{disaster}} led {{to insurance}} claims of around $1.4 billion USD, making {{it at that}} time the largest insured man-made catastrophe. The insurance and reinsurance claims process revealed serious weaknesses in the way insurers at Lloyd's of London and elsewhere <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of their potential exposures, and led to their procedures being reformed.|$|E
50|$|The city of Geelong in Victoria, Australia, {{operated}} {{an extensive}} tramway system from 1912 until 1956, when {{the service was}} replaced by buses.

25|$|The online {{component}} of the game uses the in-game massgate system, which is derived from Ground Control. The system helps players keep track of friends, allowing them {{to see whether they}} are online or playing a game. Clans can be created and <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of in-game, with features such as ranks and clan matches. Massgate includes leader boards and a ranking system based on US Army military ranks. Players can increase their rank and leader board position in a way similar to Battlefield 2, by accumulating earnings and scoring points, medals, and badges. Achieving higher ranks becomes progressively more difficult. The leader board also keeps track of clan rankings.|$|E
25|$|Maya rituals {{differ from}} region to region, but many similar {{patterns}} in ceremonies, whether being performed for {{individual or group}} need, have been noted. First, all rituals are preceded by foresight of a medicine man, who determines {{the day of the}} ceremony through calendrical divination. The medicine men of the Ixil Maya of Guatemala, who <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of days in their heads, would lay out red seeds from the coral tree onto the pre-Columbian calendar to count them and figure out what day best suited the specific ritual. As a symbol of a spiritual purification, the individual or individuals would observe a fasting and abstinence period before the ritual day.|$|E
25|$|To {{make matters}} {{easier for the}} youth, however, the Old Man that dwelt in the first cave the youth had {{discovered}} <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> {{of all of the}} youth's money and inventory items so that the youth could recover them again and take up from roughly the same position. Additionally, the Old Man was capable of telepathic communication with the hero and could grant the child magical abilities for short periods of time by researching spells in tomes of forbidden magic. The Old Man's ability to see clairvoyantly also enabled him to sense when certain plot elements were occurring such as the kidnapping of the great fairy or the washing up of useful items by the seashore. These events would be relayed to the hero telepathically.|$|E
50|$|Overnight {{rain and}} {{moisture}} <b>kept</b> the <b>track</b> closed until 2:00 p.m. Another shower closed it again until almost 4 o'clock.

500|$|Vincent Chorley, in {{his review}} of the album for RPGFan, praised the {{original}} game music, applauding it for [...] "conveying emotion and atmosphere, and then playing around with this mental image". As for the album itself, however, he was disappointed {{in the way that}} it merged <b>tracks</b> together and <b>kept</b> <b>tracks</b> based on a single song short, saying that [...] "many of the tracks are so short that they are impossible to enjoy in their entirety". The vinyl release was praised by Jeremy Parish of USGamer for its sound quality and the soundtrack's [...] "towering achievement in game music", but he felt that the music was not very [...] "listenable" [...] on its own, and that the album did not fit the LP format as well as an album originally produced for the format would have.|$|R

25|$|When the King traveled, Marshals {{supervised}} the local Voivodes. The Marshals decided {{who would be}} admitted to royal audience. They were the organizers and masters of royal and court ceremonies (including weddings, funerals and the like). They were the masters of the court, <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of lesser courtiers, and (where applicable) set their salaries. Each Marshal wielded a marshal's staff, which he had received from the Chancellor (Kanclerz). In exchange, all Chancellor nominations were heralded by the Marshals. If no Marshal was present, his functions were carried out by a Grand Treasurer or secular Grand Chancellor. On formal occasions and during travel, where appropriate, a Marshal with his staff of office preceded the King. Close after the Marshals in the hierarchy were the Chancellors.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the wall is the degree of control it would have provided over immigration, smuggling and customs. Limites did not strictly mark the boundaries of the empire: Roman power and influence often extended beyond the walls. People within and beyond the limes travelled through it each day when conducting business, and organised check-points like those offered by Hadrian's Wall provided good opportunities for taxation. With watch towers only a short distance from gateways in the limes, patrolling legionaries could have <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of entering and exiting natives and Roman citizens alike, charging customs dues and checking for smuggling. Another theory is of a simpler varietythat Hadrian's Wall was partly constructed to reflect the power of Rome and was used as a political point by Hadrian. Once its construction was finished, it is thought to have been covered in plaster and then whitewashed: its shining surface reflected the sunlight and was visible for miles around.|$|E
25|$|FiveThirtyEight's {{predictions}} for each state primary, {{both for the}} Republican and the Democratic party nominations, were based on statistical analysis, not on the analyst's opinions. The core data employed were polls, which FiveThirtyEight aggregated for each state (while also considering national polls) using essentially the same method it had employed since 2008. In the 2016 primaries, the projections also took into account endorsements. The website also <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> of the accumulation of national party convention delegates. In a comparison of prediction success published by Bloomberg News after the primary season was completed, FiveThirtyEight's prediction success tied for {{the highest percentage of}} correct primary poll winners, at 92%; but it lagged behind PredictWise in predicting a larger set of primaries. Notably, even with FiveThirtyEights track record of correctly predicting elections that pollsters get wrong, it still missed Bernie Sanders's upset victory in the Michigan primary, for instance, regarded as the 'one of the biggest upsets in modern political history'.|$|E
