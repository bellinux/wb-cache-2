5|$|A belief {{from the}} Leskovac region states the ala is a monster with an {{enormous}} mouth who holds in her hand a big wooden spoon, with which she grabs and devours everything that gets in her way. One story has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> a man kept such an ala in his barn; she drank thirty liters of milk every day. Another warns that ale {{in the form of}} twelve ravens used to take the crops from vineyards.|$|E
5|$|Ala can “sneak” into humans, {{gaining a}} human form while {{retaining}} their own properties. A tradition has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> an ala sneaked into St. Simeon, {{which made him}} voracious, but St. Sava took her out of him. In a tale recorded in eastern Serbia and Bulgaria, a farmer killed an ala who possessed a skinny man living in a distant village, because the ala destroyed his vineyard. In another story, an ala gets into a deceased princess and devours the soldiers on watch.|$|E

5|$|All {{publications}} and media {{were subjected to}} censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing to}} cooperate. Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to <b>it</b> <b>that</b> these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|Believing she {{has finally}} lost her sanity, Jenni {{resolves}} to be committed. She tells Eric {{that the entire}} property will be meticulously searched for the skull as a last resort. Mickey secretly steals the skull and brings it to Snow before Eric can retrieve <b>it.</b> <b>That</b> night, Eric prepares to murder Jenni and stage it as a suicide. Jenni sees Marion's ghost in Mickey's greenhouse and flees back to the house, where Eric begins throttling her. The ghost appears and chases Eric outside, corners and attacks him, drowning him in the decorative pond.|$|E
5|$|Boosted by this spiritual experience, Afonso won {{the battle}} against an outnumbering enemy. Legend has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Afonso killed the five Moorish kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja taifas, before decimating the enemy troops. Hence, in {{gratitude}} to Jesus, he incorporated five shields arranged in a cross—representing his divine-led victory over the five enemy kings—with each one carrying Christ's five wounds {{in the form of}} silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscariot's thirty pieces of silver.|$|E

5|$|Caldas has a {{tradition}} of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of molasses brown thread on white linen, and on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.|$|E

5|$|During the war the {{chancellery}} was destroyed, {{except for}} the exterior walls, by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin in 1945.

5|$|Early Greek {{sources have}} <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Philomela {{was turned into}} a swallow, which has no song; Procne turns into a nightingale, singing a {{beautiful}} but sad song in remorse. Later sources, among them Ovid, Hyginus, and the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats write that although she was tongueless, Philomela {{was turned into a}} nightingale, and Procne into a swallow. Eustathius' version of the story has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.|$|E
5|$|From about 627 onwards, Edwin was {{the most}} {{powerful}} king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the Isle of Man, and Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the subjection of Wessex, and his recent successes added to his power and authority. The imperium, as Bede calls <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> Edwin possessed was later equated {{with the idea of}} a Bretwalda, a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century. Put simply, success confirmed Edwin's overlordship, and failure would diminish it.|$|E

In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a Communist-oriented paper.

5|$|In the König-class ships, each gun turret had {{a working}} chamber beneath <b>it</b> <b>that</b> was {{connected}} to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below.

On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration, although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E
