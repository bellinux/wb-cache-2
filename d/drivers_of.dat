5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe conduct {{multilevel}} {{analyses of}} Norwegian data {{and find that}} related industrial variety is a positive regional <b>driver</b> <b>of</b> enterprise innovation. Unrelated variety is a negative regional <b>driver</b> <b>of</b> enterprise productivity. This implies that regions {{with high levels of}} related variety and low levels of unrelated variety optimize enterprise performance. We argue that regional specialization is a two-dimensional construct inversely associated with related and unrelated variety. Thus, a specialized region (low in unrelated variety) is in fact a <b>driver</b> <b>of</b> enterprise productivity. In addition, we find that population density is another regional <b>driver</b> <b>of</b> enterprise productivity...|$|R

5|$|Ayrton Senna was a Brazilian racing {{driver who}} won three Formula One world championships. He entered Formula One in 1984 with the Toleman team, but after one season, {{he moved to}} Lotus. He spent three seasons with Lotus before moving to McLaren in 1988. Over the next five years, the intense rivalry between Senna and Alain Prost, a leading Formula One driver, came to the forefront, with {{particularly}} notable race incidents and collisions occurring between the two. Senna won all three of his world championships during his six seasons with McLaren, in 1988, 1990 and 1991. He wanted to move to Williams after 1992, but was prevented from doing so by a clause in Alain Prost's contract. He moved to Williams in 1994, but during the third race of the season, {{he was killed in}} an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital.

At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie {{got back into the}} motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Gugelmin, {{like many}} Brazilian <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> his generation, {{moved to the}} United Kingdom to further his racing career. He was a {{longtime}} friend of future Formula One world champion Ayrton Senna, who was already racing in the UK, and the two shared a house from 1982 to 1987. Senna, having previously been a Formula Ford driver with the Van Diemen team, used his influence within the organisation to secure Gugelmin a race seat with them for 1982. By the end of the year, Gugelmin was British Formula Ford 1600cc champion. He followed this up by finishing as runner-up in the British Formula Ford 2000cc series the following year. He moved to the European Formula Ford series in 1984, and won the title at his first attempt. A step up to Formula Three followed in 1985 with West Surrey Racing, winning the British championship and the prestigious Macau Grand Prix. Gugelmin then spent two years in Formula 3000, the final step before Formula One. Gugelmin took one victory in Formula 3000, at Silverstone in 1987 while driving for the Ralt factory team.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> heavy trucks. A {{major problem}} for the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E
