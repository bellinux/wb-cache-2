40|$|The {{discovery}} of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{a few decades ago}} initiated a global impact on the entirety of the medical and life sciences research spheres. Nowadays, essentially all laboratories focusing on such vital research employ in-house PCR techniques on a near-daily basis, due to the wide spectrum of applications which PCR technology can adopt itself to. Unfortunately, ubiquitously available and affordable technologies, such as RT-qPCR, do have a major passive drawback: inter-laboratory reproducibility.

40|$|SummaryDespite the {{importance}} of the insect nervous system for functional and developmental neuroscience, descriptions of insect brains have suffered from a lack of uniform nomenclature.

40|$|Thirty {{years of}} {{research}} into petroleum microbiology and bioremediation have bypassed an important observation – that many hydrocarbon contaminated sites posing potential risks to human health harbour weathered, ‘mid-distillate’ or heavy oils (Pollard, 2003). Ex-situ biopiling is an important technology for treating soils contaminated with weathered hydrocarbons. However, its performance continues to be represented by reference to reductions in the hydrocarbon ‘load’ in the soils being treated, rather than reductions in the risks posed by the hydrocarbon contamination (Owens and Bourgouin, 2003; Tien et al., 1999). The absence of ‘risk’ from the vocabulary of many operators and remediation projects reduces stakeholder (regulatory, investor, landowner, and public) confidence in remediation technologies, and subsequently limits the market potential of these technologies. Stakeholder confidence in the biopiling of weathered hydrocarbons may therefore be improved by demonstrating process optimisation within a validated risk management framework.

THE ISSUE focuses on traffic, health and the environment to achieve intelligent solutions for sustaining urban economies by bringing together innovative research-driven clusters to coordinate European research and technology development in six areas. These comprise ITS; transport impacts on urban mobility; transport greening; intermodal regional transport; safety and security of citizens; and associated economic, health and environmental impacts. THE ISSUE project particularly addresses the use of space technologies from satellite remote sensing and navigation, as well as GIS and computer intelligence technologies in transport-related sectors. This paper specifically looks into the planned Master Classes program. THE ISSUE project comprises research clusters from the East Midlands Region in the UK, the Midi-Pyrenees and Aquitaine Regions in France, the Molise Region in Italy and the Mazovia Region in Poland. Each region has set up a three-way partnership between regional authorities, academic partners, and industry contributors working to draw together the industry and academic strengths in the regions and connect the research with the needs of managing traffic, transport, and air quality that the regional bodies are responsible for. The three-year project is supporting scientists, engineers and development agencies from the different regions to work together, using the latest space and information technologies, to develop more effective methods of easing road congestion and improving the urban environment. As part of THE ISSUE project "Master Class" knowledge exchange programmes will be developed using material from the earlier review of applicable technology and expertise within the THE <b>ISSUE</b> <b>consortium.</b> Two variants will be developed, one focussing on senior management and policy/strategy makers and the other with a focus on technical awareness and implementation.

The following month, the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26.7, indicating a slightly above average season. Over next two months, however, fluctuations in sea surface temperatures, particularly those in the Central Pacific, caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast. A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts to indicate a near-average season in their final August forecast update, which predicted 27tropical storms.

40|$|Abstract Sustainable ICT (SICT) {{can develop}} {{solutions}} that offer benefits both internally in IT {{and across the}} extended enterprise. However, because the field is new and evolving, few guidelines and best practices are available. There {{is a need to}} improve the SICT behaviours, practices and processes within organizations to deliver greater value from SICT. To address the <b>issue,</b> a <b>consortium</b> of leading organizations from industry, the nonprofits sector, and academia decided to develop a framework for systematically assessing and improving SICT capabilities. The SICT Capability Maturity Framework (SICT-CMF) gives organizations a vital tool to manage their sustainability capability. The framework provides a comprehensive value-based model for organizing, evaluating, planning, and managing SICT capabilities. Using the framework, organizations can assess the maturity of their SICT capability and systematically improve capabilities in a measurable way to meet the sustainability objectives including reducing environmental impacts and increasing profitability. The core of SICT-CMF is a maturity model for SICT which provides a management system with associated improvement roadmaps that guide senior IT and business management in selecting strategies to continuously improve, develop, and manage the sustainable IT capability. This chapter describes the SICT-CMF and the use of it to determine the maturity of sustainable IT capability within a number of leading organisations. The chapter highlights the challenges in managing SICT and motivates the benefit of maturity models. The development process for the SICT-CMF is discussed and the role of Design Science in the development cycle is explored. The application of the resulting model and its use to measure SICT maturity is discussed together with an analysis of the average results for organisations using the model.

Key issues that will be discussed include: faculty development, technology roles - from remote imaging transmitted to the classroom to iPod lecture series and field assignments, credit transfer among Consortium members, faculty recruitment, funding course development, and innovation in course delivery. The epicenter of discussion is meeting the needs of students currently employed who cannot afford time or cost to relocate at a university campus to complete graduate courses or degree programs, meeting needs of natural resource agencies (federal, state and local), and future roles of professional societies (professional licensing and certifications). Among the futures issues will be presentations on meeting the needs of the agencies with hybrid (on-line and in the field) courses, Blended Learning (using multiple media technologies to teach a single lesson), and the new role of the employee’s career development system, e. g. DoILearn (Department of the Interior) and AgLearn (Department of Agriculture). Presenters will introduce <b>issues</b> the <b>Consortium</b> faces such as, developing and maintaining active course listings, common structure to on-line course listings, “what our students want, and what our agency clients want!”, “academic credits from accredited institutions”; understanding Learning and Content Management Systems with focus on knowledge, skills and abilities, and linkages between extension faculty and faculty in graduate programs. Presenters also will focus on the contemporary issues of faculty recruitment and development, linkages between the Land Grant/McIntire-Stennis natural resource colleges to the State Colleges, and private sector venders contracting to Federal and State agencies. The NRDL Consortium Policies and Procedures (draft) will be introduced. Consortium members: Virginia Tech, Stephen F.
