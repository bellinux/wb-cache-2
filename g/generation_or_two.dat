25|$|Until late in {{the fourth}} century the united Empire {{retained}} sufficient power to launch attacks against its enemies in Germania and in the Sassanid Empire. Receptio of barbarians became widely practiced: imperial authorities admitted potentially hostile groups into the Empire, split them up, and allotted to them lands, status, and duties within the imperial system. In this way many groups provided unfree workers (coloni) for Roman landowners, and recruits (laeti) for the Roman army. Sometimes their leaders became officers. Normally the Romans managed the process carefully, with sufficient military force on hand to ensure compliance, and cultural assimilation followed over the next <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E

25|$|By the mid-eighties {{the stock}} of {{purebred}} mares had dwindled to just a handful, though there were some mares only a <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> removed. In 1983 a group of supporters formed a special breed association {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Weser-Ems Studbook, approving stallions that were half-Hanoverian, half-Ostfriesen or Alt-Oldenburg. However, as the mares themselves were typically only halfbred, the foals did not have the desired type, and furthermore the genepool was simply too small. To replenish it, the breeders looked to the studs where Ostfriesen/Alt-Oldenburger stallions had stood for generations, picking up a few horses here and there. More horses came from greater strongholds: Silesian Heavy Warmbloods of Poland, the Danish Oldenbourgs, and the Groningen horse of the Netherlands. But the efforts of Dr. Herta Steiner, Moritzburg State Stud Equerry, were the keystone to saving the breed. She had championed for the last remaining heavy warmbloods in Saxony and Thuringia. Soon the old type was revived.|$|E
25|$|Giovanni died in 1429. According to Lorenzo, {{his fortune}} upon {{his death was}} worth around 180,000 gold florins. His death did not greatly affect the bank's operations, and the {{transition}} to Cosimo went smoothly, aided by Ilarione, who was retained as ministro. Fortunately for the bank, Lorenzo di Giovanni di Bicci de Medici was on excellent terms with Cosimo, and did not insist on dissolving the partnerships so he could receive {{his share of the}} patrimony (primogeniture not being operative here); many Florentine banks and mercantile businesses lasted only a <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> because some of the inheriting sons usually wished to strike out on their own. At this time, the Medici bank was flourishing: besides the branches in Rome and Florence, the Venetian and Genevan branches had been founded. Ilarione would not last long in his position, and is mentioned as dead in a letter written in February 1433. The timing was unfortunate because the Albizzi government of Florence was moving against the young Medici-led resistance (galvanized by the Albizzi government's failure in a war against Lucca and Milan), culminating in Cosimo's exile to Venice. Despite the unfavorable politics in this period of the bank's history, its Italian branches turned in bumper profits, with as much as 62% of the total coming from Rome (in 1427, the Roman branch of the Medici bank had approximately 100,000 florins on deposit from the Papal Curia; in comparison, the total capitalization of the entire Medici bank was only about 25,000 gold florins) and 13% from Venice between 1420 and 1435 (with the later Medici branches opened in Bruges, London, Pisa, Avignon, Milan, and Lyon contributing nothing as they had not been founded yet). At this time, there seems to have been some sort of Medici office in Basel, and it seems to have lasted until 1443. De Roover speculates that it was a sub-branch of the Medici bank's Geneva branch serving the General Council of the Church, and was closed when the Council no longer made it worth their while to maintain it.|$|E

2500|$|Refuge in Israel was {{not without}} its tragedies: [...] "in a <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> millennia of rooted Oriental civilization, unified even in its diversity,” had been wiped out, writes Mizrahi scholar Ella Shohat. The trauma of rupture from their {{countries}} of origin was further complicated by {{the difficulty of the}} transition upon arrival in Israel; Mizrahi immigrants and refugees were placed in rudimentary and hastily erected tent cities (Ma'abarot) often in development towns on the peripheries of Israel. Settlement in Moshavim (cooperative farming villages) was only partially successful, because Mizrahim had historically filled a niche as craftsmen and merchants and most did not traditionally engage in farmwork. As the majority left their property behind in their home countries as they journeyed to Israel, many suffered a severe decrease in their socio-economic status aggravated by their cultural and political differences with the dominant Ashkenazi community. Furthermore, a policy of austerity was enforced at that time due to economic hardships.|$|E

Moreover, loss of control over these cell fate decisions might lead to cellular transformation and cancer. This review addresses the current understandings of the molecular mechanisms that regulate hematopolietic stem cell self-renewal in the niche and how leukemic transformation might change the dependency of leukemic stem cells on their microenvironment for self-renewal and survival...|$|R

5000|$|Social {{mobility}} is {{the movement}} of individuals, social groups or categories of people between the layers or strata in a stratification system. This movement can be intragenerational (within a <b>generation)</b> <b>or</b> intergenerational (between <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more <b>generations).</b> Such mobility is sometimes used to classify different systems of social stratification. Open stratification systems are those that allow for mobility between strata, typically by placing value on the achieved status characteristics of individuals.

[...] Those systems in which there is little to no mobility, even on an intergenerational basis, are considered closed stratification systems.
