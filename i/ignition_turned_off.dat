50|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} battery usage, a petrol driven heater is fully integrated to vehicle. It typically takes 5 to 10 minutes to warm and provides excellent cabin heating. It takes several {{minutes for the}} heater to run down and will therefore continue to operate after the <b>ignition</b> is <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
50|$|The FJR1300 has an {{electrically}} adjusted windshield {{controlled by}} a rocker switch on the handlebars. In Gen I and Gen II models, by default the shield returns to its lowest position when the key is off, however some riders choose to disable the 'return' function. In the Gen III model the windshield maintains its position until changed with the rocker switch, even when the <b>ignition</b> is <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another {{potential}} [...] "run on" [...] problem {{after an}} <b>ignition</b> has been <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> {{can be attributed}} to an inlet valve(s) that are not sealing fully allowing the piston motion to pull a fuel mixture in when technically the valve is shut.|$|R
50|$|Power {{windows are}} usually {{inoperable}} {{when the car}} is not running. This is primarily a security feature. It would be a simple thing to allow electric power windows to be operable when the <b>ignition</b> is <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> however it would also make the car much easier to steal. Some systems offer the compromise of leaving power applied to the windows until a passenger door is opened at which time the window power is removed.|$|R
50|$|Features {{offered on}} Sebring coupes {{included}} 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, adaptive automatic transmissions and fully independent suspensions, {{along with a}} host of power operated features. Sebring also offered variable speed rack and pinion steering, 17 inch aluminum wheels with GoodYear Eagle tires, 4-wheel double wishbone suspension, one-touch power windows, one-touch moonroof, electrochromic mirror with compass, power accessory delay ignition (which allowed occupants to operate power window switches when <b>ignition</b> is <b>turned</b> <b>off),</b> and Homelink universal transmitter, among other options.|$|R
30|$|Dual-Vision XC cameras, {{manufactured}} by Rosco Vision Systems, were {{installed in the}} vehicles by a qualified technician. Cameras were mounted under the rear view mirror, providing {{a view of the}} forward roadway and of the driver’s face. An infrared illuminator was installed in each vehicle for nighttime video recording. The cameras also included an embedded GPS system. Cameras were set to automatically begin recording audio, video, and GPS data as soon as the vehicle <b>ignition</b> was <b>turned</b> on by the driver and to stop recording when the vehicle <b>ignition</b> was <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> Video data were recorded at 3.5 frames per second at standard VGA resolution.|$|R
50|$|A {{power antenna}} is an {{electrically}} motorized automotive radio antenna that raises and lowers either manually with a dash-mounted switch or automatically {{by turning the}} radio on or off. The automatic kind will also lower when the <b>ignition</b> switch is <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> Unlike most car antennas adjusted directly by hand, power antennas retract completely beneath the surface that they are mounted on. This convenience appeared on luxury cars {{as early as the}} mid-1950s. The automatic power antenna first appeared in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|An {{ignition}} interlock interrupts {{the signal}} from the ignition to the starter until a valid breath sample is provided that meets minimal alcohol guidelines in that state. At that point, the vehicle can be started as normal. At random times after the engine has been started, the IID will require another breath sample. The purpose {{of this is to}} prevent someone other than the driver from providing a breath sample. If the breath sample isn't provided, or the sample exceeds the ignition interlock's preset blood alcohol level, the device will log the event, warn the driver, and then start up an alarm (e.g., lights flashing, horn honking) until the <b>ignition</b> is <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> or a clean breath sample has been provided. A common misconception is that interlock devices will simply <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the engine if alcohol is detected; this would, however, create an unsafe driving situation and expose interlock manufacturers to considerable liability.|$|R
5000|$|For 1957 {{the front}} bumper was reshaped, the grille and tailfins were made larger, and larger tail-lights were fitted. The spare wheel moved {{back inside the}} trunk, which had been {{redesigned}} {{to allow it to}} be mounted vertically. The side [...] "Thunderbird" [...] script moved from the fins to the front fenders. A new option was [...] "Dial-o-Matic" [...] 4-way power seats that would move rearward when the <b>ignition</b> was <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> to allow easier exit and entry. In addition to the standard 292 and optional 312 engines, higher performance versions of the 312 were offered, including two with McCulloch superchargers rated at 300 and [...] respectively. 1957 sales were 21,380, including three extra months of production because the 1958 models were late. The 1957 Thunderbird was the last two-seater Ford sold until the 1982 Ford EXP sport compact car.|$|R
25|$|The Multi-information display, {{located in}} the center of the tachometer, can be toggled through nine {{different}} screens of vehicle information including instantaneous fuel economy, hybrid system schematic, trip computer, and ECO Guide. The ECO Guide display includes a real-time graphic that provides a target zone for acceleration and deceleration in order to achieve maximum fuel economy. When the <b>ignition</b> switch is <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> a summary screen displays a scoring function that encourages drivers to take an interest in developing fuel-efficient driving habits over the long term. In this manner, drivers can earn additional ‘leaves’ on a plant stem when practicing fuel saving strategies. Long-term fuel efficient driving habits ultimately earn the driver a ‘trophy’ graphic.|$|R
5000|$|GPS tracking: The device {{fits into}} the vehicle and captures the GPS {{location}} information apart from other vehicle information at regular intervals to a central server. Other vehicle information can include fuel amount, engine temperature, altitude, reverse geocoding, door open/close, tire pressure, cut <b>off</b> fuel, <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>ignition,</b> <b>turn</b> on headlight, turn on taillight, battery status, GSM area code/cell code decoded, number of GPS satellites in view, glass open/close, fuel amount, emergency button status, cumulative idling, computed odometer, engine RPM, throttle position, GPRS status and a lot more. Capability of these devices actually decide the final capability of the whole tracking system; most vehicle tracking systems, {{in addition to providing}} the vehicle's location data, feature a wide range of communication ports {{that can be used to}} integrate other on board systems, allowing to check their status and control or automate their operation.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power outlets (cigarette lighter outlets) of two vehicles. While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, {{the amount of}} current available through such a connection is small. This method works by slowly recharging the battery, not by providing the current needed for cranking. The engine cranking motor current draw will exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette lighter outlet. Many vehicles <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> the cigarette lighter outlets when the key is <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> making the technique unusable unless the <b>ignition</b> key is <b>turned</b> to the accessory or on position to connect the cigarette lighter outlet to the battery.|$|R
5000|$|Turning on/off: Tethered Aptus {{automatically}} {{turns on}} when the computer is turned on, and autocratically <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> when the computer is <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> Credo must be <b>turned</b> on and <b>off</b> manually, and also <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> automatically {{after a period of}} idle time.|$|R
5000|$|The oil {{pressure}} idiot light lights when engine {{oil pressure}} drops below a predetermined level. The light normally appears when the vehicle <b>ignition</b> is <b>turned</b> on, but the engine is not running, as it detects no oil pressure due to the oil pump not operating (the oil pump is powered off the crankshaft, so only operates when the engine is running). It normally <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> a few seconds after engine start as the oil pump starts working and building up oil pressure. This tell-tale can bear the legend [...] or a pictogram of an oil can. Some cars illuminate the light red or yellow, depending on the action needed to be taken.|$|R

5000|$|Just {{as humans}} can be killed or {{otherwise}} disabled, computers can be <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> One challenge is that, if being <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> prevents it from achieving its current goals, a superintelligence would likely {{try to prevent}} its being <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> Just as humans have systems in place to deter or protect themselves from assailants, such a superintelligence would have a motivation to engage in [...] "strategic planning" [...] to prevent itself being <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> This could involve: ...|$|R
50|$|The Emitter <b>Turn</b> <b>Off</b> Thyristor (ETO) {{is a type}} of {{thyristor}} {{that uses}} a MOSFET to turn on and <b>turn</b> <b>off.</b> It combines the advantages of both the GTO and MOSFET.

50|$|During <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> {{the forward}} voltage {{of the device}} must be limited until the current tails off. The limit is usually around 20% of the forward {{blocking}} voltage rating. If the voltage rises too fast at <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> {{not all of the}} device will <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> and the GTO will fail, often explosively, due to the high voltage and current focused on {{a small portion of the}} device. Substantial snubber circuits are added around the device to limit the rise of voltage at <b>turn</b> <b>off.</b> Reseting the snubber circuit usually places a minimum on time requirement on GTO based circuits.|$|R
40|$|An {{exploratory}} study compared {{the prevalence of}} multiple types of condom-associated ‘turn offs’ in men and women. Nearly 2000 people completed a web-based questionnaire. Data were analysed from 464 {{men and women who}} reported that condoms had <b>turned</b> them <b>off</b> the last time they were used. Gender differences were not observed for the majority (9) of 15 <b>turn</b> <b>offs.</b> The most common <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> related to loss of pleasure. For example, more than three-quarters of the men and nearly 40 % of the women reported decreased sexual sensation (P = 0. 0001). Putting on condoms was reported by 43. 2 % of the men versus 30. 2 % of the women (P = 0. 02). Smell was a relatively frequent <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> with about one-third indicating this issue and no significant gender difference (P = 0. 32). <b>Turn</b> <b>offs</b> pertaining to arousal and orgasm were also common. Findings suggest that numerous physical and psychological condom <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> may be experienced by men and women while using male condoms. Although some <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> differed as a function of gender, there was remarkable similarity between men and wome...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To further {{improve the}} energy {{efficiency}} of heterogeneous networks, a separation architecture called hyper-cellular network (HCN) has been proposed, which decouples the control signaling and data transmission functions. Specifically, the control coverage is guaranteed by macro base stations (MBSs), whereas small cells (SCs) are only utilized for data transmission. Under HCN, SCs can be dynamically <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> when traffic load decreases for energy saving. A fundamental problem then arises: how many SCs can be <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> as traffic varies? In this paper, we {{address this problem}} in a theoretical way, where two sleeping schemes (i. e., random and repulsive schemes) with vertical inter-layer offloading are considered. Analytical results indicate the following facts: (1) Under the random scheme where SCs are <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> with certain probability, the expected ratio of sleeping SCs is inversely proportional to the traffic load of SC-layer and decreases linearly with the traffic load of MBS-layer; (2) The repulsive scheme, which only <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> the SCs close to MBSs, is less sensitive to the traffic variations; (3) deploying denser MBSs enables <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> more SCs, which may help to improve network energy-efficiency. Numerical results show that about 50 % SCs can be <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> on average under the predefined daily traffic profiles, and 10 % more SCs can be further <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> with inter-layer channel borrowing.
