40|$|This article {{argues that}} an autopoietic {{perspective}} of human communities would allow to understand societies as self-organized systems and thus promote information literacy {{as a facilitator}} of social development. Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) social dynamics generate public information available worldwide in digital repositories, websites and bibliographic resources. However, processing such amount of data is not achievable by a single central-controlled system. We claim that distributed and heterogeneous networks of coordinated mechanisms, composed by both specialized human and artificial agents, are needed to improve information retrieval, knowledge inference and decision-making, but also to produce social value, <b>goods</b> and <b>services.</b> <b>Handling</b> these issues implies the collective construction of global semantic networks but also the active labor of knowledge producers and consumers. We conclude that information literacy is as much important as any technical implementation and, therefore, may lead to networks of Commons-oriented communities which would utilize P 2 P infrastructuresVasilis Kostakis acknowledges funding for facilities used in this research by IUT (19 - 13) of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Researc...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} decentralized multi-project scheduling under uncertainty. The problem instance {{we study}} is the scheduling of airport ground <b>handling</b> <b>services,</b> where aircraft turnarounds {{can be seen as}} multiple projects, ground <b>handling</b> <b>services</b> as activities, and service providers as resources. In this environment aircraft requiring ground <b>handling</b> <b>services</b> and the corresponding service providers are self-interested autonomous parties. Moreover, the environment is well-known for its large number of disturbances. We employ a heterogeneous multiagent scheduling framework with two types of autonomous agents representing aircraft and ground service providers respectively. We use online scheduling to cope with uncertainty in the release time of project: the uncertainty in aircraft arrival time at an airport...|$|R
