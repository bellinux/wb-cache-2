40|$|Spatial data (e. g., points) have {{extensive}} applications in practice, such as spatial databases, Location-Based Services, spatial computing, social analyses, computational geometry, graph design, medical imaging, etc. Geometric queries, such as <b>geometric</b> <b>range</b> queries (i. e., finding points inside a <b>geometric</b> <b>range)</b> and nearest neighbor queries (i. e., finding the closest {{point to a}} given point), are fundamental primitives to analyze and retrieve information over spatial data. For example, a medical researcher can query a spatial dataset to collect information about patients in a certain geometric area to predict {{whether there will be}} a dangerous outbreak of a particular disease (e. g., Ebola or Zika). With the dramatic increase on the scale and size of data, many companies and organizations are outsourcing significant amounts of data, including significant amounts of spatial data, to public cloud data services in order to minimize data storage and query processing costs. For instance, major companies and organizations, such as Yelp, Foursquare and NASA, are using Amazon Web Services as their public cloud data services, which can save billions of dollars per year for those companies and organizations. However, due to the existence of attackers (e. g., a curious administrator or a hacker) on remote servers, users are worried about the leakage of their private data while storing and querying those data on public clouds. Searchable Encryption (SE) is an innovative technique to protect the data privacy of users on public clouds without losing search functionalities on the server side. Specifically, a user can encrypt its data with SE before outsourcing data to a public server, and this public server is able to search encrypted data without decryption. Many SE schemes have been proposed to support simple queries, such as keyword search. Unfortunately, how to efficiently and securely support geometric queries over encrypted spatial data remains open. In this dissertation, to protect the privacy of spatial data in public clouds while still maintaining search functions without decryption, we propose a set of new SE solutions to support geometric queries, including <b>geometric</b> <b>range</b> queries and nearest neighbor queries, over encrypted spatial data. The major contributions of this dissertation focus on two aspects. First, we enrich search functionalities by designing new solutions to carry out secure fundamental geometric search queries, which were not supported in previous works. Second, we minimize the performance gap between theory and practice by building novel schemes to perform geometric queries with highly efficient search time and updates over large-scale encrypted spatial data. Specifically, we first design a scheme supporting circular range queries (i. e., retrieving points inside a circle) over encrypted spatial data. Instead of directly evaluating compute-then-compare operations, which are inefficient over encrypted data, we use a set of concentric circles to represent a circular range query, and then verify whether a data point is on any of those concentric circles by securely evaluating inner products over encrypted data. Next, to enrich search functionalities, we propose a new scheme, which can support arbitrary <b>geometric</b> <b>range</b> queries, such as circles, triangles and polygons in general, over encrypted spatial data. By leveraging the properties of Bloom filters, we convert a <b>geometric</b> <b>range</b> search problem to a membership testing problem, which can be securely evaluated with inner products. Moving a step forward, we also build another new scheme, which not only supports arbitrary <b>geometric</b> <b>range</b> queries and sub-linear search time but also enables highly efficient updates. Finally, we address the problem of secure nearest neighbor search on encrypted large-scale datasets. Specifically, we modify the algorithm of nearest neighbor search in advanced tree structures (e. g., R-trees) by simplifying operations, where evaluating comparisons alone on encrypted data is sufficient to efficiently and correctly find nearest neighbors over datasets with millions of tuples...|$|E

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{approach for}} receiver differential code biases (DCB) estimation is proposed with the BDS {{data obtained from}} a regional tracking network. In contrast to the conventional methods for BDS receiver DCB estimation, the proposed method {{does not require a}} complicated ionosphere model, as long as one reference station receiver DCB is known. The main idea for this method is that the ionosphere delay is highly dependent on the <b>geometric</b> <b>ranges</b> between the BDS satellite and the receiver normally. Therefore, the non-reference station receivers DCBs in this regional area can be estimated using single difference (SD) with reference stations. The numerical results show that the RMS of these estimated BDS receivers DCBs errors over 30 days are about 0. 3 ns. Additionally, after deduction of these estimated receivers DCBs and knowing satellites DCBs, the extractive diurnal VTEC showed a good agreement with the diurnal VTEC gained from the GIM interpolation, indicating the reliability of the estimated receivers DCBs...|$|R

40|$|Background Water is {{essential}} for health. The ‘Water is Cool in School’ campaign promoted improved drinking water access in UK schools. Implementation has been patchy, and impact has not been studied. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine whether fluid intake and frequency of toilet visits are associated with children’s access to drinking water in the classroom. Methods A total of 145 schoolchildren in Year 2 (aged 6 – 7 years) and 153 in Year 5 (aged 9 – 10 years) classes were studied in six Southampton schools. Total fluid intake and toilet visits were recorded during one school day. Schools were recruited according to drinking policy: ‘prohibited access’ = water prohibited in classroom; ‘limited access’ = water allowed in classroom but not on the desk; and ‘free access’ = water bottle encouraged on the desk. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results In total, 120 children in prohibited access, 91 in limited access and 87 in free access settings were recruited. Total fluid intake was significantly higher in Year 2 free access schools (<b>geometric</b> mean 293, <b>range</b> 104 – 953 mL) compared with prohibited access schools (<b>geometric</b> mean 189, <b>range</b> 0 – 735 mL, P = 0. 046), in Year 5 free access schools (<b>geometric</b> mean 489, <b>range</b> 88 – 1200 mL) compared with prohibited access schools (<b>geometric</b> mean 206, <b>range</b> 0 – 953 mL, P = 0. 001), and in free access versus limited access schools (<b>geometric</b> mean 219, <b>range</b> 0 – 812 mL, P = 0. 003). A total of 81 % and 80 % of children in prohibited and limited access schools, respectively, consumed below the minimum recommended amount of total fluid at school, compared with 46. 5 % in the free access schools. In total, 34. 6 % of children did not use the toilets at all during the school day. There was no trend observed between water access and frequency of toilet visits (median of 1 trip for each group, P = 0. 605). Conclusion Most children have an inadequate fluid intake in school. Free access to drinking water in class is associated with improved total fluid intake. Primary schools should promote water drinking in class. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Geostationary (GEO) {{satellites}} form {{an indispensable}} {{component of the}} constellation of Beidou navigation system (BDS). The ephemerides, or predicted orbits of these GEO satellites(GEOs), are broadcast to positioning, navigation, and timing users. User equivalent ranging error (UERE) based on broadcast message is better than 1. 5 m (root formal errors: RMS) for GEO satellites. However, monitoring of UERE indicates that the orbital prediction precision is significantly degraded when the Sun {{is close to the}} Earth&# 39;s equatorial plane (or near spring or autumn Equinox). Error source analysis shows that the complicated solar radiation pressure on satellite buses and the simple box-wing model maybe the major contributor to the deterioration of orbital precision. With the aid of BDS&# 39; two-way frequency and time transfer between the GEOs and Beidou time (BDT, that is maintained at the master control station), we propose a new orbit determination strategy, namely three-step approach of the multi-satellite precise orbit determination (MPOD).
