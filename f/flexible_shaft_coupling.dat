40|$|Development and {{application}} of pneumatic <b>flexible</b> <b>shaft</b> couplings {{have been in the}} center of our department research activities for a long time. These couplings are able to change torsional stiffness by changing pressure in their flexible elements – air bellows. Until now we have dealt with the use of pneumatic <b>flexible</b> <b>shaft</b> couplings for tuning mechanical systems working with periodically alternating load torque at steady state. Some mechanical systems, however, operate with a static load torque at constant speed (e. g. hoists, elevators, etc.), where it is necessary to consider the suitability of <b>shaft</b> <b>coupling</b> in terms of load torque at transient conditions (run-up and braking). Therefore we decided to analyze the use of pneumatic <b>flexible</b> <b>shaft</b> couplings also in this type of mechanical systems on an example of conveyor belt drive...|$|R

[...] The propulsor was perhaps as much as 50% more efficient than a propeller, producing the same speed at lower revolutions, thus reducing the noise signature. In addition all pipework connections to equipment on the main machinery raft had expansion/flexible coupling connections, which also reduced noise.

40|$|Mechanical {{systems with}} {{combustion}} engines, compressors, pumps and fans, {{can be characterized}} as torsional oscillating mechanical systems (TOMS). It is therefore necessary to control their dangerous torsional vibrations. It was confirmed that dangerous torsional vibration can be reduced to acceptable level by an appropriate adjustment, respectively by tuning the TOMS. According to several authors, the most appropriate way of system tuning is application of suitable flexible element, which is <b>flexible</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>coupling.</b> It turned out that one of the types of shaft couplings, which are particularly suited to meeting this objective are pneumatic flexible shaft couplings, to act as so-called pneumatic tuners of torsional oscillations. The issue of research and development of pneumatic tuners of torsional oscillations, among other things is, long-term in the focus of the author. The existence of tuners creates the opportunity to develop new ways of tuning torsional oscillating mechanical systems. The author of the scientific article will focus on the characteristics of developed pneumatic tuners of torsional oscillation in terms of their design, construction, function, significance advantages and conditions imposed on pneumatic tuners {{based on the results of}} his patent activity. Simultaneously provides information about the characteristic properties of pneumatic tuners of torsional oscillations in the general design...|$|E
40|$|High {{speed drive}} shafts are {{traditionally}} balanced using trim balance weights {{applied to the}} shaft ends. This paper considers the development and theoretical analysis of a novel and alternative strategy of balancing long <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>shafts,</b> whereby the trim balancing weights are applied by the means {{of a pair of}} 'Balancing Sleeve' arms that are integrally attached to each end of the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft.</b> The trim balance weights are intended to apply a corrective centrifugal force to the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft</b> in order to limit shaft end reaction forces. With increasing speed, the magnitude of the corrective force also increases due to the flexibility of the balance sleeve. This thereby counteracts the increased <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft</b> unbalance resulting from its own flexibility. Additionally, it is also found that the mechanism imparts a corrective bending moment to the <b>coupling</b> <b>shaft</b> ends, which has a tendency to limit deflection. The methodology is modelled as a rotating simply supported shaft with uniform eccentricity and allows application to the problem of drivetrain balancing of sub- 15 MW industrial gas turbines. Results show that reaction loads can theoretically be reduced from 10, 000 N to approximately zero. The bending moment applied to the shaft is also shown to reduce shaft deflection theoretically to zero. In practical applications this will be unrealistic and achievable results show deflection theoretically reduced by half. Analysis of the balance sleeve feasibility is considered through use of a three-dimensional finite element model. Further to this paper, the aim is to develop a full dynamic model of both shaft and counterbalance sleeve, with verification coming from scaled, experimental test facilities.
