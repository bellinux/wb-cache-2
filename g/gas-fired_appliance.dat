To formalize energy conservation efforts in the U. S., minimum efficiency standards were {{set forth in the}} National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA). To ensure that all important considerations concerning <b>gas-fired</b> <b>appliances</b> were included in the U. S. Department of Energy's analysis for technological feasibility and economic justification, the NAECA-related information deployment program aimed to provide well-documented research findings regarding codes and standards issues to ensure that rulemaking does not force manufacturers to meet standards by making gas appliances less cost-effective for rate payers and less competitive in the marketplace. The project covered many technical issues regarding the application and cost-effectiveness of options for increasing the efficiency of gas-fired furnaces, boilers, and direct heating equipment: first cost, maintenance cost, energy cost, degree of efficiency improvement, and effect on appliance utility. The report describes the program and its relationship to other GRI programs, and includes summary abstracts from task reports, all of which are cited in the reference section. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy [© International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] EC funded Naturalhy project is assessing the potential for using the existing gas infrastructure for conveying hydrogen as a mixture with natural gas (methane). The hydrogen could then be removed at a point of use or the natural gas/hydrogen mixture could be burned in <b>gas-fired</b> <b>appliances</b> thereby providing reduced carbon emissions compared to natural gas. As part of the project, the impact on the safety of the gas system resulting from the addition of hydrogen is being assessed. A release of a natural gas/hydrogen mixture within a vented enclosure (such as an industrial housing of plant and equipment) could result in a flammable mixture being formed and ignited. Due to the different properties of hydrogen, the resulting explosion may be more severe for natural gas/hydrogen mixtures compared to natural gas. Therefore, a series of large scale explosion experiments involving methane/hydrogen mixtures has been conducted in a 69. 3 m 3 enclosure in order to assess the effect of different hydrogen concentrations on the resulting explosion overpressures. The results showed that adding up to 20 % by volume of hydrogen to the methane resulted in a small increase in explosion flame speeds and overpressures. However, a significant increase was observed when 50 % hydrogen was added. For the vented confined explosions studied, it was also observed that the addition of obstacles within the enclosure, representing congestion caused by equipment and pipework, etc., increased flame speeds and overpressures above the levels measured in an empty enclosure. Predictions of the explosion overpressure and flame speed were also made using {{a modified version of the}} Shell Global Solutions model, SCOPE. The modifications included changes to the burning velocity and other physical properties of methane/hydrogen mixtures. Comparisons with the experimental data showed generally good agreement...|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} by the Department of Energy {{in response to a}} request from the HVAC industry for consolidated information about alternative heating and cooling cycles and for objective comparisons of those cycles in space conditioning applications. Twenty-seven different heat pumping technologies are compared on energy use and operating costs using consistent operating conditions and assumptions about component efficiencies for all of them. This report provides a concise summary of the underlying principals of each technology, its advantages and disadvantages, obstacles to commercial development, and economic feasibility. Both positive and negative results in this study are valuable; {{the fact that many of}} the cycles investigated are not attractive for space conditioning avoids any additional investment of time or resources in evaluating them for this application. In other cases, negative results in terms of the cost of materials or in cycle efficiencies identify where significant progress needs to be made in order for a cycle to become commercially attractive. Specific conclusions are listed for many of the technologies being promoted as alternatives to electrically-driven vapor compression heat pumps using fluorocarbon refrigerants. Although reverse Rankine cycle heat pumps using hydrocarbons have similar energy use to conventional electric-driven heat pumps, there are no significant energy savings due to the minor differences in estimated steady-state performance; higher costs would be required to accommodate the use of a flammable refrigerant. Magnetic and compressor-driven metal hydride heat pumps may be able to achieve efficiencies comparable to reverse Rankine cycle heat pumps, but they are likely to have much higher life cycle costs because of high costs for materials and peripheral equipment. Both thermoacoustic and thermionic heat pumps could have lower life cycle costs than conventional electric heat pumps because of reduced equipment and maintenance costs although energy use would be higher. There are strong opportunities for gas-fired heat pumps to reduce both energy use and operating costs outside of the high cooling climates in the southeast, south central states, and the southwest. Diesel and IC (Otto) engine-driven heat pumps are commercially available and should be able to increase their market share relative to gas furnaces on a life cycle cost basis; the cost premiums associated with these products, however, make it difficult to achieve three or five year paybacks which adversely affects their use in the U. S. Stirling engine-driven and duplex Stirling heat pumps have been investigated in the past as potential <b>gas-fired</b> <b>appliances</b> that would have longer lives and lower maintenance costs than diesel and IC engine-driven heat pumps at slightly lower efficiencies. These potential advantages have not been demonstrated and there has been a low level of interest in Stirling engine-driven heat pumps since the late 1980 's. GAX absorption heat pumps have high heating efficiencies relative to conventional gas furnaces and are viable alternatives to furnace/air conditioner combinations in all parts of the country outside of the southeast, south central states, and desert southwest. Adsorption heat pumps may be competitive with the GAX absorption system at a higher degree of mechanical complexity; insufficient information is available to be more precise in that assessment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of wood combustion on PM 2. 5 in fall/winter, as the most favorable periods with presumed intense biomass burning for residential heating due to low temperatures. As {{a part of the}} Supersito project, nearly 650 PM 2. 5 samples were collected daily at urban and rural sites in Emilia Romagna (Northern Italy) in five intensive experimental campaigns through the 2011 - 2014 years. A set of 48 different tracers related to biomass burning were investigated in order to provide useful information on emissions from wood combustion: anhydrosugars, primary biological sugars, low molecular-weight carboxylic acids, methoxylated phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonaceous components (EC/OC). Of these individual compounds, levoglucosan was by far the dominant anhydrosugar, both on a relative and an absolute basis (200 - 1042 ng m- 3), followed by mannosan (3 - 121 ng m- 3) and galactosan (4 - 35 ng m- 3), indicating that wood burning for domestic heating is a diffuse regional source during fall and winter. Different diagnostic ratios between anhydrosugars (levoglucosan to mannosan) and methoxylated phenols (syringyls to vanillyls) were computed to discriminate the wood types used as combustion fuel, i. e., hardwood vs. softwood. It was found that smoke particles were emitted from a heterogeneous mix of combustions conditions, with the predominant contribution of hardwood. 19 high molecular weight PAHs were investigated in PM 2. 5 samples, as they have been found largely emitted from residential heating, including wood and coal combustion and natural <b>gas-fired</b> home <b>appliance</b> or their mix. The total concentration of the investigated PAHs showed higher values at the urban site, mean value of 5. 2 ng m− 3, than at the rural site, 2. 9 ng m− 3, and was dominated by benzo[b+j]fluoranthene, followed by benzo[ghi]perylene and benzo[a], benzo[e] and indeno[1, 2, 3 -cd] pyrenes. Also crysene {{is one of the most}} abundant PAHs in several samples. Such PAHs distribution profile indicated that wood combustion and traffic are the major emission sources in the studied area, in agreement with similar figures found in wintertime at other sites in Northern Italy. The strong contribution of wood combustion to atmospheric PAHs was indicated by the positive correlation between levoglucosan and the most abundant PAHs (R 2 = 0. 71 ÷ 0. 79) and individually with benzo[a]pyrene (R 2 = 0. 79). Using such a relationship, the contribution of wood burning to ambient concentration of benzo[a]pyrene (BaPwb...|$|R
