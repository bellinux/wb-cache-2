The author examines the evidence from Ryukyuan dialects of Japanese and from prehistoric Japanese loan-words in the Ainu language. This combined evidence demonstrates hat the majority of Pre-Proto-Japanese words with initial vowel <b>ength</b> may be associated with an initial low pitch. However, there are also certain words which combine initial high pitch and initial vowel <b>ength.</b> Comparative data from Tungusic and Korean are also used. The {{goal of this}} article is to provide internal and partial external evidence for the reconstruction of long vowels in Proto-Japanese (pj). l It is widely accepted e facto that the oldest variety of Japanese, attested by texts of the Nara period (712 [...] 794 AD), does not demonstrate the difference between long and short vowels, and that most long vowels in different modern Japanese dialects represent he result of a later development, mostly due to loss of intervocalic onsonants with the following mono...|$|E

Microfiche. viii, 67 leaves illThe {{heredity}} of photoperiodic {{response of}} flowering in Phaseo 1 us vulgaris was studied. The parents were classified into three types {{according to their}} photoperiod sensitivity [...] day-neutra 1 (flower at any day 1 <b>ength),</b> intermediate (require a night longer than 11. 5 hours), and sensitive (require a night longer than 12 hours). Crosses between parents of the same phenotype generally produced F 1 and F 2 progenies which showed no segregation. The segregation patterns for photoperiodic response were determined for larger numbers of individuals by planting during the summer when days are too long for floral induction and assuming that each plant begins to flower when the daylength has shortened to the critical length required by that plant. Temperatures within the range experienced in the field {{were found to have}} an insignificant effect. It is postulated that the inheritance of the photoperiodic response in these lines is determined by at least four major gene loci with dominance, epistasis, and independent segregation. A dominant N gene is postulated that permits flowering at any day 1 <b>ength.</b> If the recessive n gene or a dominant inhibitor of the N gene, IN, are present, there is an intermediate day 1 <b>ength</b> requirement for flowering. A dominant Q gene which intensifies the short day length requirement is also postulated. If the recessive q gene or a dominant inhibitor of the Q gene, IQ, are present, the day 1 <b>ength</b> requirement again is of the intermediate type. The day-neutral and intermediate parents therefore differ by two genes (at the N and IN loci), and the intermediate and sensitive parents differ by another two genes (at the Q and IQ loci), so that the day-neutral and sensitive parents differ by a total of four genes. It is likely that additional genes with smaller effects may also be involved...|$|E

40|$|The spotted minnow, Galaxias maculatus has a {{widespread}} southern hemisphere and circum-polar distribution including south-western and south-eastern Australia. It was sampled at monthly intervals over 12 - 18 months, by seine and plankton netting at three localities including a freshwater lake, Moates Lake, and two intermittently flowing, naturally saline rivers, the Jerdacuttup and the Oldfield rivers {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia. The resulting data provided an opportunity to describe the biology of G. maculatus in some detail including; environmental variables, life cycle, larval development, diet and parasitism by platyhelminth and nematode worms. Comparisons were made with other studies in south-east Australia, including Tasmania, and New Zealand. The present study confirmed that, at least throughout most of its range in Western Australia, G. maculatus has established a self-sustaining land-locked reproductive strategy. It is hypothesised {{that the development of}} land-locked breeding is an adaptive response to changing coastal geomorphology in the Holocene period that restricted ocean access of rivers and their fauna and caused estuaries to become non-tidal. The principal conclusion arising is that the local biology differs largely in degree rather than kind from elsewhere it has been studied; differences in degree are interpreted as local adaptations to an environment that is both variable and unpredictable Field measurement of environmental variables revealed G. maculatus will withstand salinities to approximately 46 ppt and surface water temperatures to 280 c. Very low dissolved oxygen concentrations to < 1. 0 mg r 1 are accommodated by practicing secondary aerial respiration at the water surface. Galaxias maculatus on the south coast of Western Australia were smaller than those reported from populations elsewhere. Overall tota 11 <b>engths</b> of Western Australian males and females ranged 23 - 132 mm compared to 38 - 187 mm length to caudal fork for south-west Victoria, 31 - 185 mm standard length for Tasmania and 40 - 152 mm length to caudal fork for New Zealand fish. In the present study, size varied between the lake and one river population that was smaller. It is hypothesised that reduction in size of Western Australian G. maculatus generally is an adaptive response to avoid predation by piscivorous birds in shallow, confined river pools and lakes. There was a well defined, albeit extended, breeding season between autumn and spring with peak spawning in winter. The season was longer in the relatively stable lake situation and shorter the very variable river situation partly due to the influence of river flow, which is continuous into the lake and intermittent and variable in the rivers. A flow dependent upstream spawning migration was part of the reproductive strategy but there was also the capacity, in certain circumstances, of spawning on falling water levels in years of nil or little flow. There was an almost complete cessation of reproductive activity during summer. Fecundity ranged from 296 - 2 874 eggs with a mean of 912 and was positively correlated with total length.

The principal structurally controlled iscontinuities are those associated with tilting, folding and faulting. The former result from bedding plane slip during flexural folding that smoothes the bedding planes and reduces cohesion.

Both are likely to confine the movement ofwater through the rock, enhancing weathering and further weakening the surface.

The results followed the physical model predictions described by: where C(Q) /C(O) is the fraction of steroid remaining in the intestinal lumen of length Q, r is the effective lumenal radius, Q is the flow-rate, Pi, 9 and Pm are the respective aqueous boundary layer and membrane permeability coefficients. The log fraction of steroids remaining in the lumen was linear with intestinal length at various flow rates. The fraction absorbed increased with slower flow-rates at any given length due to the longer resi lence time. The fraction of steroid absorbed vs log partition coefficient profiles as a functjon of flow-rate were significantly sigmoidal. The absorption rates of progesterone were aqueous boundary layer-controlled and the less lipophiic hydrocortisone were membrane-con-trolled. It is significant hat the permeability of the aqueous boundary layer is propor-tional to Q”* 44...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Mount Isa is a Palaeo-Mesoproterozoic terrane in Northern Australia charac-terized by> 300 Ma of episodic tectonic {{activity}} prior to effective cratonization. This {{tectonic activity}} {{has resulted in}} {{dramatic changes in the}} at production distribution i the crust and must have been accompanied by long-term changes in thermal regimes. Primary differentia-tion of crust initially enriched in heat producing elements has been achieved by felsic magmatism over much of the 300 Ma history, often associated with extensional deformation. The flux of heat producing elements from lower to mid-upper crustal levels associated with this magmatism was sufficient tocause long-term lower crustal cooling of at least 200 °C. The accumulation of the radiogenic intrusives (which omprise c. 23 % of surface outcrop and have heat production rates averaging 5. 2 pWm 3) in the mid-upper crust resulted in a highly stratified heat production distribution. One consequence of this distribution is that small changes in the depth to this heat production, through processes such as deformation, erosion and the deposition of sediments, lead to significant changes in deep crustal temperatures (up to 100 °C) and consequently lithospheric st <b>ength.</b> These considerations suggest that the long-term evolution of the Mount Isa region partly reflects the progressive concentration...|$|E
40|$|Forty-three {{patients}} with β-thalassemia from Northern Sardinia (31 severe and polytransfused, six follow-up babies, five adults with mild thalassemia {{who were not}} transfusion dependent, and a young transfused patient was also affected by a disease of intermediate severity) were studied {{in order to establish}} the fetal hemoglobin composition, restriction fragment 1 <b>ength</b> polymorphisin haplotypes at the β-globin gene cluster, and the type(s) of mutation. Haplotype II was prevalent, [56 / 86 chromosomes (65 %) ], haplotype I was also fairly common, [22 / 86 chromosomes (25 %) ], while other types were relatively rare. The nonsense mutation at codon 39 was nearly exclusive, [76 / 80 chromosomes (95 %) ]. Other β-thalassemia mutations occurred on chromosomes with haplotypes 111, IX, X, and perhaps V, and a new type related to II. The mutated A γ T gene was associated with type type II, X, and the new type. Type IX was linked to a βd gene and to an Xmn I site 5 ' to the G γ gene, to a high G γ globin level, and to a disease of mild severity. Type I 11 was associated with a β + +-thalassemic gene. The d 39 mutation linked to type I 1 was associated with thalassemia intermedia in three patients...|$|E
