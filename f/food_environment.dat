25|$|To {{explain the}} small stature of H.nbsp&floresiensis, Brown et al. have {{suggested}} that in the limited <b>food</b> <b>environment</b> on Flores, H.nbsp&erectus evolved a smaller body size via insular dwarfism, a form of speciation which has been observed in other species on Flores alsonbsp&– including several species of the proboscidean genus Stegodon, an elephant-like creature. (A dwarf stegodont species of Flores, Stegodon sondaari, became extinct by about 850,000 years ago {{and was replaced by}} another species of normal size, Stegodon florensis, which then also evolved into a dwarf form, Stegodon florensis insularis, which disappeared about 12,000 years ago.) This hypothesis has been criticized by Teuku Jacob and colleagues who argue that LB1 is similar to the pygmy peoples who populate a Flores village, Rampasasa,nbsp&– and who point out that size can vary substantially in pygmy populations. Contradictory evidence has emerged.|$|E
40|$|Retail <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> are {{increasingly}} considered influential in determining dietary behaviours and health outcomes. We reviewed {{the available evidence}} on associations between community (type, availability and accessibility of food outlets) and consumer (product availability, prices, promotions and nutritional quality within stores) <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> and dietary outcomes {{in order to develop}} an evidence-based framework for monitoring the availability of healthy and unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages in retail <b>food</b> <b>environments.</b> Current evidence is suggestive of an association between community and consumer <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> and dietary outcomes; however, substantial heterogeneity in study designs, methods and measurement tools makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. The use of standardized tools to monitor local <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> within and across countries may help to validate this relationship. We propose a step-wise framework to monitor and benchmark community and consumer retail <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> {{that can be used to}} assess density of healthy and unhealthy food outlets; measure proximity of healthy and unhealthy food outlets to homes/schools; evaluate availability of healthy and unhealthy foods in-store; compare <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> over time and between regions and countries; evaluate compliance with local policies, guidelines or voluntary codes of practice; and determine the impact of changes to retail <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> on health outcomes, such as obesity...|$|R
40|$|Non-communicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) dominate disease burdens globally {{and poor}} nutrition increasingly contributes to this global burden. Comprehensive monitoring of <b>food</b> <b>environments,</b> {{and evaluation of}} the impact of public and private sector policies on <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> is needed to strengthen accountability systems to reduce NCDs. The International Network for Food and Obesity/NCDs Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) is a global network of public-interest organizations and researchers that aims to monitor, benchmark and support public and private sector actions to create healthy <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> and reduce obesity, NCDs and their related inequalities. The INFORMAS framework includes two ‘process’ modules, that monitor the policies and actions of the public and private sectors, seven ‘impact’ modules that monitor the key characteristics of <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> and three ‘outcome’ modules that monitor dietary quality, risk factors and NCD morbidity and mortality. Monitoring frameworks and indicators have been developed for 10 modules to provide consistency, but allowing for stepwise approaches (‘minimal’, ‘expanded’, ‘optimal’) to data collection and analysis. INFORMAS data will enable benchmarking of <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> between countries, and monitoring of progress over time within countries. Through monitoring and benchmarking, INFORMAS will strengthen the accountability systems needed to help reduce the burden of obesity, NCDs and their related inequalities.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} concerns about food system transformations affect how middle class consumers in Islamabad, Pakistan, perceive and approach food consumption {{in their everyday}} lives. The dissertation is situated {{in the context of}} risky <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> and <b>food</b> fears resulting from intensified, industrialised, and increasingly lengthened global food systems. Working within food geography and <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> paradigms, this dissertation explores how the transformation of food systems is associated with increasing anxiety about food security and safety for middle class urban consumers in Islamabad. Qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews and participant observation is used to illustrate the effects external influences, such as energy scarcity and violent events, have on everyday <b>food</b> <b>environments.</b> The dissertation examines the ways in which conceptualisations of 'good food', and trust relationships are negotiated in these dynamic <b>food</b> <b>environments.</b> The intensely geographical nature of these <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> and <b>food</b> systems, and the role of place-specific contexts on perceptions and adaptations related to food anxieties are emphasised. Situated in literatures on food anxiety and food consumption emerging from geography, food studies, and anthropology, this dissertation challenges dominant discourses on alternative and ethical consumption in a globalising food system. The results of this research not only contribute to literature on South Asia, but also contribute to consumption practices of a burgeoning middle class in developing countries. </p...|$|R

40|$|Private-sector {{organizations}} play {{a critical}} role in shaping the <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> of individuals and populations. However, there is currently very limited independent monitoring of private-sector actions related to <b>food</b> <b>environments.</b> This paper reviews previous efforts to monitor the private sector in this area, and outlines a proposed approach to monitor private-sector policies and practices related to <b>food</b> <b>environments,</b> and their influence on obesity and non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention. A step-wise approach to data collection is recommended, in which the first (‘minimal’) step is the collation of publicly available food and nutrition-related policies of selected private-sector organizations. The second (‘expanded’) step assesses the nutritional composition of each organization 2 ̆ 7 s products, their promotions to children, their labelling practices, and the accessibility, availability and affordability of their products. The third (‘optimal’) step includes data on other commercial activities that may influence <b>food</b> <b>environments,</b> such as political lobbying and corporate philanthropy. The proposed approach will be further developed and piloted in countries of varying size and income levels. There is potential for this approach to enable national and international benchmarking of private-sector policies and practices, and to inform efforts to hold the private sector to account for their role in obesity and NCD prevention...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Food {{literacy}} {{can encourage}} adolescents to develop healthy dietary patterns. This study examined home economics teachers’ (HET) {{perspectives of the}} importance, curriculum, self-efficacy, and <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> regarding <b>food</b> literacy in secondary schools in Australia. METHODS: A 20 -item cross-sectional survey was completed by 205 HETs. The survey focused {{on the importance of}} aspects of food literacy, HETs’ self-efficacy, and attitudes toward food literacy and schools’ <b>food</b> <b>environments.</b> Data were analyzed descriptively, and associations between participants’ demographic characteristics and perceptions were investigated by chi-square analyses. RESULTS: HETs rated aspects of food literacy including preparing and cooking food, knowing about healthy foods and food safety and hygiene practices as very important. They indicated animal welfare, where food comes from, and plan and manage time for food shopping to be the least important aspects of food literacy. HETs reported that students’ involvement in food literacy activities resulted in healthier diets and improved food practices, but the schools’ <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> are not comprehensively supportive of food literacy. CONCLUSIONS: HETs report that food literacy is very important for adolescents to learn. The focus is more on microaspects in comparison to macroaspects of food literacy. Schools’ <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> are ideally positioned to shape dietary intake of adolescents but their potential is not being realized...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Policies {{to create}} healthy <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> are {{recognized}} as critical components of efforts to prevent obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. There {{has not been a}} systematic review of existing methods and tools used to assess the implementation of these government policies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to review methods and tools used for assessing the implementation of government policies to create healthy <b>food</b> <b>environments.</b> The study conducted a systematic literature search. Multiple databases as well as the grey literature were searched. All study designs and review papers on assessing the implementation of government policies to create healthy <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> were included. A quality assessment of the methods and tools identified from relevant studies was carried out using the following four criteria: comprehensiveness, relevance, generalizability and feasibility. This quality assessment was completed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: The review identified 52 studies across different policy areas, levels and settings. Self-administered questionnaires and policy checklists were most commonly applied to assess the extent of policy implementation, whereas semi-structured interviews were most commonly used to evaluate the implementation process. Measures varied widely, with the existence of policy implementation the aspect most commonly assessed. The most frequently identified barriers and facilitators for policy implementation were infrastructure support, resources and stakeholder engagement. The assessment of policy implementation on <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> was usually undertaken in combination with other policy areas, particularly nutrition education and physical activity. Three tools/methods were rated 2 ̆ 7 high 2 ̆ 7 quality and 13 tools/methods received 2 ̆ 7 medium 2 ̆ 7 quality ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Harmonization of the available high-quality methods and tools is needed to ensure that assessment of government policy implementation can be compared across different countries and settings and over time.

40|$|Background and objectives:  The World Health Organization (WHO) ’s {{monitoring}} {{of risk factors}} for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) does not include ’upstream’ monitoring of many aspects of <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> that influence population diets. INFORMAS (International Network for Food and Obesity/NCDs Research, Monitoring and Action Support) is a global network of public-interest organisations and researchers that aims to monitor, benchmark and support public and private sector actions to create healthy food environments and reduce obesity and NCDs. This {{monitoring of}} public and private sector policies, and their impacts on the healthiness of food environments, seeks to complement existing WHO monitoring efforts. Methods: Monitoring areas are divided into process, impact and outcome modules. The two process modules focus on monitoring and benchmarking the policies and actions of the public and private sector. The seven impact modules focus on monitoring and benchmarking the impact of those policies and actions on key aspects of <b>food</b> <b>environments,</b> such as food composition, labelling, promotion, provision, access, availability, affordability, and trade and investment. The three outcome modules focus on monitoring and evaluating changes in behavioural, dietary, physiological and metabolic risk factors, as well as health outcomes. Some aspects of these outcome components are being developed by WHO {{as part of their}} global NCD monitoring framework. Results: The development of protocols and pilot testing is planned for 2013 - 2015. The monitoring framework will be trialled in large and small, and high- and low-income countries globally. Within five years, it is expected that all countries will be invited to collect their own data and contribute those data to a global database for benchmarking <b>food</b> <b>environments.</b>   Conclusions: Benchmarking data and good practice exemplars will be communicated to policymakers, civil society and the food industry with the aim of stimulating improvements in the healthiness of <b>food</b> <b>environments.</b> </div...|$|R

40|$|The {{liberalization}} {{of international trade}} and foreign direct investment through multilateral, regional and bilateral agreements has had profound implications for the structure and nature of food systems, and therefore, for the availability, nutritional quality, accessibility, price and promotion of foods in different locations. Public health attention has only relatively recently turned to the links between trade and investment agreements, diets and health, and there is currently no systematic monitoring of this area. This paper reviews the available evidence on the links between trade agreements, <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> and diets from an obesity and non-communicable disease (NCD) perspective. Based on the key issues identified through the review, the paper outlines an approach for monitoring the potential impact of trade agreements on <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> and obesity/NCD risks. The proposed monitoring approach encompasses a set of guiding principles, recommended procedures for data collection and analysis, and quantifiable ‘minimal’, ‘expanded’ and ‘optimal’ measurement indicators to be tailored to national priorities, capacity and resources. Formal risk assessment processes of existing and evolving trade and investment agreements, which focus on their impacts on <b>food</b> <b>environments</b> will help inform the development of healthy trade policy, strengthen domestic nutrition and health policy space and ultimately protect population nutrition.
