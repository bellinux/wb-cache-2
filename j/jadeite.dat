5|$|Burial 116 is {{the tomb}} of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid, {{below the level of}} the Great Plaza. The tomb {{contained}} rich offerings of <b>jadeite,</b> ceramics, shell and works of art. The body of the king was covered with large quantities of jade ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king. One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate jade mosaic vessel with the lid bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} John Coles {{from the}} University of Cambridge began {{a research project}} {{that resulted in the}} publication of an important series of papers on many aspects of the Levels. A range of archaeological projects, such as the exploration of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia BC and the establishment of their economic and geographic significance, was funded by various donors including English Heritage. Possibly the project's most significant excavation was of the Sweet Track in 1970, during which a <b>Jadeite</b> axe was discovered. Eight radiocarbon determinations of the date of the axe place it at around 3200 BC.|$|E
5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red tourmaline, and <b>jadeite.</b> Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and gold-plated bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold cloak of the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E

50|$|In Sailor Moon Crystal, Nephrite {{attempts}} {{to appeal to}} Queen Beryl to take <b>Jadeite's</b> place after calling him out for his failures only for Zoisite to intervene. Later, when his Soul Shadow is destroyed by Usagi, Nephrite rejoins the other Kings of Heaven to threaten the Sailor Soldiers. In the next episode, he {{attempts to}} find the Silver Crystal using a Monster who resembles a bride. However, he is attacked by Makoto and is forced to flee. In his past life, he was the love interest of Sailor Jupiter. He is killed by Metaria.|$|R
50|$|In the live-action series, Nephrite is <b>Jadeite's</b> main rival for the attentions of Queen Beryl, who {{considers}} him useless. His physical appearance is drastically changed, {{and he is}} portrayed as hot-headed and violent. Repeatedly humiliated by the Sailor Soldiers, and mocked by the other Kings of Heaven, he strives to win Beryl's favor, but she kills her as a demonstration of her power. He is then reborn in Tokyo as a normal human being with all his memories intact, getting {{a job at the}} karaoke parlor and forging a tenuous friendship with Ami Mizuno, who was compassionate toward him when she was Dark Mercury. At the end of the series, he is re-established with the other Kings of Heaven as one of Prince Endymion's guardians.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{compositions}} of sodic pyroxenes from blueschist metabasites in Northwest Turkey were in-vestigated by electronprobe microanalysis. These {{are compared}} with sodic pyroxenes from high-grade blueschist terrains and eclogites with special {{reference to the}} island of Syros in Greece. Pyroxenes from lawsonite zone metabasites in Northwest Turkey are chloromelanites, aegerine augites and aegerine <b>jadeites</b> with the acmite contents ranging from 65 % down to 30 %. Epidote-garnet bearing high-grade blueschist metabasites of Syros {{on the other hand}} contain omphacite with the acmite content less than 30 %. All the analyzed sodic pyroxenes from eclogites and high-grade blueschists in the literature are also omphacites with low acmite contents. It is argued that the acmite content of the sodic pyroxene de-creases with rising temperature of metamorphism. This is almost entirely related to the appearance of epidote as an additional ferric ion bearing phase with an increase in temperature...|$|R
5000|$|The Monsters (Yōma) are the Dark Kingdom's army of monsters {{in every}} {{version of the}} series, serving as the monster of the week in every adaptation. In the first anime adaptation, <b>Jadeite's</b> and Nephrite's monsters are conjured {{from out of the}} ground, with some of them taking the form of humans (such as Morga impersonating Naru Osaka's mother). These monsters are killed either by Sailor Moon using [...] "Moon Tiara Action" [...] or by other Sailor Soldiers' attacks {{at the end of each}} episode.

50|$|Architectural {{patterns}} and objects {{found at the}} Talgua settlement provide indicators of both social stratification and trade networks with the Maya. Jade and marble vessels found at the site are seen as items of prestige and clues {{to the degree of}} social stratification. In addition to the prestige items found, there were numerous items made of obsidian, which would have come from the Maya highland regions and jade from Maya areas of Guatemala. Whereas, items found to be made out of green, jade-like rocks indigenous to northeast Honduras were found not to be Jade at all, but <b>jadeites</b> or green rocks with a distinct talc feel (Cuddy 122). In further exemplification of the role of this area as an important buffer zone between Mesoamerica and southern Central and South America, Doris Stone (1966) has pointed out that much of the area’s later fascination with gold came from the south and fascination with jade came from the Maya in the north. Items and beads of greenstone were in full production by around 500 CE.|$|R
25|$|Today, it is {{estimated}} that Burma is the origin of upwards of 70 percent of the world's supply of high-quality <b>jadeite.</b> Most of the <b>jadeite</b> mined in Burma is not cut for use in Burma, instead being transported to other nations, primarily in Asia, for use in jewelry and other products. The <b>jadeite</b> deposits found in Kachinland, in Burma’s northern regions is the highest quality <b>jadeite</b> in the world, considered precious by sources in China going {{as far back as the}} 10th century. <b>Jadeite</b> in Burma is primarily found in the “Jade Tract” located in Lonkin Township in Kachin State in northern Burma which encompasses the alluvial region of the Uyu River between the 25th and 26th parallels. Present-day extraction of jade in this region occurs at the Phakant-gyi, Maw Se Za, Tin Tin, and Khansee mines. Khansee is also the only mine that produces Maw Sit Sit, a type of jade. Mines at Tawmao and Hweka are mostly exhausted. From to 1964 to 1981, mining was exclusively an enterprise of the Myanmar government. In 1981, 1985, and 1995, the Gemstone laws were modified to allow increasing private enterprise. In addition to this region, there are also notable mines in the neighboring Sagaing District, near the towns of Nasibon and Natmaw and Hkamti. Sagaing is a district in Myanmar proper, not a part of the ethic Kachin State.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jadeite,</b> {{with its}} bright emerald-green, pink, lavender, orange and brown colours was {{imported}} from Burma to China only after about 1800. The vivid green variety {{became known as}} Feicui (翡翠) or Kingfisher (feathers) Jade. It quickly became almost as popular as nephrite and a favorite of Qing Dynasty's nouveau riche, while scholars still had strong attachment to nephrite (white jade, or Khotan), which they deemed to be the symbol of a nobleman.|$|E
25|$|The six {{black and}} six white game pieces {{are the main}} game pieces to be moved around the board, and similar sets of cubic or cuboid game pieces made from ivory, <b>jadeite</b> or rock crystal {{have been found in}} several other tombs.

25|$|The diaphaneity of {{a mineral}} {{describes}} {{the ability of}} light to pass through it. Transparent minerals do not diminish the intensity of light passing through it. An {{example of such a}} mineral is muscovite (potassium mica); some varieties are sufficiently clear to have been used for windows. Translucent minerals allow some light to pass, but less than those that are transparent. <b>Jadeite</b> and nephrite (mineral forms of jade are examples of minerals with this property). Minerals that do not allow light to pass are called opaque.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{earliest}} known jade artifacts excavated from prehistoric sites are simple ornaments with bead, button, and tubular shapes. Additionally, jade was used for adze heads, knives, and other weapons, which can be delicately shaped. As metal-working technologies became available, the beauty of jade made it valuable for ornaments and decorative objects. <b>Jadeite</b> measures between 6.0 and 7.0 Mohs hardness, and nephrite between 6.0 and 6.5, {{so it can be}} worked with quartz or garnet sand, and polished with bamboo or even ground jade.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{moves from}} the Tagus estuary were maritime. A {{southern}} move led to the Mediterranean where 'enclaves' were established in south-western Spain and southern France around the Golfe du Lion and into the Po valley in Italy, probably via ancient western Alpine trade routes used to distribute <b>jadeite</b> axes. A northern move incorporated the southern coast of Armorica. The enclave established in southern Brittany was linked closely to the riverine and landward route, via the Loire, and across the Gâtinais valley to the Seine valley, and thence to the lower Rhine. This was a long-established route reflected in early stone axe distributions and it was via this network that Maritime Bell Beakers first reached the Lower Rhine in about 2600 BC.|$|E
25|$|It is {{remarkable}} that the Maya, {{who had no}} metal tools, created many objects from a very thick and dense material, jade (<b>jadeite),</b> particularly all sorts of (royal) dress elements, such as belt plaques - or celts - ear spools, pendants, and also masks. Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king Pakal, covered with irregularly-shaped jade plaques and having eyes made from mother-of-pearl and obsidian; another death mask, belonging to a Palenque queen, consists of malachite plaques. Similarly, certain cylindrical vases from Tikal have an outer layer of square jade discs. Many stone carvings had jade inlays.|$|E
25|$|The Yayoi {{period is}} marked by {{specific}} centers specializing in magatama and the widespread trade of magatama. The period {{is marked by}} the formation of power centers {{that came to be}} individual states. The development of weapons increased in this period to protect increasingly developed rice fields and fishing rights. Trade greatly increased in this period, as did the specialization of production of certain items, including magatama. Magatama producing areas exchanged their product with other products, specifically rice, leading to the widespread distribution of magatama across Japan. Magatama were commonly used to create necklaces and bracelets worn on the wrists or ankles. The necklace was typically constructed of <b>jadeite</b> magatama separated by cylindrical bored-holed pieces of jasper. Small beads of dark-blue glass are also not uncommon on the necklace. The bracelet was typically also used shells from the coastal areas of Shikoku and the Inland Sea, wood, and bronze. In this period the use of the mirror, sword, and jewels as status symbols for village, and later regional leaders of all kinds, emerged in the Yayoi period, and point to the origin of the mirror, sword, and magatama as the Imperial Regalia of Japan.|$|E

2500|$|Nephrite and <b>jadeite</b> {{were used}} from prehistoric periods for hardstone carving. <b>Jadeite</b> has {{about the same}} {{hardness}} as quartz.

2500|$|Nephrite can {{be found}} in a creamy white form (known in China as [...] "mutton fat" [...] jade) as well as in a variety of light green colours, whereas <b>jadeite</b> shows more colour variations, {{including}} blue, red, black, dark green, lavender and white. [...] Of the two, <b>jadeite</b> is rarer, documented in fewer than 12 places worldwide. [...] Translucent emerald-green <b>jadeite</b> is the most prized variety, both historically and today. [...] As [...] "quetzal" [...] jade, bright green <b>jadeite</b> from Guatemala was treasured by Mesoamerican cultures, and as [...] "kingfisher" [...] jade, vivid green rocks from Burma became the preferred stone of post-1800 Chinese imperial scholars and rulers. Burma (Myanmar) and Guatemala are the principal sources of modern gem <b>jadeite.</b> [...] In the area of Mogaung in the Myitkyina District of Upper Burma, <b>jadeite</b> formed a layer in the dark-green serpentine, and has been quarried and exported for well over a hundred years.

2500|$|The Chinese word yù [...] "jade; gems of all kinds; (of women) beautiful; (courteous) your" [...] has semantically broader {{meanings}} than [...] English [...] "any {{of various}} hard greenish gems used in jewelry and artistic carvings, including <b>jadeite</b> and nephrite; a green color of medium hue; made of jade; green like jade". Yù {{has referred to}} many rocks and minerals that carve and polish well, especially <b>jadeite,</b> nephrite and agalmatolite, as well as bowenite and other varieties of serpentine. [...] <b>Jadeite</b> {{is now known as}} yìngyù [...] (lit."hardjade") and nephrite correspondingly as ruǎnyù [...] (lit."softjade").

2500|$|Magatama in the Yayoi period, ca. [...] 300 BCE to CE 300, are notably {{different}} from Jōmon-period magatama. The jewels {{moved from a}} primitive, non-standard form towards more polished and uniform form in this period. The technology to cut large gemstones and polish jewels notably advanced in the Yayoi period. Refined materials such as <b>jadeite,</b> serpentinite, and glass replaced the less sophisticated materials of the Jōmon period.

2500|$|The Chinese {{character}} 玉 (yù) is used {{to denote}} the several types of stone known in English as [...] "jade" [...] (e.g. 玉器, jadewares), such as <b>jadeite</b> (硬玉, 'hard jade', another name for 翡翠) and nephrite (軟玉, 'soft jade'). [...] But because of the value added culturally to jades throughout Chinese history, the word has also come to refer more generally to precious or ornamental stones, and is very common in more symbolic usage as in phrases like 拋磚引玉/抛砖引玉 (lit. 'casting a brick (i.e. the speaker's own words) to draw a jade (i.e. pearls of wisdom from the other party)'), 玉容 (a beautiful face; 'jade countenance'), and 玉立 (slim and graceful; 'jade standing upright').

2500|$|Magatama {{became very}} common in the Kofun period, ca. CE 250 to CE 538, {{and by the end}} of the period almost all kofun tumuli {{contained}} magatama. In the early Kofun period magatama were made from <b>jadeite</b> as in earlier periods, but by the middle of the period were made from jasper, {{and by the end of}} the period, almost exclusively of agate and jade. Magatama capped by silver or gold also appear towards the end of the period. Large magatama made of talc, imitations of smaller ones made of more precious materials, were used as grave goods. Magatama are found in kofun tumuli across Japan from the period. Their use went from merely decorative to sacred and ceremonial grave goods. [...] are magatama with inscriptions that look like flowers of the clove tree and have a hole suitable to attach to a string. These first appear in the Kofun period. In the Kofun period magatama appear on necklaces, with several magatama set between bored cylinders. Archeological remains show evidence of similar ankle bracelets, but they are less common. Clay haniwa funerary objects of the Kofun period commonly depict people wearing the necklaces and ankle bracelets.|$|E
2500|$|Magatama first {{appeared}} in Japan in the Final Jōmon period, ca. 1000 to 300 BCE., and in this period magatama were made from relatively simple, naturally occurring materials, including clay, talc, slate, quartz, gneiss, <b>jadeite,</b> nephrite, and serpentinite. They lack the uniformity of design found in magatama produced in later periods. Magatama from the Jōmon period were irregularly shaped, lacked continuity in form from region to region, and have been called [...] "Stone Age magatama" [...] for this reason. Magatama {{are thought to be}} an imitation of the teeth of large animals, pierced with a hole, which are found in earlier Jōmon remains. These resemble magatama, but more recent scholarship indicates that these early Jōmon may have simply had a decorative function, and have no relationship to magatama. [...] Magatama in the Jōmon period appear to have moved from the purely decorative to having a status and ceremonial function {{by the end of the}} period. A [...] "middle Jōmon exchange network" [...] may have existed, whereby magatama were produced in regions where materials for their manufacture were readily plentiful. Jade and talc examples produced in bead-making villages located in present-day Itoigawa, Niigata have been found at a large number of sites in along the northern coast, central mountains, and Kantō region.|$|E
