50|$|The {{final step}} of the scheme, distillation, {{comprises}} two distillation columns, and optionally four distillation columns. The three main types of chemicals in the fluid {{at this stage of}} the separation are water, BioPDO, and impurities such as glycerol, sugars, and proteins. Of the three chemicals water has the lowest boiling point (see the water, 1,3-propanediol, and glycerol articles for boiling point information), so it is removed as distillate in the first column. The bottoms of the first column is then sent to a second column, where BioPDO is removed as distillate because of its lower boiling point. Both columns operate under low pressure (55 mm Hg in the first column; 20 mm Hg in the second column) to lower the boiling points of the distillate and bottoms streams, thereby using a lower pressure steam than that for atmospheric columns. At this point, the BioPDO stream has 99% purity. If the BioPDO is to be used for polymer production, however, then greater purity is required. To achieve greater purity, the BioPDO distillate of the second column is sent to a <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>reactor</b> to convert the remaining polymer-coloring impurities into non-coloring chemicals. The effluent of the reactor is then sent to a second set of two distillation columns that operate the same way as the first set of columns. The BioPDO distillate of the fourth distillation column has a purity of 99.97%, which is able to meet polymer- and fiber-grade standards.|$|E

As for Claus tail gas, conventional hydrogenation catalyzers are gradually being replaced by low-temperature hydrogenation catalyzers. This paper concentrates {{on the development of}} technologies for low-temperature hydrogenation hydrolysis catalyzers, preparation of such catalyzers and their industrial application. In view of the specific features of SO 2 hydrogenation and organic sulfur hydrolysis during low-temperature hydrogenation, a new technical process involving joint application of hydrogenation catalyzers and hydrolysis catalyzers was proposed. In addition, low-temperature hydrogenation catalyzers and low-temperature hydrolysis catalyzers suitable for low-temperature conditions were developed. Joint application of these two kinds of catalyzers may reduce the inlet temperatures in the conventional <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>reactors</b> from 280  °C to 220  °C, at the same time, hydrogenation conversion rates of SO 2 can be enhanced to over 99 %. To further accelerate the hydrolysis rate of organic sulfur, the catalyzers for hydrolysis of low-temperature organic sulfur were developed. In lab tests, the volume ratio of the total sulfur content in tail gas can be as low as 131  ×  10 − 6 when these two kinds of catalyzers were used in a proportion of 5 : 5 in volumes. Industrial application of these catalyzers was implemented in 17 sulfur recovery tail gas processing facilities of 15 companies.

The SPT fracture energy Esp (derived from integrating the load-displacement curve) divided by the maximum load (Fm) of SPT was used to fit the Esp/Fm versus-temperature curve to determine the energy transition temperature (Tsp) which corresponded to the ductile-brittle transition temperature of the Charpy impact test. The results indicated that the ratio of Esp/Fm could better represent the energy of transition in SPT compared with Esp. The ductile-to-brittle transition temperature of the four different types of materials was measured using the hydrogen charging test by SPT. These four types of materials included the base metal and the weld metal in the as-received state, and the base metal and the weld metal in the de-embrittled state. The results showed that there was a degree of temper embrittlement in the base metal and the weld metal after ten years of service at 390 °C.

40|$|Abstract The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{characterization}} of chemical reactions and adsorption by means of remote detection (RD) method of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The thesis consists of three related topics: In the first one, novel RD NMR based methods for characterizing chemical reactions were presented. In the second topic RD NMR methods were used to study the performance of new kind of microfluidic reactors. The third project concentrated {{on the development of}} a novel way to quantify the adsorption of flowing gas mixtures in porous materials. Even though all the topics cover quite different areas of research, they have few common nominators: remote detection NMR, microfluidics and method development. Microfluidic devices are of interest for many areas of science (such as molecular biology, disease diagnosis, chemistry) as they offer great promises for future technologies. Small dimensions enable, among many other things, the benefits of small sample volumes, large surface to volume ratio, efficient heat exchange and precise control of flow features and chemical reactions. The efficient evolution of microfluidic processes requires also the development of new innovative ways to characterize the performance of microfluidic devices. In this work, remote detection NMR is utilized for the purpose. RD is a method where the encoding and detection of information are separated physically. In many cases, the encoding and detection are performed with two separate RF coils while a fluid is passing through the studied system. In {{the first part of the}} thesis work, we introduced the concept of remote detection exchange (RD-EXSY) NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrated that the RD-EXSY method can provide unique chemical information. Furthermore, the time-of-flight (TOF) information, which is a natural side product of the experimental setup used, can be converted into indirect spatial information, showing the active reaction regions in a microfluidic device. Additionally, we demonstrated that by applying the principles of Hadamard spectroscopy in the encoding of the indirect spectral dimension we were able to produce with high efficiency RD-EXSY TOF images with direct spatial information. This allows even more accurate characterization of the active regions. The second topic concentrates on the development of microfluidc <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>reactors.</b> In the project atomic layer depositon (ALD) method was used for the first time to deposit both catalyst nanoparticles and support material on the surface of wall-coated microreactors. As a model reaction continuous flow propene hydrogenation into propane was studied by means of remote detection NMR. Reaction yield, mass transport phenomena and the activity of the catalyst surface were determined from the RD NMR data. Thirdly we presented a novel method for gas adsorption measurements in porous materials using RD TOF NMR. Traditional adsorption measurements are carried out at static conditions for a single gas component, as multi-component adsorption measurements are challenging and time-consuming. We investigated adsorption of continuously flowing propane and propene gases as well as their mixture in packed beds of mesoporous materials. The unique time-of-flight information obtained using the RD NMR method was utilized in the determination of flow velocity, which was then converted into amount of adsorbed gas...|$|R
40|$|The major {{applications}} of aromatic hydrogenation (dearomatisation) {{are in the}} production of aromatic-free fuels and solvents. Health risks related to aromatic compounds, such as benzene and some polyaromatic compounds, have encouraged legislators to tighten the restrictions on aromatic content in end products. In diesel fuel, aromatic compounds have the further effect of lowering fuel quality, and they are reported to be responsible for undesired particle emissions in exhaust gases. Indeed, the major remaining concern in regard to exhaust gases is particle emissions, as fuels are already low in sulphur and the emissions of CO, SOx and NOx have been significantly reduced. The aim of the work was, on the basis of experimental data from the liquid phase to develop kinetic and deactivation models of the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds suitable for use in the design and optimisation of <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>reactors</b> operating in the liquid phase. To this end, the hydrogenation of toluene, tetralin, naphthalene and mixtures of these on a commercial nickel catalyst was studied in a continuously working three-phase reactor. These model compounds were chosen to represent monoaromatics (toluene), partly hydrogenated polyaromatics (tetralin) and polyaromatics (naphthalene). The solvent effect on toluene hydrogenation was studied in cyclohexane, n-heptane and isooctane. At low temperatures the hydrogenation rates were similar, but at higher temperature the rate in cyclohexane was significantly lower than the rate in n-heptane and isooctane. It was concluded that the difference in the rates at higher temperatures was primarily due to the different solubility of hydrogen. Thus, the matrix effects of all compounds need {{to be included in the}} models for reliable parameters and rate expressions to be achieved. Toluene and tetralin were assumed to form a π-complex with adsorbed hydrogen and surface nickel. Intermediates were presumed to retain their aromatic nature and to react further to corresponding cyclohexenes and thereafter to fully saturated products. The difference between the hydrogenation rates of naphthalene and monoaromatic compounds was explained in terms of adsorption strength and adsorption mode of aromatic compounds. Naphthalene, adsorbing more strongly than monoaromatic compounds, was proposed to react through π/σ-adsorption rather than π-adsorption. The kinetic models of toluene, tetralin and naphthalene were successfully applied to the hydrogenation of aromatic mixtures of these compounds. Naphthalene was observed to inhibit the hydrogenation of toluene and tetralin, but toluene and tetralin had no effect on the hydrogenation of naphthalene. The inhibition effect could be explained with the adsorption terms obtained during single component experiments, decreasing in the order naphthalene>>tetralin>toluene. The simulation of the data obtained in the hydrogenation of mixtures with the kinetic models of the single compounds showed that the inhibition effect can successfully be estimated from single compound experiments if well defined adsorption coefficients are available for all compounds. Severe catalyst deactivation was observed during the work. Coking (formation of hydrogen-deficient species) was assumed to be the cause of this deactivation since no sulphur or nitrogen impurities were detected. Besides increase in the cis-to-trans ratio, the catalyst deactivation suppressed the hydrogenation of tetralin to decalins relative to the hydrogenation of naphthalene to tetralin. This was explained by the π-adsorption of tetralin, which was proposed to require an ensemble of Ni-atoms, which further on, with deactivation, led to a more severe decrease in the hydrogenation rate of tetralin than in the hydrogenation rate of naphthalene. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Mechanically {{agitated}} gas-liquid contactors {{are frequently}} {{used in the}} chemical, food and biochemical industries as fermenters and as <b>hydrogenation</b> or chlorination <b>reactors.</b> However wide is the usage of such vessels, their design {{is not based on}} chemical engineering data, but is still rather empirical. Thus, it is highly desirable to have a tool for the rational design of agitated gas-liquid contactors that is based on fundamental chemical engineering parameters that are transferable to other systems and operating conditions. Focusing on liquid film-controlled processes and using the data from fermenters of different scales, we develop k L a correlations that are suitable for scale-up. First, we discuss how to determine the proper experimental k L a values, which are not distorted by other equipment parameters as is the gas residence time. We demonstrate the possible k L a distortion on the pilot-plant experimental data by comparing the results obtained by two different experimental techniques. Further, we present physically correct k L a data for fully non-coalescent (sodium sulphate solution) batch. The data are presented both for laboratory and pilot-plant fermenters. We identify the process parameters, the values of which are dependent on the vessel scale when operated under the same power input per volume, and, using these parameters, we develop common k L a correlations suitable to describe the data for various scales of the vessel.

40|$|Chemical {{modification}} is {{an important}} way to improve the properties of existing polymers, {{and one of the}} important examples is the hydrogenation of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) in organic solvent by homogeneous catalysis in order to extend its application. This process has been industrialized for many years to provide high performance elastomers (HNBR) for the automotive industry, especially those used to produce components in engine compartments. 	In the current commercial process, a batch reactor is employed for the hydrogenation step, which is labor intensive and not suitable for large volume of production. Thus, novel hydrogenation devices such as a continuous process are being developed in our research group to overcome these drawbacks. In order to make the process more practical for industrial application, high concentration polymer solutions should be targeted for the continuous hydrogenation. However, many problems are encountered due to the viscosity of the high concentration polymer solution, which increases tremendously as the reaction goes on, resulting in severe mass transfer and heat transfer problems. So, hydrogenation kinetics in high concentration NBR solution, as well as the rheological properties of this viscous solution are very essential and fundamental for the design of novel <b>hydrogenation</b> processes and <b>reactor</b> scale up. 	In the present work, hydrogenation of NBR in high concentration solution was carried out in a batch reactor. A commercial rhodium catalyst, Wilkinson’s catalyst, was used with triphenylphosphine as the co-catalyst and chlorobenzene as the solvent. The reactor was modified and a PID controller was tuned to fit this strong exothermic reaction. It was observed that when NBR solution is in a high concentration the kinetic behavior was greatly affected by mass transfer processes, especially the gas-liquid mass transfer. Reactor internals were designed and various agitators were investigated to improve the mechanical mixing. Experimental results show that the turbine-anchor combined agitator could provide superior mixing for this viscous reaction system. 	The kinetic behavior of NBR hydrogenation under low catalyst concentration was also studied. It was observed that the hydrogenation degree of the polymer could not reach 95 % if less than 0. 1 %wt catalyst (based on polymer mass) was used, deviating from the behavior under a normal catalyst concentration. 	The viscosity of the NBR-MCB solutions was measured in a rotational rheometer that has a cylinder sensor under both room conditions and reaction conditions. Parameters that might affect the viscosity of the solutions were studied, especially the hydrogenation degree of polymer. Rheological properties of NBR-MEK solutions, as well as NBR melts were also studied for relevant information. 	It is concluded that the hydrogenation kinetics deviates from that reported by Parent et al. [6] when polymer is in high concentration and/or catalyst is in low concentration; and that the reaction solution (HNBR/NBR-MCB solution) deviates from Newtonian behavior when polymer concentration and hydrogenation degree are high...|$|R

The LCA focused on the cumulative energy demand (CED), cumulative exergy demand (CExD), and the CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 eq) emission, with CO 2 and N 2 O measured separately. The highest calculated reduction potential of CED and CExD were achieved using phenol, which reduced the CED by 29 % and 57 % with 1. 85 % and 4. 26 % cis, cis-muconic acid, respectively. A decrease in the CO 2 eq emission was especially achieved when the N 2 O emission in the combined biological and chemical process was restricted. At 4. 26 % cis, cis-muconic acid, the different carbon backbone feedstocks contributed to an optimized reduction of CO 2 eq emissions ranging from 14. 0 to 17. 4 ¿ton CO 2 eq/ton adipic acid. The bulk of the bioprocessing energy intensity is attributed to the <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>reactor,</b> which has a high environmental impact and a direct relationship with the product concentration in the broth...|$|E
40|$|Carane, C 10 H 18, a new {{and unique}} {{saturated}} bicyclic hydrocarbon, can be produced by. the continuous, three-phase, catalytic hydrogenation of delta- 3 -carene in a trickle bed reactor. Delta- 3 -carene can be recovered from the crude turpentine produced by Kraft pulp mills in the Rocky Mountain region. Among the various catalysts investigated, Harshaw 1404 -T nickel catalyst was found to give the best results in a fixed bed flow tube reactor. The reaction conditions for maximum carane production {{in this study were}} found to be about 85 °C, 1200 psig, and. 025 hr^- 1 liquid hourly space velocity. <b>Hydrogenation</b> <b>reactor</b> product was distilled in a column with 40 theoretical stages at 28 : 1 reflux ratio to yield. 9 gallons of 92 % to 93 % carane per gallon of delta- 3 -carene charged to the process. Several methods of feed pretreatment to remove impurities which act as catalyst poisons were evaluated. Suspected poisons are sulfur, water, and auto-oxygenation products. The best pretreatment method appeared to be contacting the delta- 3 -carene with dilute caustic followed by steam evaporation under nitrogen and drying with CaSO 4 desicant. The delta- 3 -carene feed was then passed over spent Harshaw l 404 -T catalyst from the previous hydrogenation run at reaction conditions — 1200 psig, 70 - 80 °C, and 0. 10 hr^- 1 space velocity. By using this feed pretreatment procedure, catalyst ages of approximately 65 cc’s of feed per gram of catalyst could be obtained. before the delta- 3 -carene conversion dropped below 50 %. • Hydrogen purging and solvent leaching with a variety of solvents were used unsuccessfully to regenerate spent hydrogenation catalyst...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} {{process for}} the reduction of organic compounds could {{have a number of}} advantages over thermochemical reduction, including enhanced separation between reactants and products, lower operating temperatures and pressures, and improved mass transfer of reactants to and from catalyst surfaces. This research investigated the use of noble metal, base metal, transition metal carbide, and carbide-supported metal catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogenation of triglycerides. We report that many of these catalysts, including W 2 C-supported Pd catalysts, had high rates and/or selectivities for the hydrogenation reaction. Low activities for certain catalysts were hypothesized to be related to lack of stability in the electrochemical <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>reactor.</b> The solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) used in this study is known to be strongly acidic, which can create a corrosive environment under certain applied potentials. Two techniques, thermogravimetric analysis of the post-reaction membrane electrode assemblies and chronoamperometry in a model SPE cell, were used to characterize catalyst stabilities. It was concluded that the low activities of these base metal and carbide catalysts for triglyceride hydrogenation were due to their incompatibility with the SPE. This study is among the first to investigate the nature of the hydrogenation mechanism is the context of the SPE reactor. By varying the applied voltage across the SPE reactor, it was found that catalytic activities varied with potential. Linear sweep voltammetry was used with the various catalysts in a model SPE cell, which showed that this dependence was due to the electrochemical nature of the hydrogenation rate determining step. Variations in the hydrogenation activities of the different catalysts were found to correlate with their activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction, suggesting that similar sites are involved in each reaction. With this understanding of the triglyceride hydrogenation mechanism, catalyst formulations could be modified to improve the activities and selectivities for this and related reactions. A preliminary economic analysis indicated that the electrochemical hydrogenation of triglycerides may be economically viable in comparison to the thermochemical process currently used in industry...|$|E
40|$|Major {{industrial}} accidents continue {{to occur in}} process industries in spite of advances in risk management and abnormal condition management made over the last 40 years. A change in hazard identification (HAZID) theory and practice is required to better support process diagnosis and improve abnormal condition management, thus leading {{to a reduction in}} the number and severity of accidents. To improve HAZID for better supporting diagnosis the scope of HAZID analysis should be widened and knowledge generation and reuse associated with HAZID should be improved. To address these two major issues, a conceptual framework for systematically describing process system operation has been developed to guide the formation of a novel hazard identification methodology able to delivers outcomes with a high coverage of hazards and rich causal knowledge {{that can be used for}} supporting diagnosis. The conceptual framework was called the Functional Systems Framework. It allows qualitative knowledge associated with structure-function-goal relationships in process systems to be expressed in a clear and consistent manner. This knowledge describes how components, streams and connections form the structure of the system and how their capabilities describe system function. The capabilities explicitly describe how the actions of components and streams affect system properties to meet the goals of the system. The capability concept is crucial for describing the structure-function-goal relationships of process systems. The Functional Systems Framework was used to guide the formation of a novel HAZID method called the Blended Hazard Identification (BLHAZID) methodology. The primary purpose of the BLHAZID methodology is to generate knowledge to be used for supporting fault diagnosis. Therefore the outcomes of the method must contain a high coverage of hazards, richly describe failure causality and be able to be captured using computer-aided tools. This facilitates effective reuse of knowledge. The BLHAZID methodology takes advantage of the blending of two fundamental approaches to hazard identification: function-driven, such as Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), and component-driven, such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The BLHAZID methodology utilises the strengths of both approaches and minimizes their weaknesses by blending them together, forming a single approach with increased utility. Explicitly examining both functional and structural failures delivers outcomes with high coverage. The BLHAZID approach can be used to describe failure causality between process system equipment and streams in great detail and hence generate rich causal knowledge. The knowledge associated with the BLHAZID is captured and expressed in a structured language using computer based tools. This knowledge can then be reused for many applications, the most pertinent being diagnosis. Industrial case studies of increasing complexity show how the BLHAZID methodology is applied in practice. A BTX storage system and coke ovens gas bleeder, located at BlueScope Steel Ltd., are analysed to show the basic characteristics of the methodology. The BTX storage and transfer system is a combination of a batch and a continuous system, transferring BTX material periodically to a tanker. The bleeder is a safety relief system that flares coke ovens gas under high pressure conditions and therefore has two major operational modes: under normal pressure conditions and high pressure conditions when flaring occurs. A benzene saturation unit, at BP Refinery (Bulwer Island), is studied to show how the BLHAZID methodology can be applied to more intricate process systems. The benzene saturation unit contains a benzene <b>hydrogenation</b> <b>reactor</b> circuit combined with a control system and a large recycle of material and energy. These industrial case studies showed that the BLHAZID methodology generated outcomes that contained increased coverage and richer causality compared with other HAZID methods, with the extensibility and expressive power of the structured language allowing the effective capture of the BLHAZID outcomes. While the final quality of the outcomes is affected by the strengths of the analysis team, the BLHAZID methodology is indeed more effective at supporting fault diagnosis than other HAZID techniques because of the formal approach of relating capabilities to function and failure, the systematic nature of the workflow, the logical linking between subsystems that allows causality to be traced throughout a process system and the power of the structured language that supports effective reuse of BLHAZID knowledge. This work is a contribution towards a change in the field of HAZID, where detailed theory associated with hazard identification and failure propagation in process systems meets with an increased use of knowledge management tools and practices...|$|E
