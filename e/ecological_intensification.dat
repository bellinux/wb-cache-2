40|$|Worldwide, human {{appropriation}} of ecosystems is disrupting plant–pollinator communities and pollination function through habitat conversion and landscape homogenisation. Conversion to agriculture is destroying and degrading semi-natural ecosystems while conventional land-use intensification (e. g. industrial management of large-scale monocultures with high chemical inputs) homogenises landscape structure and quality. Together, these anthropogenic processes reduce the connectivity of populations and erode floral and nesting resources to undermine pollinator abundance and diversity, and ultimately pollination services. <b>Ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> of agriculture represents a strategic alternative to ameliorate these drivers of pollinator decline while supporting sustainable food production, by promoting biodiversity beneficial to agricultural production through management {{practices such as}} intercropping, crop rotations, farm-level diversification and reduced agrochemical use.

The two main perspectives on sustainable agriculture are an <b>ecological</b> and <b>intensification</b> perspective. Different technologies can serve as a means to support either of these visions. Three important topics of discussion within the public debate are 1) whether or not Dutch farmers should take responsibility to produce food {{for the rest of the}} world even if that has a negative impact on the local environment, 2) the land sparing versus land sharing debate and 3) the belief in a highly technological future for food production versus a growing desire for an authentic, local food production.

40|$|While {{tropical}} deforestation remains widespread, some countries experienced a forest transition—a shift from net deforestation to net reforestation. Costa Rica {{had one of}} the highest deforestation rates in the 1980 s and is now considered as a model of environmental sustainability, despite being a major producer of bananas and pineapples. Wetested three land use processes that are thought to facilitate forest transitions. First, forest transitions may be accompanied by land use displacement through international trade of land-based products, which may undermine the global-scale environmental benefits of national forest protection. Second, reforestation is often associated with land use intensification in agriculture and forestry, allowing for land sparing. Third, this intensification may partly result from a geographical redistribution of land use at the sub-national scale to better match land use with land suitability. These hypotheses were verified for Costa Rica’s forest transition. We also tested whether forest increased mainly in regions with a low ecological value and agriculture expanded in regions with a high <b>ecological</b> value. <b>Intensification</b> and land use redistribution accounted for 76 % of land spared during the forest transition, with 32 % of this spared area corresponding to net reforestation. Decreasing meat exports led to a contraction of pastures, freeing an area equivalent to 80 % of the reforested area. The forest transition in Costa Rica was environmentally beneficial at the global scale, with the reforested area over 1989 – 2013 corresponding to 130 % of the land use displaced abroad through imports of agricultural products. However, expansion of export-oriented cropland caused deforestation in the most ecologically valuable regions of Costa Rica. Moreover, wood extraction from forest plantations increased to produce the pallets needed to export fruits. This highlights the importance of a multi-scale analysis when evaluating causes and impacts of nationalscale forest transitions...|$|R
40|$|The {{debate on}} future global food {{security}} {{is centered on}} increasing yields. This focus on availability of food is overshadowing access and utilization of food, and the stability of these over time. In addition, pleas for increasing yields across the board overlook the diversity of current positions and contexts in which local agriculture functions. And finally, the actual model of production is based on mainstream agricultural models in industrialized societies, in which ecological diversity and benefits from nature have been ignored or replaced by external inputs. The dependence upon external inputs should exacerbate the negative impacts {{on the environment and}} on social equity. Strategies to address future global food security thus require local innovation to increase agricultural production in a sustainable, affordable way in the poorest regions of the world, and to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture and its dependence on non-renewable resources. <b>Ecological</b> <b>intensification,</b> the smart use of biodiversity-mediated ecosystem functions to support agricultural production, is portrayed as the most promising avenue to achieve these goals. Here we first review examples of <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> from around the world. Functional diversity at plant, field and regional scales is shown to hold promise for reducing pesticide need in potato production in the Netherlands, increasing beef production on the pampas and campos in south-east South-America without additional inputs, and staple crop production in various regions in Africa. Strategies range from drawing on high-tech breeding programs to mobilizing and enriching local knowledge and customs of maintaining perennials in annual production systems. Such strategies have in common that larger spatial scales of management, such as landscapes, provide important entry points in addition to the field level. We then argue that the necessary innovation system to support transitions towards <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> and to anchor positive changes should be built from a hybridization of approaches that favour simultaneously bottom-up processes, e. g. developing niches in which experiments with <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> develop, and top-down processes: changing socio-technical regimes which represent conventional production systems through targeted policies. We show that there are prospects for drawing on local experiences and innovation platforms that foster co-learning and support co-evolution of <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> options in specific contexts, when connected with broader change in the realm of policy systems and value chains. This would require dedicated system innovation programmes that connect local and global levels to sustainably anchor change towards <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification.</b> <br/...|$|E

Their common {{aim is to}} improve the levels of specific ecosystem services by driving key ecosystem functions. However, an operational common grid of analysis is needed. Among these approaches, scientists have recently put forward ecological engineering and <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> which provide relevant examples for building and testing a common grid. Here, we propose to integrate ecological engineering and <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> into a generic framework from management practices to ecosystem services. The novelty of this framework is to consider management practices as gradients of inputs to ecosystems. Specifically, management actions are defined according to the type and level of inputs, characterized along a gradient from endogenous to exogenous inputs, and from biological to artificial inputs. Our framework highlights the importance of the interactions between management practices and natural capital properties. These interactions determine the ecosystem functions that will sustain target ecosystem services. We then show how ecological engineering and <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> can be distinguished and unified within our framework. To illustrate this, we use four ecological engineering and <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> case studies representing different types and levels of inputs. Our proposed framework should thus help (1) researchers to make improved assessments of the links between practices, ecosystem structure and functions, and ultimately services, and to foster improved meta-, cost-benefit- and life-cycle analyses and evaluations of ecosystem management approaches; (2) project designers by improving the adequacy of their action to the specified target; and (3) managers to establish the specifications of the ecosystem management adapted to their objective...|$|E

However <b>intensification</b> of dairy farms has degraded waterways and their functions within many regions of New Zealand. Waterways have been left unfenced and accessible to stock, {{which has led to}} increased sedimentation and contamination of surface water, and the loss of other riparian functions that rely on vegetation and clean water such as biodiversity, fishing, swimming, food gathering, and recreational activities. Increasing attention upon these issues both in the media and in public policy, and the perceived need to protect the reputation of the New Zealand dairy industry, has led dairy companies, regional councils and non-governmental organizations to develop voluntary agri-environmental programmes that encourage farmer suppliers of dairy companies to exclude stock from riparian corridors (including from main crossing points) and to progressively plant some of their riparian corridors. There have been surveys of progress towards targets set by these programmes, but little is known about farmers’ first hand experiences of the design and management of their riparian corridors.

40|$|Russia {{sees the}} need to {{increase}} wood production. The aim {{of this paper is}} to contribute to the understanding of barriers and bridges in social and <b>ecological</b> systems for <b>intensification</b> of wood production in NW Russia. This requires that past development trajectories are understood. Using a local logging frontier in Russia's Komi Republic as a case study, we employed an environmental history approach to: (1) recreate the wood harvesting history for the period 1719 - 2014, (2) identify the main actors that produced this history, and (3) analyse what ideologies influenced decision making. First, after a long history of selective harvesting before the Russian Revolution in 1917, forests were rapidly clear-felled during the Soviet period 1921 - 1991. Following general economic deceleration, and thus severely reduced harvesting activities during 1992 - 1997, the rate of logging has increased slightly again. To conclude, barriers in ecosystems to intensification include Soviet legacies of large-scale harvesting, which resulted in a very uneven age distribution, limited and poorly conducted silviculture, as well as insufficient transport infrastructure. Additionally, social system barriers are a conservative mind-set at the policy level, unpredictable conditions for forest use rights and ownership, and limited value-added production at local level. Developing predictable rules and norms, forest zoning at local to regional scales, and the emergence of place-based multi-level collaborative learning concepts like Model Forest provide opportunity for bridging the observed barriers...|$|R
40|$|In <b>ecological</b> or {{sustainable}} <b>intensification,</b> {{increasing the}} agricultural productivity and enhancing ecosystem services is possible through improving resource and input-use efficiency.

Treatments at four levels including 15, 20, 25 and 30 tons of animal manure per hectare were designed. The results showed that the growing season of Fenugreek was coincident with absorbed radiation by canopy, so the time to reach the maximum leaf area index was in accordance with the time to reach the maximum incident radiation by canopy of Fenugreek. The lowest leaf area index (0. 22) and radiation use efficiency (1. 42 g Mj- 1) was obtained with the application of 15 ton ha- 1 animal manure and highest leaf area index (0. 30). And radiation use efficiency (1. 74 g Mj- 1) was obtained with the application of 25 ton ha- 1 animal manure. The results also indicated that increasing the animal manure enhanced leaf area index and consequently radiation use efficiency, but this advantage was seen only up to a certain level of animal manure application (25 ton ha- 1). Thus, sustainable intensification is attainable in a low input agro-ecosystem by improving radiation use efficiency as an appropriate indicator and without any application of additive manure...|$|R

40|$|We need {{to break}} away from {{intensive}} agriculture based on non-renewable and toxic inputs. Safer practices are indeed emerging. Sustainable agriculture started about 50 years ago with the design of integrated pest management (IPM) to counteract pesticide misuse and abuse. <b>Ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> emerged only a few years ago. Here we review the literature to compare <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> and IPM, {{from the point of view}} of crop protection. We present also agroecology and organic farming. Neither <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> nor IPM have philosophical bases such as agroecology, or to an even larger extent, biodynamic agriculture. <b>Ecological</b> <b>intensification,</b> IPM and agroecology are polysemous, flexible and pragmatic approaches, whereas organic farming is well-defined by its scope and standards. E cological intensification, in explicitly pursuing the goal of increasing food production to feed the planet, differs from agroecology, whose proponents think that the view that world hunger will be solved by merely increasing yield is an oversimplification. In terms of cropping system design, in its actual practice, IPM often remains based on methods that increase the efficiency of chemical pesticide use. Or, along with organic agriculture, it may remain based on substitution of pesticides by less harmful alternatives. In contrast, ecologically intensive crop protection usually requires cropping system redesign. In terms of ecosystem service provision, IPM tends to focus on the pest-pathogen regulation service. In contrast, both <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> and agroecology pay attention to both practices which were designed for crop protection and biomass provision purposes, as well as practices with broader scope, primarily designed to offer other ecosystem services which are found to have indirect effects on crop protection. This chapter also describes selected tropical case studies of crop protection, such as upland rice seed-dressing and fruit fly control in orchards, to compare and contrast crop protection in these contexts. Finally, we propose to consider IPM and ecologically intensive crop protection as complementary rather than conflicting approaches. The concept of "ultimate IPM" brings IPM closer to ecologically intensive crop protection. This new approach involves starting from a nearly natural ecosystem to which inputs are gradually added when absolutely necessary, rather than starting from a conventional agroecosystem and gradually remove inputs from it.

40|$|Land-use {{intensification}} (LUI) {{is one of}} {{the main}} global drivers of biodiversity loss with negative impact on ecosystem processes and the services that societies derive from the ecosystems. The effect of LUI on ecosystem processes can be direct through changes in environmental conditions and indirect through changes in plant community. In this dissertation I explored the mechanisms through which land-use intensification affects plant community assembly and ecosystem processes in the Bolivian lowland tropics. Specifically I evaluated: 1) how plant communities respond to LUI via plant response traits, 2) the effects of plant communities on decomposition via their effect traits, and 3) the relative importance of direct and indirect pathways in explaining LUI effects on ecosystem processes. I used two gradients of LUI, a long gradient, including five common and contrasting land use types (mature forest, logged forest, secondary forest, agricultural land, and pastureland), and a short gradient of disturbance intensity represented by four experimental treatments in managed forest (unlogged forest, and forest subject to one of three levels of logging intensity and application of silvicultural treatments). Plant community response and effect were evaluated based on species diversity and functional properties. I measured for the most dominant species 12 functional traits and 14 litter traits. Both gradients of LUI affected functional properties of the plant communities. An increase in LUI shifted plant communities from species characterized by slow growth and slow returns on resource investment (conservative species), toward species characterized by fast growth and fast returns on resources investment (acquisitive species). However, communities with an intermediate position along the LUI gradient (i. e., secondary forests) showed dominance of conservative species mainly due to land use management (abundance of palm species due to frequent burning). Along the short gradient of LUI demographic processes mediated the changes plant communities. With and increase in disturbance caused by logging and silvicultural treatments, there was an increased recruitment of individuals with more acquisitive trait values. Moreover, the response of functional diversity differed between both LUI gradients. Whereas functional diversity decreased along the long LUI gradient, it did not change along the short LUI gradient. Communities with an intermediate position along the long LUI gradient showed higher functional diversity than communities at the extremes of the gradient. Whereas both environmental and management filters drove changes in plant communities along a long LUI gradient, changes along a short LUI gradient were mainly driven by environmental filters. LUI affected litter decomposition through changes in environmental conditions and through changes in plant communities. With an increase in LUI decompositionpotential (measured as mass loss of standard litter incubated in all land use types) decreased. Since soil properties only weakly affected decomposition, other factors were probably the main drivers of the direct effects of LUI on decomposition potential. With increasing LUI the litter decomposability increased due to changes in litter quality produced by plant communities; litter from mature- and logged forest had low decomposability, litter from secondary forest had an intermediate decomposability, and litter from agricultural land and pastureland had high decomposability. Functional traits, such as leaf N concentration, specific leaf area and leaf chlorophyll content, were good and positive predictors of decomposition rate. Although experimentally litter quality explained more variation in decomposition rate across the long LUI gradient (48 %) than environmental site characteristics (17 %), the actual decomposition rate (in-situ decomposition of litter community into its own land use type) was site-dependent, and determined by both drivers that partlycompensated each other. Thus, litter with high decomposability (litter from pastureland) incubated in the land use type with low decomposition potential (pastureland plot) had generally a similar decomposition rate as litter with low decomposability (litter from mature forest) incubated in the land use type with high decomposition potential (mature forest plot). Tropical ecosystems are not only very diverse in species, they are also diverse in their responses to human disturbance. I concluded that LUI has important effects on plant community properties and ecosystem processes. These effects, however, contrast with some predictions of current <b>ecological</b> theory. High <b>intensification</b> of land use does not necessarily lead to low plant functional diversity, and less favourable environmental conditions for decomposition do not necessarily lead to low decomposition rates. Instead, the multiple factors related with management decisions at local scales cause a large heterogeneity of ecosystem responses. Consequently, depending on the management decisions taken, the negative effect of LUI could be mitigated...|$|R

Hedgerow quality affects these benefits and continuous unbroken hedgerows, with a high diversity of woody species, are more valuable for the provision of bumblebees and Linyphiid spiders, while the presence of trees within the hedgerow supports Lycosid spiders. Floral resources, beyond the woody hedgerow species themselves, are also a key forage resource for hoverflies. The impact of these hedgerows on invertebrate abundance is moderated by local landscape, and hedgerows are a more valuable forage resource for pollinators in more intensely managed landscapes.

These are through, applying agricultural ecological processes (<b>ecological</b> <b>intensification),</b> utilising modern livestock breeding (genetic intensification), and socio-economic intensification. <b>Ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> includes continuous housing of cows applying a cut-and-carry feeding system, introduction of purpose-bred forages and pastures, and the introduction of agro-forestry within the dairy systems. Genetic intensification strategies include: importation of dairy breeds such as Holstein–Friesian (HF) and cross-breeding of the indigenous breeds with HF. Training and capacity-building activities to create sustainable livelihoods have been initiated for farming and technological practices of animal husbandry, but also to enhance appropriate leadership and corporative-building skills that would create and support an enabling environment for sustainability. These improvements and initiatives in the service delivery have been championed by national governments, development partner institutions, or non-governmental organisations through different programmes. Challenges of intensification include matching management to genetic potential of imported and cross-bred improved dairy breeds, ensuring low post-harvest losses, proper utilisation, and reducing environmental impact. Using examples from Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia, this paper reviews the management and assessment approaches used in fostering smallholder dairy development strategies and dairy’s contribution to sustainable livelihoods in the face of intensification...|$|E
40|$|Correspondance auteur: Hinsinger P. philippe. hinsinger@supagro. inra. fr In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} global food demand, <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> of agroecosystems is required to increase nutrient use efficiency in plants while decreasing fertilizer inputs. Better exploration and exploitation of soil resources is a major issue for phosphorus, given that rock phosphate ores are finite resources, which {{are going to be}} exhausted in decades from now on. We review the processes governing the acquisition by plants of poorly mobile nutrients in soils, with a particular focus on processes at the root-soil interface. Rhizosphere processes are poorly accounted for in most plant nutrition models. This lack largely explains why present-day models fail at predicting the actual uptake of poorly mobile nutrients such as phosphorus under low input conditions. A first section is dedicated to biophysical processes and the spatial/temporal development of the rhizosphere. A second section concentrates on biochemical/biogeochemical processes, while a third section addresses biological/ecological processes operating in the rhizosphere. New routes for improving soil nutrient efficiency are addressed, with a particular focus on breeding and ecological engineering options. Better mimicking natural ecosystems and exploiting plant diversity appears as an appealing way forward, on this long and winding road towards <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> of agroecosystems...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> {{has been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means to}} achieve environmentally sustainable increases in crop yields by enhancing ecosystem functions that regulate and support production. There is, however, little direct evidence of yield benefits from <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> on commercial farms growing globally important foodstuffs (grains, oilseeds and pulses). We replicated two treatments removing 3 or 8 % of land at the field edge from production to create wildlife habitat in 50 – 60 ha patches over a 900 ha commercial arable farm in central England, and compared these to a business as usual control (no land removed). In the control fields, crop yields were reduced by as much as 38 % at the field edge. Habitat creation in these lower yielding areas led to increased yield in the cropped areas of the fields, and this positive effect became more pronounced over 6 years. As a consequence, yields at the field scale were maintained—and, indeed, enhanced for some crops—despite the loss of cropland for habitat creation. These results suggested that over a 5 -year crop rotation, there would be no adverse impact on overall yield in terms of monetary value or nutritional energy. This study provides a clear demonstration that wildlife-friendly management which supports ecosystem services is compatible with, and can even increase, crop yields...|$|E
40|$|French {{agriculture}} is now facing a dual challenge of environmental sustainability and productivity. Further to the Grenelle Environment Conference (Environment roundtables organized in 2007 by the French government), Ecologically Intensive Agriculture (EIA) {{has emerged as}} a new concept to reach this dual challenge. This paper uses an economic approach to analyse the emerging concept of EIA and its specificities. It discusses the relevance of <b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> and natural resources productivity concepts at the farm level. It shows the measurement of productive efficiency of farms as a methodological framework for assessing the EIA approach...|$|E

Nevertheless, deep differences exist between the acception of agroécology: on the one hand, weak agroecology (<b>ecological</b> <b>intensification</b> [...] .) {{is limited to the}} appication of techniques that combine economic and environmental performances, in the frame of the present socio-economical system; on the other hand, strong agroecology adress a complete (i. e. ecological and social and economic) shift with the present paradigm of industrial agriculture...|$|E

The application of Quantitative Population Epigenetics {{as a catalyst for}} sustainable agriculture offers earning opportunities (market segments or business cases) for the existing players in the high-input agriculture in terms of win-win. For example, agriculture is a major factor in eutrophication of surface waters. By using epigenetically active compounds to switch on yield or stress genes, new crop varieties for low-input agriculture could be developed to improve nitrogen and water use efficiency for cereal production significantly. ...|$|E
