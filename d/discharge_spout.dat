The single loop bag is {{suitable}} for one man operation {{as there is no}} need for a second man to put the loops on the loader hook.

5000|$|... 1) Centrifugal Discharge Elevator - Typically, this is {{the style}} of {{elevator}} used in grain handling facilities we are all familiar with along rivers, ports or on the farm. The elevator buckets discharge product freely {{by the use of}} centrifugal force. Product flings out of the bucket into the <b>discharge</b> <b>spout</b> located {{at the top of the}} elevator. The most common style elevator bucket seen in agricultural application is the [...] "CC" [...] style. This style is most recognized by the four breaks in the inside bottom of the bucket, straight sides and the presence of high sides or [...] "ears". An example of this style is made by a variety of manufacturers TOPS Inc. [...] "CC Swift", MAXI-LIFT [...] "Tiger - CC" [...] or [...] "CC- Max" [...] or Tapco's [...] "CC-HD". 2) Continuous Discharge Elevator - This style bucket elevator is used typically to discharge sluggish and non free flowing product where the elevator buckets discharge on top of each other. Speeds are run in the 125 fpm range to accomplish this type of centrifugal force. Common styles of elevator buckets seen in this application would be the MF, HF, LF, and HFO due tot their [...] "V" [...] style among other attributes. 3) Positive Discharge Elevator - Elevator design where the buckets are used to elevate commodities such as popcorn, candy and potato chips where the utmost concern is on gentle handling and finished food grade applications. This style elevator bucket operates off a double strand chain where they are held in place by two pins so the bucket is allowed to freely swivel. To discharge the bucket it's mechanically tripped to flip and discharge but until this action the bucket is held parallel with the floor and upright. These elevators typically form an [...] "S" [...] or [...] "L" [...] in design and run throughout a plant.|$|E
30|$|The paper sludge (PS) used in {{this study}} was {{supplied}} from the final waste sludge <b>discharge</b> <b>spout</b> of deinked pulp manufacturing process in Chuetsu Pulp & Paper Co., Ltd. (Toyama, Japan). The moisture content of PS was around 50  % by squeezing of the filler-pressed machine. It was sealed in plastic Ziploc bags and stored at − 30  °C until experimental use. PS was analyzed after oven drying at 50  °C to constant weight. The PS components of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, acid-soluble lignin and ash were assayed by Klason lignin method (Lopez et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|There {{the study}} object is the hydrodynamics of gaseous and {{two-phase}} flow of multicomponent fluid in the inclined and vertical wells with the carrying off. The paper {{purpose is to}} study the motion of gaseous, two-phase multicomponent mixes {{with regard to the}} pool properties, with regard to the phase transitions, with regard to the effect influence in the zone near the bottom and with regard to the heat exchange with the rocks in the inclined and vertical wells with the added inclined carrying off. The mathematical model describing the two-phase one-rate, one-temperature flow has been adapted for the flow conditions in the inclined wells and in the wells with the carrying off. The influence of Joule - Thomson effect on the temperature of zone near the bottom has been taken account. The algorithms and the software package for the assessment of critical <b>discharge</b> of <b>spouting</b> wells and for the choice of means of spout control have been created on the basis of adapted model describing the two-phase flowAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

Throbbing and rattling, she fought the water that held Arcturus down. A greaser touched the crosshead-slides with a tallow swab, and a panting fireman thrust a bar through the furnace door. Their skin was blackened by sweat and coal dust; soaked singlets, tight like gloves, clung to their lean bodies. Nobody else, however, was actively occupied. The negroes lay on the deck and the white men lounged {{in the shade of}} the awning. They had done all that flesh and blood could do, in a climate that breaks the white man's strength, and now the tide ought to finish their labor. But they did not know, and some doubted.|$|R
50|$|Hyampolis lay in {{a valley}} in east Phocis, about eight {{kilometers}} from Abae, north-northwest of Orchomenus and southwest of Atalanti. The city is mentioned in Homer's Iliad (Catalogue of Ships). Until today only a wall from the 4th century BC and some other substantial remains survive. William Martin Leake in the 19th century described the archaeological site as follows:The entire circuit of the fortifications is traceable, but they are most complete on the western side. The masonry is of the third order, nearly approaching to the most regular kind. The circumference is about three-quarters of a mile. The direct distance to this ruin from the summit of Abae is not {{more than a mile}} and a half in a north-west direction. Below Vogdháni, on the side of a steep bank which falls to the valley of Khúbavo, a fountain issuing from the rock is <b>discharged</b> through two <b>spouts</b> into a stone reservoir of ancient construction, which stands probably in its original place.|$|R

Evaluated were three variants of technological. Evaluated were 3 variants of technological procedures with using the shredder with <b>discharge</b> <b>spout,</b> shredder with container and the vine cane baler. For the individual variants were modeled operating costs, depending {{on the extent of}} the annual use that reflects the size of the vineyard. The operating costs were also confronted with the price of wood chips.

40|$|Crop yield map is {{a useful}} means to {{quantify}} yield variations within the fields {{and to provide a}} scientific basis for implementing site-specific crop management strategies. This research explores the feasibility of developing a new silage yield monitoring system by employing a new mass flow sensor based on using the momentum of chopped material impacting a pivoted plate loaded by a retractable spring installed {{at the end of a}} chopper <b>discharge</b> <b>spout.</b> A precise rotary potentiometer was used to measure the degree of pivoted plate rotation. To save and process the output voltage of the potentiometer, a programmable circuit comprising of AVR microcontroller ATMEGA series and MAX 232 microchip was used and the output data was sent to a portable computer for further processing. To calibrate the output signal of the sensor versus instantaneous chopped material flow rate, the chopper was fed artificially with predetermined mass flow rates of 6, 8 and 10 kg s- 1 of silage corn at five replications for each feeding rate. The results of statistical analysis showed high correlation between degrees of the pivoted-plate rotation and instantaneous feed rates with adjusted R 2 of 0. 98. To evaluate the accuracy of mass flow rate estimation, a platform scale weighing system was used during the field tests. The statistical analysis did not show any significant difference between sensor mass flow rate estimation and platform scale weighing system output. By using the resulted calibration equation, yield map of a silage cornfield was generated...|$|E
40|$|Supplying {{air with}} ball spout air {{diffusers}} {{is a common}} air-conditioning system for air distribution in large space stadiums. When supplying hot air with ball spout diffusers in winter, the phenomenon of hot jet upturning may appear, so the design should consider adjusting the spout angle so as to control the rising airflow. The purpose of the paper is to predict and optimize the air distribution of a tennis hall in winter {{for the purpose of}} guiding the design and regulation of air-conditioning system. Based on the optimal scheme of summer conditions, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique, the air distribution and indoor thermal environment of a tennis hall in winter were numerically simulated. Two conditions were considered <b>discharging</b> air with <b>spouts</b> downwards with a 30 degree slope and discharging air horizontally. Indoor thermal environment was evaluated from two case studies including the protection of the movement of the ball and thermal comfort of the human body, and consequently, the optimal design was then proposed. The results can provide some guidance for air distribution design and spout regulation in winter conditions of air-conditioning systems in similar tennis halls...|$|R
