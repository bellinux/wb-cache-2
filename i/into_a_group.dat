5|$|According to Hesler and Smith's 1979 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Lactarius, L.torminosus belongs to subgenus Piperites, section Piperites (in which it is the type species), subsection Piperites. Species in this subsection are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow. A 2004 phylogenetic analysis of European Lactarius species concluded that L.torminosus falls <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> that includes L.torminosulus, and that these two species {{are closely related to}} a group that includes L.tesquorum, L.scoticus, and L.pubescens.|$|E

The heaviest margins were in the defeats to Czechoslovakia and Finland, 181 and 192 respectively. Australia scored only 10 goals in reply.|$|E

El Salvador was drawn <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> with Belize, Nicaragua, and Panama. La Selecta defeated Nicaragua 2–0, Belize 5–2, and lost 2–0 against Panama, which was enough to let them advance from the group in second place. In the semifinals they lost to Honduras, again by a 2–0 score. In the third place match, they faced Panama again, losing in a penalty shootout 4–5 after a 0–0 draw. This performance was enough to qualify El Salvador for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The team was coached by José Luis Rugamas.

Two El Salvador players, Alexander Escobar and Eliseo Quintanilla, were awarded red cards in the first half, while Deris Umanzor, Rodolfo Zelaya, and goalkeeper Juan José Gómez were injured and had to leave the game after El Salvador had already exhausted their three substitutions. The game was awarded 3–0 to Costa Rica. In the third place playoff, Honduras earned a win over La Selecta with the only goal scored by Roger Espinoza (30'). At the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup, El Salvador were in Group A alongside Canada, Costa Rica, and Jamaica.
