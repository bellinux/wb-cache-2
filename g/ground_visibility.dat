Flight crew reported that MZ 8968 was descending and was instructed to call when at a position 5 minutes from Kaimana.

The center section had a large negative dihedral (anhedral) and the outer surfaces a positive dihedral. This created the inverted gull, or [...] "cranked", wing pattern along the Ju 87's leading edge.

500|$|Both {{flights of}} 56 Squadron {{took off from}} {{their side of the}} trench lines at 17:00 hours.

McCudden later noted there were lower scattered layered skeins of clouds, but horizontal visibility was fair. On the other hand, he saw <b>ground</b> <b>visibility</b> was veiled by haze. He also noted friendly aircraft swarming to the north as his flight approached the Battle of Passchendaele.

50|$|The {{cemetery}} area {{is situated}} {{adjacent to a}} vehicle access track running northeast from the Old Bundulla Homestead towards the Dawson River. There were 72 deaths on the settlement while this cemetery was in use between 1918 and 1920. The ground penetrating radar survey by L 'Oste-Brown et al. (1995) identified 24 possible graves including some trench graves probably associated with the 1919 Spanish influenza epidemic which struck the settlement. All graves were recorded to maximum depths of 1.1-1.2 metres. The cemetery {{is marked by a}} sign and its perimeter defined by white-painted rocks and star pickets. The area is heavily grassed affecting <b>ground</b> surface <b>visibility</b> across the cemetery area and beyond. Small exposures are located across the site giving some visibility in small patches with reasonable <b>ground</b> surface <b>visibility</b> on exposures. There are no marked graves.|$|R
30|$|During the {{measurement}} period, the <b>ground</b> horizontal <b>visibility</b> Vis {{was obtained by}} using lidar, and the air temperature Ta and relative humidity RH were obtained by using temperature and humidity meter.

This was improved with the P-40D (Kittyhawk I) which abandoned the synchronized gun mounts and instead had two [...]50in (12.7mm) guns in each wing, although Caldwell still preferred the earlier Tomahawk in other respects. The D had armor around the engine and the cockpit, which enabled it to withstand considerable damage. This allowed Allied pilots in Asia and the Pacific to attack Japanese fighters head on, {{rather than try to}} out-turn and out-climb their opponents. Late-model P-40s were well armored. Visibility was adequate, although hampered by a complex windscreen frame, and completely blocked to the rear in early models by a raised turtledeck. Poor <b>ground</b> <b>visibility</b> and relatively narrow landing gear track caused many losses on the ground.|$|E
50|$|FAR 91.175 {{requires}} that a pilot decide 200 feet before landing if their <b>ground</b> <b>visibility</b> {{is good enough}} to land or whether to circle around for another try. Enhanced Vision Systems (EVS) allow them to hold off until 100-150 feet.|$|E

5000|$|On August 12, 1930, a ČSA Ford 5-AT-C Trimotor (registration OK-FOR) crashed near Jihlava (Iglau) while {{attempting}} to avoid a thunderstorm. The aircraft struck the <b>ground</b> in poor <b>visibility</b> after a sharp turn to avoid a chimney and caught fire, killing 12 of 13 on board.|$|R
50|$|It was a {{conventional}} design, albeit with some unique characteristics. The carriage was {{mounted on a}} double-crank, curved axle which made it lower to the <b>ground,</b> reducing <b>visibility</b> and improving stability. The curved axle allowed the weapon to traverse without movement of the wheels, although traverse was still limited {{by the need to}} prevent the recoiling barrel from hitting the carriage. In addition the spade was pivot-mounted allowing the weapon to traverse without disturbing the spade. This movement of the carriage without moving the wheels or spade produced a very accurate weapon.|$|R
50|$|In Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E surface areas, {{operation}} of the airport beacon during the hours of daylight often indicates that the <b>ground</b> <b>visibility</b> is less than 3 miles and/or the ceiling is less than 1,000 feet. Regardless of the weather conditions, the FAA has no regulation that requires airports to turn the beacon on during the day.|$|E
5000|$|Only pilots may {{initiate}} {{a request for}} this type of approach, as regulations prohibit air traffic control (ATC) from asking pilots to perform them. [...] A contact approach will only be issued if the aircraft is operating clear of clouds with at least 1-mile of flight visibility, with a reasonable expectation of continuing to the destination airport under those conditions.

5000|$|The Douglas Commercial Model 5 was {{developed}} in 1938 as a 16-22 seat [...] civilian airliner, designed to use either Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet or Wright R-1820 Cyclone engines. It was the first airliner to combine shoulder wings and tricycle landing gear, a configuration that is still common in turboprop airliners and military transport aircraft.The tricycle landing gear was innovative for transport airplanes. It provided better ground handling and better <b>ground</b> <b>visibility</b> for the pilots. The fuselage was about two feet above the ground, so loading of passengers and cargo was easier than conventional geared aircraft.A very early design change was {{the addition of a}} 15-degree dihedral to the horizontal tail group to improve stability. Another significant modification was adding exhaust stacks to the engine nacelles, which was retroactively incorporated after the series entered production. An unusual optical trick was applied to the prototype. The top of the vertical stabilizer and the outline of the engine nacelles were painted a darker color following the aircraft's contour, making the tail and engines appear somewhat smaller and the aircraft sleeker.|$|E

50|$|By 1928 {{there was}} {{significant}} government aviation activity in French African colonies. Initially this involved the Breguet 14, a largely metal-framed World War I bomber that was gradually {{replaced by the}} newer but wooden Potez 25. It was soon realised that in the hot humid climates, metal-framed aircraft were more durable and required less maintenance; as a result a new category for French aircraft, the Colonial type, was established. In 1930 the Air Ministry issued a programme with design criteria for both single and multi-engine types. The latter, designated Col 3, was required to have three 224 kW (300 hp) engines, providing the ability to maintain an altitude of 2,000 m (6,600 ft) with one engine out. It was to have four roles: photo-reconnaissance, whilst equipped with radio, a machine gun and 54×1 kg (2.2 lb) grenades; ground attack, with two crew and the same grenade load, an extra machine gun and 24×10 kg (22 lb) bombload; ambulance, with one pilot, one medic and two wounded; and transport, with a pilot and four passengers. The high-wing design would improve <b>ground</b> <b>visibility.</b> In 1927, before this specification had appeared or the Colonial types had been defined, Bernard had built its 1927 three-engine, five seat Bernard SIMB AB 16 for similar tasks, but in 1930 prepared an all-metal version of the Bernard 60 T civil transport as the Bernard 160 Col 3.|$|E

While the delineation of low stratiform clouds can now be achieved with good skill, the identification of areas where <b>ground</b> <b>visibility</b> is impaired still used to pose a major problem (see figure 1).

40|$|In May 1980, the Center for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio, {{carried out}} an archaeological {{survey of the}} {{proposed}} route of an eight-inch pipeline to be installed by the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company. The pipeline will extend from the Scurlock Oil Company tank farm about one kilometer southwest of Sabine Pass to a landfall on the Gulf Coast at a point about six kilometers west of Texas Point (Fig. 1). The survey was done under contract between the Center for Archaeological Research and the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Independent Contractor-Letter Agreement of May 1980).
