5|$|With The Mansion Of Happiness {{published}} from 1800 in England to 1926 in The United States, it is {{the longest}} continuously published board game with a known designer, George Fox. That totals 126 years of continuous publication. Obviously Chess, <b>Draughts</b> (Checkers), Go, and many other board games have been continuously published for a longer time, {{but no one knows}} the designer of these games.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a {{software}} program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC {{was one of the}} first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his <b>draughts</b> program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's <b>draughts</b> program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall at {{the centre}} of the north range is entered through a porch and screens passage, a feature common in houses of the period, {{designed}} to protect the occupants from <b>draughts.</b> As the screens are now missing, they may have been free-standing like those at Rufford Old Hall. The porch is decorated with elaborate carvings. The Great Hall's roof is supported by arch-braced trusses, which are decorated with carved motifs including dragons. The floor, now flagged, would probably originally have been rush-covered earth, with a central hearth. The gabled bay window overlooking the courtyard was added in 1559. The original service wing {{to the west of the}} Great Hall, behind the screens passage, was rebuilt in 1546, and housed a kitchen, buttery and pantry. A hidden shaft was discovered during a 19th-century investigation of two secret rooms above the kitchen, connecting them to a tunnel leading to the moat, the entrance to which has since been filled in. The west range now houses the gift shop and restaurant.|$|E
50|$|Types of <b>draught</b> {{can also}} be divided into induced <b>draught,</b> where exhaust gases are {{pulled out of the}} boiler; forced <b>draught,</b> where fresh air is pushed into the boiler; and {{balanced}} <b>draught,</b> where both effects are employed. Natural <b>draught</b> {{through the use of a}} chimney is a type of induced draught; mechanical <b>draught</b> can be induced, forced or balanced.|$|R
50|$|Most modern boilers {{depend on}} {{mechanical}} <b>draught</b> rather than natural <b>draught.</b> This is because natural <b>draught</b> {{is subject to}} outside air conditions and temperature of flue gases leaving the furnace, {{as well as the}} chimney height. All these factors make proper <b>draught</b> hard to attain and therefore make mechanical <b>draught</b> equipment much more reliable and economical.|$|R

5|$|The Nimrod {{was created}} {{only four years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and one year after a similar purpose built game-playing machine, Bertie the Brain, the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort. The Nimrod is considered under some definitions one of the first video games, possibly the second. While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while the Nimrod and Bertie did not feature an electronic screen they both had a game running on a computer. The software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a <b>draughts</b> program by Christopher Strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were the first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than through light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, human–computer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's <b>draughts</b> program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students {{by the end of the}} 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E
5|$|OXO or Noughts and Crosses is a {{video game}} {{developed}} by A S Douglas in 1952 for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of noughts and crosses. It {{was one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. Douglas programmed the game as part of a thesis on human-computer interaction for the University of Cambridge. The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and had three small cathode ray tube screens to display the state of the memory; Douglas re-purposed one screen to demonstrate portraying other information to the user, such as the state of a noughts and crosses game. After the game served its purpose, it was discarded on the original hardware but later successfully reconstructed. OXO, along with a <b>draughts</b> game by Christopher Strachey completed around the same time, is one of the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Under some definitions, it thus may qualify as the first video game, though other definitions exclude it due to its lack of moving or real-time updating graphics.|$|E

5|$|Tennis for Two is {{considered}} under some definitions {{to be the}} first video game. Other candidates with stronger candidacies from a technological standpoint include the 1947 cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, though it did not run on a computing device; the 1950 Bertie the Brain, the earliest known game to run on a computer, though it used light bulbs for a display; and OXO and a <b>draughts</b> game by Christopher Strachey in 1952, the earliest digital computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Tennis for Two, though it contained no technological developments to separate it from earlier games, has the distinction of being the earliest known computer game with visuals created purely for entertainment purposes. Prior games were created primarily for academic research purposes or to demonstrate the computing power of the underlying machine, {{with the exception of the}} non-computer based cathode-ray tube amusement device. This, therefore, makes Tennis for Two the first video game under some definitions from a philosophical viewpoint rather than a technical one and a distinctive moment in the early history of video games.|$|E
