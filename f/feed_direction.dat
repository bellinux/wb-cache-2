40|$|We present {{experimental}} and theoretical results {{to describe and}} explain processing outcomes when producing nanochannels that are a few times wider than the atomic force microscope (AFM) probe using an AFM. This is achieved when AFM tip-based machining is performed with reciprocating motion of {{the tip of the}} AFM probe. In this case, different <b>feed</b> <b>directions</b> with respect to the orientation of the AFM probe can be used. The machining outputs of interest are the chip formation process, obtained machined quality, and variation in the achieved channel depth. A three-sided pyramidal diamond probe was used under load-controlled conditions. Three <b>feed</b> <b>directions</b> were first investigated in detail. The direction parallel to and towards the probe cantilever, which is defined as “edge forward”, was then chosen for further investigation because it resulted in the best chip formation, machining quality, and material removal efficiency. To accurately reveal the machining mechanisms, several <b>feed</b> <b>directions</b> with different included angles for the pure edge-forward direction were investigated. Upon analysis of the chips and the machined nanochannels, it was found that processing with included angles in the range 0 – 30 ° led to high-quality channels and high material-removal efficiency. In this case, the cutting angles, such as the rake angle, clearance angle, and shear angle, have an important influence on the obtained results. In addition, a machining model was developed to explain the observed machined depth variation when scratching in different <b>feed</b> <b>directions...</b>|$|R

This investigation tested whether a complete and sound RPD casting can be obtained when a minimal amount of metal is used, A factorial experimental design, three spruing methods, two metal <b>feeding</b> <b>directions,</b> and two different weights of metal were used to cast 60 Kennedy class II, modification 1 RPDs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{vibrations}} of {{a workpiece}} during machining shorten the tool life and deteriorate the surface roughness {{in cases where}} the workpieces have a low stiffness (as is the case with artificial hip joints). In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the vibrations of the workpiece at the cutting point; this method is based on an algorithm that generates a cutting path to minimize workpiece displacements. The generation of the cutting path takes into account the workpiece stiffness, cutting force vectors, the material removal process, <b>feed</b> <b>directions,</b> and tool orientation.

50|$|The {{face milling}} process can in {{principle}} produce very flat surfaces. However, in practice the result always shows visible trochoidal marks following {{the motion of}} points on the cutter's end face. These revolution marks give the characteristic finish of a face milled surface. Revolution marks can have significant roughness depending on factors such as flatness of the cutter's end face {{and the degree of}} perpendicularity between the cutter's rotation axis and <b>feed</b> <b>direction.</b> Often a final pass with a slow feed rate is used to improve the surface finish after the bulk of the material has been removed..

50|$|Besides the {{direction}} of purge gas flow relative to soil <b>feed</b> <b>direction,</b> there is one major difference in configuration between countercurrent and cocurrent rotary dryers. The purge gas from a countercurrent rotary dryer is typically only 350 °F to 500 °F and does not require cooling before entering the baghouse where fine particles are trapped. A disadvantage is that these particles {{may not have been}} decontaminated and are typically recycled to the dryer. Countercurrent dryers have several advantages over cocurrent systems. They are more efficient in transferring heat from purge gas to contaminated soil, and the volume and temperature of exit gas are lower, allowing the gas to go directly to a baghouse without needing to be cooled. The cooler exit gas temperature and smaller volume eliminates the need for a cooling unit, which allows downstream processing equipment to be smaller. Countercurrent systems are effective on petroleum products with molecular weights lower than No.2 fuel oil.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises obtaining a maximum absorption of the laser beam at a predetermined workpiece thickness, in which an inclination angle (phi c) of a cutting front by an adjustment of the geometry of the laser beam using beam formation and/or a movement of the focal points of the laser beam superimposed to the feed motion are changed, and superimposing an oscillating deflection of the laser beam to an uniform feed motion.

40|$|Vibrations of a tool or a {{workpiece}} in cutting shorten tool life and deteriorate a surface roughness. In this research, we propose {{a method to}} reduce vibrations of the workpiece at a cutting point. An algorithm that generates a cutting path to minimize workpiece displacements at a cutting point is developed. In this algorithm, the cutting path is generated with changing <b>feed</b> <b>directions,</b> tool posture and material removal process by considering workpiece compliance matrices and cutting force vectors. <b>Feed</b> <b>directions</b> and tool posture are changed to control {{the direction of the}} cutting force vector.

Minimum workpiece displacement at a cutting point is calculated from these calculated results.

50|$|Since carbide {{saw blades}} are circular, they are {{radially}} the stiffest {{elements of the}} power train {{in the direction of}} the feed, but very unstable perpendicular to the <b>feed</b> <b>direction.</b> Due to the thin blade body the blades must be stabilized to minimize the side vibration amplitudes. When the first experiments with carbide saws were made, a development engineer of Advanced Machine & Engineering in Rockford stabilized the blade by using a broomstick which he pushed against the vibrating blade, minimizing the vibrations. From this experience a blade stabilizer was developed using two plastic coated ball bearings mounted on eccentric shafts and supported by a welded bracket to the gearbox. Horst Doepcke, who saw this method during experiments carried out by Metalcut, also describes them in his dissertation “Sägen von Rohren mit hartmetallbestückten Kreissägeblättern”. Further Amsaw developments lead to segment stabilizers, whereby on both sides of the blade adjustable plastic-coated plates minimized the blade vibrations (AME). Other manufacturers later used similar slide elements as “vibration dampeners”. These erroneously labeled vibration dampeners did not however dampen the oscillations, but merely minimized the amplitudes. Mr. Doepke describes this function in detail in his dissertation.Recently the Advanced Machine & Engineering Company has developed a pair of front stabilizers for its AMSAW machines arranged close to the point at which the blade enters the material. These stabilizers hydraulically extend, when the carbide teeth have moved past the stabilizer tips before cutting and stabilize the blade which also help to guide the blade into the cut to improve the accuracy. Other forms of stabilizers are listed in German in the VDI Verlag Nr. 1999 by Dipl.-Ing. Rainer Liebrecht. This report especially addresses the effect of vibration on saw blades.|$|E

It was noted vortex settling facilitated settling of the printing ink and the strategy of regularly alternating <b>feed</b> <b>direction</b> in the OF resulted in a higher permeate flux compared to the corresponding flux for operation without alternating <b>feed</b> <b>direction.</b> The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the vortex settling tank (VST) used in the pilot-scale experiment was 14 min while <b>feed</b> <b>direction</b> to the stage- 2 OF was alternated once every hour.
