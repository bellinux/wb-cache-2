5|$|On February 15, 1993, Clinton {{made his}} first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit. Two days later, in a nationally {{televised}} address to {{a joint session of}} Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{works were}} not usually {{produced}} on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images {{that would be}} most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in {{certain areas of the}} major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.|$|E
5|$|The general {{atmosphere}} of enrichment and satisfaction {{during the period}} of economic growth in Côte d'Ivoire made it possible for Houphouët-Boigny to maintain and control internal political tensions. His easygoing authoritarian regime, where political prisoners were almost nonexistent, was well accepted by the population. However, the economic crisis that began in the 1980s caused a sharp decline in living conditions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> and underprivileged urban populations. According to the World Bank, the population living below the poverty threshold went from 11% in 1985 to 31% by 1993. Despite the implementation of certain measures, such as the reduction of the number of young French workers (who worked abroad while serving in the military) from 3,000 to 2,000 in 1986, allowing many jobs to go to young Ivorian graduates, the government failed to control the rising rates of unemployment and bankruptcy in many companies.|$|E

25|$|Four Andean civilizations {{flourished in}} Late Intermediate Period: the Chancay, Chimú, Lambayeque, and Ica. Luxury goods, {{including}} elaborate ceramics, were mass-produced in vast quantities <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> {{as well as}} nobles. Identical ceramics created in molds took sway over individualized works. The Lambayeque culture of north coastal Peru created press-molded reliefs on blackware ceramics. Chimú ceramics, also predominantly blackware, often featured zoomorphic appliqués, such as monkeys or sea birds. They excelled at the doubled-chambered whistling vessels. Chancay ceramics, from the central coast, featured black-on-white designs on unique shapes, such as female effigies or elongated, oval jars. Their sand-tempered ceramics were hastily painted and left unpolished. Ica culture ceramics, from the southern coasts, were the finest quality of their time. They were still handcrafted and had {{a wide range of}} polychrome slips, including black, maroon, orange, purple, red, white, and a glittery deep purple. Designs were abstract and geometric.|$|E

25|$|In 1534 the Diocese of Goa {{was created}} from the Diocese of Funchal {{to serve as}} a common diocese for the western coast of India, {{including}} Goa and the area in and around Bombay. Missionaries of the newly founded Society of Jesus were sent to Goa; the Portuguese colonial government supported the Catholic mission with incentives for baptised Christians. They offered rice donations for the poor, good positions in the Portuguese colonies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> and military support for local rulers. Many Indians were converted opportunistic Rice Christians who continued to practise their old religion. The Portuguese, in their efforts to keep Christian purity, insisted the converts should avoid anything Hindu. Portuguese rulers insisted the natives should adopt foreign food habits and dress. They also gave European names to the natives. But Konkani Christians wanted to preserve their language, culture and manners. At the same time the Portuguese colonizers in Goa imposed excessive taxes on the native Christians. The taxes were so huge that in 1642 some native Goans sent a memorandum to Lisbon, the capital of Portugal.|$|E
25|$|The temple gained great {{popularity}} {{during the}} 1980s (during the Asian economic boom), {{especially among the}} growing well-educated and entrepreneurial middle class, mostly small-business owners and technocrats of Sino-Thai origin. Royalty and high-standing civil servants also started to visit the temple, including the generals Arthit Kamlang-ek and Chaovalit Yongchaiyuth. During this period the temple experienced tremendous growth in terms of monks, lay workers and temple visitors. The temple therefore established a screening procedure for newcomer employees. Furthermore, Mae chi Chandra set strict rules and regulations for the community, such as a prohibition on political lobbying and selling things in the temple. Wat Phra Dhammakaya emphasized values of prosperity, modernity and personal development, which made it attractive <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> especially during times of quick cultural and social changes. By the mid-1980s, the temple was attracting up to fifty thousand people on major ceremonies. The Dhammadaya ordination program started out with sixty participants in 1979; by 1986, over a thousand participants joined. In 1990, the temple had 260 monks, 214 samaneras (novices that are minors) and 441 full-time employees. In 1995, Wat Phra Dhammakaya caught the nation's attention when a Magha Puja celebration was broadcast live on television, with the then Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn {{as chairman of the}} ceremony.|$|E

Gordon-Cumming managed to disguise his contempt <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> society to which he was now limited so that he could continue to indulge himself in golf, croquet, billiards, cricket, bridge and collecting post marks. He also enjoyed his own company, and that of his dogs and pet monkey. He hated Dawlish and considered his wife a [...] "fat little frump", unapologetically engaging in chronic infidelity. Florence lost no opportunity to remind him who funded their life but eventually herself resorted to alcohol abuse; the couple had effectively separated before she died in 1922.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{was baptized}} a Roman Catholic and {{attended}} mass as a child, {{but did not}} have a heavily religious upbringing. His parents divorced when he was nine, leaving the children to be raised primarily by their mother. Hoffman's childhood passion was sports, particularly wrestling and baseball, but at age 12, he saw a stage production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons and was transfixed. He recalled in 2008, [...] "I was changed– permanently changed– by that experience. It was like a miracle to me". Hoffman developed a love for the theater, and proceeded to attend regularly with his mother, who was a lifelong enthusiast. He remembered that productions of Quilters and Alms <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Class,</b> the latter starring a teenaged Robert Downey, Jr., were also particularly inspirational. At the age of 14, Hoffman suffered a neck injury that ended his sporting activity, and he began to consider acting. Encouraged by his mother, he joined a drama club, and initially committed to it because he was attracted to a female member.|$|E
500|$|Manor houses include Goldney Hall, {{where the}} highly {{decorated}} Grotto dates from 1739.

Residential buildings include the Georgian Portland Square and the complex of small cottages around a green at Blaise Hamlet, which was built around 1811 for retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House. The 18th-century Kings Weston House, in northern Bristol, was designed by John Vanbrugh and is the only Vanbrugh building in any UK city outside London. Almshouses and pubs from the same period intermingle with modern development. Several Georgian squares were designed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> as prosperity increased during the 18th century. During World War II, the city centre was heavily bombed during the Bristol Blitz. The central shopping area near Wine Street and Castle Street was particularly hard-hit, and the Dutch House and St Peter's Hospital were destroyed. Nevertheless, in 1961 John Betjeman called Bristol [...] "the most beautiful, interesting and distinguished city in England".|$|E
500|$|During the 1820s and 1830s, Sherwood wrote a {{great many}} tracts for the poor; like her novels <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> they [...] "taught the lessons of {{personal}} endurance, reliance on Providence, and acceptance of one's earthly status." [...] Emphasizing individual experience and one's personal relationship with God, they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to [...] "larger economic and political forces." [...] In this, they resembled the Cheap Repository Tracts, {{many of which were}} written by Hannah More. [...] As Linda Peterson, a scholar of nineteenth-century women's literature, argues, Sherwood's tracts use a Biblical [...] "interpretative frame" [...] in order to highlight the fleetingness of earthly things. For example, in A Drive in the Coach through the Streets of London (1819), Julia is granted the privilege of shopping with her mother only if she will [...] "behave wisely in the streets" [...] and [...] "not give [...] mind to self-pleasing." [...] Of course, she cannot keep this promise and she eagerly peeks in at every store window and begs her mother to buy her everything she sees. [...] Her mother therefore allows her to select one item from every shop. Julia, ecstatic, chooses, among other things, blue satin boots, a penknife, and a new hat with flowers, until the pair reach the undertaker's shop. There her mood droops considerably and she realizes the moral of the lesson, recited by her mother, as she picks out a coffin: [...] "but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth" [...] (1 Timothy 5:6).|$|E
