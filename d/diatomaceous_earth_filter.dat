40|$|Industrial {{production}} of certain amino acids by fermentation requires acquisition of peptide solutions obtained from soybean meal by acidic hydrolysis. Because this hydrolysis is exothermic, {{a great amount}} of heat is released, and the residue is carbonized much like a process that produces charcoal. About one-half of the nitrogen (N) and a majority of the phosphorus (P) remain un-hydrolyzed in this residue. Although this byproduct could be neutralized with lime, I was interested in finding a use for it in its acidic state. Use of this material for establishment of acid-loving crops was a natural selection and blueberries were a logical fit as a crop to be grown. In order to evaluate this acid residue, a comparison of it with accepted soil acidification and modification procedures was deemed appropriate. Current conventional blueberry establishment in Iowa uses sphagnum peat moss (SPM) to alter soil physical conditions and elemental sulfur (ES) to acidify the soil. Besides acidic soybean meal residue (SMR), spent <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> <b>filter</b> (DEF) was used to modify a clay soil to a lighter, silty texture...|$|E

Fiber glass and <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> <b>filters</b> displayed low adsorption and recovery, but an important increase of the adsorption percentage was observed when the filters were treated with cationic polymers (about 99 % adsorption). A new methodology of virus elution was developed in this study, consisting of the slow passage of the eluent through the filter, thus increasing the contact time between eluent and virus adsorbed on the filters. The use of this technique allows a maximum recovery of 71. 2 % compared with 46. 7 % phage recovery obtained by the standard elution procedure. High percentages (over 83 %) of phage adsorption were obtained with different filters from 1 -liter aliquots of the samples, except for Virosorb 1 -MDS filters (between 1. 6 and 32 % phage adsorption).

Microscopic observations revealed two main deformation modes: the debonding of the frustules from the epoxy and crushing/fracture of the frustules.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Sporadic {{outbreaks}} of diacetyl off-flavor in beer are a serious economic {{problem to the}} brewing industry. Studies were carried out {{in an attempt to}} improve the understanding of the problem and to experiment with new ways of controlling this defect. The Owades and Jakovac method of diacetyl determination as modified by Pack was further refined to increase its sensitivity to the low diacetyl levels encountered in beers. A survey of alcoholic beverages showed diacetyl levels of all samples tested to be below threshold levels for organoleptic detection. Comparing yeast strains on a per cell basis, a 2. 5 -fold difference was found to exist between yeast strains in their ability to produce diacetyl. Also, corn steep liquor addition to wort resulted in increased diacetyl production during the subsequent fermentation. Diacetyl removal from beer was studied using both live whole cells and crude enzyme extracts.

Filters tested included the following: wire-wound, sintered filter elements, sintered ceramic fllter elements, cotton stringwound filter elements, felted-cotton filter elements, cation resin, adsorption resin, <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> precoat <b>filter,</b> and a wood-cellulose precoat filter. Parameters measured were flow rate, filter-influent and -effluent boehmite concentration, pressure drop, and final filter load. The pressure drop and efficiency of the filters was correlated with boehmite load. Boehmite deposits on filters as a nonporous gelatinous cake, and causes a rapidly increasing pressure drop. Tests indicate that the optimum load with filter elements and precoat filters is achieved at a pressure drop of 25 psi.

Of the filters tested, the precoat filter snd 40 to 60 mesh cation resin were the more effective in removing boehmite.

40|$|Population {{regulation}} {{results from}} an interplay of numerous intrinsic and external factors, {{and for many}} insects cannibalism is such a factor. This study confirms a previously-reported observation that sublethal exposure to the fossilized remains of diatoms (i. e. <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth)</b> increases net fecundity (eggs produced minus eggs destroyed/day) of flour beetles, Tribolium confusum. The aim was to experimentally test two non-mutually-exclusive ecological mechanisms potentially responsible for the increased net fecundity: higher egg production and lower egg cannibalism. Adult T. confusum were maintained at low or high density in medium containing sublethal (0 - 4 %) <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth.</b> Net fecundity increased up to 2. 1 Ã— control values during <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> exposure, and returned to control levels following removal from <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth.</b> Cannibalism assays on adults showed that <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> {{reduced the number of}} eggs produced to 0. 7 Ã— control values at low density and to 0. 8 Ã— controls at high density, and also reduced egg cannibalism rates of adults to as little as 0. 4 Ã— control values, but at high density only. <b>Diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> also reduced cannibalism by larvae on eggs to 0. 3 Ã— control values. So, while the presence of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> reduced egg production, net fecundity increased as a result of strong suppression of the normal egg cannibalism by adults and larvae that occurs at high beetle density. Undisturbed cultures containing sublethal <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> concentrations reached higher population densities than diatomaceous earth-free controls. Cohort studies on survival from egg to adult indicated that this population increase was due largely to decreased egg cannibalism by adult females.

In this study, the pure <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> mixed with kaolinite and silica flour in several proportion was used to assess how parameters such as Atterberg limits, compression tests, and electrical properties change with <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> content and how these changes may affect the sue use on diatomic soils in engineering applications. Experimental results show that <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> have high liquid and plastic limits. The higher fraction volume of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> allows higher water storage and that is represented on the results of liquid limit and electrical property test results. The permittivity of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth,</b> kaolinite, and silica flour are governed by the availability of volume of free water in the soil specimens.
