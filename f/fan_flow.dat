50|$|A duct leakage tester is a {{diagnostic}} tool {{designed to measure}} the airtightness of forced air heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) ductwork. A duct leakage tester consists of a calibrated fan for measuring an air flow rate and a pressure sensing device to measure the pressure created by the <b>fan</b> <b>flow.</b> The combination of pressure and <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> measurements are {{used to determine the}} ductwork airtightness. The airtightness of ductwork is useful knowledge when trying to improve energy conservation.|$|E

40|$|Effects of an {{external}} delta-wing vortex generator on the flow and heat transfer characteristics in <b>fan</b> <b>flows</b> and uniform flows were experimentally investigated and compared. A heated plate, {{installed on the}} bottom wall of a duct, {{was used as the}} heat transfer surface. Three-component mean and fluctuating velocity measurements were conducted using a laser Doppler velocimetry to characterize the flow structures and to obtain the near-wall flow parameters, including the axial mean velocity, axial vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy. Temperatures on the heat transfer surface were measured using thermocouples to obtain the Nusselt numbers. Results show that the external delta-wing vortex generator in <b>fan</b> <b>flows</b> has little overall effect on the near-wall averaged axial mean velocity and axial vorticity, but increases the turbulent kinetic energy, in the investigated X/D ranges. The increase in the turbulent kinetic energy by the delta-wing has little effect on heat transfer in the inherently vortical <b>fan</b> <b>flows.</b> Consequently, the delta-wing vortex generator in <b>fan</b> <b>flows</b> has little effect on the heat transfer augmentation...|$|R

5000|$|A basic duct {{leakage testing}} system {{includes}} three components: a calibrated fan, a register sealing system, and {{a device to}} measure <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> and building pressure. Supply registers or return air grills are sealed using adhesive tapes, cardboard, or non-adhesive reusable seals. One register or return is left unsealed, and the calibrated fan is connected to it. Pressure is monitored {{in one of the}} branches of the ductwork while the calibrated fan delivers air into the system. As air is delivered into the ductwork, pressure builds and forces air out of all of the openings in the various ductwork connections or through the seams and joints of the furnace or air-conditioner. The tighter the ductwork system (e.g. fewer holes), the less air is needed from the fan to create a change in the ductwork pressure.|$|E
50|$|MERV 14 {{filters are}} capable of {{reducing}} smoke particles by approximately 80% when operating at the filter's design velocity, so a CADR smoke rating on a simple filtering unit that uses a MERV 14 filter will be approximately 0.80 times the <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> rate in CFM. If the filtering unit does not mix the test room's air very well, it may receive a lower CADR measurement {{because it does not}} operate as efficiently as it should. If a filtering unit uses a MERV 12 filter that removes roughly 40% of the smoke particles, then it may still obtain a smoke CADR of 80 by filtering 200 cubic feet per minute instead of 100 CFM. Conversely, a 99.97% HEPA filter (MERV 17) that removes over 99.9% of the smoke particles needs to filter 80 cubic feet per minute to get a CADR of 80. This shows the CFM airflow of a unit is always equal to or greater than the CADR rating.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} of the performance and stability for a shrouded-fan unmanned rotorcraft whose mission profile also prescribes the flight in ground effect. The not so simple estimation of the aerodynamic coefficients and of the thrust in the various situations makes the performance calculation and the stability analysis difficult tasks. This {{is because of the}} strong interaction between the <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> and shroud that causes quite different flow structures about the airframe depending on flight conditions. A further difficulty is related to the ground effect which produces substantial modifications in the rotor thrust and aerodynamic coefficients. To evaluate performance and stability, two models have been developed. One determines the aerodynamic coefficients of the shroud, whereas the other one calculates thrust and moment of the rotors system. Both models take into account the mutual interference between <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> and fuselage and ground effect. Performance and stability are then discussed with reference to significant flight conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{movement}} of the tip-leakage vortex in a <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> is investigated, from data of an existing zonal large-eddy simulation. A methodology is presented to analyze {{the motion of the}} vortex, using low-pass filtering and integral-based vortex identification functions. This approach permits to focus on the largest vortices of the flow at each instant, through normalized criteria. In the present <b>fan</b> <b>flow,</b> the velocity spectra are characterized by a peak frequency associated with a natural un-steadiness, in the casing region downstream of the rotor blades. Using the present methodology, in a plane just downstream of the blade trailing edge, a significant wandering motion of the vortex is shown. Further downstream, where the vortex interacts with the adjacent blade wake, the vortex movement is much more disordered. This is interpreted as a vortex splitting phenomenon. But when only the mean flow and the peak frequency are retained in the analysis, a wandering motion is observed again...|$|E

The DeltaQ test combines a model of the house and duct system with the results of house pressurization tests with the air handler on and off to determine the duct leakage air flows to outside conditioned space at operating conditions. The key advantage of the DeltaQ test over other methods is that it determines the air leakage flows directly, rather than requiring interpretation of indirect measurements.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{was used to}} evaluate the flow field and thrust performance of a promising concept for reducing the noise at take-off of dual-stream turbofan nozzles. The concept, offset stream technology, reduces the jet noise observed on the ground by diverting (offsetting) a portion of the <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> below the core flow, thickening and lengthening this layer between the high-velocity core flow and the ground observers. In this study a wedge placed in the internal fan stream is used as the diverter. Wind, a Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) code, was used to analyze the flow field of the exhaust plume and to calculate nozzle performance. Results showed that the wedge diverts all of the <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> to the lower side of the nozzle, and the turbulent kinetic energy on the observer side of the nozzle is reduced. This reduction in turbulent kinetic energy should correspond to a reduction in noise. However, because all of the <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> is diverted, the upper portion of the core flow is exposed to the freestream, and the turbulent kinetic energy on the upper side of the nozzle is increased, creating an unintended noise source. The blockage due to the wedge reduces the fan mass flow proportional to its blockage, and the overall thrust is consequently reduced. The CFD predictions are in very good agreement with experimental flow field data, demonstrating that RANS CFD can accurately predict the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy fields. While this initial design of a large scale wedge nozzle did not meet noise reduction or thrust goals, this study identified areas for improvement and demonstrated that RANS CFD can be used to improve the concept...|$|E
40|$|Drift {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} issues to consider for realising sustainable pesticide sprays. This study proposes and tests an alternative methodology for quantifying the drift potential (DP) of air blast sprayers, trying to avoid the difficulties faced in conducting field trials according to the standard protocol (ISO 22866 : 2005). For this purpose, an ad hoc test bench designed for DP comparative measurements was used. The proposed methodology was evaluated in terms of robustness, repetitiveness and coherence by arranging a series of trials at two laboratories. Representative orchard and vineyard air blast sprayers in eight configurations (combination of two forward speeds, two air <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> rates, and two nozzle types) were tested. The test bench was placed perpendicular to the spray track to collect the fraction of spray liquid remaining in the air after the spray process and potentially susceptible to drift out of the treated area. Downwind spray deposition curves were obtained and a new approach was proposed to calculate an index value of the DP estimation that could allow the differences among the tested configurations to be described. Results indicated that forward speed of 1. 67 m/s allows better discrimination among configurations tested. Highest DP reduction, over 87. 5 %, was achieved using the TVI nozzles in combination with low air <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> rate in both laboratories; conversely, the highest DP value was obtained with the ATR nozzles in combination with high air <b>fan</b> <b>flow</b> rate.
