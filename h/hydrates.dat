So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas Th(OH)2SO4 and Th(OH)3NO3. The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts. So phosphates, fluorides, oxalates, iodates and carbonates of actinides are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as <b>hydrates,</b> such as ThF4·3H2O and Th(CrO4)2·3H2O.|$|E

40|$|Prevention of gas <b>hydrate</b> {{blockages}} is a {{major challenge}} posed to the petroleum industry because uncontrolled formation of <b>hydrate</b> may result in plugging of transport pipelines, causing considerable production loss and personnel safety hazard. Injection of <b>hydrate</b> inhibitors {{is the most common}} option to prevent <b>hydrate</b> formation. In current industrial practice the dosage of <b>hydrate</b> inhibitor is estimated and injected upstream without much downstream measurements. Therefore, <b>hydrate</b> blockages are still encountered in {{the oil and gas industry}} due to lack of any <b>hydrate</b> monitoring measures against unexpected changes. In this thesis, novel techniques have been developed for monitoring <b>hydrate</b> inhibition and detecting early signs of <b>hydrate</b> formation based on downstream sample analysis and online measurements. The main achievements of this study can be categorised as follow: 1. <b>Hydrate</b> Inhibition Monitoring Techniques: Three techniques, i. e. conductivity-velocity (C-V) technique, water activity technique and water content technique, have been developed for determining optimising inhibitor injection rates 2. Initial <b>Hydrate</b> Formation Detection Techniques: The main objective of detecting early signs of <b>hydrate</b> formation is to give the operators adequate time to prevent <b>hydrate</b> formation and start remediation actions.

5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride.

Hydrogen fluoride readily <b>hydrates</b> on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many <b>hydrates</b> HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many <b>hydrates</b> HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases.

40|$|To better {{understand}} <b>hydrate</b> formation and dissociation mechanisms, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and viscosity measurements {{were employed to}} examine the <b>hydrate</b> transition processes of tetrahydrofuran (THF) - water (D 2 O or H 2 O) solution. Specifically, Spin-Lattice Relaxation Time (T 1) and Spin-Spin Relaxation Time (T 2) of THF in D 2 O were measured before <b>hydrate</b> formation, during <b>hydrate</b> formation, during <b>hydrate</b> dissociation, and after <b>hydrate</b> dissociation to probe the local molecular ordering changes around THF molecules. <b>Hydrate</b> formation and dissociation patterns were imaged using MRI. The viscosity of THF/H 2 O solution was monitored before <b>hydrate</b> formation and after <b>hydrate</b> dissociation using Champion Technologies <b>Hydrate</b> Rocking Cell (CTHRC) to investigate the residual viscosity phenomenon.

T 2 distribution technique was proven to be an effective tool in measuring the dynamic behavior of THF molecules in the <b>hydrate</b> phase and the liquid phase independently and concurrently. Comparison of T 1 's of THF in D 2 O solution during <b>hydrate</b> formation with that during dissociation revealed evidence of residual <b>hydrate</b> structures remaining in the liquid phase. Residual viscosity (as measured by CTHRC) was absent after THF <b>hydrate</b> dissociation. It was suggested that the residual viscosity observed by other groups after natural gas <b>hydrate</b> dissociation was more likely due to higher than equilibrium gas concentration than residual <b>hydrate</b> clathrate structures. To enable direct and accurate measurements of gas <b>hydrate</b> behavior in black oil, liquid-state proton NMR spectroscopy was innovatively applied to monitor the water peak area change in the NMR spectrum of water-in-oil emulsion during <b>hydrate</b> formation and dissociation. Because water in the <b>hydrate</b> phase does not contribute to the water peak area in such a spectrum, as water is being converted into <b>hydrate,</b> the water peak area would decrease.

The sand column was packed in several segments having vertical and horizontal layers with two distinct grain-size sands.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained.

30|$|Estimating gas <b>hydrate</b> {{saturation}} from P-wave velocity data {{using an}} effective medium approach requires {{knowledge of the}} elastic properties of the background rocks and a rock physics model that accounts for the effect of gas <b>hydrate</b> on the host rocks. Estimated gas <b>hydrate</b> saturations can vary widely depending on the model used (Pearson et al. 1983; Mathews 1986; Guerin et al. 1999; Hyndman et al. 1999; Collett et al. 1984, 1999; Collett 2001; Kleinberg et al. 2003; Lee and Collett 2008, 2009). Gas <b>hydrate</b> can be modeled either {{as part of the}} pore fluid (gas <b>hydrate</b> in-pore) or as part of the load-bearing sediment matrix (gas <b>hydrate</b> in-frame) (Helgerud et al. 1999). The gas <b>hydrate</b> in-pore model assumes that the gas <b>hydrate</b> floats in the sediment pore space and does not add stiffness to the sediment frame. As a consequence, the sediment S-(shear) wave velocity is nearly unaffected by the occurrence of gas <b>hydrate.</b> For the gas <b>hydrate</b> in-frame model, grains of gas <b>hydrate</b> are included as part of the sediment frame, stiffening the sediment. For this model, the sediment S-wave velocity is slightly increased by gas <b>hydrate</b> but much less than for a model in which gas <b>hydrate</b> actually cements the grain contacts (e.g., Dvorkin and Nur 1993). Both the gas <b>hydrate</b> in-pore and in-frame models predict an increase in P-wave velocity with increased gas <b>hydrate</b> concentration (slightly more for the gas <b>hydrate</b> in-frame model).
