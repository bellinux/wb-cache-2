40|$|All {{over the}} world, and mainly in United States [10], since 1977 to 1991 the {{research}} {{centers of the}} main automotive companies had processed several statistical data on real accidents between vehicles and pedestrians taking care, obviously, to pedestrians' injury [7]. In latest years a research group of EEVC (European Enhanced Vehicle Safety Committee) had examined the statistic works of past twenty years and subsequent several scientific papers, and had realized some documents about "pedestrian test" procedures [2, 6, 7]. In reference papers of period 1977 - 1997 and in EEVC documents, the scientists describe a proposed homologative test for child-head impact; an impact simulation of a standardized impactor on car bonnet represents it, in order to evaluate the child-head injury as deceleration of its center of gravity [1, 4, 5]. Injury evaluation criteria is an energy criterion and is quantified by the HPC index (<b>Head</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Criteria</b> also called, without distinction, HIC - Head Injury Criteria) defined as follows: HPC = [1 /t(2) -t(1) (t 2) (t 1) integraladt](2. 5) (t(2) -t(1)) max in which t(1) and t(2) are respectively initial and final impact's instants (t(2) -t(1) is the integration range) and a is acceleration resultant vector, measured by an accelerometer mounted in the head-impactor. The HPC index became very high if the bonnet, during its deformation, hits the under-bonnet very hard part. In past researches {{we have used a}} laser reverse engineering facilities for reconstruct the geometry of the external frontal part of a car in order to virtually evaluate, with a numerical/experimental correlated methodology, the performance of the bonnet for Child-Head impact tests. Now we want to evaluate if, {{in all parts of the}} under-bonnet area, we can underline a potential impact with under bonnet hard parts. Our research was propose a new method based on virtual reconstruction of the surface that envelopes all the deformation surfaces in internal part of the bonnet. The deformed shapes of bonnet will be evaluated using FEM explicit codes PamCrash. Using a Pre-processor we will reconstruct, starting from a points (FEM model's nodes) clouds, a new surface of maximum deformed bonnet. This surface will be processed and rapid prototyped as a puzzle of shells with their support. This prototyped surface will be super-imposed on the real under-bonnet layout of car and will allow to easily evaluate where and how much our deformed bonnet could hit the hard-parts of the Engine Lay-out. Our results will show a new easy and fast method to evaluate the potential performance of the front part of a vehicle in Child head impact only reconstructing, with a reverse engineering operation, the bonnet shapes (surface) and, after a simple processing, rapid-prototyping the deformed bonnet-shape, in order to avoid to take all the under-bonnet layout with a reverse engineering operation that could be less easy and very time-consuming...|$|R

40|$|In {{hydrological}} models, {{parameters are}} used to represent the time-invariant characteristics of catchments and to capture different aspects of hydrological response. Hence, model parameters need to be identified based on their role in controlling the hydrological behaviour. For the identification of meaningful parameter values, multiple and complementary <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> are used that compare modelled and measured discharge time series. The reliability of the identification of hydrologically meaningful model parameter values depends on how distinctly a model parameter can be {{assigned to one of}} the <b>performance</b> <b>criteria.</b> To investigate this, we introduce the new concept of connective strength between model parameters and <b>performance</b> <b>criteria.</b> The connective strength assesses the intensity in the interrelationship between model parameters and <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> in a bijective way. In our analysis of connective strength, model simulations are carried out based on a latin hypercube sampling. Ten <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> including Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) and its three components (alpha, beta and r) as well as RSR (the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation) for different segments of the flow duration curve (FDC) are calculated. With a joint analysis of two regression tree (RT) approaches, we derive how a model parameter is connected to different <b>performance</b> <b>criteria.</b> At first, RTs are constructed using each <b>performance</b> <b>criterion</b> as the target variable to detect the most relevant model parameters for each <b>performance</b> <b>criterion.</b> Secondly, RTs are constructed using each parameter as the target variable to detect which <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> are impacted by changes in the values of one distinct model parameter. Based on this, appropriate <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> are identified for each model parameter. In this study, a high bijective connective strength between model parameters and <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> is found for low- and mid-flow conditions. Moreover, the RT analyses emphasise the benefit of an individual analysis of the three components of KGE and of the FDC segments. Furthermore, the RT analyses highlight under which conditions these <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> provide insights into precise parameter identification. Our results show that separate <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> are required to identify dominant parameters on low- and mid-flow conditions, whilst the number of required <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> for high flows increases with increasing process complexity in the catchment. Overall, the analysis of the connective strength between model parameters and <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> using RTs contribute to a more realistic handling of parameters and <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> in hydrological modelling...|$|R

The aim {{of this research is}} to examine, from different points of view, these practitioners in regard to the importance of perceived <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> and their respective performance outcomes in a construction project. A research model is structured based on nine <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> and their respective performances. The data were collected from 324 practitioners who have participated in {{construction projects}} in Hong Kong. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and repeated measures ANOVA are used to analyse the data. The relative importance of nine <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> and their <b>performances</b> are measured. Timely completion of the project is the most important <b>performance</b> <b>criterion,</b> followed by profit, environmental protection and quality. There are differences in the importance of the <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> with respect to performance.

40|$|<b>Performance</b> <b>criteria</b> {{typically}} {{reflect the}} values of the project stakeholders in how they will be viewing their projects. A critical analysis of current research shows that several key challenges being faced in information systems (IS) projects include the lack of clearly defined objectives, mismatched stakeholders' expectations and lack of sufficient or formal methods to aid practitioners in developing relevant <b>performance</b> <b>criteria.</b> This is accentuated by growing calls to rethink the traditional measurement paradigm. Moreover, most of the known solutions in practice are without structured or easily implementable procedures to elicit and develop <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> and measures.

In reference papers of period 1977 - 1997 and in EEVC documents, the scientists describe a proposed homologative test for child-head impact; it is represented by an impact simulation of a standardized impactor on car bonnet, in order to evaluate the child-head injury as deceleration of its center of gravity. Injury evaluation criteria is an energy criterion and is quantified by the HPC index (<b>Head</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Criteria</b> also called, without distinction, HIC - Head Injury Criteria) defined as follows: [GRAPHICS] in which t(1) and t(2) are respectively initial and final impact's instants (t(2) -t(1) is the integration range) and a is acceleration resultant vector, measured by an accelerometer mounted in the head-impactor. Impact duration generally doesn't exceed the 20 ms (milliseconds); in this range we can recognize two different phases: the first phase, dependent mainly on the local bonnet stiffness, with a length of time never greater than 4 ms and a second phase {{until the end of}} the phenomenon, dependent on boundary conditions and impacting bodywork parts, impacting engine parts and so on. In the first phase we can find the maximum acceleration's value, that heavily affects the final value of HPC [3]. In 1998, WG 17 has published a new testing protocol that was approved by EuroNCAP and European Community and fixed it as homologative criteria since 2010 [10. For the period until 2010 the automotive companies had unanimously accepted a testing protocol less restrictive than the EuroNCAP one: the ACEA Protocol [11, 14] that will became a homologative criteria since 2005; this fact involves new compatibility problem for new car designer, because since 2005 all the vehicle will be homologated For determining the entity of damage on pedestrians we refer to the measurement scale called Abbreviated Injury only if they will respect the biomechanical values' range imposed by new testing protocol. Our paper pays attention on Child Head impact phenomena (the high priority impact both for WG 17 and for ACEA protocol) and on the factors that affect the increase of HIC values. Other studies had demonstrated that in the middle area of the bonnet the acceleration peak, that heavily affects the value of HIC, strictly depends on "structural" parameters [3] of the bonnet; our paper is based on this studies and wants to reproduce, using numeric simulation, the Child impact dynamic (a very low-energy impact [...] only 150 Joule) in order to demonstrate the importance of kinetic phenomena despite of the deformation's one. We can justify the validity of this hypothesis by the comparison of impact simulation of ACEA and WG 17 test; these protocols are different for mass of impactor and speed of impact (for ACEA we have an impactor of 3. 5 Kg that hits the bonnet with a 35 Km/h speed while for WG 17 we have an impactor of 2. 5 Kg that hits with a 40 Km/h speed). Child Head impact simulation in accordance with WG 17 protocol was made and correlated on physical tests made on a FIAT Punto 60 by TNO (with an average correlation index of +/- 10 %) [5]. The test simulated, for the evaluation aim of our study, was made on a sub-system composed by the complete bonnet with its catch and hinges and was simulated in the explicit FEM code PamCrash...|$|R
