5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. <b>Holism</b> has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations {{without reference to the}} whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific <b>holism</b> differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical <b>holism</b> is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E

5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic <b>holism,</b> in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic <b>holism</b> is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic <b>holism</b> also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, ecology transitioned {{from a more}} {{descriptive}} form of natural history to a more analytical form of scientific natural history. Frederic Clements published the first American ecology book in 1905, presenting the idea of plant communities as a superorganism. This publication launched a debate between ecological <b>holism</b> and individualism that lasted until the 1970s. Clements' superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of seral development that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by Henry Gleason, who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates {{to the development of}} community associations.|$|E
5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared <b>holism</b> and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of <b>Holism,</b> but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|Although Fodor {{originally}} {{rejected the}} idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, he has in recent years devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic <b>holism.</b> Fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts of the mind. He argues that mental states are multiply realizable {{and that there is}} a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He has also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterizes as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{scale of}} {{ecological}} organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. Ecological relationships regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate {{all the way}} up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of <b>holism</b> applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Gladwell often {{speaks of}} the {{importance}} of <b>holism</b> to unconscious intelligence, meaning that it considers the situation as a whole. At the same time, he stresses that unconscious intelligence relies on finding simple underlying patterns. However, only when a situation is overwhelmingly determined by one or a few interacting factors is <b>holism</b> consistent with simple underlying signatures. In many situations, <b>holism</b> and simple underlying signatures pull in different directions.|$|E

25|$|One subject within {{philosophy}} of biology {{deals with the}} relationship between reductionism and <b>holism,</b> contending views with epistemological and methodological significance, but also with ethical and metaphysical connotations.|$|E
25|$|The central theses {{underlying}} the indeterminacy of translation and other extensions of Quine's work are ontological relativity {{and the related}} doctrine of confirmation <b>holism.</b> The premise of confirmation <b>holism</b> is that all theories (and the propositions derived from them) are under-determined by empirical data (data, sensory-data, evidence); although some theories are not justifiable, failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex, there are many equally justifiable alternatives. While the Greeks' assumption that (unobservable) Homeric gods exist is false, and our supposition of (unobservable) electromagnetic waves is true, both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations.|$|E
25|$|Three {{commonly}} mentioned philosophical {{precepts of}} occupational therapy are that occupation {{is necessary for}} health, that its theories are based on <b>holism</b> and that its central components are people, their occupations (activities), and the environments in which those activities take place. However, {{there have been some}} dissenting voices. Mocellin, in particular, advocated abandoning the notion of health through occupation as he proclaimed it obsolete in the modern world. As well, he questioned the appropriateness of advocating <b>holism</b> when practice rarely supports it. Some values formulated by the American Occupational Therapy Association have been critiqued as being therapist-centric and do not reflect the modern reality of multicultural practice.|$|E
25|$|If {{matter and}} energy are seen as {{necessary}} to explain the physical world, but incapable of explaining mind, dualism results. Emergence, <b>holism,</b> and process philosophy seek to ameliorate the perceived shortcomings of traditional (especially mechanistic) materialism without abandoning materialism entirely.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} in Cambridge, he found time to study a diverse number of {{subjects}} in addition to law; he wrote a book, Walt Whitman: A Study in the Evolution of Personality, although it was unpublished until 1973. The thoughts behind this book {{laid the foundation for}} Smuts' later wide-ranging philosophy of <b>holism.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Holism</b> {{assumes that}} health is {{affected}} by everything in an individual's environment; some sources also include a spiritual or existential dimension. In contrast, reductionism in chiropractic reduces causes and cures of health problems to a single factor, vertebral subluxation. Homeostasis emphasizes the body's inherent self-healing abilities. Chiropractic's early notion of innate intelligence {{can be thought of}} as a metaphor for homeostasis.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{understand}} the motivation behind systems engineering is {{to see it as}} a method, or practice, to identify and improve common rules that exist within a wide variety of systems. Keeping this in mind, the principles of systems engineering <b>holism,</b> emergent behavior, boundary, et al. can be applied to any system, complex or otherwise, provided systems thinking is employed at all levels. Besides defense and aerospace, many information and technology based companies, software development firms, and industries in the field of electronics & communications require systems engineers as part of their team.|$|E
25|$|Brăileanu {{eventually}} {{lost his}} Senate seat {{the establishment of}} a single-party regime, the National Renaissance Front (FRN), in February 1938. He withdrew from political life, while his Iconar disciples sought a rapprochement with the FRN chapter in Ținutul Suceava. He focused on a synthesis of his sociological theory, with Teoria Comunității Omenești ("The Theory of Human Community"), published in 1939 by Editura Cugetarea (second edition 1941). The work also signified his distancing from both <b>holism</b> and the mainline, positivist, sociological school of Bucharest, turning to phenomenological sociology and pragmatism, with more or less explicit borrowings from Edmund Husserl and William James.|$|E
25|$|It {{had very}} {{much in common with}} his {{philosophy}} of life as subsequently developed and embodied in his <b>Holism</b> and Evolution. Small units must needs develop into bigger wholes, and they in their turn again must grow into larger and ever-larger structures without cessation. Advancement lay along that path. Thus the unification of the four provinces in the Union of South Africa, the idea of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and, finally, the great whole resulting from the combination of the peoples of the earth in a great league of nations were but a logical progression consistent with his philosophical tenets.|$|E
25|$|The {{quest for}} <b>holism</b> leads most anthropologists {{to study a}} people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and {{linguistic}} data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs. In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification {{of what constitutes a}} culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.|$|E
25|$|Quine's ontological relativism (evident in {{the passage}} above) led him to agree with Pierre Duhem that for any {{collection}} of empirical evidence, {{there would always be}} many theories able to account for it. However, Duhem's <b>holism</b> is much more restricted and limited than Quine's. For Duhem, underdetermination applies only to physics or possibly to natural science, while for Quine it applies to all of human knowledge. Thus, while it is possible to verify or falsify whole theories, {{it is not possible to}} verify or falsify individual statements. Almost any particular statement can be saved, given sufficiently radical modifications of the containing theory. For Quine, scientific thought forms a coherent web in which any part could be altered in the light of empirical evidence, and in which no empirical evidence could force the revision of a given part.|$|E
500|$|Fodor {{has made}} many and varied criticisms of <b>holism.</b> He {{identifies}} the central problem {{with all the}} different notions of <b>holism</b> as {{the idea that the}} determining factor in semantic evaluation is the notion of an [...] "epistemic bond". Briefly, P is an epistemic bond of Q if the meaning of P is considered by someone to be relevant for the determination of the meaning of Q. Meaning <b>holism</b> strongly depends on this notion. The identity of the content of a mental state, under <b>holism,</b> can only be determined by the totality of its epistemic bonds. And this makes the realism of mental states an impossibility:If people differ in an absolutely general way in their estimations of epistemic relevance, and if we follow the <b>holism</b> of meaning and individuate intentional states by way of the totality of their epistemic bonds, the consequence will be that two people (or, for that matter, two temporal sections of the same person) will never be in the same intentional state. Therefore, two people can never be subsumed under the same intentional generalizations. And, therefore, intentional generalization can never be successful. And, therefore again, there is no hope for an intentional psychology.|$|E

500|$|<b>Holism</b> {{remains a}} {{critical}} part of the theoretical foundation in contemporary ecological studies. <b>Holism</b> addresses the biological organization of life that self-organizes into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to non-reducible properties. This means that higher order patterns of a whole functional system, such as an ecosystem, cannot be predicted or understood by a simple summation of the parts. [...] "New properties emerge because the components interact, not because the basic nature of the components is changed." ...|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, Fodor adhered to a causal notion of mental content and of meaning. This idea of content contrasts sharply with the inferential role semantics to which he subscribed earlier in his career. [...] Fodor criticizes inferential role semantics (IRS) because its commitment to an extreme form of <b>holism</b> excludes the possibility of a true naturalization of the mental. But naturalization must include an explanation of content in atomistic and causal terms.|$|E
500|$|Although New Age {{activists have}} been {{motivated}} by New Age concepts like <b>holism,</b> interconnectedness, monism, and environmentalism, their political ideas are diverse, ranging from far-right and conservative through to liberal, socialist, and libertarian. Accordingly, Kyle stated that [...] "New Age politics {{is difficult to}} describe and categorize. The standard political labels—left or right, liberal or conservative–miss the mark." [...] MacKian suggested that the New Age operated {{as a form of}} [...] "world-realigning infrapolitics" [...] that undermines the disenchantment of modern Western society.|$|E
500|$|The Clementsian {{superorganism}} {{theory was}} an overextended application of an idealistic form of <b>holism.</b> The term [...] "holism" [...] was coined in 1926 by Jan Christiaan Smuts, a South African general and polarizing historical figure who {{was inspired by}} Clements' superorganism concept. Around the same time, Charles Elton pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book Animal Ecology. Elton defined ecological relations using concepts of food chains, food cycles, and food size, and described numerical relations among different functional groups and their relative abundance. Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text. Alfred J. Lotka brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology.|$|E
500|$|The {{justification}} for the first premise is the most controversial. Both Putnam and Quine invoke naturalism to justify the exclusion of all non-scientific entities, and hence to defend the [...] "only" [...] part of [...] "all and only". The assertion that [...] "all" [...] entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by confirmation <b>holism.</b> Since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, there is no {{justification for}} excluding any of the entities referred to in well-confirmed theories. This puts the nominalist who wishes to exclude the existence of sets and non-Euclidean geometry, but to include the existence of quarks and other undetectable entities of physics, for example, in a difficult position.|$|E
500|$|Such a [...] "meaning-vector" [...] {{provides}} {{a description of}} the reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community. It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to that expression or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning. According to Putnam, it is legitimate to speak of a change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term, and not its stereotype, has changed. However, since there is no possible algorithm that can determine which aspect—the stereotype or the reference—has changed in a particular case, it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language. Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions which must be considered, Putnam embraced a form of semantic <b>holism.</b>|$|E
500|$|Most New Age groups {{believe in}} an Ultimate Source {{from which all}} things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine. Various {{creation}} myths have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and everything in it. In contrast, some New Agers emphasise {{the idea of a}} universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source. The New Age worldview emphasises <b>holism</b> and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole, in doing so rejecting both the dualism of Judeo-Christian thought and the reductionism of Cartesian science. A number of New Agers have linked this holistic interpretation of the universe to the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock. The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as [...] "droplet of divinity", [...] "inner Godhead", and [...] "divine self". Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding 'subtle bodies', a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a [...] "Higher Self" [...] which {{is a part of the}} human but which connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through intuition.|$|E
2500|$|While in academia, Smuts {{pioneered the}} concept of <b>holism,</b> which he defined as [...] " [...] {{fundamental}} factor operative towards the creation of wholes in the universe" [...] in his 1926 book, <b>Holism</b> and Evolution. Smuts' formulation of <b>holism</b> has been linked with his political-military activity, especially his aspiration to create a league of nations. As one biographer said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Appeals to <b>holism</b> {{as opposed}} to reductionism: proponents of pseudoscientific claims, {{especially}} in organic medicine, alternative medicine, naturopathy and mental health, often resort to the [...] "mantra of holism" [...] to dismiss negative findings.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{philosophers}} {{of biology}} {{have attempted to}} explain {{the rise and fall}} of reductionism, vitalism, and <b>holism</b> throughout the history of biology. For example, these philosophers claim that the ideas of Charles Darwin ended the last remainders of teleology in biology, though the matter continues to be debated. [...] Debates in these areas of philosophy of biology turn on how one views reductionism.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Holism</b> is {{the view}} that {{emphasizes}} higher-level processes, also called emergent properties: phenomena at a larger level that occur due to the pattern of interactions between {{the elements of a}} system over time. [...] For example, to explain why one species of finch survives a drought while others die out, the holistic method looks at the entire ecosystem. Reducing an ecosystem to its parts in this case would be less effective at explaining overall behavior (in this case, the decrease in biodiversity). As individual organisms must be understood {{in the context of their}} ecosystems, holists argue, so must lower-level biological processes be understood in the broader context of the living organism in which they take part. Proponents of this view cite our growing understanding of the multidirectional and multilayered nature of gene modulation (including epigenetic changes) as an area where a reductionist view is inadequate for full explanatory power.
