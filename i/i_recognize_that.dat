25|$|As for... {{the great}} {{question}} {{of the power of}} sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that {{it would be good for}} princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of the fourth season, Beaver joined the limited series Harper's Island. Although he initially feared that it would prevent future appearances of Bobby, {{he was able to}} maintain his Supernatural [...] "quota" [...] with seven episodes. The character's role increased for the fifth season, which made sense for the actor due to the apocalyptic storyline. The season also introduced a new story arc for Bobby: his use of a wheelchair. Series creator Eric Kripke explained that it [...] " [...] the Apocalypse matter"; the writers wanted [...] "real stakes and real loss and real obstacles thrown in our heroes' way" [...] to differentiate it from prior seasons. Though he found it to be a challenge, Beaver enjoyed the experience because he could perform tricks on set that his wheelchair-using college roommate had taught him. However, the actor did [...] " [...] very seriously", and commented, [...] "I can get out of the chair {{at the end of the}} day and go home and <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that,</b> so many people can't and I have to be considerate to them and respect that." ...|$|E

Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, <b>I</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television.

2500|$|Family Feud {{returned}} in syndication on September 20, 1999, with comedian Louie Anderson as host. After Richard Karn {{took over the}} show, the format was changed to reintroduce returning champions, allowing them to appear {{for up to five}} days. However, even after Karn's takeover, Anderson-hosted episodes continued in reruns that aired on PAX Network. In John O'Hurley's later days, the show's Nielsen ratings were at 1.5 (putting it in danger of cancellation), but when comedian Steve Harvey took over, ratings increased by as much as 40%, and within two short years, the show was rated at 4.0, and had become the fifth most popular syndicated program. Fox News' Paulette Cohn argued that [...] Harvey's [...] "relatability," [...] or [...] "understanding of what the people at home want to know," [...] is what saved the show from cancellation; Harvey himself argued, [...] "If someone said an answer that was so ridiculous, I knew that the people at home behind the camera had to be going, 'What did they just say?' â€¦ They gave this answer that doesn't have a shot in hell of being up there.
