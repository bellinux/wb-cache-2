Cell replacement strategies are now intensely studied as a possible therapeutic intervention of glial associated neurodegenerative disorders and glial tumors. Similar to any novel strategy, however, set-backs and liabilities accompany the promises this technique withholds. For cell replacement to function efficiently and demonstrate robust results, introduced cells must be 1) generated in sufficient yield and 2) <b>immunocompatible</b> with the host and 3) able to sustain self-growth. New perspectives within stem cell biology and gliogenesis regulation have provided new insights within the past decade to begin addressing these challenges.

50|$|Because {{of their}} {{plasticity}} and potentially unlimited capacity for self-renewal, {{embryonic stem cell}} therapies have been proposed for regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease.

Besides the ethical concerns of stem cell therapy (see stem cell controversy), there is a technical problem of graft-versus-host disease associated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Attempts were therefore made to direct differentiation of myelinating Schwann cell-like cells from marrow stromal cells (MSC). Rat femur MSCs were harvested by selective adherence to tissue culture plastic. The isolated cells were characterized by induction along osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages as well as staining for STRO- 1 immunopositivity. Sphere-forming MSCs were then stimulated with Forskolin, bFGF, PDGF and Heregulin to acquire the Schwann-cell-like phenotype. The phenotype was however transient and cells acquired fibroblastic phenotype in extended cultures. In cocultures with dorsal root ganglion neurons, the Schwann-cell like cells stably expressed the markers, S 100 β and p 75, without exogenous growth factors; they aligned with axonal bundles that radiated from the neurons and indicated immunopositivity for myelin basic protein.

In attempts to enhance these features, or collagen type I was incorporated into the gels, with no significant improvements in prolonged human cell adherence. However, alginate gels containing both collagen type I and beta-tricalcium phosphate were found to enhance human cell adherence and proliferation. Furthermore, interactions between the collagen and beta-tricalcium phosphate prevented loss of the protein from the hydrogels. These results indicate that alginate gels containing collagen have potential uses as vehicles for delivery of adherent cells to a tissue site.

Currently, Schwann cell-like cells derived from the bone marrow lack fate commitment and revert to a fibroblast-like phenotype upon withdrawal of differentiation-inducing factors. In recapitulation of embryonic events leading to Schwann cell maturation, we hypothesize that the Schwann cell-like cells acquire the switch to fate commitment through contact-dependant cues from incipient neurons of the developing dorsal root ganglia. To address this, Schwann cell-like cells derived from adult rat bone marrow were cocultured with neurons purified from embryonic dorsal root ganglia. A cell-intrinsic switch to the Schwann cell fate was achieved consistently and the cell progeny maintained expression of the markers S 100 β, p 75 NTR, GFAP, P 0 and Sox 10 even without exogenous differentiation-inducing factors or neurons. In vitro formation of MBP-positive segments under myelinating conditions by the cell progeny was comparable to that by sciatic nerve-derived Schwann cells. Controls in which Schwann cell-like cells were barred from direct contact with neurons in coculture reverted to SMA/CD 90 -expressing myofibroblasts.

40|$|Poster Presentation: P 24 BACKGROUND. Schwann cell {{transplantation}} improves post-traumatic nerve regeneration in both {{peripheral nervous system}} (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) but sufficient numbers of <b>immunocompatible</b> cells are required for clinical application. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are a readily accessible cell source that can be expanded and differentiated to specialized cells for regenerative medicine. OBJECTIVES. We attempted to establish a protocol to induce the stable differentiation of human BMSC along a Schwann cell lineage. METHODS. Neurosphere medium was used to induce human BMSCs into neurospheres. Then, these neurospheres were induced to differentiate along the Schwann cell lineage using glia growth factors, and {{this was followed by}} co-culture with dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. RESULTS. A lot of spheres of floating cells appeared after human BMSCs were cultured in neurosphere differentiation medium. These BMSCs-induced neuropheres showed nestin- and GFAP-immunoreactive staining. After induction with Schwann cell differentiation medium, a number of bi-polar and spindle-like cells positive for p 75 and S 100 grew from the neurospheres. However, these Schwann cell-like cells lost their Schwann cell phenotype after the induction medium was changed. Following co-culture with the DRG neurons, all derivatives of the Schwann cell-like cells not only acquired the Schwann cell phenotype, but remained stably committed even in subcultures in which both extrinsic factors and neurons were withdrawn. CONCLUSION. Our success with stable derivation of Schwann cells from human BMSCs offer a viable source of Schwann cells for autologous cell therapy in clinical applications. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Young Investigator Colloquium 1 Schwann cell {{transplantation}} improves post-traumatic nerve regeneration in both {{peripheral nervous system}} and central nervous system but sufficient numbers of <b>immunocompatible</b> cells are required for clinical application. Protocols utilizing multiple trophic and glial growth factors have been established to induce glial-like differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). However, the reported transition of BMSCs to Schwann cell-like cells was reversible, suggesting against a complete differentiation process. In recapitulation of embryonic events leading to Schwann cell determination, commitment of Schwann cell-like cells into mature Schwann cells can be achieved when they receive necessary signals from neurons of developing dorsal root ganglia. In this study, we mimic the course of Schwann cell development and established a new protocol to fulfill a cell-intrinsic switch of human BMSCs to a Schwann cell fate. As shown by our results, derivatives of human BMSCs underwent the commitment to mature Schwann cells even when all exogenous differentiation-inducing cues are not presented in cultures. First, the derived cells acquired a Schwann cell phenotype indicated by bipolar morphology and expression of Schwann cell markers. Second, these cells maintained myelination capacities, shown by forming basic myelin protein-positive segments along axons of sensory neurons. Third, the gene expression profiles of the derived cells and human Schwann cell line are similar, demonstrated by a high correlation of the two populations. Our success with stable derivation of Schwann cells from human BMSCs offer a viable source of Schwann cells for autologous cell therapy in clinical applications. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. Stem {{cells are}} {{regarded}} as undifferentiated cells {{that are capable of}} selfrenewal, proliferation, production of a great number of differentiated progeny, and regeneration of tissues (Blau et al., 2001). The therapeutic potential of multilineage stem cells for tissue engineering (TE) applications is vast. Two general types of stem cells are potentially useful for this application: embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and adult (autologous) stem cells (Zuk et al., 2001). Traditionally, ESCs are isolated from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts, however harvesting of these cells results in the death of the embryo, which has led to ethical, religious and political issues (Moore, 2007). In contrast, adult stem cells, by virtue of their nature, are <b>immunocompatible</b> and have no ethical issues associated with their use (Zuk et al., 2001). Subcutaneous adipose tissue is an active and highly complex tissue composed of several different cell types, and is derived from the mesodermal germ layer and contains a supportive stromal vascular fraction (SVF) that can be easily isolated. This SVF contains a heterogeneous mixture of cells including preadipocytes (Raposio et al., 2007; Schäffler and Büchler, 2007; Jurgens et al., 2008). The preadipoctyes are considered as the multipotent stem cells termed adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) that have similar properties to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) (Fraser et al., 2006). ADSCs are idyllic for cellular therapy applications due to various factors: they can be harvested, multiplied and handled easily, efficiently and noninvasively, they have a pluripotential and proliferative capacity comparable to BM-MSCs, and morbidity to donors is considerably less, requiring only local anaesthesia and a short wound healing time. Human ADSCs (hADSCs) can be expanded in an undifferentiated state and have multipotential differentiation capacity along the classical mesenchymal lineages of adipogenesis, osteogenesis, chondrogenesis and myogenesis (de Villiers et al., 2009) ...|$|E
40|$|Obtaining oligodendroglial {{cells from}} {{dispensable}} tissues {{would be of}} great interest for autologous or <b>immunocompatible</b> cell replacement in demyelinating diseases {{as well as for}} studying myelin pathologies. Recently, two laboratories have simultaneously reported that mouse fibroblasts could be converted into oligodendroglial cells by direct reprogramming with transcription factors involved in oligodendrocyte development (Najm et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 31 : 426, 2013, Yang et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 31 : 434, 2013). We have lentivirally transfected combinations of tetracycline-inducible sox 10 (S), olig 2 (O), zfp 536 (Z) and/or nkx 6. 1 (N) transgenes in adult rat adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) and checked for the generation of functional oligodendrocytes. Immunostaining with the O 4 monoclonal, which binds to oligodendrocyte progenitor cell membranes, was used as initial marker of oligodendroglial reprogramming. The first signs of ADSC conversion into oligodendrocytic cells were observed with the S-O-Z combination by 6 weeks and the O 4 + cell population kept rising the following months, eventually constituting more than 50 % of cells. Increasing numbers of O 1 (galactocerebroside), p 75 (low-affinity NGF receptor), and GFAP-positive cells appeared in that period. Cells expressed also myelin-associated proteins like MBP, MAG, MOG and PLP 1 /DM 20. Transduction with the S-O-N-Z transgene combination also produced oligodendrocyte progenitors but did not improve the result; S-O-N, O-Z or O transductions did not consistently produce oligodendrocytes in our hands. After 3 months of continuous expansion, the reprogrammed cells became independent of transgene activation by doxycycline. Antibiotic selection of transduced cells (with zeocin) did not show to be more efficient for reprogrammed cell purity and proliferation than unselected cultures. Different pre-induction treatments were tried in an attempt to improve the efficiency or speed of reprogramming: of these, treatment with Repsox followed by retinoic acid or adipocytic pre-differentiation, appeared to increase reprogramming consistency or to slightly accelerate the process. When seeded onto rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, transdifferentiated cells were observed to cover lengths of one or several axons with typical myelin-like appearance. We propose that functional oligodendrocytes can be efficiently generated from adult mesenchymal cells in the rat by direct cell reprogramming...|$|E
40|$|Research for new {{biocompatible}} {{and easily}} implantable materials continuously proposes new molecules and new substances with biological, chemical and physical characteristics, {{that are more}} and more adapted to aesthetic and reconstructive surgery and to the development of biomedical devices such as cardiovascular prostheses. Two classes of polymeric biomaterials seem to meet better these requirements: “hydrogels”, which includes polyalkylimide (PAI) and polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and “elastomers”, which includes polyurethanes (PUs). The first ones in the last decade have had a great application for soft tissue augmentation, due to their similarity to this tissue for their high water content, elasticity and oxygen permeability (Dini et al., 2005). The second ones, on the contrary, are widely used in cardiovascular applications (catheters, vascular grafts, ventricular assist devices, total artificial hearts) due to their good mechanical properties and hemocompatibility (Zdrahala R. J. and Zdrahala I. J., 1999). In the biocompatibility evaluation of these synthetic polymers, that is important for its potential use in clinical applications, a fundamental aspect is the knowledge of the polymers cytotoxicity and the effect of their interaction with cells, in particular with the cell populations involved in the inflammatory responses, i. e. monocyte/macrophages. In consideration of what above said, the aim of this study is the comprehension of the in vitro effect of PAI, PVA and PU on three cell lines that represent three different stages of macrophagic differentiation: U 937 pro-monocytes, THP- 1 monocytes and RAW 264. 7 macrophages. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by measuring the rate of viability with MTT, Neutral Red and morphological analysis at light microscope in time-course dependent experiments. The influence of these polymers on monocyte/macrophage activation in terms of cells adhesion, monocyte differentiation in macrophages, antigens distribution, aspecific phagocytosis, fluid-phase endocitosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6) and nitric oxide (NO) release was evaluated. In conclusion, our studies have indicated that the three different polymeric biomaterials are highly biocompatible, since they scarcely affected viability of U 937, THP- 1 and RAW 264. 7 cells. Moreover, we have found that even though hydrogels and polyurethane influences monocyte/macrophage differentiation (depending on the particular type of cell and polymer), they are <b>immunocompatible</b> since they not induced significantly high cytokine release. For these reasons their clinical applications are strongly encouraged...|$|E
40|$|AS THE {{possibility}} of therapeutic cloning in humans {{has just been}} demonstrated by a Corean group of researchers, the paper argues that biotechnologies of that kind may contribute to alleviate the chronic shortage of organs and tissues for transplantation. Ever since immunosuppressant drugs have become available, transplantation surgery has made considerable progress, and the procurement of transplants, especially from living donors, has been problematic. The investigation of the properties of (adult or embryonic) stem cells opened great hopes. Conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, myocardial infarct, or neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's diseases), could be treated by cellular therapy, namely, transplantation of human cells issued from cell lines derived from human stem cells possibly stored in cell banks. Adult stem cells, however, are rare and difficult to identify (apart from bone marrow, which contains the precursors of blood cells, a resource already widely used). There exists a large supply of human embryonic stem cells in countries where the freezing of embryos {{for the purposes of}} medically assisted procreation leaves 'spare' or 'surplus' embryos which may be either destroyed or donated for research after couples have fulfilled their procreative aim. It is often considered that harvesting stem cells from those embryos, for use in research or therapeutics, is morally more acceptable than destroying them. But the constitution of stem cell banks is open to two objections. First, in order to offer HLA compatible grafts to a large population, the bank should offer a selection of cell supplies representative of all HLA types in the population, a virtually impossible task. Second, with HLA compatible grafts there remains a risk of immunorejection, and a necessity for the patients treated to take immunosuppressant drugs {{for the rest of their}} lives. Should biological research establish their feasibility and safety, cloning techniques might then appear to be the best choice. Treating (for example) diabetic patients with cells constructed by transferring the nucleus of a somatic cell of the patient into an enucleated oocyte would have the double advantage that the graft would be <b>immunocompatible</b> with the receiver, and that cell banks would not be required; instrumentalizing women for the collection of oocytes has been found objectionable, but a Chinese group of researchers suggested the {{possibility of}} using animal oocytes. It remains that such practices have raised lots of ethical controversies. It is at this moment difficult to assess their impact on our vision of 'humanity'...|$|E
40|$|As natural {{constituents}} of the extracellular matrix, sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are {{of great interest}} {{in the design of}} novel biomaterials for cell immobilization and tissue engineering. A substantial challenge in the characterization and application of sulfated GAGs lies in their structural heterogeneity, motivating the exploration of alternative functional analogs. Alginate shows promise for cell immobilization due to its gentle gelling conditions and good biocompatibility, but is limited by its inertness thus requiring functionalization to promote desired cell interactions. Throughout the work presented in this thesis alginates were chemically sulfated to create structural analogs to sulfated GAGs, exhibiting gel-forming capability and a customizable monosaccharide sequence and sulfation degree. Homogeneous sequences of alginate (poly-M, poly-G and poly-MG) were sulfated and shown to interact with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2), where the interaction strength was influenced by both sulfation degree and alginate monosaccharide sequence. Conformational flexibility has been proposed to influence the protein-binding properties of heparin, and growth factor interaction with sulfated alginates was found to increase with chain flexibility introduced by periodate oxidation. Furthermore, the influence of chain length was studied using sulfated alginate oligosaccharides, revealing similarities to heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) interactions. Sulfated alginate was found to have a stimulating effect on the proliferation, spreading and deposition of extracellular matrix by encapsulated chondrocytes. The effect was shown to be mediated by increased FGF- 2 signaling where the sulfated alginate scaffold interacts with the growth factor and the FGF cell receptor, analogous to heparan sulfate in native tissues. Sulfation has a derogatory effect on the gelling properties of alginate, resulting in decreased elastic modulus and increased osmotic swelling due to weakened ionic crosslinks. Mixtures containing non-sulfated alginate were found to generate more stable gels, allowing tuning of mechanical properties and inclusion of highly sulfated alginates to optimize biological activity. Encapsulation of chondrocytes in sulfated alginate gels resulted in reduced expression of inflammatory markers following stimulation with interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), while soluble sulfated alginates have been found to reduce complement activation in human plasma. The anti-inflammatory effects of sulfated alginates were further explored by incubation of alginate microspheres in human whole blood. Poly-L-lysine (PLL) coated alginate microcapsules were coated with an additional layer of sulfated poly-MG (SMG) alginate and were found to reduce the cytokine response whereas complement activation was increased. Non-coated microbeads of SMG mixed with unmodified alginate were found to be highly <b>immunocompatible,</b> reducing induction of complement and cytokines compared to pure alginate beads. Both alginate and to a greater extent sulfated alginate were found to bind factor H, potentially contributing to their anti-inflammatory nature...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to create pre-formed neural {{spheroid}} networks (NSN) on a polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) concave microwell array for eventual implantation into the rat brain. Recent studies have shown that stem cells have great potential in treating various neurological insults of the central nervous system, ranging from traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, to neurodegenerative disorders. However, the use of stem cell lines in research are controversial due to the method of obtaining cells, in their formation of teratomas and degeneration into cancer cells, their non-specific differentiation, and lastly in their inability to control the location of neural connections. A novel approach to address this issue utilizes pre-formed neural networks consisting of neural spheroids on polymer scaffolds for the implantation into the rat brain. Yet, it was observed that the cylindrical shape of the wells hindered the transfer process. This study aimed to overcome the lack of neural spheroid network detachment by utilizing concave well structures, using a simple method developed in this laboratory. Primary neurons were isolated from pregnant Sprague Dawley rats at 16 ~ 17 days of gestation. Isolated neurons were cultured in PDMS wells with a concave structure and interconnected by rounded micro channels. It was reported previously that a concave structure enabled an easier and more efficient formation of spheroids, not to mention the ease in extraction of spheroid cells. Various studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of guidance channels in promoting neurite growth. Therefore, micro channels were integrated in the micro array design, and served as a guidance conduit to enhance neurite growth, and by association, spheroid interconnection. The primary neurons formed a spheroid structure after 3 days, upon which they began to sprout new neurites. By day 8, neurite connections peaked. Spheroid diameter underwent an initial decrease then stabilized on day 2. Various well diameters (300 ~ 700 um) and channel lengths (1. 5 x diameter ~ 3 x diameter) were evaluated, with a 300 um well diameter and 450 um center-to-center channel length found to be optimal. The completed network was assessed for interconnection using calcium imaging and showed coordinated calcium signals between the neural spheroids. The network was then successfully transferred to a collagen matrigel and cultured for a week. The methodology showed an improvement in the transfer of networks, with about a 90 % extraction rate. The viability of the NSN on the matrigel was assessed using a Live/Dead assay, and cells were found to have greater than 95 % viability. The optimal hydrophilicity was determined for neurite extension and transfer of NSNs onto the matrigel. It was found that an incubation time between 4 ~ 6 hours was optimal. Future studies will involve the implantation of the NSN into the rat brain. Additionally, the use of neural progenitor and stem cell lines may provide an autologous source of cells which are <b>immunocompatible</b> with the host. In particular, marrow stromal cells are interesting in that they may also address the ethical concerns. A long term goal is to refine the methodology and apply this research to enable studies in the treatment of patients suffering from spinal cord injury and other neurodegenerative disorders...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was the {{construction}} and characterization of a novel, fully human immunoRNase (IR). IRs, chimeric proteins made up of a ribonuclease (RNase) molecule fused to an antibody moiety, represent a valid alternative to immunotoxins (ITs). ITs directed to cell surface molecular targets have shown to have a therapeutic potential. However, they also have limitations, mainly represented by nonspecific toxicity and by the immunogenicity of their bacterial or plant toxins. To circumvent some of these problems, toxins have been replaced by mammalian RNases, molecules per se not cytotoxic, which become toxic when internalized by target cells. In particular, the use of human RNases, physiologically present in extracellular fluids and tissues, has allowed the construction of immunoconjugates potentially less immunogenic. Obviously, the preparation of fully human IRs is highly desiderable to obtain effective and tumorselective, but also <b>immunocompatible</b> immunoagents. A novel, fully human IR was prepared in the present study. It is made up of human pancreas RNase (HP-RNase), fused to a human single chain variable fragment (scFv) directed to the ErbB 2 receptor. This scFv, named Erbicin, has been isolated in our laboratory from a large human scFv phagemid library. ErbB 2, a tyrosine kinase receptor, represents one of the most specific tumor associated antigens (TAA), since this receptor is overexpressed in clinically significant tumors, such as breast, ovary and lung carcinomas. On the other hand, in normal tissues it is expressed only in certain epithelial cell types. The novel, fully human anti-ErbB 2 IR, named hERB-hRNase, was successfully expressed in bacterial cells and isolated from the periplasmic fraction. The characterization of its biological properties showed that the human IR retains the enzymatic activity of the wild-type ribonuclease (HP-RNase) and specifically binds to ErbB 2 -positive cells with high affinity, as the parental scFv. Furthermore, our studies showed that the human IR undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis in target cells. In fact, the IR behaves as an immunoprotoxin and upon internalization by target cells becomes selectively cytotoxic in a dose-dependent manner at nanomolar concentrations. Administered in five doses of 1. 5 mg/kg to mice bearing an ErbB 2 -positive tumor, hERB-hRNase induced a dramatic reduction of tumor volume. The immunoconjugate hERB-hRNase is the first fully human antitumor IR produced so far, with a high potential as a poorly immunogenic human drug devoid of nonspecific toxicity, directed against ErbB 2 -positive malignancies. The ABC (ATP binding cassette) family of membrane transport proteins includes the best known mediators of resistance to anticancer drugs, such as the ABC transporters ABCB 1 (MDR 1 /P-gp), ABCC 1 /MRP 1, and ABCG 2 /MXR. However, although ABC transporters overexpression appears to be a major cause of failure in the treatment of cancer, acquired resistance to multiple anticancer drugs may also be multifactorial, involving alteration of detoxification processes, apoptosis, DNA repair and drug uptake. The human prostate cancer cell line RC 0. 1 has been derived from the parental sensitive cell line DU 145 by continuous exposure to the drug rubitecan (9 -nitro-camptothecin), an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, now in phase III clinical trials. Several factors have been proposed to explain the phenotype of camptothecin resistance in RC 0. 1 cell line. Microarray analyses, performed using a novel ABC-ToxChip, indicated the overexpression of the ABC transporter MRP 2 in the resistant cell line RC 0. 1. In order to establish the role of MRP 2 in camptothecin resistance, different strategies were {{used in the present study}} to inhibit this ABC transporter. The inhibition of MRP 2 expression was obtained by RNA interference technology, whereas the inhibition of its biological activity was achieved using the inhibitor MK 571. In both cases, the resistance phenotype of RC 0. 1 tumor cells was not reverted. This indicated that MRP 2 does not play a crucial role in the resistance mechanism. To explain MRP 2 overexpression, we hypothesized that this represents an early adaptation of the cells to the drug, providing the background for the evolution of different resistance mechanisms. The expression profile of the 48 ABC transporters has been characterized in a panel of 60 diverse cancer cell lines (the NCI- 60), used by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to screen for anticancer activity. By correlating the expression results with the growth inhibitory profiles of 1, 429 candidate anticancer drugs tested against the cells, transporters able to confer resistance to anticancer drugs have been identified. In particular, 28 compounds were predicted to be less active in cells that expressed large amounts of MRP 2. Such a prediction has been confirmed in the present study. Furthermore, the analysis of the chemical structures of the 28 identified MRP 2 substrates led to the identification of common structural features, such as a cyclopentanone ring, an element structurally related to the cyclopentenone ring of prostaglandins. This observation led us to hypothesize a new role for MRP 2 transporter, such as its involvement in the transport of cyclopentenone prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are involved in a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes, but the mechanism of prostaglandin release from cells is not completely understood. Here we demonstrate an effective involvement of MRP 2 in the transport of the cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15 -deoxy-Δ 12, 14 -prostaglandin J 2 (15 -d-PGJ 2) ...|$|E
