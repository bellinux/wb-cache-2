5|$|Although {{it offers}} the {{greatest}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration, tracheal intubation {{is not the only}} means to maintain a patent airway. Alternative techniques for airway management and delivery of oxygen, volatile anesthetics or other breathing gases include the laryngeal mask airway, i-gel, cuffed oropharyngeal airway, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP mask), nasal BiPAP mask, simple face mask, and nasal cannula.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is generally}} considered the best method for airway management under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, as it provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration. However, tracheal intubation requires a great deal of clinical experience to master and serious complications may result even when properly performed.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with MÃ¼llerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E

5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Camillan system of {{organisation}} of the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, men were sorted into classes based on wealth, the principes being the wealthiest after the triarii. Principes were armed with short spears, or hastae, up to 1.8metres (6ft) long. They fought in a quincunx formation, usually carrying scuta, large rectangular shields, and bronze helmets, {{often with a}} number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature. They wore heavier armour types, the most common form being chainmail, which offered a good <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> without hindering movement.|$|E
5|$|Law enforcement's corrupt {{attitude}} generally {{was not at}} {{the expense}} of the people. Apart from the economic benefits provided by the Maceos, these bosses provided a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> to the island's citizens. When serious crimes were committed the local police would sometimes contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with. However, the island was not completely peaceful; threats at the point of a gun were a common means for the Maceo gang to ensure control. Though the average citizen was relatively safe, gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered. General anesthetic agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish the respiratory drive. Although {{it is not the}} only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, intubation of the trachea provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the choughs {{include the}} {{peregrine}} falcon, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain, red-billed choughs preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colonies; the falcon, which eats only insects, provides a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> against larger predators, and the chough benefits {{in terms of}} a higher breeding success. The red-billed chough is occasionally parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo, a brood parasite for which the Eurasian magpie is the primary host.|$|E
5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. The ants provide some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into taking {{them back to the}} ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.|$|E
40|$|We analyze how {{different}} <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> privacy <b>protection</b> affect industry profits, consumer welfare and total welfare. Firms earn higher profits under complete privacy protection compared with limited or no privacy protection. However, with limited privacy protection, {{the relationship between}} the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> privacy <b>protection</b> and equilibrium profits is not monotonic. Consumers benefit from a gradual increase in privacy pro-tection as long as this protection is not complete. However, complete privacy protection generates the lowest consumer surplus among the regimes we study. Finally, total welfare monotonically increases with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> privacy <b>protection...</b>|$|R

5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always {{ensures that the}} external sheath on the plug makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle before {{any of the four}} connectors within make electrical contact. The external metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for electrically safe hot-swapping.|$|E
5|$|Often {{people try}} to avoid or outrun a tornado in a vehicle. Although cars can travel faster than the average tornado, the {{directive}} from the National Weather Service is for house-dwellers {{in the path of}} a tornado to take shelter at home rather than risk an escape by vehicle. This is a result of several factors and statistics. An interior room inside a well-built frame house (especially one with a basement) provides a reasonable <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> from all but the most violent tornadoes. Underground or above-ground tornado shelters, as well as extremely strong structures such as bank vaults, offer almost complete protection. Cars, on the other hand, can be heavily damaged by even weak tornadoes, and in violent tornadoes they can be thrown large distances, even into buildings. High-profile vehicles such as buses and tractor trailers are even more vulnerable to high winds.|$|E
5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfieldsâthese would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> was less and there was more emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fortâa light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E

5|$|Teachers {{continued}} to be trained at the college (officially called the Chichester Diocesan Training College for Schoolmistresses) until 1939. As World War II approached, the institution closed and the building was auctioned; but {{before it could be}} sold, the Royal Engineers requisitioned it for their use during wartime. They used it as a base for their operations, then after the war it became their archives and records office. In 1987, they moved out, and the vacant building was threatened with demolition. A local campaign helped it receive listed status, offering a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> and the building's future was secured when it was bought and converted into a complex of serviced offices. It opened in November 1988 as the Brighton Business Centre, and was later renamed the Brighton Forum.|$|E
5|$|The design {{challenges}} the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) {{faced with this}} class were considerable, as the combined requirements of optimum hitting power, extreme speed and adequate protection taxed the knowledge of its naval architects and technology of the time. The desired speed of 35knots, for example, had been previously attained only in destroyers and smaller craft. To do so with a capital ship required a hull and a power plant of unprecedented size for a U.S. naval vessel, in addition to careful planning by its designers to ensure it would have enough longitudinal strength to withstand both bending forces while underway and any stress that might occur in combat. It took years between initial and final designs for engine and boiler technology to provide a plant of sufficient power that was also compact enough to allow a practical <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> even in such large ships.|$|E
