5|$|With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero {{begin to}} ascend the throne, but the {{ceremony}} {{is interrupted by}} the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. <b>He</b> <b>announces</b> that his master is alive ("Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!"), saved from death by Otho, {{the commander of the}} army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius's attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne.|$|E

Meanwhile, Katherine's other son, Brock Reynolds (Beau Kazer) advises Tucker {{to get to know}} their mother, but Katherine refuses to accept him, and Tucker is hurt. He hires Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) and plans to sell off Chancellor Industries piece by piece, including Jabot Cosmetics. Adam’s father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) wins Jabot in a bidding war; Tucker refuses to hire Jill at Chancellor Industries. Katherine threatens to reveal Tucker's bribing of Alexander Thomas until she begins feeling guilty and backs off; an impressed Tucker puts a hold on the selling of her company.

25|$|At Nikolskoe, {{they also}} meet Katya, Anna Sergevna's sister. Although they remain {{for only a}} short period, both {{characters}} undergo significant change: their relationship with each other is especially affected, as Arkady has begun to find himself and drift from the position of Bazarov's follower. Bazarov in particular finds falling in love distressing because it runs against his nihilist beliefs. Eventually, prompted by Odintsova's own cautious expressions of attraction to him, <b>he</b> <b>announces</b> that he loves her. She does not respond overtly to his declaration, though she too is deeply drawn to Bazarov while finding his dismissal of feelings and the aesthetic side of existence troublesome. While Anna does have some feelings toward Bazarov, they are not akin toward love and Anna cannot open herself to him because she does not see {{the possibility of a}} good future with him. After his avowal of love, and her failure to make a similar declaration, Bazarov proceeds to his parents' home, and Arkady decides to accompany him.|$|E

As the masquerade attendees scatter in fear, Raoul accosts Madame Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the Phantom. Giry reluctantly explains that the Phantom is actually a brilliant scholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer who was born with a terrifyingly deformed face. Feared and reviled by society, he was cruelly exhibited in a cage as part of a travelling fair until he eventually escaped and disappeared. He has since taken refuge beneath the opera house, which has now become his home.|$|E
25|$|In India, the {{practice}} of a hunger protest, where the protestor fasts {{at the door of}} an offending party (typically a debtor) in a public call for justice, was abolished by the government in 1861; this indicates the prevalence of {{the practice}} prior to that date, or at least a public awareness of it. This Indian practice is ancient, going back to around 400 to 750 BC. This can be known since it appears in the Ramayana, which was composed around that time. The actual mention appears in the Ayodhya kanda (the second book of the Ramayana), in Sarga (section) 103. Bharata has gone to ask the exiled Rama to come back and rule the kingdom. Bharata tries many arguments, none of which work, at which point he decides to do a hunger strike. <b>He</b> <b>announces</b> his intention to fast, calls for his charioteer Sumantra to bring him some sacred Kusha grass (which Sumantra won't do, since he's too busy looking at Rama's face, so Bharata has to get the grass himself), and lies down upon the grass in front of Rama. Rama, however, is quickly able to persuade him to abandon the attempt. Rama mentions it as a practice of the brahmanas.|$|E

During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy.

She had a long-term affair with Roger Sterling until his two heart attacks (Season 1) cause him to end the relationship. In Season 2, she becomes engaged to Dr. Greg Harris (Samuel Page). By Season 3, they are married and at Greg's request Joan quits her job at Sterling Cooper. Their marriage is tested when Greg's lack of skill as a surgeon and consequent difficulties securing work force Joan to return to work at a department store, prompting her to call Roger Sterling to ask for his help in finding an office job. Because of her invaluable organizational and managerial skills, she is later hired for the new agency formed by Don, Roger, Bert, and Lane. Meanwhile, Greg's desire to further his career as a surgeon leads him to obtain a commission in the Army, and early in Season 4 he is sent to basic training and then to Vietnam. While her husband is deployed, Joan and Roger have one sexual encounter, which results in her becoming pregnant. Joan initially decides to terminate the pregnancy, but changes her mind and gives birth shortly before the beginning of Season 5, with her husband unaware he is not the father. Greg returns from Vietnam during Season 5, but he and Joan separate, after <b>he</b> <b>announces</b> to Joan that he is returning to Vietnam for another tour of duty regardless of her feelings on the matter, and are divorced {{by the end of the}} season. By the close of Season 5, Joan has become a full partner at SCDP in exchange for agreeing to sleep with a Jaguar executive to help land the account. This leads to conflict with Don in the sixth season, during which Don ends the account with Jaguar just before SCDP makes a public offering.

At the close of the series, she is subject to harassment by McCann executives and agrees to a buyout of her partnership stake. She starts a production company called Holloway Harris.|$|E
