5|$|Although {{proposals}} for television projects were submitted to him, {{he had no}} interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he {{would never be able to}} film his stories.|$|E
5|$|While under Iso's tutelage, Kanō {{witnessed}} a demonstration by the Yōshin-ryū jūjutsu teacher Totsuka Hikosuke and later {{took part in}} randori with members of Totsuka's school. Kanō {{was impressed by the}} Yōshin-ryū practitioners and realized that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> be able to beat someone as talented as Totsuka simply by training harder: he also needed to train smarter. It was this experience that first led Kanō to believe that to be truly superior, one needed to combine the best elements of several ryū, or schools, of jūjutsu including Yagyu Shingan-ryū Taijutsu. Toward this end, he began to seek teachers who could provide him with superior elements of jūjutsu that he could adopt.|$|E
5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mind you do," [...] {{said the}} Vicar, and would go past him with {{at most a}} slight {{acceleration}} of his breathing. And {{out of respect for}} his manhood he made it a rule, whatever <b>he</b> <b>might</b> fancy, <b>never</b> to look back at the danger, when once it was passed.|$|R
50|$|Molyneux {{furnished}} {{an account}} of Sir Henry, Sir Philip, Sir Robert, and Thomas Sidney to Holinshed's Chronicles (ed. 1587, iii. 1548-56), in which he complained that Sir Henry Sidney, however <b>he</b> <b>might</b> strive, <b>never</b> succeeded in obtaining for him a comfortable office or reward of any kind. The enmity of Burghley probably retarded his advancement.|$|R

5|$|When Mardonius {{heard that}} the Allied army was on the march, he retreated into Boeotia, near Plataea, trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry. The Allied army however, {{under the command of}} the Spartan regent Pausanias, stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect {{themselves}} against such tactics. Mardonius ordered a hit-and-run cavalry attack on the Greek lines, but the attack was unsuccessful and the cavalry commander killed. The outcome prompted the Allies to move to a position nearer the Persian camp, still on high ground. As a result, the Allied lines of communication were exposed. The Persian cavalry began to intercept food deliveries and finally managed to destroy the only spring of water available to the Allies. The Allied position now undermined, Pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards their original positions. This went awry, leaving the Athenians, and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away, near Plataea itself. Seeing that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have a better opportunity to attack, Mardonius ordered his whole army forward. However, as at Thermopylae, the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites, and the Spartans broke through to Mardonius's bodyguard and killed him. The Persian force thus dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly, but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Allies, thus finalising their victory.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to his notoriety, Leavitt kept {{a running}} {{correspondence}} {{with people that}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have met. His friendship with Albany, New York mayor Erastus Corning 2nd, for instance, lasted decades, and the pair's letters about angling are among the papers collected in Corning's archives.|$|E
25|$|Shamrock was {{originally}} scheduled {{to compete at}} UFC 2 but broke his hand after blocking a high kick while sparring with a teammate. He still wanted to compete, but when doctors told him that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> fight again if he injured his hand any further, he reluctantly withdrew from the show.|$|E
60|$|Among the {{mountain}} pastures and valleys that {{lie in the}} centre of France there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit, whose delight it was to play tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys. They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare. Indeed, {{there was only one}} thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a needle. At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> was able to imitate the hole, so every woman would have found him out at once, and this he knew.|$|R
5000|$|Divination {{emerges as}} an {{alternative}} means of perception. Pilar, [...] "Pablo's woman," [...] is a reader of palms and more. When Robert Jordan questions her true abilities, she replies, [...] "Because thou art a miracle of deafness.... It is not that thou art stupid. Thou art simply deaf. One who is deaf cannot hear music. Neither can he hear the radio. So <b>he</b> <b>might</b> say, <b>never</b> having heard them, that such things do not exist." ...|$|R
60|$|Long he waited, {{but wait}} as <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> the basket <b>never</b> came back, for in their joy at being free the knight's daughters had {{forgotten}} all about Ian, and had set sail in the ship that had brought him and his brothers {{to the land of}} Grianaig.|$|R
25|$|This {{accident}} left Hogan, age 36, with a double-fracture of the pelvis, {{a fractured}} collar bone, a left ankle fracture, a chipped rib, and near-fatal blood clots: he would suffer lifelong circulation problems and other physical limitations. His doctors said <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> walk again, let alone play golf competitively. While in hospital, Hogan's life was endangered by {{a blood clot}} problem, leading doctors to tie off the vena cava. Hogan left the hospital on April 1, 59 days after the accident.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, he {{suffered}} severe burns {{in a fire}} at the Copley Plaza hotel, in Boston, but survived after thirty hours of extensive surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital. Though he was warned that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> {{be able to live}} a normal life again, eight years later he was fit enough to insist on playing tennis nearly every day and to launch a hostile takeover of Viacom. Redstone has discussed the story of surviving the fire as a reflection of his strong determination and will to live.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} fourteen, while {{sick with}} typhoid fever, he raved in his {{delirium}} that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the Palazzo Pitti and the Uffizi in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the Italian Renaissance masters, the tales he {{had heard about the}} great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, Guglielmo Micheli.|$|E
60|$|In {{bitterness}} {{he realized}} now, {{as he looked}} from uncle to niece--his glance, usually so direct and bold, now oddly furtive--that though to-morrow <b>he</b> <b>might</b> kill Andre-Louis, yet even by his death Andre-Louis would take vengeance upon him. He had exaggerated nothing in reaching the conclusion that this Andre-Louis Moreau was the evil genius of his life. He saw now that do what he would, kill him even though <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> <b>he</b> could <b>never</b> conquer him. The last word would always be with Andre-Louis Moreau. In bitterness, in rage, and in humiliation--a thing almost unknown to him--did he realize it, and the realization steeled his purpose for all that he perceived its futility.|$|R
60|$|PAGE 17. l. 248. Refers to {{the story}} of Orpheus' attempt to rescue his wife Eurydice from Hades. With his {{exquisite}} music he charmed Cerberus, the fierce dog who guarded hell-gates, into submission, and won Pluto's consent that he should lead Eurydice back to the upper world on one condition--that he would not look back to see that she was following. When he was almost at the gates, love and curiosity overpowered him, and he looked back--to see Eurydice fall back into Hades whence <b>he</b> now <b>might</b> <b>never</b> win her.|$|R

You seemed so much greater and higher and nobler. How grateful I ought to be to Robert Monteith for having spoken to me yesterday and forbidden me to see you! for if <b>he</b> hadn't, you <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have kissed me last night, and then I <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have seen things as I see them at present." ...|$|R
25|$|Following graduation, Eliot {{attended}} Milton Academy in Massachusetts for a preparatory year, {{where he}} met Scofield Thayer who later published The Waste Land. He studied philosophy at Harvard College from 1906 to 1909, earning his bachelor's degree after three years, {{instead of the usual}} four. While a student, Eliot was placed on academic probation and graduated with a pass degree (i.e. no honours). He recovered and persisted, attaining a B.A. in an elective program best described as comparative literature in three years, and an M.A. in English literature in the fourth. Frank Kermode writes that the most important moment of Eliot's undergraduate career was in 1908 when he discovered Arthur Symons's The Symbolist Movement in Literature. This introduced him to Jules Laforgue, Arthur Rimbaud, and Paul Verlaine. Without Verlaine, Eliot wrote, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have heard of Tristan Corbière and his book Les amours jaunes, a work that affected the course of Eliot's life. The Harvard Advocate published some of his poems and he became lifelong friends with Conrad Aiken the American novelist.|$|E
500|$|Rush divided his {{energies}} {{between his}} business ventures and his sculling contests, organising {{as well as}} competing in regattas and 'aquatic carnivals', so much so, that he never achieved the solid prosperity of other Clarence River commercial pioneers. He added the Criterion Hotel {{and a string of}} race-horses to his business 'empire' at Rocky Mouth. As a former farm-boy from impoverished Ireland, where <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> have owned even a house plot, Rush now purchased many acres of Clarence River land, much of it having little value. Rush's Irish background of tenant farming gave little understanding of managing capital, property, or conducting a business career. Rush fits an Irish immigrant model offered by historian Patrick O'Farrell: ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{considering}} his situation, believing {{that not only}} would he never walk again, but that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> move a body part again, Reeve considered suicide. He mouthed to Dana, [...] "Maybe we should let me go." [...] She tearfully replied, [...] "I am only {{going to say this}} once: I will support whatever you want to do because this is your life, and your decision. But I {{want you to know that}} I'll be with you for the long haul, no matter what. You're still you. And I love you." [...] Reeve never considered euthanasia as an option again.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not stop}} to set on foot an inquiry into his train of thought or state of feeling, however; but went {{thinking}} on all the way home, and continued to dream on in the same strain all night. For, having satisfied himself that Frank Cheeryble could have no knowledge of, or acquaintance with, the mysterious young lady, it began to occur to him that even <b>he</b> himself <b>might</b> <b>never</b> see her again; upon which hypothesis he built up a very ingenious succession of tormenting ideas which answered his purpose even better than the vision of Mr Frank Cheeryble, and tantalised and worried him, waking and sleeping.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} will not. I don't suppose they could bring {{themselves}} to object to anything <b>he</b> <b>might</b> suggest. I <b>never</b> knew a young man so happily situated in this respect. He is quite a free agent. I don't think they would say much to him if he insisted on marrying the cook-maid. Indeed, {{it seems to me}} that his word is quite paramount at Castle Richmond." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{told him}} that it {{contained}} an order for the majordomo to ride, with a troop of twelve men, to meet us, and that he was to give what aid he could in getting them together as quickly as possible; so that, even if robbed of the letter, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> still be able to fulfil his mission. Not, I own, that I thought of that at the time, for the idea that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be stopped <b>never</b> once entered my mind." ...|$|R
2500|$|Muncie {{was born}} and raised in the Pittsburgh area town of Uniontown, Pennsylvania, as one of six {{children}} in a football-playing family. His three brothers called him [...] "Chuck" [...] because they did not like [...] "Harry". When he was six, Muncie was hit by a truck, breaking his thigh, leg, hip, and arm. He was in a cast from his neck to his toes for six months, and doctors warned that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> be able to walk properly again. Muncie recovered to become a multi-sport athlete, but the accident left his left leg shorter than his right. He compensated by playing with a shoe with an extra-thick sole.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{graduated}} from Cheltenham High School in 1964, where he excelled in football, basketball, baseball, and track and field. A tailback in football, he injured his knee {{in an early}} season game in his junior year {{in the fall of}} 1962. He was told by the doctors he was never to play football again, but Jackson returned for the final game of the season. [...] In that game, Jackson fractured five cervical vertebrae, which caused him to spend six weeks in the hospital and another month in a neck cast. Doctors told Jackson that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> walk again, let alone play football, but Jackson defied the odds again. On the baseball team, he batted [...]550 and threw several no-hitters. In the middle of his senior year, Jackson's father was arrested for bootlegging and was sentenced to six months in jail.|$|E
2500|$|By late June, Heilmann was batting [...]387 and battling George Sisler for the American League batting championship. On August 26, 1922, Heilman's season {{came to an}} {{end when}} he {{sustained}} a complete break of his collarbone when he crashed into Frank Brower while trying to beat out an infield hit. Heilmann had to have his collarbone rebroken and reset, and it was then discovered that Heilmann had also broken his shoulder. The injuries were so severe that Heilmann remained hospitalized until a week {{before the end of the}} season, and even after leaving the hospital, he feared <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> play again. Despite missing the last five weeks of the season, Heilmann hit a career high 21 home runs, fourth in the American League, and also ranked among the league leaders with a [...]356 batting average (fourth), a [...]432 on-base percentage (fifth) and a [...]598 slugging percentage (fourth).|$|E
60|$|Presently {{she shook}} the corpse by the shoulder, {{and then with}} a show of {{strength}} which her tenderly girlish form belied, she turned the body over on its back. If she had been in doubt before, one glance at the hideous features set in death must have convinced her that life was extinct, and with the realization there broke from her lips peal after peal of mad, maniacal laughter as with her little hands she beat upon the upturned face and breast of the dead man. It was a gruesome sight from which the Englishman involuntarily drew back-a gruesome, disgusting sight such as, <b>he</b> realized, <b>might</b> <b>never</b> be witnessed outside a madhouse or this frightful city.|$|R
60|$|It was Winston's last {{afternoon}} at the Grange, and almost unpleasantly hot, while the man whose vigor had not as yet returned to him was content to lounge in the big window-seat listlessly watching his companion. He had borne the strain of effort long, {{and the time of}} his convalescence amid the tranquillity of Silverdale Grange had with the gracious kindliness of Miss Barrington and her niece been a revelation to him. There were moments when it brought him bitterness and self-reproach, but these were usually brief, and he made the most of what <b>he</b> knew <b>might</b> <b>never</b> be his again, telling himself that it would at least be something to look back upon.|$|R
60|$|And when Michael {{departed}} from Cedarwild in a crate on an express wagon, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> well have <b>never</b> returned, for Wilton Davis was notorious among trained-animal men for his cruelty to dogs. Some care <b>he</b> <b>might</b> take {{of a particular}} dog with a particularly valuable trick, but mere fillers-in came too cheaply. They cost from three to five dollars apiece. Worse than that, so {{far as he was}} concerned, Michael had cost nothing. And if he died it meant nothing to Davis except the trouble of finding another dog.|$|R

6000|$|There was {{a sadness}} {{in his voice}} which almost brought the tears into her eyes--mostly for his sake, partly for her own. For, though <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>never</b> know it, were not his sorrows her sorrows? ...|$|E
60|$|However deeply {{engrossed in}} mementoes of the Dark or Stone Ages <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> {{failed to see}} us the moment we entered his echoing gallery.

So much so that I sent an almost rapturous {{description}} of him to Mr Anon.|$|R
6000|$|The old Fairy, {{who wished}} to make him happy, at last hit upon a plan. She shut the Dear Little Princess up in a palace of crystal, and put this palace down where the Prince would not fail to find it. His joy at seeing the Princess again was extreme, and he set to work {{with all his might}} to try to break her prison; but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly. In despair he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to the Dear Little Princess, who, on her part, {{stretched}} out her hand that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> kiss it; but turn which way <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> could raise it to his lips, for his long nose always prevented it.
