40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine cancer {{incidence}} in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AASV) derived from population-based cohort studies by means of meta-analysis. Methods Relevant electronic databases were searched for studies characterizing the associated risk of overall malignancy in patients with AASV. Standardized incidence rates (SIRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of association. We tested for publication bias and heterogeneity and stratified <b>for</b> site-specific <b>cancers.</b> Results Six studies (n = 2, 578) were eventually identified, of which six provided the SIR for overall malignancy, five reported the SIR <b>for</b> non-melanoma skin <b>cancer</b> (NMSC), four <b>for</b> leukemia, five <b>for</b> bladder <b>cancer,</b> three <b>for</b> lymphoma, three <b>for</b> liver <b>cancer,</b> four <b>for</b> lung <b>cancer,</b> three <b>for</b> kidney <b>cancer,</b> four <b>for</b> prostate <b>cancer,</b> four <b>for</b> colon <b>cancer</b> and four <b>for</b> breast <b>cancer.</b> Overall, the pooled SIR of cancer in AASV patients was 1. 74 (95 %CI = 1. 37 – 2. 21), wit...|$|R

40|$|Objective:To examine {{long-term}} {{trends in}} cancer mortality in the Indigenous {{people of the}} Northern Territory (NT) of Australia. Design:Comparison of cancer mortality rates of the NT Indigenous population {{with those of the}} total Australian population for 1991 – 2000, and examination of time trends in cancer mortality rates in the NT Indigenous population, 1977 – 2000. Participants:NT Indigenous and total Australian populations, 1977 – 2000. Main outcome measures:Cancer mortality rate ratios and percentage change in annual mortality rates. Results:The NT Indigenous cancer mortality rate was higher than the total Australian rate <b>for</b> <b>cancers</b> of the liver, lungs, uterus, cervix and thyroid, and, in younger people only, <b>for</b> <b>cancers</b> of the oropharynx, oesophagus and pancreas. NT Indigenous mortality rates were lower than the total Australian rates <b>for</b> renal <b>cancers</b> and melanoma and, in older people only, <b>for</b> <b>cancers</b> of the prostate and bowel. Differences between Indigenous and total Australian cancer mortality rates were more pronounced among those aged under 64 years <b>for</b> most <b>cancers.</b> NT Indigenous cancer mortality rates increased over the 24 -year period <b>for</b> <b>cancers</b> of the oropharynx, pancreas and lung, all of which are smoking-related cancers. Conclusions:Cancer is an important and increasing health problem <b>for</b> Indigenous Australians. <b>Cancers</b> that affect Indigenous Australians {{to a greater extent than}} other Australians are largely preventable (eg, through smoking cessation, Pap smear programs and hepatitis B vaccination) ...|$|R

5|$|Copper {{reduction}} or deficiency {{can also}} be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically {{in the treatment of}} copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion.

40|$|Several large {{randomized}} trials comparing laparoscopic versus open resection <b>for</b> colon <b>cancer</b> {{have demonstrated that}} the laparoscopic-assisted colectomy can be an acceptable alternative to an open colectomy <b>for</b> colon <b>cancer</b> [1 - 4]. These trials suggested similar oncologic outcomes (local recurrence and overall survival) for laparoscopic-assisted and open colectomies. In addition, laparoscopic-assisted resection {{may be associated with}} a shorter hospital stay with no difference in intra-, peri- and postoperative complications. To date, however, the laparoscopic resection <b>for</b> rectal <b>cancer</b> has not gained level- 1 evidence in surgical practice. A subset analysis of the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) trial, Conventional versus Laparoscopic-Assisted Surgery in Colorectal Cancer (CLASICC), reported a 34 % conversion rate with 59 % morbidity during the first 30 days after laparoscopic surgery <b>for</b> rectal <b>cancer.</b> Laparoscopic procedures <b>for</b> rectal <b>cancer</b> are regarded as technically demanding because a total mesorectal excision (TME) and autonomic nerve preservation are prerequisites for functional and oncological safety.
