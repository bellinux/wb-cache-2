40|$|An {{elementary}} {{classroom teacher}} (ECT) has a busy day.

40|$|Physical {{education}} classrooms often have {{low levels of}} moderate to vigorous physical activity levels. This is a problem since many young elementary students are not building a foundation of fundamental movement skills necessary to be lifelong participants in physical activities. This study investigated how <b>elementary</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> teachers used auditory modalities in their classrooms. The research question explored the emergence of rhythmic competency in fundamental movement skills to increase overall moderate to vigorous activity levels. This concurrent, mixed-methods, multiple case study used a constructivist paradigm using the schema and dynamic system theories as the underlying motor system theoretical framework. Two research sites were selected: a suburban Maryland public school system and a private liberal arts college located in the same county. The participants included 21 <b>elementary</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> teachers and 6 physical education or exercise science majors from nationally recognized programs. Data were collected from a focus group, interviews, classroom observations, and a 10 -item response Likert style survey designed for <b>elementary</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> teachers to recognize current trends {{in the field of}} auditory modalities and rhythmic competency. The data were analyzed to identify auditory modality instructional methods for the emergence of rhythmic competencies.

Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using a school subject ranking scale and a pre- and post-survey.

Statistically significant differences were found when examining the school subject ranking scale and the pre- and post-survey questionnaire results. The participants= open-ended responses on the surveys were transcribed and analyzed and six positive, and five negative themes emerged from the open-ended question with YES responses through inductive analysis, and five themes emerged from the open-ended question with NO responses through inductive analysis. The themes that described the participants= positive experiences in physical education as a child included: enjoyment in athletics, being successful, learning new things, a break from the classroom setting, teamwork, and positive interaction with the teacher. The themes that described the participants= negative experiences in physical education as a child included: being spotlighted, captains picking teams, no instruction, large class size/waiting in line, and too competitive. The results of the study found that after a 15 week methods course on <b>elementary</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> that the participant=s beliefs and perceptions concerning the importance of physical education had the greatest change when compared to the other school subjects. The results also indicated that the participants believed that physical education is an integral part of school education, provides opportunities to learn about fitness, is not just about playing games and sports, and is not just a time to be with friends, laugh and be silly. The results from this study also suggest that preservice teachers believed that physical education deserves a lot more credit than it is currently given. Further research in this area is necessary to continue to investigate the importance of preservice physical education methodology courses, and to uncover if the beliefs and perceptions of the participants change (and are sustained over time).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the relationship among various contextual factors with accelerometer measured physical activity during <b>elementary</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education.</b> Data were collected during 2015 – 2016 from 281 students (1 st– 5 th grade, 137 males, 144 females) from a private school located in a metropolitan area of Utah in the U.

A multi-level general linear mixed effects model was employed to examine the relationship among various physical education contextual factors and percent of wear time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (%MVPA), accounting for clustering of observations within students and the clustering of students within classrooms. Explored contextual factors included grade level, lesson context, sex, and class size. Main effects and interactions among the factors were explored in the multi-level models. A two-way interaction of lesson context and class size on %MVPA was shown to be statistically significant.
