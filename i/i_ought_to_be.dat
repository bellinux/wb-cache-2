500|$|Her {{books were}} very popular during the Great Depression and World War II. Her novels, which {{journalist}} Lesley McDowell described as containing [...] "derring-do, dashing blades, and maids in peril", allowed readers {{to escape from}} the mundane and difficult elements of their lives. In a letter describing her novel Friday's Child, Heyer commented, [...] "'I think myself <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shot for writing such nonsense. ... But it's unquestionably good escapist literature and I think I should rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{his brother}} died in 1929, Pond married Katherine N. de Nancrede, who was 47 years old, at a {{ceremony}} in Ann Arbor. [...] Pond said at the time, [...] "It's the first time I ever did it, and I thought <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pardoned because of my youth." [...] Pond was also an amateur acrobat and remained a physical fitness buff all of his life. [...] At {{the time of his}} wedding in 1929, the Associated Press reported that he is [...] "almost as well known for his present athletic agility as for his architectural accomplishments. A part of his daily routine is to turn handsprings and flipflops and do other strenuous exercises." [...] He drew applause when, on his 80th birthday, he grabbed his bare knees with both hands and performed a backflip. [...] A photograph of Pond's feat was published in Life magazine in June 1937.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{to a total}} of 944 theatres, with an extra 66 being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> grateful for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E

2500|$|Netanyahu {{attended}} Cheltenham High School in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, {{graduating in}} 1964 as a classmate of Baseball Hall of Fame member Reggie Jackson. While in high school, he began contemplating his purpose in life, {{when he wrote}} in a 1963 letter, [...] "The trouble with the youth here is that their lives are meager in content. <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready at every moment of my life to confront myself and say'This is what I've done'." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Burns was released, she {{was quickly}} rearrested for {{continuing}} protests, picketing, and marching at the White House. Upon her third arrest in 1917, the judge aimed {{to make an}} example of Burns, and she was given the maximum sentence. [...] Once again a prisoner at Occoquan Workhouse, Lucy Burns endured what is remembered as the “Night of Terror.” The women were treated brutally and were refused medical attention. To unite the women, Burns tried to call roll and refused to stop despite numerous threats by the guards. When they realized Lucy Burns's spirit {{was not going to}} be easily broken, they handcuffed her hands above her head to her cell door and left her that way for the entire night. Burns was so loved and respected by her fellow suffragists that the women in the cell across from her held their hands above their head and stood in the same position. Despite her courage and extraordinary leadership skills, the burden of working so diligently did bother Burns at times; she once told Alice Paul, “I am so nervous I cannot eat or sleep. I am such a coward <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a village seamstress, instead of a Woman’s Party organizer.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Ruiz de Burton is very {{critical}} of the United States in her fiction, both objectively and in relation to her native Mexico. [...] She accuses the US of childishly holding on to a provincial mentality, maintaining that Europe still sets the standard for cultural judgment.. [...] In The Squatter and the Don, the characters Clarence and Hubert discuss wines from California, {{which appears to be}} patronizing criticism of California from Northeasterners, but, according to Anne Elizabeth Goldman, is in fact more of a criticism of the provincial sensibilities maintained by Bostonians. [...] Like the Norval sisters in Who Would Have Thought It? who travel to Europe to learn good taste, Clarence notes this mentality saying [...] "Don't you know I like some of our California wines quite as well as the imported, if not better? [...] I suppose <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ashamed to admit it, thus showing my taste is not cultivated...I think sooner or later our wines will be better liked, better appreciated." [...] Hubert responds: [...] "I think so too, but for the present it is the fashion to cry down our native wines and extol the imported. [...] When foreigners come to California to tell us that we can make good wines, that we have soils in which to grow the best grapes, then we will believe it, not before." ...|$|E
