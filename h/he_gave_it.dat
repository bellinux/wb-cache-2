5|$|Living giraffes were {{originally}} classified as one species by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the binomial name Cervus camelopardalis. Morten Thrane Brünnich classified the genus Giraffa in 1772. The species name camelopardalis is from Latin.|$|E

Released as a single in January 1977, the song peaked at number twenty-two on the US Easy Listening chart for two weeks in April 1977.|$|E

5|$|Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander, after {{collecting}} {{a specimen}} at Botany Bay in 1770 {{on the first}} voyage of Captain James Cook, {{was the first to}} write of this species. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the name Leucadendron apiifolium, but never officially described it. The specific epithet referred to the similarity of its leaves to Apium (celery).|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{was first}} scientifically described in 1859 by William Orville Ayres, the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the specific epithet californica, as the originally-described specimen was caught off San Francisco. Locally, this species {{may also be}} referred to as angel shark, California angel shark, or monkfish.|$|E
5|$|The manor of Harmondsworth {{was owned}} before the Norman Conquest by King Harold Godwinson, but {{was seized by}} William the Conqueror after Harold's death at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Three years later, William granted it to William FitzOsbern, one of his close confidants. It was {{subsequently}} transferred to the Abbey of Rouen. In 1391, it was acquired from the abbot and prior by William of Wykeham, the Bishop of Winchester. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> to Winchester College, which he had founded in 1382, {{as part of his}} endowment of that establishment. Its revenues went towards supporting the college.|$|E

Then in 1950, Smith became the Director of Central Intelligence, {{the head of the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other {{intelligence}} agencies in the United States. Smith reorganized the CIA, redefined its structure and its mission, and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a new sense of purpose. He made the CIA the arm of government primarily responsible for covert operations. He left the CIA in 1953 to become an Under Secretary of State. After retiring from the State Department in 1954, Smith continued to serve the Eisenhower Administration in various posts for several years, until his retirement and his death in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Banksia spinulosa {{was named}} by James Edward Smith in England in 1793, after being {{collected}} by John White, most likely in 1792. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the common name prickly-leaved banksia, though this has {{fallen out of}} use. With four currently recognised varieties, the species has had a complicated taxonomic history, with two varieties initially described as separate species in the early 19th century. A fourth, from the New England region, has only recently been described. However, there has been disagreement whether one, var.cunninghamii, is distinct enough to once again have specific status. The pre-eminent authority on Banksia, Alex George, concedes there is still more {{work to be done}} on the Banksia spinulosa complex.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker originally {{described the}} tasselled wobbegong in an 1867 volume of Archives Néerlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles. His account {{was based on}} two Indonesian specimens, one caught off Waigeo and the other off Aru. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the name dasypogon, from the Greek dasys ("hairy") and pogon ("beard"), and assigned it to the genus Crossorhinus (a synonym of Orectolobus). In 1908, Charles Tate Regan created the new genus Eucrossorhinus for this species, derived from the Greek eu ("good"), krossoi ("tassel") and rhinos ("nose"). Regan subsequently reconsidered the main trait he used to separate Eucrossorhinus (the spacing of {{the fourth and fifth}} gill slits) and synonymized it with Orectolobus. Later authors have placed the tasselled wobbegong either in its own genus or in Orectolobus. Other common names for this species are bearded wobbegong and Ogilby's wobbegong.|$|E

5|$|His {{concern with}} public {{education}} was not interrupted by his military campaigns. In 1813 he {{was rewarded with}} 40,000 pesos for his victories at Salta and Tucumán, an amount that would equal almost 80 gold kilograms. Belgrano rejected taking the prize money for himself, considering that a patriot should not seek money or wealth. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> back to the XIII year Assembly, with instructions to build primary schools at Tarija, Jujuy, San Miguel de Tucumán, and Santiago del Estero. He laid {{out a series of}} instructions about the methods and requirements for the selection of the teachers. However, the schools were not built, and by 1823 Bernardino Rivadavia declared that the money was lost; Juan Ramón Balcarce included it in the debt of the Buenos Aires province a decade later.|$|E

25|$|In 1830, 29 {{years after}} its initial discovery, Professor Nils Gabriel Sefström of Sweden rediscovered the element. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> its current name, vanadium, {{in honor of the}} Scandinavian goddess of love and beauty, Vanadis. In the same year, Friedrich Wöhler, the German chemist who had {{synthesized}} urea, analyzed some of del Río's samples and proved that vanadium and eritronium were the same. Later the U.S. geologist George William Featherstonhaugh proposed without success that the element should be named rionium, in honor of its original discoverer.|$|E
