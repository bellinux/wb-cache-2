5|$|The {{shooting}} led to {{the creation}} of the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization managed by the Capitol Police Board which provides funds for the families of Chestnut and Gibson. In November 2005, the fund was expanded to include the family of Sgt. Christopher Eney, a USCP officer killed during a training accident in 1984. The shooting was cited as one reason for the development of the Capitol Visitors Center. The legislation authorizing the construction of the facility was introduced by Washington, D.C. Delegate <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> <b>Norton</b> and was entitled the Jacob Joseph Chestnut-John Michael Gibson United States Capitol Visitor Center Act of 1998. The door where Weston entered was renamed in honor of the two officers, from the Document Door to the Chestnut-Gibson Memorial Door.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, the American Legion {{called for}} {{conversion}} of the District of Columbia War Memorial as well. To give added impetus to the effort, local D.C.-area attorney Edwin Fountain formed the World War I Memorial Foundation to solicit funds and act as a lobby for the effort. D.C. Council member Jack Evans (in whose ward the D.C. War Memorial was located) and <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> <b>Norton,</b> D.C.'s Delegate to Congress, both became honorary trustees of the foundation.|$|E
25|$|In a July 2016 {{statement}} issued {{jointly by the}} offices of Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine; Representatives Don Beyer, Gerald Connolly, and Barbara Comstock; and Delegate <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> <b>Norton,</b> the NPS plans repair the bridge in two phases. The first phase, which addresses the bridge's most urgent repairs, will refurbish and reinforce the approach spans on {{either end of the}} bridge at a cost of $166 million. These repairs will permit the bridge to stay open until 2030. The second phase, whose cost was estimated at $94 million, would replace the bascule span and make other repairs to the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Significant cost {{increases}} {{led to the}} project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from {{the cost of the}} building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that the Bush administration was meddling in the project's design. Two days later, <b>Eleanor</b> <b>Holmes</b> <b>Norton,</b> D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.|$|E

500|$|The District {{is not a}} {{state and}} {{therefore}} has no voting representation in the Congress.

[...] New York representative Peter T.

You don’t know whether the First Amendment is alive and well until it is tested by people with despicable ideas. And I loved the idea of looking a racist in the face—remember this was a time when racism was much more alive and well than it is today—and saying, 'I am your lawyer, sir, {{what are you going to}} do about that?'"Norton worked as an adjunct assistant professor at New York University Law School from 1970 to 1971. In 1970, Mayor John Lindsay appointed her as the head of the New York City Human Rights Commission, and she held the first hearings in the country on discrimination against women. Prominent feminists from throughout the country came to New York City to testify, while Norton used the platform as a means of raising public awareness about the application of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to women and sex discrimination.|$|R
