The significance of Ca 2 + influx and phosphoinositide signalling during the formation of cell polarity in migrating monospores was analysed pharmacologically. The {{results indicate that the}} inhibition of the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> polarity, as judged by the ability of F-actin to localize asymmetrically, cell wall synthesis, and development into germlings, occurred when monospores were treated with inhibitors of the Ca 2 + permeable channel, phospholipase C (PLC), diacylglycerol kinase, and inositol- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptor. Moreover, it was also found that light triggered the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> polarity via photosynthetic activity but not its direction, indicating that the Ca 2 + influx and PLC activation required for the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> polarity are light dependent.

The level of recombinant antibody expression was tightly correlated with the efficiency of plasmid amplification and the cytogenetic appearance of the amplified genes, and was strongly dependent on cell type.

High-producer clones stably expressed the antibody over several months without eliciting changes in both the protein expression level and the cytogenetic appearance of the amplified genes. The integrity and reactivity of the protein produced by this method was fine. In serum-free suspension culture, the specific protein production rate in high-density cultures was 29. 4 pg/cell/day.

To evaluate the effects of the cytokines on <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> parasitized <b>cell</b> lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in their presence immediately following infection with T. parva sporozoites. Neither rIFN-gamma nor rIL- 2 altered the proportion <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> initially developing schizonts, but both enhanced <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> infected <b>cell</b> lines by about twofold.

Here, we integrated phenomenological modeling with quantitative single-cell measurements to separate the sensing and amplification components of Wnt ligands and receptors during establishment of polarity of the Caenorhabditis elegans P cells. By systematically exploring how P-cell polarity is altered in Wnt ligand and receptor mutants, we inferred that ligands predominantly affect the sensing process, whereas receptors are needed for both sensing and amplification.

Since monospores from the red alga Porphyra yezoensis are a real example of migrating plant cells, {{the involvement of the}} cytoskeleton and PI 3 K was investigated during their early development. Our results indicate that the asymmetrical localization of F-actin at the leading edge is fixed by the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis in migrating monospores, which is PI 3 K-dependent and protein synthesis-independent. After migration, monospores adhere to the substratum and then become upright, developing into multicellular thalli via the establishment of the apical-basal axis. In this process, F-actin usually accumulates {{at the bottom of the}} basal cell and development after migration requires new protein synthesis. These findings suggest that the establishment of anterior-posterior and apical-basal axes are differentially regulated during the early development of monospores.

In this report, we describe the characterization of a novel female gametophyte mutant, eostre, which affects <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> fates in the mature embryo sac. The eostre phenotype is caused by misexpression of the homeodomain gene BEL 1 -like homeodomain 1 (BLH 1) in the embryo sac. It is known that BELL-KNAT proteins function as heterodimers whose activities are regulated by the Arabidopsis ovate family proteins (OFPs). We show that the phenotypic effect of BLH 1 overexpression is dependent upon the class II knox gene KNAT 3, suggesting that KNAT 3 must be expressed and functional during megagametogenesis. Moreover, disruption of At OFP 5, a known interactor of KNAT 3 and BLH 1, partially phenocopies the eostre mutation. Our study indicates that suppression of ectopic activity of BELL-KNOX TALE complexes, which might be mediated by At OFP 5, is essential for normal development and cell specification in the Arabidopsis embryo sac.
