40|$|Abstract This study {{investigates the}} {{reproductive}} peri-odicity and reproductive {{output of the}} seagrass Zostera novazelandica on two intertidal reefs. Peak numbers of <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots</b> occurred duringMarch (late summer) of two years at both sites and no <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots</b> occurred {{during the winter months}} of July to September. There were greater numbers of <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots</b> in seagrass patches in the low intertidal zone (up to an average of 55 per 0. 1 m 2) compared to the middle (up to 20 per 0. 1 m 2) and upper (up to 9 per 0. 1 m 2) zones, and about three times greater reproductive output in patches associated with tidepools compared to those not bordering tide-pools. The average number of inflorescences per shoot was 3. 1 (0. 25) at one site vs 1. 2 (0. 08) at the other, and showed a progressive decrease from the lower shore to the upper shore. Patches associated with tidepools had twice the number of inflorescences per shoot (2. 8 0. 24) than patches not bordering tidepools (1. 5 0. 16). The number of <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots</b> was highly correlated with leaf width, leaf length, and ramet density, while the leaf-area index decreased from the lower shore to the upper shore. The reproductive eort of plants, as measured by the percent biomass invested in <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots</b> during peak reproduction, was significantly dierent between sites, tidepool associations, and shore level. For all the variables measured, there was considerable spatial vari-ation, with significant interaction terms between most factors investigated. In laboratory experiments, more inflorescences were produced at light intensities of 30 and 300 lE m) 2 s) 1 than at 100 lE m) 2 s) 1.

40|$|A {{study with}} a {{comprehensive}} range of four constant {{photosynthetic photon flux}} densities (PPFD = 60, 90, 140 and 200 ¿mol m- 2 s- 1) combined with four constant temperatures (18, 21, 23 and 26 °C; equal day and night temperature) was conducted in growth chambers using the pot plant Kalanchoe blossfeldiana. The current work allows for establishing relationships between these two climatic factors and product quality (plant height, number of <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots,</b> inflorescence size and inflorescence position) and cropping duration. From the studied product quality attributes, temperature and PPFD only showed a marked interaction on number of <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots</b> and on inflorescence size. The huge increase observed {{on the number of}} <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots</b> (from 4. 6 to 20. 5) was a response to higher PPFD, whereas temperature had only a minor effect. Inflorescence size was also enhanced at higher PPFD (especially at lower temperatures) but in contrast with the number of <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots,</b> inflorescence size was drastically reduced at higher temperatures. Plant height varied between 13. 5 and 21. 6 cm and was strongly influenced by temperature, whereas influence of PPFD was only marginal. Time to flowering decreased quadratically with temperature and with PPFD, and no interaction between these climatic factors was found. The fastest treatment (26 °C combined with 200 ¿mol m- 2 s- 1) was 30 days earlier than the slowest one (18 °C combined with 60 ¿mol m- 2 s- 1).

50|$|Seagrasses are {{flowering}} species, {{but they}} can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Reproducing sexually increases genetic variation, which can enhance a plant's ability {{to adapt to a}} changing environment, but asexual reproduction requires less effort and is what Z. muelleri typically uses to maintain its population. When reproducing sexually, the plant's flowers form an inflorescence that is enclosed in a spathe (a large sheathing bract that encloses flower clusters in certain plant species). Each shoot can have up to 6 spathes, which contain 4-12 pairs of male and female flowers. Larger plants will have more flowers. Male flowers typically mature before female flowers. Once a <b>flowering</b> <b>shoot</b> matures, it darkens and breaks off the plant, and floats away. The enclosed seeds then become deposited in sediment someplace else. Zostera muelleri can reproduce asexually via rhizome encroachment, which is a form clonal reproduction. The plant can use this form of regeneration to recover from high intensity disturbances.|$|E

40|$|Many {{functionally}} hermaphroditic {{plants have}} evolved mechanisms to reduce interference between the sex functions and to optimize reproductive output. In addition to physical mechanisms {{such as the}} spatial (herkogamy) and temporal (dichogamy) separation {{of male and female}} functions, plasticity in sex expression by means of mate-recognition (flexible mating) could be important in plants with variable access to cross-pollen. This applies particularly to clonal plants because of their modular growth form. We experimentally tested for the effects of pollen source and vegetative neighbourhood on instantaneous sex ratio and seed production in the self-compatible clonal marine angiosperm Zostera marina L. To this end, we exposed the (monoecious) <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots</b> to self and cross-pollen and to neighbourhoods of their own and a mix of foreign vegetative <b>shoots.</b> <b>Flowering</b> <b>shoots</b> that had been exposed to cross-pollen showed (1) a significantly lower female/male ratio at peak flowering, evidence for mate-recognition, and (2) a significantly higher seed set {{by the end of the}} season. Both effects were independent of the genetic composition of their vegetative neighbourhood. The results suggest that Z. marina maintains a cryptic self-incompatibility system not previously described for angiosperms with sub-aqueous pollination. In Z. marina, and possibly other self-compatible clonal plant species, mate-recognition could be a means of increasing the out-crossing probability for <b>flowering</b> <b>shoots</b> with central positions within their clon...|$|R

40|$|Zostera caulescens Miki is {{distributed}} around the Honshu Island, Japan, and a threatened species. Its population in Funakoshi Bay on the Sanriku Coast, northeast Honshu Island, {{is known to}} be the world's longest seagrass.

Therefore, bimonthly sampling of its flowering and vegetative shoots together with its rhizomes and roots was conducted along a depth gradient in Funakoshi Bay to examine its phenology and morphology including flower structures. Zostera caulescens in Funakoshi Bay showed different morphology from those in central Honshu Island and the Korean Peninsula. The Leaf apex shapes were characterized by two forms: mucronate and emarginate. This study discovered that of flowering shoots was changed from an emarginate form in summer to a mucronate one in autumn and winter. Biomass and leaf area index (LAI) of <b>flowering</b> <b>shoot</b> showed higher values in summer and lower values in autumn and winter.
