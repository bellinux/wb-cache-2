40|$|Event-related {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (erfMRI) was employed to measure the hemodynamic response during a Go / No-go task, in 16 healthy subjects. The task was designed so that <b>Go</b> <b>and</b> <b>No-go</b> events were equally probable, allowing an unbiased comparison of cerebral activity during these two types of trials. In accordance with prediction, anterior cingulate was active during both the <b>Go</b> <b>and</b> <b>No-go</b> trials, dorsolateral <b>and</b> ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was more active during the No-go trials, while primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, pre-motor cortex and cerebellum were more active during Go trials.

40|$|Background: Response {{disinhibition}} {{plays an}} important role in addictive behaviors. However, results of studies on the performance on response inhibition tasks of individuals evidencing potentially problematic levels of alcohol drinking are mixed. Objectives: We assessed conditions under which persons with a relatively high risk of alcohol dependence show inhibition deficits in such tasks and investigated the nature of those deficits. Methods: Fifty-eight male undergraduate students, 27 of which were high-risk drinkers according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, performed a go/no-go inhibition task with differing percentages of no-go trials (50 % vs. 25 %), stimulus presentation times (600 vs. 200 ms), <b>and</b> types of <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> stimuli (alcohol related vs. -unrelated). Response inhibition was indexed by response time (RT) to <b>go</b> trials <b>and</b> response accuracy on <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> trials. Results: There were no differences between low- and high-risk drinkers on any of the three outcome measures under the 600 -ms stimulus presentation condition. Under the 200 -ms condition, the high-risk drinkers showed faster RTs to <b>go</b> stimuli, <b>and</b> more errors on both go- <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> trials than the low-risk drinkers, irrespective of type <b>and</b> percentage of <b>no-go</b> stimuli. However, the accuracy differences between the two groups disappeared after controlling for the RT on go trials, suggesting a speed-accuracy trade-off. Conclusion: High-risk drinkers' response inhibition deficits are not restricted to alcohol-related cues and are especially likely to occur under conditions prompting fast responding. These findings could be used to inform treatment, suggesting the promotion of strategies aimed at preventing high-risk alcohol users from making quick decisions...|$|R

Forty children aged 8 to 13 were presented with four stimulus blocks each containing 75 <b>go</b> <b>and</b> 75 <b>no-go</b> tone stimuli in random order.

However, in studies using go/no-go tasks, findings regarding the presence of response inhibition deficits in nicotine-dependent individuals are mixed. This might be due to differences between studies on a number of task parameters. Here we aimed to identify task conditions under which go/no-go task performance deficits can be observed in smokers and to characterize the nature of such deficits. Sixty-one male students (30 smokers, 31 non-smokers) performed a go/no-go task while independently manipulating three task parameters: (1) percentage no-go trials (50 % or 25 %), (2) stimulus presentation time (600 ms or 200 ms), and (3) nature of no-go stimuli (cigarette related or cigarette unrelated). Three measures, reaction time on <b>go</b> trials <b>and</b> percentage correct responses on <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> trials, served as performance indicators. Under 200 -ms but not 600 -ms stimulus presentation conditions, the smokers responded faster on <b>go</b> trials <b>and</b> made more errors on both <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> trials than the non-smokers did. These differences occurred irrespective of the percentage of <b>no-go</b> trials <b>and</b> nature of <b>no-go</b> stimuli.

Experiments 2 and 3 differentiated the effect of the Go-trial proportion from the effect of the Go-mapping rule.

Next, participants performed a practice stop signal block consisting of 16 trials, where they were presented with <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> trials. On the no-go trials, participants were required to inhibit their response (i.e. not press “f” or “j” in response to the circle on the screen) when they heard a stop signal (i.e. the verbal prompt “stop”). This block allowed participants to become better acquainted with the stop signal portion of the task and allowed for calibration of the stop signal delay.|$|R

This study optimized the assessment of sensitivity of children with DCD to emotionally significant stimuli by using easily discriminable emotional expressions in a go/no-go task.

For example, response conflict is high when a response must be withheld (no-go) in contexts in which there is a prepotent tendency to make an overt (go) response. An event-related brain potential (ERP) component, the N 2, is more pronounced on no-go than on <b>go</b> trials <b>and</b> was previously thought to reflect the need to inhibit the go response. However, the N 2 may instead reflect the high degree of response conflict on no-go trials.

To test this hypothesis, we collected high-density ERP data from 12 18 - 24 -year-olds performing a go/no-go task, in which the relative frequency of go versus no-go stimuli was varied. Consistent with our hypothesis, an N 2 was apparent on both <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> trials <b>and</b> showed the properties expected of an ERP measure of conflict detection on correct trials: (1) It was enhanced for low-frequency stimuli, irrespective of whether these stimuli were associated with generating or suppressing a response, and (2) it was localized to the anterior cingulate cortex [...] ...|$|R

We analyze offline the anticipation related SCPs recorded from 11 subjects over two days in a variation of the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) paradigm with <b>Go</b> <b>and</b> <b>No-go</b> conditions in an assistive technology framework. The results suggest that widely used spatial filters such as Common Average Referencing (CAR) and Laplacian are sub-optimal for the single trial analysis of SCPs. We show that a spatial smoothing filter (SSF), which in combination with CAR enhances the spatially distributed SCP while attenuating high frequency spatial noise. We report, first, that a narrow band filter in the range [0. 1 1] Hz captures anticipation related SCP better and effectively reduces ISOs. Second, the SSF in combination with CAR outperforms CARalone and Laplacian spatial filters. Third, we compare linear and quadratic classifiers calculated using optimally filtered Cz electrode potentials and report that the best methods resulted in single trial classification accuracies of 83 ± 4 %, where classifiers were trained on day 1 and tested using data from day 2, to ensure generalization capabilities across days (1 - 7 days).

40|$|Computer-based {{assessment}} of many cognitive processes (eg, anticipatory and response readiness processes) requires {{the use of}} invariant stimulus display times (SDT) and intertrial intervals (ITI). Although designs with invariant SDTs and ITIs have been used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research, such designs are problematic for fMRI studies because of collinearity issues. This study examined regressor modulation with trial-level reaction times (RT) as a method for improving signal detection in a go / no-go task with invariant SDTs and ITIs. The effects of modulating the go regressor were evaluated with respect to the detection of BOLD signal-change for the no-go condition. BOLD signal-change to no-go stimuli was examined when the go regressor was based on a (a) canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF), (b) RT-based amplitude-modulated (AM) HRF, and (c) RT-based amplitude and duration modulated (A&DM) HRF. Reaction time–based modulation reduced the collinearity between the <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> regressors, with A&DM producing the greatest reductions in correlations between the regressors, and greater reductions in the correlations between regressors were associated with longer mean RTs and greater RT variability. Reaction time–based modulation increased statistical power for detecting group-level no-go BOLD signal-change across a broad set of brain regions. The findings show the efficacy of using regressor modulation to increase power in detecting BOLD signal-change in fMRI studies in which circumstances dictate the use of temporally invariant stimulus presentations...|$|R

Method Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in male participants receiving either a moderate dose of alcohol (0. 65 g/kg alcohol; n 032) or a non-alcoholic placebo beverage (n 032) while performing an emotional Go/No-Go task that required response execution (Go trials) to pictures of a "target" emotional facial expression (angry, happy, neutral) <b>and</b> response inhibition (<b>No-Go</b> trials) to a different "nontarget" expression. Results Overall, N 200 and P 300 amplitudes were more enhanced during No-Go than Go trials. Interestingly, alcoholintoxicated individuals displayed larger No-Go N 200 amplitudes across all emotional conditions than controls, accompanied by decreased task performance (i. e., more errors), particularly in response to angry faces. P 300 amplitude in the alcohol group was significantly reduced for both <b>Go</b> <b>and</b> <b>No-Go</b> trials, but only following angry and happy emotional expressions. Conclusions These results suggest that alcohol-intoxicated individuals need to effortfully activate more cognitive resources during the early inhibition process in order to regulate a response than controls. Moreover, alcohol affected the emotional modulation of both response inhibition and execution in the later stages of cognitive control. Alcohol dampened emotional responsiveness, which may restrict the availability of attentional resources for cognitive control. Yet, these findings may underlie the lack of control in alcohol-intoxicated individuals when faced with emotionally or socially challenging situations...|$|R

Typically, performance decreases with increasing delay duration, indicating that working memory fades across a delay. However, no such performance decrease has been found when the sample cues exist of present vs. absent stimuli, suggesting that pigeons do not rely on working memory, but seem to respond by default in those trials. We trained 3 pigeons in a DGNG task and found a similar default response pattern: The diverging slopes of the retention functions on correct <b>Go</b> <b>and</b> <b>No-Go</b> trials suggested that pigeons by default omitted their response following No-Go stimuli, but actively retained task-relevant information across the delay for successful responses on Go trials. We conducted single-cell recordings in the avian nidopallium caudolaterale, a structure comparable to the mammalian prefrontal cortex. On Go trials, many neurons displayed sustained elevated activity during the delay preceding the response, replicating previous findings and suggesting that task-relevant information was neurally represented and maintained across the delay. However, the same units did not show enhanced delay activity preceding correct response suppressions in No-Go trials. This activation-inactivation pattern presumably constitutes a neural correlate of the default response strategy observed in the DGNG task...|$|R

Objective. Stress-reducing therapies help maintain cognitive performance during stress. Aromatherapy is popular for stress reduction, but its effectiveness and mechanism are unclear. This study examined stress-reducing effects of aromatherapy on cognitive function using the go/no-go (GNG) task performance and event related potentials (ERP) components sensitive to stress. The study also assessed the importance of expectancy in aromatherapy actions. Methods. 81 adults were randomized to 3 aroma groups (active experimental, detectable, and undetectable placebo) and 2 prime subgroups (prime suggesting stress-reducing aroma effects or no-prime). GNG performance, ERPs, subjective expected aroma effects, and stress ratings were assessed at baseline and poststress. Results. No specific aroma effects on stress or cognition were observed. However, regardless of experienced aroma, people receiving a prime displayed faster poststress median reaction times than those receiving no prime. A significant interaction for N 200 amplitude indicated divergent ERP patterns between baseline <b>and</b> poststress for <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> stimuli depending on the prime subgroup. Furthermore, trends for beneficial prime effects were shown on poststress no-go N 200 /P 300 latencies and N 200 amplitude. Conclusion. While there were no aroma-specific effects on stress or cognition, these results highlight the role of expectancy for poststress response inhibition and attention. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tested the}} postulation that {{change in the}} ability to {{modulate}} corticospinal excitability and inhibitory processes underlie age-related differences in response preparation and generation during tasks requiring either rapid execution of a motor action or actively withholding that same action. Younger (n = 13, mean age = 26. 0 years) and older adults (n = 13, mean age = 65. 5 years) performed an RT task in which a warning signal (WS) was followed by an imperative signal (IS) to which participants were required to respond with a rapid flexion of the right thumb (go condition) or withhold their response (no-go condition). We explored the neural correlates of response preparation, generation, and inhibition using single- and paired-pulse TMS, which was administered at various times between WS and IS (response preparation phase) and between IS and onset of response-related muscle activity in the right thumb (response generation phase). Both groups exhibited increases in motor-evoked potential amplitudes (relative to WS onset) during response generation; however, this increase began earlier and was more pronounced for the younger adults in the go condition. Moreover, younger adults showed a general decrease in short-interval intracortical inhibition during response preparation in both the <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> conditions, which was not observed in older adults. Importantly, correlation analysis suggested that for older adults the task-related increases of corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition were associated with faster RT. We propose that the declined ability to functionally modulate corticospinal activity with advancing age may underlie response slowing in older adults...|$|R
40|$|Stimuli that {{elicit a}} prepotent but {{incorrect}} response are {{typically associated with}} an enhanced electrophysiological N 2 that is thought to index the operation of a control process such as inhibition or conflict detection. However, recent studies reporting {{the absence of the}} N 2 modulation in go/no-go tasks involving auditory stimuli challenge this view: It is not clear why inhibition or conflict detection should be sensitive to the modality of the stimulus. Here we present electrophysiological data from a go/no-go task suggesting that the relative size of the N 2 modulation in visual and auditory tasks depends on the perceptual overlap between the <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>no-go</b> stimuli. Stimuli that looked similar but sounded different were associated with a typical visual N 2 modulation and the absence of an auditory N 2 modulation, consistent with previous findings. However, when we increased the perceptual overlap between the auditory stimuli, a large no-go N 2 was observed. These findings are discussed in terms of existing hypotheses of the N 2, and clarify why previous studies have not found an N 2 modulation in auditory go/no-go tasks. Descriptors: No-go, Stimulus modality, Response conflict, N 2, Monitoring, Inhibition There has been increasing interest in electrophysiological correlates of cognitive control processes, the high-level processes that monitor and regulate basic information processing. An important example concerns the N 2, a negative event-related brain potential (ERP) component with a frontocentral scalp distribution that peaks around 300 ms after stimulus presenta-tion. TheN 2 is often enhanced under conditions {{in which there is a}} tendency to make a prepotent but incorrect response (e. g. ...|$|R
50|$|Go/no-go gauges play an {{integral}} part in setting the correct headspace during gunsmithing. In order for the chamber to be in-spec, the bolt must close without resistance on the go gauge, but it must not close completely on the <b>no-go</b> <b>gauge.</b> In addition, there is usually a third gauge called FIELD that is slightly larger than the <b>no-go</b> <b>gauge.</b> Since bolt <b>and</b> chamber lugs eventually stretch with use, the bolt may start to close on the <b>no-go</b> <b>gauge.</b> If the bolt also closes fully on the field gauge, such a gun is considered unsafe due to high risk of shell case rupture if the cartridges length happens {{to be on the}} shorter end of the spec.|$|R
