During most of his section of the song, Kelly sings of shining, drinking and two-stepping in a club, and he promises to kiss any place on Mariah's body she wants: [...] "Girl, if you let me, I'm gonna touch it / But if I touch it, I'm gonna wanna hit it." [...] Later, he mimics Carey's bridge: [...] "If some honies up <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>that</b> want me to touch her body / Touch it / Let me hear you say, 'I-i-i-i do.'" [...] According to Kelly, the remix is unofficial, and his lyrics are freestyle rap.|$|E

2500|$|Melville's {{mastering}} of Shakespeare, Matthiessen finds, supplied {{him with}} verbal resources that {{enabled him to}} create dramatic language through three essential techniques. First, the use of verbs of action creates a sense of movement and meaning. The effective tension caused by the contrast of [...] "thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds" [...] and [...] "there's that <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>that</b> still remains indifferent" [...] in [...] "The Candles" [...] (Ch. 119) makes the last clause lead to a [...] "compulsion to strike the breast," [...] which suggests [...] "how thoroughly the drama has come to inhere in the words;" [...] Second, Melville {{took advantage of the}} Shakespearean energy of verbal compounds, as in [...] "full-freighted". Third, Melville employed the device of making one part of speech act as another - for example, 'earthquake' as an adjective, or turning an adjective into a noun, as in [...] "placeless".|$|E

AbsolutePunk.net reviewer Jason Tate awarded the album a 99% rating and praised the band's writing, saying [...] "By the second song it is perceptible that the band has a grasp on crafting songs {{that do not}} follow a formula, or insult the listener by maintaining a hold on one particular style or sound." [...] Allmusic's Corey Apar also gave the album a glowing review, writing [...] "...Is a Real Boy comes off as an impressively well-done, multifaceted effort that deserves multiple spins and makes Say Anything truly a band to watch." [...] Punk News noted that the album seems to be commenting in the over-use of irony in the emo scene, writing [...] "Yes, this album is highly ironic in that it's critical of the scene it's categorized in and it's an album about a band and there are songs <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>that</b> are about songs. But, Bemis's overall quirkiness makes it work." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote that, [...] "Say Anything, an emo act based in L.A., has a new disc that proves that the genre can be artful and intriguing."

6000|$|He {{looked at}} his watch. In half an hour the doctor would be back. He must decide! If against the {{operation}} and she died, how face her mother and the doctor afterwards? How face his own conscience? It was his child that she was having. If for the operation--then he condemned them both to childlessness. And for what else had he married her but to have a lawful heir? And his father--at death's door, waiting for the news! 'It's cruel!' he thought; 'I ought never {{to have such a}} thing to settle! It's cruel!' He turned towards the house. Some deep, simple way of deciding! He took out a coin, and put it back. If he spun it, he knew he would not abide by what came up!

60|$|Aughacashel is a {{mountain}} {{on the eastern}} side of Loch Allen, near the borders of the County Cavan--uncultivated and rocky at the top, but nevertheless inhabited, and studded with many miserably poor cabins, till within {{about a quarter of a}} mile of the summit. The owners of these cabins, with great labour, have contrived to obtain wretchedly poor crops of potatoes from the barren soil immediately round their cabins. To their agricultural pursuits many joined the more profitable but hazardous business of making potheen, and they were generally speaking, a lawless, reckless set of people--paying, some little, and others no rent, and living without the common blessings or restraints of civilization: no road, or sign of a road, came within some miles of them; Drumshambo, the nearest village, was seven or eight miles distant from them; and although they knew that neither the barrenness of their locality, nor the want of means of approach would altogether secure them from the unwelcome visits of the Revenue police or the Constabulary, still they felt sure that neither of these inimical forces could come into their immediate neighbourhood, without their making themselves aware of their approach, in time to guard against any injury which they might do them, either by removing all vestiges of their trade, or by sending those who were in fear of being taken up, into the more inaccessible portions of the mountain. On the western side of Aughacashel, immediately over Loch Allen, and about half way between the lowlands and the summit, a kind of rude limekiln had been made, apparently for the purpose of burning lime for the neighbouring land; but the very poor state of the rocky ground about, which gave signs of but little industry, afforded evidence that the limekiln had not added much to the agricultural wealth of the country. It was now at any rate made use of for other purposes, for it was <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>that</b> Joe Reynolds at present usually worked his still. There were only two cabins immediately close to it; one of which was occupied by a very old man and his daughter, but in which Corney Dolan and Reynolds resided, when they were away from Drumleesh; and the other belonged to another partner in the business, who considered himself the owner of the limekiln, and the head of the party concerned in it. This man's name was Daniel Kennedy, and to the reckless, desperate contempt of authority and hatred of those who exercised it, which characterized Reynolds, he added a cruelty of disposition, and a love of wickedness, from which the other was much more free.|$|E
