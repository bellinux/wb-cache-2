5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled {{his face with a}} handkerchief to hide <b>his</b> <b>tears</b> and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|Newman, who {{was only}} a few years younger than Keats and Shelley, was born into the Romantic generation, when Englishmen still wept in moments of emotion. But he lived on into the age of the stiff upper lip, with the result that later generations, hearing of <b>his</b> <b>tears</b> on a visit to his mother's grave or at the {{funerals}} of old friends such as Henry Wilberforce, thought him not only sensitive but melancholy.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of October 6, 1998, Shepard met Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyoming; the three men were in their early twenties. McKinney and Henderson decided to give Shepard a ride home. They {{subsequently}} drove the car to a remote, rural area, and proceeded to rob, pistol-whip, and torture Shepard, tie him to a fence, and leave him to die. Media reports often contained the graphic account of the pistol-whipping and his fractured skull. It was reported that Shepard was beaten so brutally that his face was completely covered in blood, except {{where it had been}} partially washed clean by <b>his</b> <b>tears.</b> Both of the assailants' girlfriends testified that neither McKinney nor Henderson was under the influence of drugs or alcohol {{at the time of the}} attack.

25|$|Unhappy in school, Napoleon {{writes about}} his {{difficulties}} {{in a letter}} to his family. A bully reports to a monk that Napoleon is hiding letters in his bed, and the monk tears the letter to pieces. Angry, Napoleon goes to visit the attic quarters of his friend Fleuri, a place of refuge where Napoleon keeps his captive bird, a young eagle that was sent to him from Corsica by an uncle. Napoleon tenderly pets the eagle's head, then leaves to fetch water for the bird. The two bullies take this opportunity to set the bird free. Napoleon finds the bird gone and runs to the dormitory to demand the culprit show himself. None of the boys admits to the deed. Napoleon exclaims that they are all guilty, and begins to fight them all, jumping from bed to bed. In the clash, pillows are split and feathers fly through the air as the Minim Fathers work to restore order. They collar Napoleon and throw him outside in the snow. Napoleon cries to himself on the limber of a cannon, then he looks up to see the young eagle in a tree. He calls to the eagle which flies down to the cannon barrel. Napoleon caresses the eagle and smiles through <b>his</b> <b>tears.</b>|$|E
25|$|The real {{content of}} the midrash is a haggadic {{treatment}} of Deut. xxxi. 14 et seq., supplemented by an exegesis of Deut. iii. 23 et seq., and is filled with somewhat tedious dialogues between God and Moses, who is represented as unwilling to die. All <b>his</b> <b>tears</b> and entreaties were in vain, however; for God commanded all the princes of heaven to close the gates of prayer. In {{the last days of}} his life, until the 7th of Adar, Moses interpreted the Torah to Israel, and on the day of his death, according to R. Ḥelbo, he wrote thirteen Torahs, of which twelve were for the twelve tribes, and the best was for the Ark of the Covenant (ib. xxxi. 24 et seq.; comp. Pesiḳ. p.197a; Deut. R., Wayelek, end.; Midr. Teh. on Ps. xc.); some say that the angel Gabriel descended, and took the Torah from the hands of Moses, bearing it through each heaven to show the piety of its scribe, and that the souls of the holy read from this Torah on Mondays and Thursdays and on festivals. This is followed by a long section beginning with R. Josiah's account of the honors which Moses rendered Joshua, and the service which he did him in the last days of his life. Especially noteworthy here is the poetic prayer of Joshua beginning עורו רנו שמי השמים העליונים.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{character}} of Tibullus the historical man is unclear, {{the character}} of his poetic persona is reflected in his works. He was an amiable man of generous impulses and unselfish disposition, loyal to his friends to the verge of self-sacrifice (as is shown by his leaving Delia to accompany Messalla to Asia), and apparently constant to his mistresses. His tenderness towards them is enhanced by a refinement and delicacy which are rare among the ancients. When treated cruelly by his love, he does not invoke curses upon her head. Instead he goes to her little sister’s grave, hung so often with his garlands and wet with <b>his</b> <b>tears,</b> to bemoan his fate. His ideal is a quiet retirement {{in the country with}} the loved one at his side. He has no ambition and not even a poet's yearning for immortality. In an age of crude materialism and gross superstition, he was religious in the old Roman way. His clear, finished and yet unaffected style made him a great favourite and placed him, in the judgment of Quintilian, ahead of other elegiac writers. For natural grace and tenderness, for exquisiteness of feeling and expression, he stands alone. He rarely overloads his lines with Alexandrian learning. However, his range is limited. Tibullus is smoother and more musical, but liable to become monotonous; Propertius, with occasional harshnesses, is more vigorous and varied. In many of Tibullus's poems a symmetrical composition can be traced.|$|E

Degenkolb described it as [...] "the best day in [...] cycling career", as it was his first victory in one of the cycling monuments (he won a second in April in the Paris–Roubaix).|$|E
500|$|When Humphreys {{returned}} to pre-season {{training for the}} following season, he was playfully teased over his penalty miss.

Humphreys started the 2002–03 season with a goal against Carlisle on {{the opening day of}} the season. Throughout the course of the season, Humphreys would be played prominently as a left winger. Humphreys finished the season as an ever-present in the Hartlepool squad, adding 11 goals to his name in the process and helped Hartlepool gain promotion to the Second Division.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910.

He is much impressed with the parade of firemen he sees in his hometown, so much so in fact that he basely deserts his sister on the streets to follow the 'smoke eaters.' But Willie is only a little boy, and despite his enthusiasm, he is soon weary and footsore. His plight, added to <b>his</b> <b>tears,</b> attracts {{the attention of a}} kindly fireman who is driving with his engine back to quarters. The lad's discomfort is soon forgotten, for the fireman gives him a ride back to the engine house. There Willie gravely applies to the captain for a position on the uniformed force, and is jokingly accepted. But he does not see the humor in it and follows the other men to the bunkroom, where he takes part in their sports." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{illustration}} of Peter {{standing by the}} locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident {{in the moment of}} the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, [...] "Peter began to cry" [...] is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter’s emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but <b>his</b> <b>tears,</b> his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader’s identification with him. Here, verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony. Scott suggests Potter’s tale has encouraged many generations of children to [...] "self-indulgence, disobedience, transgression of social boundaries and ethics, and assertion of their wild, unpredictable nature against the constrictions of civilized living." ...|$|E

Ram Charan called Manam a film that induces [...] "Love, joy, passion, hatred, excitement and almost every feeling you can imagine and more".

His blood boiling with anger, Tom harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before slamming the door.
