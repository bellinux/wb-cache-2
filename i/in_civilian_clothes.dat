5|$|Abu Nidal's {{most infamous}} {{operation}} was the 1985 {{attack on the}} Rome and Vienna airports. On 27 December, at 08:15 GMT, four gunmen opened fire on the El Al ticket counter at the Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport in Rome, killing 16 and wounding 99. In Vienna International Airport a few minutes later, three men threw hand grenades at passengers waiting to check into a flight to Tel Aviv, killing four and wounding 39. According to Seale, the gunmen had been told the people <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> at the check-in counter were Israeli pilots returning from a training mission.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} faced by the ZNG included a shortage of trained officers, inadequate troop training, a shortage of weapons and especially a shortage of ammunition. Mobilisation proved particularly successful, however, and troops were plentiful; in Zagreb, approximately 80 percent of those called up in September and October reported for service. The ZNG were short of uniforms; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms, while the remainder fought <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes.</b> The ZNG also relied on the civilian infrastructure for food, fuel and medical care.|$|E
5|$|By April 1945, the Allied advance into Germany {{threatened}} Hinton's POW camp. The Germans evacuated {{the camp}} but Hinton, feigning sickness, remained behind. Once the guards had left, {{he was able}} to find keys to the gates and let himself out. He soon made contact with soldiers of the United States 6th Armoured Division. Dressed <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes,</b> he was initially treated with suspicion but soon convinced the Americans of his identity. He borrowed an American uniform and went forward to the frontline with the 44th Infantry Division and assisted in the capture of three villages and rounding up of German POWs. Senior American officers soon found out about Hinton's presence with their troops and sent him to England, where he arrived on 12 April 1945.|$|E
50|$|<b>Civilian</b> <b>Clothes</b> is a {{surviving}} 1920 American silent comedy film {{produced by}} Famous Players-Lasky and distributed by Paramount Pictures.

5|$|In August 1943, Smith and Strong flew to Lisbon via Gibraltar <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes,</b> {{where they}} met with Generale di Brigata Giuseppe Castellano at the British embassy. While Castellano had hoped to arrange terms for Italy to join the United Nations against Nazi Germany, Smith was {{empowered}} to draw up an armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, but {{he was unable to}} negotiate political matters. On September 3, Smith and Castellano signed the agreed-upon text on behalf of Eisenhower and Pietro Badoglio, respectively, in a simple ceremony beneath an olive tree at Cassibile, Sicily. In October, Smith traveled to Washington for two weeks to represent Eisenhower in a series of meetings, including one with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park, New York, on 10 October.|$|E

5|$|Ole Ewé, {{a former}} member of BOPA—another group in the Danish {{resistance}} movement—disagreed with the description of the attempt to kill the Gestapo leader Hoffman on the Roskildevej road. In the film, the car had Nazi flags, and a soldier and his son are killed by resistance gunfire. Ewé said that on that day he and other BOPA members were enlisted to kill Arno Oskar Hammeken, a Gestapo informer. Flammen, who also received tips about the informer's whereabouts, appeared there and shot up the car. Ewé said that the man in the car was <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> and there were no Nazi flags on the car.|$|E
50|$|Uniforms {{were not}} {{available}} at the outset so {{the men of the}} B Specials went on duty <b>in</b> their <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> wearing an armband to signify they were Specials. Uniforms did not become available until 1922. Uniforms took the same pattern as RIC/RUC dress with high collared tunics. Badges of rank were displayed on the right forearm of the jacket.|$|R
5000|$|The attackers {{then used}} a {{sledgehammer}} {{to break into}} the house next door, where they found Joseph Walsh (39) in bed with his seven-year-old son Michael and his two-year-old daughter Bridget. Joseph Walsh was bludgeoned to death with the sledgehammer while Michael Walsh was shot and died from his wounds the next day. Another son, Frank (14), was shot in the thigh but survived. A local man, George Murray, described the aftermath of the attack: [...] "One of the three policemen had revolvers and the other two had guns. These men went out. Immediately after, seven armed men - five in police uniform and two <b>in</b> <b>civilians</b> <b>clothes</b> - entered". Later that evening, another Catholic, John Mallon (60), was shot dead in Skegoneill Avenue.|$|R
50|$|On 19 September 2005, two {{undercover}} British SAS soldiers disguised <b>in</b> Arab <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> and headdresses {{opened fire}} on Iraqi police officers after having been stopped at a roadblock, killing at least one. After the two soldiers were arrested, the British Army raided the jail they were being held in to rescue them, killing several people from among their nominal allies - the Iraqi security forces.|$|R
5|$|On 25 April 40 Marines {{from the}} 9th MAB on the USS Hancock were flown in by Air America {{helicopters}} <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> to the DAO compound {{to augment the}} 18 Marine Security Guards assigned to defend the Embassy; an additional six Marines were assigned to protect Ambassador Martin. Martin had remained optimistic that a negotiated settlement could be reached whereby the US {{would not have to}} pull out of South Vietnam and, in an effort to avert defeatism and panic he instructed Major James Kean, Commanding Officer of the Marine Security Guard Battalion and Ground Support Force Commander United States Embassy Compound, that he could begin to remove the tamarind tree and other trees and shrubbery which prevented the use of the Embassy parking lot as a helicopter landing zone.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, Khánh {{flew from}} Huế to Saigon dressed <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> on a {{commercial}} airliner. He covered for his ruse by claiming that he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating {{that he had come}} for a dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps earlier in the day with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E
5|$|Robert Fletcher, costume {{designer}} {{for the previous}} Star Trek films, was responsible for The Search for Spocks wardrobe. Fletcher's job was to sketch outfits, choose the necessary fabrics, and complete the fittings for principal characters. He collaborated with costumer Jim Linn, who clothed extras and managed the logistics of cleaning, repairing, and tracking costumes. Most of the Starfleet uniforms had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes.</b> Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to be representative of a Vulcan's level of consciousness. The costumer {{had the advantage of}} access to Paramount's store rooms, which contained literal tons of expensive fabrics.|$|E

50|$|The Innsbruck-Reichenau {{camp was}} located in western Austria and was an {{offshoot}} of the Dachau camp. It was surrounded by an electric fence, there was separation between men and women and the inmates were all forced to work. Unlike the other prisoners, the Jews of Libya were allowed to stay <b>in</b> their <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes.</b> The SS guards were cruel to the Jews- they were banned from any religious expression or worship, and punishment such as flogging, imprisonment and death by shooting were common.|$|R
50|$|Heinrich Himmler was {{a senior}} member of the Nazi Party and is most well known as the Reichsfuhrer-SS; as a result, most of Himmler's attire is {{connected}} to his SS uniform. In addition to being Reichsführer-SS and a Reichsleiter, towards the end of World War II he held numerous high level positions including Commander of the Replacement Home Army and General Plenipotentiary for the entire Reich's administration (Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung). Himmler however, never chose to wear a Nazi Party uniform and all photographs of him are <b>in</b> either <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> or <b>in</b> his SS uniform.|$|R
5|$|The Guides were disbanded in January 1862 {{after the}} Confederate {{government}} of Kentucky fled Bowling Green, as Hines {{did not want}} to fight anywhere except in Kentucky. He traveled to Richmond, Virginia, and missed the Battle of Shiloh as a result. In April, he decided to join Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan, and he re-enlisted in the army as a private in the 9th Kentucky Cavalry in May 1862. Morgan recognized Hines' talents and commissioned him as a captain on June 10, 1862. Afterward, Hines {{spent most of his time}} engaged in secret missions in his beloved Kentucky. Dressed <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes,</b> he usually operated alone to avoid drawing attention to himself, not wanting to be executed as a spy.|$|E
5|$|The three Scottish soldiers' killings was an {{incident}} {{that took place in}} Northern Ireland during the Troubles. It happened on 10 March 1971, when the Provisional Irish Republican Army shot dead three unarmed British Army soldiers of the 1st Battalion, Royal Highland Fusiliers. Two of the three were teenage brothers; all three were from Scotland. They were killed off-duty and <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes,</b> having been lured from a city-centre bar in Belfast, driven to a remote location and shot whilst relieving themselves by the roadside. Three British soldiers had been killed prior to this event; all had been on duty and killed during rioting.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Trenggalek, Sudirman and {{his group}} were stopped by TNI {{soldiers}} belonging to 102Battalion. These soldiers, who were told that Sudirman– who was <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> and unrecognised by the troops holding them– was a prisoner, refused to allow the group to pass; they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, things which may have belonged to spies. When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men were right to guard their areas diligently, Fanani called a post in Kediri and ordered that a car be sent {{to pick up the}} general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; as they left the city on 24December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri.|$|E
50|$|Wellesley has {{no money}} to pay his men; however, he has {{arranged}} for a loan from the Rothschild family. James Rothschild has set out from Vienna with a badly needed bank draft, but is overdue. Sharpe, his men, and a company under Major Dunnett (Julian Fellowes) are sent out to search for him. While Sharpe and his men are out scouting the terrain, the company is surprised and wiped out by enemy cavalry led by Colonel de L'Eclin (Malcolm Jamieson) and a man <b>in</b> dark <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> (Anthony Hyde), with only Perkins and a gravely wounded Captain Murray as survivors.|$|R
60|$|As, {{the next}} evening, Walter {{heard that there}} was news that William's troops had not yet moved from the Boyne, he {{thought that it was}} safe to take the direct road through Dublin. He had laid aside his uniform, on {{reaching}} home, and in the morning started <b>in</b> his <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes,</b> with the uniform in the valise, strapped behind the saddle. He carried his sword, as usual, for almost all gentlemen at that time rode armed, and this would therefore excite neither comment nor attention. He carried also a brace of pistols, in a belt underneath his coat.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in 1914, the huge number of volunteers answering the appeal of Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, were formed into a New Army. The problem of providing uniforms for these recruits was acute and many trained <b>in</b> their <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> for weeks. A highly simplified version of Service Dress was produced for them, without breast pockets, shoulder straps and other refinements. They were dark blue in colour, because the original khaki dye had been produced in Germany before the war and it had proved difficult to acquire sufficient from alternative sources. This colour {{gave rise to the}} popular name for the uniform; [...] "Kitchener's Blues". Around 500,000 sets of these uniforms were produced and worn during basic training.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} mobilization, the Life Guards arrived at their {{assigned}} position near the Belgian border. Strachwitz and his platoon volunteered for a mounted, long-distance reconnaissance patrol, which would penetrate far behind Belgian lines. His orders were to gather intelligence on rail and communications connections and potentially disturb them, {{as well as}} report on the war preparations being made by their opponents. If the situation allowed, he was to destroy railway and telephone connections and to derail trains, causing as much havoc as possible. His patrol ran into many obstacles and they were constantly {{on the verge of}} being detected by either British or French forces. Their objective was the Paris–Limoges–Bordeaux train track. Strachwitz dispatched a messenger, who broke through to the German lines and delivered the intelligence they had gathered. The patrol blew up the signal box at the Fontainebleau railway station, and tried to force their way through to presumed German troops at the Marne near Châlons. However, the French forces were too strong and they were unable to get through. After six weeks behind the lines their rations were depleted and they had to resort to stealing or begging. Strachwitz then decided to head for Switzerland, hoping that the French–Swiss border was not as heavily protected. After a brief skirmish with French forces, one of Strachwitz's men was seriously wounded, which forced them to seek medical attention. During many weeks of outdoor living their uniforms had deteriorated, so Strachwitz took that opportunity to buy new clothes for his men. Their progress was slowed by the wounded man, and the group was caught <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes</b> by French forces.|$|E

50|$|In German-occupied Paris, an {{announcer}} reports {{during a}} blackout that the Second Front has begun, with British forces invading the Continent, and that Royal Air Force bombers {{have been shot}} down. Five downed pilots split up and {{make their way to}} Paris to try to get help in returning to England. On the way, they break into a tavern <b>in</b> search of <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes.</b> When a German soldier shows up for a drink, Squadron Leader Paul Lavallier (Paul Henreid), a member of the Free French, knocks him out and takes his money.|$|R
60|$|When {{they arrived}} {{within a few}} miles of Newcastle they left the main road and struck across country, their object being to come down upon the road running north from Carlisle, for they thought it likely that parties of General Wade's troops would be {{scattered}} far over the country north of Newcastle. At a farm house they succeeded <b>in</b> buying some <b>civilian</b> <b>clothes,</b> giving out that they were deserters, and as they were willing to pay well, the farmer, who had no goodwill towards the Hanoverians, had no difficulty in parting with two of his best suits.|$|R
5000|$|The {{invasion}} was a {{quick and}} decisive operation encountering major resistance, though not what the U.S., British and other forces expected. The Iraqi regime had prepared to fight both a conventional and irregular war at the same time, conceding territory when faced with superior conventional forces, largely armored, but launching smaller scale attacks in the rear using fighters dressed <b>in</b> <b>civilian</b> and paramilitary <b>clothes.</b> Since the initiation {{of the war in}} Iraq, numerous programs were created to [...] "enhance psychological resilience and prevent psychological morbidity in troops." ...|$|R
