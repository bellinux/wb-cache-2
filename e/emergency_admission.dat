50|$|A patient needing {{specialist}} care at {{a hospital}} or clinic, will be informed by the GP of the hospitals {{where they can get}} their treatment. This choice usually includes public and private hospitals. The NHS will pay for treatment in a private setting if the hospital meets the cost and service criteria that NHS hospitals adhere to. Otherwise opting for a private hospital makes the patient liable for private hospital fees. Because the private sector often has higher costs, most people choose to be treated for free in an NHS hospital. If the GP judges the case to be extremely urgent, the doctor may by-pass the normal booking system and arrange an <b>emergency</b> <b>admission.</b> The median wait time for a consultant led first appointment in English hospitals is a little over 3 weeks. Patients can be seen by the hospital as out-patients or in-patients, with the latter involving overnight stay. The speed of in-patient admission is based on medical need and time waiting with more urgent cases faster though all cases will be dealt with eventually. Only about one third of hospital admissions are from a waiting list. For those not admitted immediately, the median wait time for in-patient treatment in English hospitals is a little under 6 weeks. Trusts are working towards an 18-week guarantee that means that the hospital must complete all tests and start treatment within 18 weeks of the date of the referral from the GP. Some hospitals are introducing just in time workflow analysis borrowed from manufacturing industry to speed up the processes within the system and improve efficiencies.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{high volume}} of {{emergency}} admissions to hospital {{is a challenge}} for health systems internationally. Patients with lung cancer and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are frequently admitted to hospital as emergency cases. While the frequency of <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> has been investigated, few studies report patient experiences, particularly in relation to the decision-making process prior to <b>emergency</b> <b>admission.</b> We sought to explore patient and carer experiences and those of their healthcare professionals in the period leading up to <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> to hospital. Setting: 3 UK hospitals located in different urban and rural settings. Design: Qualitative critical incident study. Participants: 24 patients with advanced lung cancer and 15 with advanced COPD admitted to hospital as emergencies, 20 of their carers and 50 of the health professionals involved in the patients' care. Results: The analysis of patient, carer and professionals' interviews revealed a detailed picture of the complex processes involved leading to <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> to hospital. 3 phases were apparent in this period: self-management of deteriorating symptoms, negotiated decision-making and letting go. These were dynamic processes, characterised by an often rapidly changing clinical condition, uncertainty and anxiety. Patients considered their options drawing on experience, current and earlier advice. Patients tried to avoid admission, reluctantly accepting it, albeit often with a sense of relief, as anxiety increased with worsening symptoms. Conclusions: Patients with advanced respiratory illness, and their carers, try to avoid <b>emergency</b> <b>admission,</b> and use logical and complex decision-making before reluctantly accepting it. Clinicians and policy-makers need to understand this complex process when considering how to reduce emergency hospital admissions rather than focusing on identifying and labelling admissions as 'inappropriate'...|$|E
40|$|Background: Access {{to general}} {{practices}} {{may be an}} important determinant of <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> for asthma, as early treatment of exacerbations has been shown to prevent deterioration. Aim: To determine whether access to primary care is associated with <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> for asthma. Design and Setting: Cross-sectional analysis of data from English practices in 2010 / 11. Method: Negative binomial regression was used to explore the associations between <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> for asthma and seven measures of patient-reported access to general practice services taken from GP Patient Survey, controlled for the characteristics of practice populations. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for each association. Results: 7806 (95 %) of practices had data for all variables. There were 3, 134, 106 patients with asthma, and there were 55, 570 <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> with asthma. Admission rates were lower in practices with a higher composite access score (adjusted IRR for 10 % change in variable 0. 679 (95 %CI 0. 665 to 0. 708)). Admissions were higher in those practices with higher proportions of the practice population who were white, and in practices with lower performance in the Quality and Outcomes Framework indicator ‘asthma review in past 15 months’ (Asthma 6). Assuming these associations were causal, a higher access score of 10 % was associated with a decrease of 17, 837 admissions per year for these practices. Conclusion: Practices with higher patient reported access had lower rates of <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> for asthma. Policy makers should consider improving access to primary care as one potential way to help prevent <b>emergency</b> hospital <b>admissions</b> for asthma...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether differences between emergency hospital admission rates for breathing difficulty, feverish illness and diarrhoea are associated with population-level measures of multiple deprivation and child well-being, and whether there is variation by length of stay and age. Methods Analysis of hospital episode statistics and secondary analysis of Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2007 and Local Index of Child Well-being (CWI) 2009 in ten adjacent PCTs in North West England. The outcome measure for each PCT was the <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> rate to hospital for breathing difficulty, feverish illness and diarrhoea.

40|$|Objective. To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} an evidence-based tool for predicting {{the likelihood of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> to hospital of older people aged 75 years and over in the UK. Methods. Prospective cohort study of older people registered with 17 general practices within Halton Primary Care Trust in the north-west of England. A questionnaire with 20 items was sent to older people aged 75 years. Items {{for inclusion in the}} questionnaire were selected from information gleaned from published literature and a pilot study. The primary outcome measurement was an <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> to hospital within 12 months of completing the questionnaire. A logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify those items which predicted <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> to hospital. A scoring system was devised to identify those at low, moderate, high and very high risk of admission, using the items identified in the predictive modelling process. Results. In total, 83 % (3032) returned the questionnaire. A simple, six-item tool was developed and validated—the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Admission</b> Risk Likelihood Index (EARLI). The items included in the tool are as follows: do you have heart problems? [odds ratio (OR) 1. 40, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 15 – 1. 72]; do you have leg ulcers? (OR 1. 46, 95 % CI 1. 04 – 2. 04); can you go out of the house without help? (OR 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 47 – 0. 75); do you have problems with your memory and get confused? (OR 1. 46, 95 % CI 1. 19 – 1. 81); have you been admitted to hospital as an emergency in the last 12 months? (OR 2. 16, CI 1. 72 – 2. 72); and would you say the general state of your health is good? (OR 0. 66, 95 % CI 0. 53 – 0. 82). The tool had high negative predictive value (> 79 %) and identified over 50 % of those at high or very high risk of <b>emergency</b> <b>admission.</b> A very high score (> 20) identified 6 % of older people, 55 % of whom had an <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> in the following 12 months.

The <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> of a patient requires a quick and professional approach. It is important for each nurse to realize that communication with the patient, the doctor {{and other members of the}} medical team is the part of this professional approach. Another essential part is an active search of patient?s current problems. In order to manage this, it is necessary to show the ability to cooperate with the patient, to know, how to proceed in a physical checkup, to be able to describe the deviations from the standard, and last but not least, to be able to communicate with the doctor about the findings. The theoretical part of the thesis involves chapters dealing with holism, holistic philosophy, communication and physical check-up of a patient. Further this part deals with getting the anamnesis, the agreement with the admission to hospital and other formalities that belong to the procedure of admission of a patient. At the end of the theoretical part we characterize the surgical ward and the internal ward and describe abdomen aches and chest pains as typical examples of <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> reasons at these two wards. The objective of this work is to find out whether nurses at these emergency wards (surgical and internal) during the process of admission provide a patient with care that is in compliance with principles of holistic philosophy and also to compare the holistic approach of nurses at the surgical and internal emergency wards. 4 questions were set before the research started. Research question No. 1 : How are biopsychosocial needs of a patient at the <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> saturated? Research question No. 2 : How can the communication of a nurse with a patient at the <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> ward, during the admission procedures, influence the following cooperation of the patient with the medical staff? Research question No. 3 : What does the difference between the holistic care at the surgical and internal ward lie in? Research question No. 4 : How can the circumstances during the <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> of a patient influence a nurse?s respect of patient?s needs? Half-standardized interviews with 3 nurses from the surgical ward and with 3 nurses from the internal ward were used in the research part. Then, a concerned observation of those nurses was carried out, while they were taking care of a patient at the <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> ward. On the grounds of the research results we can assume that the objective of the thesis was met. The objective was to describe different views and approaches of nurses to a patient who is being admitted at the emergency ward. The research results were used to compose an instruction manual called: What nurses at the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Admission</b> Ward should not forget...|$|E
40|$|NRS 432 B. 6075 governs <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> of {{children}} with emotional disturbances to facilities for their protection, and requires a petition for continuance of admission after an <b>emergency</b> <b>admission</b> within five days of the involuntary placement. [1] Based on N. R. C. P. 6 (a), which governs the computing of time for judicial purposes, the Court held that the five day limitation on filing a petition was based on judicial, not calendar, days. The Court granted the State’s petition for a writ of mandamus, directing the district court to vacate its order denying the State’s NRS 432 B petition...|$|E
30|$|A real {{application}} {{focuses on}} estimating central, {{low and high}} quantile regressions for levels of ambulatory sensitive <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> across English GP practices. Practice deprivation is the strongest predictor of such <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions,</b> and the deprivation effect varies by quantile under the second model considered for these data. In particular, using stipulated values for covariates, it was shown that relative risks for all quantiles significantly exceed 1 for the Midlands-East and North, but for the 0.05 quantile, the probabilities that relative risk exceeds 1 in London and the South are zero or inconclusive. Outlier GP practices (in the response space) were also identified.|$|R
40|$|Study objective: UK {{government}} policy mandates {{the introduction of}} ‘intermediate care services’ to reduce <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> to hospital from the population aged 75 years or more. We evaluated one of these initiatives—the Keep Well At Home (KWAH) Project—in a West London Primary Care Trust. Design: KWAH involves a two-phase screening process, including a home visit by a community nurse. We employed cohort methods to determine whether KWAH resulted in fewer <b>emergency</b> attendances and <b>admissions</b> to hospital in the target population, from October 1999 to December 2002. Results: estimated levels of coverage in the two phases of screening were 61 and 32 %, respectively. The project had not maintained records of which additional health and social care services had been delivered following screening. The rates of <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> to hospital in the 9 months before screening were similar in practices that did and did not join the project (rate ratio (RR) = 1. 05; 95 % CI 0. 95 – 1. 17), suggesting absence of volunteer bias. Over the first 37 months of the project, {{there was no significant}} impact on either attendances at Accident & Emergency departments (RR = 1. 02; 95 % CI 0. 97 – 1. 06) or <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> of elderly patients (RR = 0. 98; 95 % CI 0. 93 – 1. 05). Conclusion: the KWAH Project has been ineffective in reducing <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> among the elderly. Significant questions arise in relation to selection of the screening instruments, practicality of achieving higher coverage of the eligible population, and creation of a new postcode lottery...|$|R
30|$|This initial {{feasibility}} study {{has suggested that}} it is feasible to collect retrospective PROMs from patients admitted unexpectedly as emergencies for the two conditions studied {{across a variety of}} types of hospitals in the NHS. The relevance of these findings to other causes of <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions</b> needs to be established. In addition, these findings justify the case for a large, multi-site study that includes clinical information on participants could explore the unresolved concerns about selection bias, particularly those arising from the clinical characteristics of patients. It would also enable estimates of the extent of variation in PROMs between hospitals to determine the usefulness of using PROMs in <b>emergency</b> <b>admissions.</b>|$|R
