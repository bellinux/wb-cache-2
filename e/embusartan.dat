40|$|In the pithed rat model, endogenously {{generated}} angiotensin (Ang) II {{can enhance}} sympathetic neurotransmission by acting on Ang II type 1 (AT 1) receptors that {{are located on}} sympathetic nerve terminals. To compare the inhibitory potency of candesartan, valsartan, eprosartan and <b>embusartan</b> in blocking presynaptically and postsynaptically located AT 1 receptors. To investigate blockade of presynaptic AT 1 receptors, we studied the effect of AT 1 receptor blockade on the sequelae of electrical stimulation of the thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow (0. 25 - 8 Hz). To investigate the interaction between postsynaptic AT 1 blockers and alpha-adrenoceptors, {{the effects of these}} compounds on pressor responses to exogenous noradrenaline were determined. To investigate blockade of postsynaptic AT 1 receptors, we studied the effect of the AT 1 antagonists on dose-response curves elicited by exogenous Ang II. The stimulation-induced increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the Ang II-elicited DBP response were dose-dependently reduced by all AT 1 receptor blockers. Interestingly, the greatest doses of the AT 1 antagonists caused less than maximal reduction in the stimulation-induced increase in DBP, resulting in a U-shaped dose-response relationship. To compare sympathoinhibitory potencies, the doses that, at 2 Hz, reduced the change in DBP by 20 mmHg (ED 20 values, expressed as -log mol/kg) were calculated; they were 5. 50 +/- 0. 12, 5. 77 +/- 0. 10, 6. 32 +/- 0. 12 and 5. 62 +/- 0. 13 for valsartan, candesartan, eprosartan and <b>embusartan,</b> respectively. The order of potency, therefore, was eprosartan> valsartan = candesartan = <b>embusartan</b> (where > signifies P valsartan = eprosartan = <b>embusartan</b> (where > signifies P < 0. 05). In the pithed rat, the effects on DBP of stimulation of the thoracolumbar spinal cord are partly dependent on endogenously formed Ang II. These effects can be counteracted by blockade of presynaptically located AT 1 receptors. No interaction was found between postsynaptically located AT 1 receptors and alpha-adrenoceptors. The order of potency of the agents tested for sympathoinhibition clearly differed from that for inhibition of the direct pressor effects of Ang II. These findings suggest considerable differences in affinity of the various AT 1 blockers for pre- and postsynaptic AT 1 receptor...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} in Wistar rats (1) {{the effectiveness of}} peripheral administration of two AT 1 -receptor blockers (losartan and <b>embusartan)</b> to cause central AT 1 -receptor blockade, and (2) whether chronic peripheral treatment with losartan or embursartan can exert sufficient central effects to prevent the central effects of ouabain and sodium. In {{the first set of}} experiments, losartan or embursartan at 30 and 100 mg/kg were administered subcutaneously (sc) as a single dose or 1 dose daily for 6 days. The BP responses to intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of Ang II, icv infusion of Na +-rich aCSF (0. 3 M NaCl) and intravenous (iv) injection of Ang II were then measured. In the second set of experiments, losartan or <b>embusartan</b> (both at 100 mg/kg/day) were given se once daily for 16 days. Ouabain or sodium-rich aCSF were given in these groups of rats by osmotic minipump for 13 [...] 14 days. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) at rest and in response to air stress, and icv injection of guanabenz (75 mug/ 7. 5 mul, and 25 mug/ 2. 5 mul), Ang II (30 ng/ 3 mul) and ouabain (0. 5 mug/ 2 mul) at a 10 minutes interval were then measured.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{angiotensin}} II (Ang II) can facilitate the effects of sympathetic neurotransmission. In the present study, using various experimental models, we investigated the inhibitory effects of several Ang II subtype 1 receptor (AT 1) antagonists on this Ang II-induced facilitation. We compared the sympatho-inhibitory potencies of the AT 1 blockers with their respective potencies regarding inhibition of the direct vasoconstrictor effects of Ang II. In the isolated mesenteric artery, we investigated the effects of Ang II in the presence and absence of losartan, irbesartan and telmisartan on stimulation-induced vasoconstrictor responses. In the pithed rat, we studied the effect of AT 1 blockade on the sequelae of electrical stimulation of the thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow (presynaptic AT 1 blockade) as well as on dose-response curves elicited by exogenous Ang II (postsynaptic AT 1 blockade). Additionally, we compared the sympatho-inhibitory of irbesartan in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In the isolated mesenteric artery, Ang II (10 nM) significantly enhanced stimulation-induced vasoconstrictor responses. The enhancement could be antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by losartan (1 nmol/l to 1 mumol/l), irbesartan (0. 1 nmol/l to 0. 1 mumol/l) and telmisartan (0. 01 nmol/l to 0. 01 mumol/l). The sympatho-inhibitory potency was telmisartan > irbesartan > losartan. In the pithed normotensive rat, the stimulation-induced increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as well as the Ang II-elicited DBP response were dose-dependently reduced by all the AT 1 receptor blockers investigated. The order of potency with respect to sympatho-inhibition was eprosartan > valsartan = candesartan = <b>embusartan</b> = telmisartan > losartan > irbesartan (comparison of doses which at 2 Hz reduced delta DBP by 20 mmHg, differences significant at P <b>embusartan</b> = valsartan = eprosartan = telmisartan > irbesartan > losartan (comparison of the antagonist concentration, in the presence of which twice the agonist concentration, in the presence of which twice the agonist concentration is needed to cause the same effect [pA 2 values], differences significant at P < 0. 05). In the pithed SHR and the normotensive WKY rat the sympatho-inhibitory potency of irbesartan did not differ significantly between both strains. It can be concluded that all AT 1 receptor antagonists appear to possess sympatho-inhibitory properties, which may be of potential interest in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Our findings suggest differences in pre- and postsynaptic inhibition between the various compounds, since for eprosartan and losartan the sympatholytic doses and postsynaptic inhibitory doses differed far less than for the other AT 1 receptor antagonist...|$|E
