5|$|After {{the success}} of Platoon (1986), Stone wanted <b>film</b> <b>school</b> friend and Los Angeles screenwriter Stanley Weiser to {{research}} and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in Crime and Punishment. The director {{had been thinking about}} this kind of a movie as early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.|$|E

5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of <b>film</b> <b>school</b> for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
5|$|Society {{became more}} liberal (as seen, for instance, in the {{achievements}} of the Polish <b>Film</b> <b>School</b> and the creation of such controversial movies as Ashes and Diamonds), and a civil society started to develop, but half-hearted democratization was not enough to satisfy the Polish public. By the time of the March 1968 events, Gomułka's thaw would be long over, and increasing economic problems and popular discontent would end up removing Gomułka from power in 1970ironically, in a situation similar to the protests that once had propelled him to power.|$|E

5|$|Wirkola got {{the idea}} to create a film based on the adult lives of Hansel and Gretel in 2007 while at <b>film</b> <b>school</b> in Australia. After being {{discovered}} by Gary Sanchez Productions, Wirkola pitched the idea at a meeting with Paramount Pictures and won a contract. Production began in March 2011 at the Babelsberg Studios in Germany and included extensive use of traditional special effects. In addition, Renner and Arterton had a month of training beforehand {{to prepare for the}} physical demands of their roles. In terms of the weapons and wardrobe, Wirkola wanted an old-world look with a modern touch, and he was adamant about filming outdoors in European nature rather than in a studio. The project was filmed in Germany and featured an international cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|Yeovil is the {{location}} for the fictional School of Lifemanship {{in a series of}} novels by Stephen Potter: Gamesmanship (1947), Lifemanship (1950), One-Upmanship (1952), Supermanship (1958), Anti-Woo (1965) and The Complete Golf Gamesmanship (1968). The books were adapted for the 1960 <b>film</b> <b>School</b> for Scoundrels, starring Alastair Sim, Terry-Thomas, Ian Carmichael and Irene Handl. Later they were adapted by Barry Took into a BBC TV comedy series called One-Upmanship (1974–78), starring Richard Briers and Peter Jones. Yeovil {{is also one of the}} three principal locations in John Cowper Powys's 1929 novel, Wolf Solent.|$|E
5|$|Short Term 12 was {{originally}} conceived by Destin Daniel Cretton as a short film {{based on his}} experiences as a line staff worker at a group facility for teenagers where he had worked for two years; it served as his thesis project for his Master's degree in film at San Diego State University. The short film ran for 22minutes and premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Jury Prize in Short Filmmaking. After graduating from <b>film</b> <b>school,</b> Cretton decided to adapt the short into a feature-length screenplay, which won one of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' five Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting in 2010. The largest change Cretton made when adapting the short film into a longer screenplay was changing the lead character's gender: Denim, a man loosely based on Cretton himself, became Grace, a young woman and the facility's supervisor. Cretton researched similar facilities and interviewed former employees for the film, noting that the script featured stories directly told by children in these facilities from his interviews.|$|E
