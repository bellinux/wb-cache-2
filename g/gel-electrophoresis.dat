Doze (12) espécimes, cujos testes convencionais de inoculação em ovos embrionados e de agar-gel resultaram positivos, foram testados em suas diluições originais congeladas por mais de um ano, sendo seis deles revelados por gel-eletroforese enquanto nenhum o foi por agar-gel (tabela II).

In this work, microcapsules were prepared using water soluble keratin, known as keratoses, {{with the aim}} of encapsulating hydrophilic molecules. Keratoses were obtained via oxidizing extraction of pristine wool, previously degreased by Soxhlet. In order to better understand the shell part of microcapsules, pristine wool and obtained keratoses were investigated by FT-IR, <b>gel-electrophoresis</b> and HPLC. Production of the microcapsules was carried out by a sonication method. Thermal properties of microcapsules were investigated by DSC. Microencapsulation and dye encapsulation yields were obtained by UV-spectroscopy. Morphological structure of microcapsules was studied by light microscopy, SEM, and AFM. The molecular weights of proteins analyzed using <b>gel-electrophoresis</b> resulted in the range of 38 - 62 kDa. The results conﬁrmed that the hydrophilic dye (Telon Blue) was introduced inside the keratoses shells by sonication and the ﬁnal microcapsules diameter ranged from 0. 5 to 4 µm. Light microscope investigation evidenced the presence of the dye inside the keratoses vesicles, conﬁrming their capability of encapsulating hydrophilic molecules.

40|$|Structural {{polymorphism}} of DNA is {{a widely}} accepted property. A simple addition to this perception has been our recent finding, where a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site present in a quasipalindromic sequence of β-globin LCR exhibited a hairpin-duplex equilibrium. Our current studies explore that secondary structures adopted by individual complementary strands compete with formation of a perfect duplex. Using <b>gel-electrophoresis,</b> ultraviolet (UV) -thermal denaturation, circular dichroism (CD) techniques, we have demonstrated the structural transitions within a perfect duplex containing 11 bp quasipalindromic stretch (TGGGG(G/C) CCCCA), to hairpins and bulge duplex forms. The extended version of the 11 bp duplex, flanked by 5 bp on both sides also demonstrated conformational equilibrium between duplex and hairpin species. <b>Gel-electrophoresis</b> confirms that the duplex coexists with hairpin and bulge duplex/cruciform species. Further, in CD spectra of duplexes, presence of two overlapping positive peaks at 265 and 285 nm suggest the features of A- as well as B-type DNA conformation and show oligomer concentration dependence, manifested in A → B transition.

As an addition to these tactics, the red-legged salamander (Plethodon shermani) uses adhesive secretions as part of its defensive strategy. The high bonding strength, the fast-curing nature, and the composition of the biobased materials makes salamander adhesives interesting for practical applications in the medical sector. To understand the adhesive secretions of P. shermani, its components were chemically analysed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), amino acid analysis, and spectroscopy (ATR-IR, Raman). In addition, proteins were separated by <b>gel-electrophoresis</b> and selected spots were characterised by peptide mass fingerprinting. The salamander secretion contains a high amount of water and predominantly proteins (around 77 % in the dry stage). The <b>gel-electrophoresis</b> and peptide mass fingerprint analyses revealed a de novo set of peptides/proteins, largely with a pI between 5. 0 and 8. 0 and a molecular mass distribution between 10 and 170 [*]kDa. Only low homologies with other proteins present in known databases could be identified. The results indicate that the secretions of the salamander Plethodon clearly differ chemically from those shown for other glue-producing terrestrial or marine species and thus represent a unique glue system...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Dientamoeba fragilis is an {{intestinal}} protozoan parasite that {{is attracting}} growing interest. Several authors have associated {{the presence of}} this faecal agent to numerous intestinal and systemic clinical symptoms, even though asymptomatic carriers have been reported. Actually, to perform the coproparasitology exam for the identification of D. fragilis it is necessary to recur to an expert microscopist. Recently, several real-time TaqMan assays for the detection of D. fragilis has been reported. In this work we validate an original real-time PCR (TaqMan), re-evaluating the traditional microscopic diagnosis. Moreover, the potential for quantitative information, intrinsic of this molecular technique, was preliminarly explored. Methods. Forty-six carriers of D. fragilis were selected from patients referred to the Service of Microbiology of Padova University Hospital. The parasite was preliminarily detected on several occasions in each patient using traditional microscopy. A control group included forty-two healthy volunteers. Real-time PCR was applied to a stool sample from each subject. On the same sample, <b>gel-electrophoresis</b> amplicon detection PCR and microscopic examination were also performed. Results. The sensitivity of real-time PCR was 100 %, whereas microscopy showed 93 % sensitivity (direct wet mount on fixed stools and trichrome stain), <b>gel-electrophoresis</b> PCR 76 % and Giemsa stain 52 %. The specificity of all methods was 100 %. On the quantitative side, the frequency distribution of the protozoan load of the stools revealed a near to log-normal pattern is apparent for the data yielded by real-time PCR. Conclusions. The real-time PCR was clearly superior to either the gel electrophoresis PCR or the traditional microscopic examination. Just one unpreserved stool sample was adequate to find the parasite.
