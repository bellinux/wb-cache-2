Professor Cass Sunstein 2 ̆ 7 s keynote address, Fear and Liberty, noted that psychological biases such as the availability heuristic and probability neglect can skew risk perception, leading to excessive public fear of national security risks and unreasonable curtailment of civil liberties. According to Sunstein, courts, which are typically responsible for protecting civil liberties, often lack sufficient information to assess whether national security concerns justify incursions on civil liberties. Nevertheless, he concluded that courts can still provide an essential safeguard against unreasonable infringements (1) by requiring that executive actions infringing civil liberties be clearly authorized by legislative enactments, (2) by carefully scrutinizing selective burdens on the civil liberties of <b>identifiable</b> <b>minorities,</b> and (3) by using strong presumptions rather than case-by-case balancing in constitutional adjudication...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} the concept of minority in the plays of Tennessee Williams, as it transforms from minority as the identity of a certain group in his early plays, into an experience of marginality. In The Glass Menagerie (1945), A Streetcar Named Desire (1947) and Suddenly Last Summer (1958) Williams' characters experience self-confinement within the body, which categorises them as <b>identifiable</b> <b>minorities.</b> Three versions of The Night of the Iguana will be pivotal in this thesis; the 1961 three-act version of Iguana finds the 'interior space' of the characters' confinement in conflict with 'the exterior space'. In Williams' later plays, including Kingdom of Earth (1968), In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel (1969) and Small Craft Warnings (1972), the concept of marginality becomes more abstract, concerning the characters' interaction with one another to create a space of liberation. The thesis defines this space as 'the circle of 'one-ness' which is formed between two marginalized characters who come together in order to be liberated from their own confinement. Over the course of these plays Williams widens this dramatic circle to operate on a collective level of unity that includes two or more characters. The thesis ends with a discussion of Vieux Carré (1977), where Williams succeeds in dramatising the unity of these characters with the image of the loving God, and offering a return to the self as the source of salvation and liberation. By reading Williams' dramatic texts in relation to his use of stagecraft, including the visual and aural images, stage directions and the characters' movements on the stage, as well as their spoken words, the thesis aims to present a new framework for the study of Williams' dramatic work.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the urban {{phenomenon}} of minority clusters, which are invariably referred to as 'ghettos'. A {{review of the literature}} on 'ghettos' suggests that the clustering of <b>identifiable</b> <b>minorities</b> is commonly associated with segregation - be it physical, economic, social or linguistic - although it is the physical segregation which tends to be most frequently noticed. Moreover, one type of segregation, such as physical - is believed to lead to another type, such as economic. Through studying Jewish settlement in Leeds and Manchester in the 19 th century, two key questions are addressed in this thesis: The first is whether there is a link between spatial clustering and spatial segregation and the second is whether spatial clustering is linked to other forms of segregation, such as economic, occupational and social. Another two questions arise from the analysis: whether Jewish settlement patterns are distinctive in their own right, and whether it is possible to identify a pattern in the process of formation of Jewish settlement that may have broader implications for immigrant/minority settlement in general. The techniques and theories of 'Space Syntax' are used here to analyse the settlements in question by using detailed street-level mapping of census data on the entire Jewish population of Manchester and Leeds and of all non-Jewish individuals in the key Jewish districts of each of the cities (the key Jewish districts are generally referred to as 'ghettos'). This enables a multi-level socio-spatial comparison to be made: between Jewish families and their immediate neighbours; between Jewish families and the population of the city as a whole; and between the initial and secondary stages of Jewish settlement. In order to investigate questions relating specifically to immigrant settlement, non-Jewish people born outside of Britain are also considered as a separate group, although they are not the main subject. The analysis suggests that spatial clustering does not necessarily lead to spatial segregation and that spatial clustering may also be associated with some types of segregation, such as occupational but not with others, such as economic. It also suggests that Jewish settlement patterns are distinctive and that they are identifiable for a longer period than expected after immigration, when compared with other immigrants. This thesis also sheds light on the process of the formation of Jewish settlement, proposing a pattern whereby after establishing a core of settlement, streets already established become more densely populated, whilst new streets are settled more slowly. Analysis of the key districts of Jewish settlement also suggests that certain areas of cities are especially prone to settlement by the disadvantaged, due to characteristics that make such areas firstly, tend to be economically unsuccessful due to their spatial segregation and secondly, less attractive to those who have the means to move elsewhere and that such areas are not so much defined by their immigrant constituents, but by their long-standing inhabitants that cannot move elsewhere. ...|$|E

40|$|Ethnic {{minority}} disproportionality {{has been}} a topic of extensive discussion and research for many years. In 1997, Artiles, Trent, and Kuan conducted a seminal review of the special education research literature to identify how often researchers report and disaggregate data {{in ways that would}} support conclusions about specific ethnic minority groups. These authors found alarmingly low rates of publication on <b>identifiable</b> <b>minority</b> groups. The purpose of this review is to replicate the work of Artiles et al. and extend this literature analysis to the subsequent 15 -year period (1995 – 2009).

40|$|Introduction Quasars {{from the}} Parkes Half-Jansky Flat Spectrum Sample (PHFS) (Drinkwater et al. 1997) {{are known to}} have a large {{dispersion}} in optical (B Γ K) colours (Webster et al. 1995, Francis et al. 1999), with the reddest objects having B Γ K ? 7. As such, they are much redder than optically selected quasars. There are two different theories to account for this large dispersion in B Γ K colour: excess red emission (most likely synchrotron) is present that increases the K flux; or dust absorption takes place, reducing the B flux. These two models have been explored by Whiting et al. (in preparation). We have found that there is an <b>identifiable</b> <b>minority</b> of quasars that are best fit with dust extinction, rather than synchrotron reddening. It is expected that, for these sources, there will be some degree of absorption of soft X-ray...|$|R

25|$|By {{the late}} Republican era, slavery {{had become a}} vital {{economic}} pillar in the wealth of Rome, {{as well as a}} very significant part of Roman society. It is estimated that 25% or more of the population of Ancient Rome was enslaved, although the actual percentage is debated by scholars, and varied from region to region. Slaves represented 15–25% of Italy's population, mostly captives in war, especially from Gaul and Epirus. Estimates of the number of slaves in the Roman Empire suggest that the majority of slaves were scattered throughout the provinces outside of Italy. Generally, slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy estimated at 5% of the total in the capital at its peak, where their number was largest.

40|$|Two main {{bodies of}} {{literature}} are <b>identifiable</b> in <b>minority</b> education policy studies in China. Many adopt a descriptive approach to examining policy documents and general outcomes in their historical contexts while others focus on evaluating preferential policies made to address inequality issues in minority education. In most discussions, educators and scholars analyse or speculate about rationale behind minority education policies promulgated by governments {{at various levels}} in different periods. Rare attempts are made to develop a conceptual framework {{to make it possible}} to analyse the policy process in its entirety. Scholars and educators have seldom defined the relevant actors of a policy, to relate the policy to issues concerning these actors in the matrix of the social hierarchy, and to evaluate how policy outcomes feed back into the policy making and implementation cycle. This paper proposes an analytical framework that addresses these issues {{on the basis of a}} comparative analysis of recent literature on bi/trilingual education policies, official policy documents for minority groups and their implementation.

40|$|Objective:To {{determine}} the current life time professional prevalence of threats and assaults by patients on psychiatry residents, their consequences, perceived adequacy of supports and institutional responses. Methods:An anonymous survey of 519 psychiatry residents in 13 psychiatry {{programs across the}} United States was conducted between March and June 2008. Results:The response rate for this survey was 38 % (n = 204). Sixty {{one percent of the}} responders were female, and 30 % were members of a visibly <b>identifiable</b> ethnic <b>minority.</b> The majority (72. 4 %) of those involved in an incident reported experiencing mild to severe psychological distress. Almost a third (31. 6 %) made requests to the hospital or department to improve safety. Most residents (93. 8 %) felt policies on psychological support after an assault would be helpful. Conclusion:This study calls attention to the high numbers of residents that are affected by violence during their training, and underscores the need for clear policy and training, in order to prevent and adequately respond to assaults, threats, and their consequences among psychiatry residents.

40|$|Medieval Toledo was a {{political}} and economic center whose ethnic diversity promoted cultural variety. It was the first place where Castilian Christians lived beside large numbers of Jews and Muslims for extended periods of time. The norms of coexistence that developed there during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries formed {{a model for other}} towns of the kingdom, especially for the Andalusian cities conquered during the thirteenth century. By {{the last half of the}} fourteenth century, however, the model had ceased to be effective. This dissertation uses Toledo in the twelfth through fourteenth centuries as a window onto the questions of ethnic interactions and majority/minority relations during the Middle Ages, discussed in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 shows that the majority Christian population there was faced with a large, <b>identifiable</b> Jewish <b>minority</b> which was far less segregated in its behavior than were most medieval European minorities of any religion. Despite the harmony between the groups for much of this period, Chapters 3 [...] 5 demonstrate that leaders of both religious communities maintained strict conceptual boundaries between themselves and the others; despite this insistence on alterity, members of the groups interacted in ways unknown in most of the rest of medieval Europe, described in Chapters 6 and 7. In fact, economic documents from the period show that Christians and Jews in Toledo were involved in very similar activities, often in cooperation with each other, although Christian rhetoric ignored this fact. The Toledan experience demonstrates that alterity was not an inevitable source of social conflict for medieval Europeans. Boundaries between groups were enormously important for medieval people, but the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in Toledo were not a time of pressure to conform or the persecution of minorities. The fourteenth century, however, saw a breakdown of toleration; Chapter 8 discusses how Europe-wide economic stresses and local political upheaval destroyed the balance between hostility and acceptance and led to violence against Jews. And once again, developments in Toledo proved to be a model for events in the rest of the kingdom of Castile, leading to the anti-Jewish riots of 1391. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Fordham University, 1999.
