The study comprised 109 participants selected by a random sampling method. The sample consisted of 53 mathematics teachers from urban secondary schools and 56 mathematics teachers from rural secondary schools drawn from a population of secondary school mathematics teachers in England. The Assessment Practices Inventory (API) was used to collect data from the participants in the study. The independent sample t- test was used to analyze the data in the study. The study determined that statistically significant differences exist in perceived frequency of usage of classroom assessment practices between mathematics teachers <b>in</b> urban <b>secondary</b> schools (M = 193. 02, SD = 72. 78) and mathematics teachers <b>in</b> rural <b>secondary</b> schools <b>in</b> England (M = 157. 84, SD = 58. 25); t (107) = 2. 794, p =. 006. Mathematics teachers <b>in</b> urban <b>secondary</b> schools were found to have perceived themselves as using the surveyed assessment categories more frequently than mathematics teachers <b>in</b> rural <b>secondary</b> schools <b>in</b> England, with a moderate effect size (d =. 53).
