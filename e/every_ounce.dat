The nature of the situation meant that Paige only had two-and-a-half weeks in the rehearsal process before her first performance. She admitted feeling daunted by the prospect, having seen Glenn Close in the role on Broadway just prior to entering rehearsals. London critics were largely won over by Paige in a performance that [...] "not only wrings out <b>every</b> <b>ounce</b> of dramatic action but delivers some unexpected humour as well" [...] and she took over the part full-time the following year.

Reviewers praised the series' vibrant graphics, high-quality sound, and varied, refined RPG gameplay, with particular optimism on the Djinn-based gameplay system and Battle aspect {{despite the fact that}} the original two games were limited to the 32-bit cartridge. GamePro raved that Golden Sun was [...] "A huge, fantastic, creative, and wickedly fun RPG that doesn't seem to care that it's 'just' on a GBA," [...] while they praised that The Lost Ages eye-popping magic effects are beautiful even by console standards. IGN, meanwhile, praised the plot's intricate structure, saying that it [...] "has been so tightly integrated into <b>every</b> <b>ounce</b> of the adventure... such a rich and deep plot that it's almost easy to get lost if you're not paying attention."

In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and Gallimimus. As well as the computer-generated dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richards' stunt double. Compositing the dinosaurs onto the live action scenes took around an hour. Rendering the dinosaurs often took two to four hours per frame, and rendering the T. rex in the rain even took six hours per frame. Spielberg monitored their progress from Poland during the filming of Schindler's List, having teleconferences {{four times a week}} with ILM's crew.

25|$|Lindbergh also {{insisted that}} {{unnecessary}} weight be eliminated, even {{going so far}} as to cut the top and bottom off of his flight map.

Adapted from Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play, it focusses on a self-sufficient Harvard University professor who finds her values challenged when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Thompson was instrumental in bringing Mike Nichols to direct the project, and the pair spent months in rehearsal to get the complex character right. [...] She was greatly drawn to the [...] "daredevil" [...] role, for which she had no qualms about shaving her head. Reviewing the performance, Roger Ebert was touched by [...] "the way she struggles with <b>every</b> <b>ounce</b> of her humanity to keep her self-respect", and in 2008 he called it Thompson's finest work. Caryn James of The New York Times also described it as [...] "one of her most brilliant performances", adding [...] "we seem to be peering into a soul as embattled as its body." [...] The film earned Thompson nominations at the Golden Globes, Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Europe, Du Bois was more determined {{than ever to}} gain equal rights for African Americans. Black soldiers {{returning from}} overseas felt {{a new sense of}} power and worth, and were representative of an emerging attitude referred to as the New Negro.

[...] Many blacks moved to northern cities in search of work, and some northern white workers resented the competition. This labor strife was one of the causes of the Red Summer of 1919, a horrific series of race riots across America, in which over 300 African Americans were killed in over 30 cities. Du Bois documented the atrocities in the pages of The Crisis, culminating in the December publication of a gruesome photograph of a lynching that occurred during the Omaha, Nebraska race riot.|$|E
