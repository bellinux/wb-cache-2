40|$|Purpose of the article: The main aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{fundamental}} approach to investment speculation in the foreign exchange market. Decision about buy-sell speculative position is based on statistical analysis of the fundamental message of the U. S. - Information about employment (www. bls. gov), which is published first Friday of each new month. The main idea is based on the change of the U. S. dollar (USD) value against the Swiss franc (CHF) and Euro (EUR). The statistical analysis is performed for the currency pairs <b>EUR.</b> <b>USD</b> and USD. CHF. Historical data of the employment situation is getting from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and stock data are obtained from Interactive Brokers U. S. The Employment situation data include the following information-Non-Farm Payroll, Unemployment rate, Average hourly earnings, and Average workweek. Scientific aim: The scientific {{aim of this}} paper is to show fundamental speculation approach on the market of foreign exchanges. The main idea is based on impact measuring of Unemployment rate change on <b>EUR.</b> <b>USD</b> and USD. CHF changes. Methodology/methods: Statistical methods of analyses used in this paper are based on the measuring of difference among two consecutive months. The negative value of the difference among two consecutive months is a signal for raising USD value and positive value of difference is a signal for weakeing USD value. Findings: The statistical analysis found the connection between the change in Unemployment rate and USD value weakeing or strenging against the CHF and EUR. Conclusions: The authors of this paper reached the conclusion by means of statistical analyses, that it is possible to predict changes of USD value against the EUR and CHF. For application of this approach is created simple trading method, which said, that positive change of Unemployment rate difference weak USD value and negative change strength.

40|$|The study {{presents}} the results of an analysis of credit risk factors of the Slovenian banking system. The objective of the empirical analysis is to establish which macroeconomic factors influence the systematic credit risk of the Slovenian banking loan portfolio. The research results have confirmed the main hypothesis that certain macroeconomic factors have a major influence on the examined credit risk. We could conclude that the credit risk of the loan portfolio depends on the employment or unemployment rate in Slovenia, on short and long-term interest rates of Slovenian banks and the Bank of Slovenia, and on the value of the Slovenian stock exchange index. We cannot claim that the examined credit risk depends on the inflation rate in Slovenia, the growth of gdp (industrial production), <b>eur</b> and <b>usd</b> exchange rates or the growth of Slovenian import and export.

40|$|We {{propose a}} model of {{exchange}} rates that jointly models associated re-alized measures of volatility and covariances within the Realized GARCH framework. The proposed model exploits identities arising from no arbitrage conditions, that facilitates a relatively parsimonious modeling of a panel of exchange rates. The model shares the simplicity of GARCH models while taking advantage of realized volatility measures that are computed from high-frequency (intraday) data. The latter leads to a better modeling of the vari-ances and covariances, by providing a flexible modeling of their dynamic properties. The model easily produce forecasts at any horizon. The model is illustrated with an empirical application for exchange rates between the currencies: <b>EUR,</b> <b>USD</b> and JPY. An out-of-sample comparison shows that the proposed model dominates conventional benchmark models, in particular at shorter horizons...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to the topic of}} yield curve modelling by revaluing the famous Nelson-Siegel model in the relatively outdated but very parsimonious version. In order to make this framework applicable to present yield curves of government bonds, we introduce an alternative model dealing with an appropri- ateness of the possibly overlooked model parameter lambda. By incorporating the sound methodology, we model the yield curves of the three currency regions - <b>EUR,</b> <b>USD</b> and GBP - and assess both in-sample fit and forecasting perfor- mance. Whereas the in-sample predicting generally achieves the best results with the alternative model predicting model coefficients, especially for longer maturities, the out-of-sample forecasting seems more complicated. Actually, the detail analysis show an interesting connection between efficiencies of the models and bond market volatilities. On the base of our research, the model directly extrapolating yields appears to be more suitable for more volatile markets.

40|$|The current {{research}} paper aims {{to assess the}} impact of sovereign credit ratings on the issuance of government bonds in Central and Eastern Europe. The personal analysis is performed on a sample of government bonds issued by Turkey, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Poland, Romania and Russia between 2000 - 2010. The sample includes issues in several currencies (<b>EUR,</b> <b>USD,</b> GBP, JPY, CHF, CZK, PLN, TRY, RUB, RON, HUF). The research paper consists of two different analyses. The first one assesses the degree in which the variation in the initial yield of government bonds issued in one particular currency can be explained by using explanatory variables such as: inflation, sovereign rating corresponding to the issuing country, and the state of crisis (this analysis is performed for each currency separately). The second analysis assesses the degree in which the variation in the maturity of the government bonds issued by a certain country can be explained by using explanatory variables such as: inflation, sovereign rating on the date of issuance, and the state of crisis. credit rating; government bonds; initial yield; maturity. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{characterizes the}} intraday {{dynamics}} of the high frequency US Dollar (USD) -Euro (<b>EUR)</b> and <b>US</b> Dollar (USD) -Japanese Yen (JPY) foreign exchange rates that {{have been subject to}} macroeconomic fundamentals. Even though the FIGARCH model with a normality assumption is found to be a good starting point, it appears to be inappropriate to represent the underlying movements of the high frequency returns due to the occurrences of jumps. Hence, this paper relies on the FIGARCH model with the mixture distribution that allows for the time-varying jumps that are determined by the US macroeconomic surprises. This paper generally finds that the US macroeconomic surprises are closely related to the intraday movements in the volatility process of the high frequency returns process through the jumps. In particular, the US macroeconomic surprises appear to affect the movements in the volatility process of the foreign exchange rates asymmetrically depending on the signs of the surprises and spuriously increasing the long memory persistence in the volatility process due to the jumps.

We use a battery of econometric specifications to evaluate whether optimal currency portfolios implied by trading strategies based on exchange rate forecasts out- perform single-currency and the equally weighted portfolio. We assess the differences in profitability of optimal currency portfolios for different types of investor preferences, different trading strategies, different composite forecasts and different forecast horizons.

40|$|Modeling and {{forecasting}} of {{implied volatility}} (IV) {{is important to}} both practitioners and academics, especially in trading, pricing, hedging, and risk management activities, all of which require an accurate volatility. However, it has become challenging since the 1987 stock market crash, as implied volatilities (IVs) recovered from stock index options present two patterns: volatility smirk(skew) and volatility term-structure, if the two are examined at the same time, presents a rich implied volatility surface (IVS). This implies that the assumptions behind the Black-Scholes (1973) model do not hold empirically, as asset prices are mostly influenced by many underlying risk factors. This thesis, consists of four essays, is modeling and forecasting implied volatility {{in the presence of}} options markets’ empirical regularities. The first essay is modeling the dynamics IVS, it extends the Dumas, Fleming and Whaley (DFW) (1998) framework; for instance, using moneyness in the implied forward price and OTM put-call options on the FTSE 100 index, a nonlinear optimization is used to estimate different models and thereby produce rich, smooth IVSs. Here, the constant-volatility model fails to explain the variations in the rich IVS. Next, it is found that three factors can explain about 69 - 88 % {{of the variance in the}} IVS. Of this, on average, 56 % is explained by the level factor, 15 % by the term-structure factor, and the additional 7 % by the jump-fear factor. The second essay proposes a quantile regression model for modeling contemporaneous asymmetric return-volatility relationship, which is the generalization of Hibbert et al. (2008) model. The results show strong negative asymmetric return-volatility relationship at various quantiles of IV distributions, it is monotonically increasing when moving from the median quantile to the uppermost quantile (i. e., 95 %); therefore, OLS underestimates this relationship at upper quantiles. Additionally, the asymmetric relationship is more pronounced with the smirk (skew) adjusted volatility index measure in comparison to the old volatility index measure. Nonetheless, the volatility indices are ranked in terms of asymmetric volatility as follows: VIX, VSTOXX, VDAX, and VXN. The third essay examines the information content of the new-VDAX volatility index to forecast daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimates and compares its VaR forecasts with the forecasts of the Filtered Historical Simulation and RiskMetrics. All daily VaR models are then backtested from 1992 - 2009 using unconditional, independence, conditional coverage, and quadratic-score tests. It is found that the VDAX subsumes almost all information required for the volatility of daily VaR forecasts for a portfolio of the DAX 30 index; implied-VaR models outperform all other VaR models. The fourth essay models the risk factors driving the swaption IVs. It is found that three factors can explain 94 - 97 % of the variation in each of the <b>EUR,</b> <b>USD,</b> and GBP swaption IVs. There are significant linkages across factors, and bi-directional causality is at work between the factors implied by EUR and USD swaption IVs. Furthermore, the factors implied by EUR and USD IVs respond to each others’ shocks; however, surprisingly, GBP does not affect them. Second, the string market model calibration results show it can efficiently reproduce (or forecast) the volatility surface for each of the swaptions markets...|$|E

BackgroundA direct broad-based {{comparison}} of vascular access use and survival in Europe (EUR) and the United States (US) {{has not been}} performed previously. Case series reports suggest that vascular access practices differ substantially in the <b>US</b> and <b>EUR.</b> We report on a representative study (DOPPS) which has used the same data collection protocol for> 6400 hemodialysis (HD) patients to compare vascular access use at 145 US dialysis units and 101 units in five EUR countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). MethodsLogistic analysis evaluated factors associated with native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) versus graft use or permanent access versus catheter use for prevalent and incident HD patients. Times to failure for AVF and graft were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. ResultsAVF was used by 80 % of EUR and 24 % of US prevalent patients, and {{was significantly associated with}} younger age, male gender, lower body mass index, non-diabetic status, lack of peripheral vascular disease, and no angina. After adjusting for these factors, AVF versus graft use was still much higher in <b>EUR</b> than <b>US</b> (AOR = 21, P 30 days prior to ESRD compared with 74 % in the US (P < 0. 0001); pre-ESRD care was associated with increased odds of AVF versus graft use (AOR = 1. 9, P = 0. 01). New HD patients had a 1. 8 -fold greater odds (P = 0. 002) of starting HD with a permanent access if a facility's typical time from referral to access placement was ≤ 2 weeks. AVF use when compared to grafts was substantially lower (AOR = 0. 61, P = 0. 04) when surgery trainees assisted or performed access placements. When used as a patient's first access, AVF survival was superior to grafts regarding time to first failure (RR = 0. 53, P = 0. 0002), and AVF survival was longer in EUR compared with the US (RR = 0. 49, P = 0. 0005). AVF and grafts each displayed better survival if used when initiating HD compared with being used after patients began dialysis with a catheter. ConclusionLarge differences in vascular access use exist between <b>EUR</b> and the <b>US,</b> even after adjustment for patient characteristics. The results strongly suggest that a facility's preferences and approaches to vascular access practice are major determinants of vascular access use...|$|R
