5|$|Heavy {{rains and}} {{flooding}} {{are the primary}} problem associated with tropical cyclones across the Pelican State. Recent examples of flooding across the state from tropical cyclones include Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, Tropical Storm Frances in 1998, Tropical Storm Allison in 1989, and Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979. Three of the four systems stalled across eastern Texas, prolonging the rainfall which occurred over Louisiana. If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> intermittent invasions from tropical cyclones, rainfall during the months of August, September, and October would average about 25% less than it currently does.|$|E
5|$|As the Bonneville Floods rushed {{down the}} Snake River, the Missoula Floods {{occurred}} in the same period, but farther north. The Missoula Floods, which took place more than 40 times in the time span from 15,000 to 13,000 years ago, were caused by Glacial Lake Missoula on the Clark Fork repeatedly being impounded by ice dams then breaking through, with the lake's water rushing over much of eastern Washington in massive surges far larger than the Lake Bonneville Flood. These floods pooled behind the Cascade Range into enormous lakes and spilled over the northern drainage divide of the Snake River watershed, carving deep canyons through the Palouse Hills. The Palouse River canyon was {{the largest of the}} many gorges cut through the Palouse Hills, and could not have become as large as it now is if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Missoula Floods. The Lake Bonneville Floods and the Missoula Floods helped widen and deepen the Columbia River Gorge, a giant water gap which allows water from the Columbia and Snake rivers to take a direct route through the Cascade Range to the Pacific.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the trailers being swept away by the torrent, many houses, with people still in or on top of them, were swept into Lake Ontario.

25|$|Reuben Moore, Jr., likely began {{construction}} of Court Manor (then known as Mooreland Hall) {{during the last}} years of the eighteenth century, following his grandfather's death in 1797. Mooreland Hall would have been a rather conventional exercise in the late colonial style if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> incorporation of the impressive Greek Revival portico into the design. Supported by four massive columns of the Doric order and surmounted by a simple triangular pediment decorated with a single semi-circular window, the scale of the portico dominates the main facade of the house. The large, two-level structure was constructed using bricks fired on site by the plantation's slaves. The house contained twelve spacious rooms, each with a fireplace and with large windows, affording panoramic views of the rolling countryside with the Massanutten Mountain Ridge rising in the distance.|$|E
25|$|For all the {{fighting}} and destruction, the Burmese gained only the lower Tenasserim coast. It is likely that even the retention of Tenasserim was possible only because the Siamese were immersed in their civil war. A more united Siam would have likely retaken at least the lower Tenasserim coast, if not the upper coast since almost all Burmese troops were deployed on the Chinese front throughout 1768 and 1769. (Recall that Ekkathat, widely {{considered to be an}} ineffective ruler, was able to retake the lower coast in 1761 while Naungdawgyi had his hands full with multiple rebellions. A much more able leader like Taksin would certainly have retaken Tenasserim if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> civil war.) But the Sino-Burmese war ended in December 1769 about six months before Taksin finished reunifying mainland Siam. Taksin chose not yet to renew the war with the Burmese, instead chose to focus on consolidating his gains in mainland Siam. (The Siamese would not launch an offensive war against the Burmese until 1787.) The territory of Tenasserim, with over 800 islands, which had been under Siamese rule for nearly five centuries, passed to the Burmese.|$|E

500|$|In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Germany, {{against the}} advice of the British government, and met Adolf Hitler at his Berghof retreat in Bavaria. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes. The former Austrian ambassador, Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein, who was also a second cousin once removed and friend of George V, {{believed}} that Edward favoured German fascism as a bulwark against communism, and even that he initially favoured an alliance with Germany. According to the Duke of Windsor, the experience of [...] "the unending scenes of horror" [...] during the First World War led him to support appeasement. Hitler considered Edward to be friendly towards Nazi Germany and thought that Anglo-German relations could have been improved through Edward if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> abdication.

500|$|For Haywood, {{industrial}} union principles were later {{confirmed by the}} defeat of the Western Federation of Miners in the 1903–05 Cripple Creek strike due — he believed — to insufficient labor solidarity. The WFM miners had sought to extend the benefits of union to the mill workers who processed their ore. Since the government had crushed the ARU, the railroad workers were again organized along craft lines, similar to the AFL. Those same railroad unions continued to haul the ore from mines that were run by strike breakers, to mills that were run by strike breakers. [...] "The railroaders form the connecting link in the proposition that is scabby at both ends," [...] Haywood complained. [...] "This fight, which is entering its third year, could have been won in three weeks if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fact that the trade unions are lending assistance to the mine operators." [...] The obvious solution, it seemed to Haywood, was for all of the workers to join the same union, and to take collective action in concert against the employers. The militants of the WFM referred to the AFL as the [...] "American Separation of Labor," [...] a criticism that was later echoed by the Industrial Workers of the World.|$|E

500|$|While widely {{considered}} to be a pop punk band, Fall Out Boy has also been described as pop rock emo, and emo pop, and cites emo group The Get Up Kids as an influence among many other bands. When interviewed for a retrospective article in Alternative Press at the time The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, Pete Wentz stated that [...] "Fall Out Boy would not be a band if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Get Up Kids." [...] Early in the band's career, when Jared Logan was producing the group's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. Wentz responded by [...] "handing over the first two New Found Glory records". Wentz also cites Green Day, the Ramones, Screeching Weasel, Metallica, Earth Crisis, Gorilla Biscuits and Lifetime as influences. The band acknowledges its hardcore punk roots as an influence; all four members were involved in the Chicago hardcore scene before joining Fall Out Boy. Wentz described the band's affiliation with the genre by saying [...] "I think {{the interesting thing is that}} we are all hardcore kids that are writing pop music...It gives us a different style because at our core we are always hardcore. That aspect is always going to be evident in the music. We are hardcore kids that couldn't quite cut it as hardcore kids." [...] He referred to Fall Out Boy's genre as [...] "softcore": hardcore punk mixed with pop sensibility. Lead singer Patrick Stump, however, is also influenced by artists he listened to while growing up including Prince, Michael Jackson, and David Bowie.|$|E
