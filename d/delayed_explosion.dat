The deviation from the FD distribution would, if observed, provide a test for the standard picture of neutrino emission from collapse-driven supernovae. For the D = 50 kpc case, the signature of the <b>delayed</b> <b>explosion</b> is still observable, but statistical fluctuation is too large to detect the deviation from the FD distribution.

40|$|We {{argue that}} the {{properties}} of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2011 fe can be best explained within the frame of the core-degenerate (CD) scenario. In the CD scenario a white dwarf (WD) merges with the core of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and forms a rapidly rotating WD, with a mass close to and above the critical mass for explosion. Rapid rotation prevents immediate collapse and/or explosion. Spinning down over a time of 0 - 10 Gyr brings the WD to explosion. A very long <b>delayed</b> <b>explosion</b> to post-crystallization phase, which lasts for about 2 Gyr leads to the formation of a highly carbon-enriched outer layer. This can account for the carbon-rich composition of the fastest-moving ejecta of SN 2011 fe.

This paper demonstrates the application of heterogeneous stochastic Petri net modeling techniques to the quantitative assessment of the probabilities of domino effects of major accidents in chemical industrial park.

Then, the domino effect models are converted into Generalized Stochastic Petri net (GSPN) in which the probability of the domino effect is calculated automatically.

Finally, in order to alleviate the state-space explosion problems of GSPN models, this paper employs Stochastic Wellformed Net (SWN), a particular class of High-Level (colored) SPN. To conduct a case study on a chemical industrial park, the probability of domino effects of major accidents is calculated by using the GSPN model and SWN model in this paper...|$|E

Recently the relativistic EOS table has become available as a new complete set of physical EOS for numerical simulations of supernova explosion. We examine this EOS table by using general relativistic hydrodynamics of the gravitational collapse and bounce of supernova cores. In order to study dense matter in dynamical situation, we perform simplified calculations of core collapse and bounce by following adiabatic collapse with the fixed electron fraction {{for a series of}} progenitor models. This is intended to give us ``approximate models'' of prompt explosion. We investigate the profiles of thermodynamical quantities and the compositions during collapse and bounce. We also perform the calculations with the Lattimer-Swesty EOS to compare the properties of dense matter. As a measure of the stiffness of the EOS, we examine the explosion energy of the prompt explosion with electron capture totally suppressed.

40|$|In the <b>delayed</b> <b>explosion</b> {{scenario}} of core-collapse supernovae (SNe), the accretion phase shows pronounced convective overturns and a low-multipole hydrodynamic instability, the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). These effects imprint detectable fast time {{variations on the}} emerging neutrino flux. Among existing detectors, IceCube is best suited to this task, providing an event rate of ~ 1000 events per ms during the accretion phase for a fiducial SN distance of 10 kpc, comparable to what could be achieved with a megaton water Cherenkov detector. If the SASI activity lasts for several hundred ms, a Fourier component with an amplitude of 1 % of the average signal clearly sticks out from the shot noise. We analyze in detail the output of axially symmetric hydrodynamical simulations that predict much larger amplitudes up to frequencies {{of a few hundred}} Hz. If these models are roughly representative for realistic SNe, fast time variations of the neutrino signal are easily detectable in IceCube or future megaton-class instruments.

In this paper, using the three-dimensional AMR code CASTRO with a realistic progenitor and equation of state and a simple neutrino heating and cooling scheme, we present a numerical study of the evolution in 3 D of the rotational profile of a supernova core from collapse, through bounce and shock stagnation, to <b>delayed</b> <b>explosion.</b> By the end of our simulation (∼ 420 ms after core bounce), we do not witness significant spin up of the proto-neutron star core left behind. However, we do see the development before explosion of strong differential rotation in the turbulent gain region between the core and stalled shock. Shells in this region acquire high spin rates that reach ∼ 150 Hz, but this region contains too little mass and angular momentum to translate, even if left behind, into rapid rotation for the full neutron star. We find also that much of the induced angular momentum is likely to be ejected in the explosion, and moreover that even if the optimal amount of induced angular momentum is retained in the core, the resulting spin period is likely to be quite modest. Nevertheless, induced periods of seconds are possible. Comment: Accepted to the Astrophysical Journa...|$|E
