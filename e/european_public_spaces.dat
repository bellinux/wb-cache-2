The new EU approach offers strategic opportunities for large and small Member States alike, as it allows them, in different ways, to actively co-create a diverse set of international cultural activities. In {{order to make the}} nascent strategy for EU international culural relations a success, it is fundamental to move beyond the crisis narrative by proactively engaging with the media, to achieve a multiplier effect and increase the impact of cultural projects and initiatives. New digital technologies are key to facilitate start up projects, specifically tailored to youth, and to reinforce the people-to-people approach. Co-creation and co-ownership with stakeholders (at local and national level) are of paramount importance to increase efficiency and sustainability of projects, but may present important value challenges. Systematic monitoring to judge which kind of projects work best, and coordination at all levels are essential to make the EU strategy a success.

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} building a dialectical understanding {{of the process of}} urban design from the perspective of Henri Lefebvre's theory of spatial production. From this perspective, urban space is the material expression of the practice of a society; space is socially produced by the conflicts and contradictions existent within the social order. A dialectic approach considers the opposite sides in unity, and in design reasoning aims to offer a synthesis that brings in unity the contradictions present within the design process. Hence I propose a dynamic understanding of urban design as an ongoing dialectic of spatial production. In this study the narrative centers on the contemporary production of urban spaces for public life.; The narratives of loss that emerged in urban studies in the last decades express dissatisfaction with respect to the disappearance of public spaces in the American cities and the consequence of privatization of public life. At the same time, the practice of everyday life in the modern city is often a disconnected experience that disregards individual experiences and the particularities of places. Despite initiatives of community life revival by design, like in the New Urbanist communities in the USA, there appears to exist a gap between the intentions and the outcomes of the urban design processes. In this research I ask the following questions: How has the relationship between the public and the private transformed over time? What might be the necessary transformations within the professional practice with respect to the roles played by planners and designers in the current production of public spaces? How would planning and design pedagogy build a different understanding of spatial research, in order to prepare planners and designers to practice with alternatives to the rational comprehensive models?; The social interaction that takes place in the city core is a good measure for the vitality of the city, which is an important characteristic for the city's potential successful position in the global marketplace. In this study I propose an ideal of spaces for public life that are civil, diverse, and convivial. A characteristic of the production of this ideal is a dynamic understanding of the design process with the consequence of blurring the boundaries between the public and the private. I argue that the production of this spatial ideal for public life is capable to configure the city's successful image in a globalized world.; In order to find out how planning and design practice should target this ideal, I performed field research regarding two newly developed projects: the Third Street Promenade, a pedestrian street in Santa Monica, United States, and CentrO, a shopping mall and entertainment center in Neue Mitte Oberhausen, Germany. I chose this comparative case study due to its potential to illustrate an irony in the productions of public spaces within the current process of globalization. While in the United States urban development aims to replicate the quality of the <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>spaces,</b> new developments in Europe reproduce the suburban, off-center, destination places like the American shopping malls and entertainment centers. I present in comparison these two projects that illustrate planning and design practices with rational comprehensive models. Among the main findings of the comparative analyses is that in spite of the similarities of these two public spaces, they exemplify different solutions with respect to the project's impact on the city cores of Oberhausen and Santa Monica.; I propose in this study the definition of design dialectics as the dynamic understanding of a life cycle of a place across the moments of the following spatial triad: a sense of a place, the conception of a place, and the life and enduring civic presence of a place. I structured this spatial triad on different ways to interact with places according to Lefebvre's dialectical moments that refer to different spatial representations. As a consequence, the proposed spatial triad generates different ways to represent places that I call an external image, a professional image, and the lived experience of a place.; Furthermore, this study translates spatial theory into planning and design practice in two ways. First, I propose to consider planning and design practitioners as spatial explorers that approach spatial analyses from a phenomenological viewpoint. A phenomenological viewpoint draws wisdom through reflective inquiries into the inner being. From this point of view professionals would assume alternatively different social roles in spatial explorations, and alternatively perform sensorial, conceptual, institutional, and rhythm analyses of places. Furthermore, I suggest they should be capable to incorporate change within the conception process through a dynamic perspective across the dialectical moments of a life cycle of a place, and to mediate among the three modes of representation within the spatial production. This process of spatial production implies a reflective paradigm of practice.; Second, in order to develop the habit of reflective action, I suggest integrating the social sciences theory into planning and design pedagogy, and familiarizing future practitioners with a critical approach to the design reasoning and practice. The design process is not a series of activities that can be dealt with one after another, but rather it is a process of forming judgments about the problems. The choice between different paradigms of practice is key in adapting to the pace of change within the contemporary spatial production. Hence this study proposes a dialectical alternative to previous methods of planning and design practice, an alternative that values the particularities of places and of individuals including the senses and the inner being...|$|E

40|$|Among the ‘figures of otherness’ that {{sociology}} have conceptualised, {{there has}} been a shift from ‘internal’ foreigners (belonging to a minority: Jews, members of ethnic and religious minorities, etc.), to the different, the foreigner, and lastly the immigrant, which has been for a long period the ideal type of the other, and the most studied. Now it seems to become, in more recent years, the Muslim. There are many reasons to explain this shift, both internal, connected with the transformations of migrations in Europe, and external, connected to the emergence of Islam as a global political actor. But there are also long-term reasons, which are related to the renovated salience of religious categories in the <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>space,</b> such as the pluralisation of religious offer, of which Islam in Europe represents in the public debate, correctly or not, the extreme case. The main interpretative problem is that, on the one hand, the religious specificity of Islam is relatively bad acknowledged; on the other hand, it is excessively used as a self-evident explanation of phenomena related also to non religious reasons. Research approaches to Islam risk then to be condemned either to reductionism or to essentialism. This seems to be equally true for the political, religious and particularly mediatic debate about Islam in the <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>space.</b> One of the paradoxes of this situation is that today, when Muslims are more and more integrated in European societies, the perception of them and of Islam is more and more conflictual. In this situation of conflict – not necessarily real, but described as such in part of the public imagery – in which the interpretative paradigms (also those of common discourses, not only scientific) are still weak and little attested, reactive forms of identity emerge, both among the autochthonous populations and the immigrant communities.

Accompagnement is a simplified classicism, devoid of figurative details and reduced to its most abstract form: an architecture that, for the first time, is concerned with the framing of empty (<b>public)</b> <b>space</b> rather than with the embellishment of (private) built space. With its deliberate blankness, accompagnement shifts the focus of architecture from the objects to the milieu. Until the reign of Henri IV, streets and squares in Paris were ambiguous leftovers both in juridical and representational terms. There was no formalized <b>public</b> <b>space,</b> as the very idea of a public sphere did not make sense until a secularized concept of state, based on a social contract, emerged. Through an analysis of the first prototype of accompagnement – the parisian places royales – the essay argues that modern <b>public</b> <b>space</b> is essentially an invention of the age of government, the result of a conscious political and architectural choice. By comparing the development of the places royales with a rereading of key political theories of sovereignty from Bodin to Hobbes and Rousseau the essay traces a genealogy of early <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>space</b> as social and cultural product. Today, understanding the political instrumentality of <b>public</b> <b>space</b> is crucial, as it might give us insights in the roots of the conflicts that we witness in the contemporary city.

40|$|Most European {{integration}} {{theories have}} perceived the Commission as a unitary actor with a pro-integration agenda. Yet, empirical {{studies have shown}} that Commission actors harbor contending views about European governance. These findings raise a theoretical problem for European integration models, and an analytical puzzle for elite studies. European integration theories claiming an independent impact of the Commission on European decision making, need to disaggregate Commission motivations, which is the central purpose of this article. Consistent with recent elite studies, I employ an institutionalist lens to analyze how rules may impact orientations, but I refine the lens to assess institutional socialization and choice in multi-layered institutional settings. I formulate six hypotheses about the interplay between three settings relevant to top Commission officials: Commission, multi-level governance, <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>space.</b> Analytically, Commission officials appear reasoned individuals capable of selecting incentives rather than passive subjects of socialization. Evidence comes from 130 interviews and 80 questionnaires, collected in 1995 - 1996 from A 1 - 2 officials, analyzed through interpretative and quantitative analysis. I find that Commission officials constitute a special microcosm of the <b>European</b> <b>public</b> space: less nationalist than most citizens, but divided on the mix of intergovernmental and supranational architectural principles; center-left of the average political actor, but disagreeing on the desirable mix of market and state, opportunity and equity...|$|R

The legitimate role for Euro-citizens in the governance of Europe then depends on how the Union’s future political order is envisioned. The more the Union is moving away from a special purpose organization with limited tasks, responsibilities and powers, and transforming itself into a full-blown polity, the more important to assess the democratic quality of its political organization and system of governance. This paper discusses the project of democratising the EU.

Pluralism, or rather pluralization, is a determining concept in defining the new Europe being built: on the social, cultural and religious level plurality is no longer pathology, but physiology. To {{the point that the}} very idea of Nation-State that we have inherited seems no longer either explicative or representative, and perhaps not even descriptive of the social and institutional landscape of the various European countries. In this framework a kaleidoscope of cultures is taking shape, whose pieces (identities and cultural communities) are in continual movement and transformation, and of which European Islam is an important element, from both the statistical and symbolic point of view. This is however a presence with peculiar characteristics in respect to the Islam of the countries of origin: in particular because being a minority becomes a constitutive and transformational element. In this situation of ever greater pluralization and hence of inevitable confrontation, reactive identities and conflicts are developing to play a determining role in the designing of the map of European Islam, but also of Europe itself...|$|R
40|$|This {{volume is}} a product of a year-long {{collaborative}} project "the European Forum on Citizenship" in the academic year 1995 / 96 at the European University Institute. Is there a common ground on which a European citizenship can be constructed? This volume looks at four foundations of citizenship in Europe: the legacy of national identities, current designs and projects for social and political citizenship in Europe, a transitional <b>public</b> <b>space</b> as the basis of an active European citizenship, and a transitional collective identity as a symbolic boundary marker for European citizenship.

40|$|The {{convergence}} of the Romanian {{government to the}} <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>space</b> requires a permanent effort ofadaptation, which should make use of constructive constituents specific to our country and to apply them thecharacteristics of modern and efficient administrations. Continuous changes of expectations {{and the interests of}} citizens requires, however, that the publicadministration (and especially the local one) to continuously reform, which increases the difficulty of this process,which requires a flexible upper of public management. It is important, however, that - despite these difficulties - the process to be done in a legal and organizationalframework, on solid and firm coordinates, based on modern European principles, without affecting a specific area ofcity administration. This paper tries to x-ray this state of facts and proposes some interesting approaches related to themechanisms of integration of local public administration- LPA in this space. This way, analyzing the organization and functioning of the public sector, the paper stresses the changesoccurring in this area following the more pronounced implementation in the administration of the 3 E principle(economy, efficiency and effectiveness), on the background of an intense manifestation of local autonomy and financialdecentralization. The authors note and highlight the phenomena o "slipping" of the public sector towards the private sector,due to the emergence of competition and the need for efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public financialresources, which resizes the mode of action and responsibility for public management, decreasing this way the politicalconnotation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{proposition}} that the impact of European judicial politics on national modes of governance in the field of gender equality is partly mitigated by two major intervening variables: the existence of contrasted political opportunity structures and uneven access to justice in the European Union. In order to demonstrate this hypothesis, this study leads a systematic evaluation of these mediating variables in three member states. It aims at assessing {{the extent to which these}} factors constitute favourable stimulus and incentives or differently, conflict structures and contrarian forces for the expansion of Community judicial politics in the field of gender equality. The paper comes to the conclusion that the conceptualization of the complex dynamics of the emerging new <b>European</b> <b>public</b> policy <b>space</b> require a rethinking of the interactions between law and politics...|$|R
