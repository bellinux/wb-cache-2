500|$|Peter {{visits the}} Quahog Mini-Mart where Chris works {{after a visit}} to the local spa. After he threatens to sue the store for Chris' [...] "sexual remarks", Peter is given an {{unlimited}} <b>gas</b> <b>coupon</b> for a year by Carl. Peter begins {{to take advantage of the}} card, even taking a trip into space, until Lois suggests that the family travel to the Grand Canyon. They leave early the next morning but inadvertently leave Stewie behind at home, only realizing that when they visit the site of 9/11. They first contact Joe but cannot get a hold of him. They then contact Cleveland and Quagmire to look after Stewie. After not receiving any calls from either of them, Lois insists that the family return home to Stewie. While driving the car, Peter somehow enters the car next to them, causing the Griffins' car to crash. When the family attempts to ride a train home, Peter spends the last of the money that they saved on curtain rings. Lois becomes angered and blames all their misfortunes on Peter's stupidity, only to feel ashamed when he informs her that everyone else respects him for who he is. Eventually, Brian is able to get the family a ride in a pickup truck bound for Quahog.|$|E

5000|$|... 1939 - Honaré Noel, {{owner of}} a café clos, or house of prostitution, in Paris bought the Château from Andre Champrepus's nephew. The château was used as country holiday home for Noel's employees, the farm was rented out to a local animal dealer, the {{buildings}} were rented to a Paris suburb for a school, and the dependences were leased to a dairy, which became {{the center for the}} Resistance in the area. The Château was also the distribution center for food and <b>gas</b> <b>coupons</b> both during and after the War, until 1950. Germans occupied the Château‘s farm in the final months before the Liberation in August 1944.|$|R
25|$|Not all was rosy for Gray however.

But an Office of Price Administration clerk named Flack refused to give Gray the coupons, explaining that cartoons were not vital to the war effort. Gray requested a hearing and the original decision was upheld. Gray was furious and vented in the strip, with especial venom directed at Flack, government price controls, and other concerns. Gray had his supporters, but Flack's neighbors defended him in the local newspaper and tongue-lashed Gray. Flack threatened to sue for libel, and some papers cancelled the strip.

50|$|Hezbollah {{fighters and}} {{operatives}} use civilian vehicles systemically for day-to-day transport and combat. Mercedes and Volvo non-commercial vehicles are preferred {{for people with}} Range Rover, Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Toyota jeeps used for materiel. Hezbollah's logistics teams transport arms and ammunition in pickup trucks, while operatives extensively use dirt bikes for off-road travel. Once arriving at a battlefield, Hezbollah fighters generally discard their vehicles and fight on foot. Hezbollah relies heavily on civilian gas stations to refuel, vetting gas station owners and providing <b>gas</b> <b>coupons</b> to facilitate the process. Similarly, the group relies on public roads and private companies for much of its logistics, like electricity, water, medicine, and food. Israel has accused Hezbollah of using ambulances and Red Cross vehicles to move weaponry.|$|R

5000|$|In {{support of}} his position, {{defendant}} has cited United States v. Di Re (1948), 332 U.S. 581, 587, 92 L.Ed. 210, 216, 68 S.Ct. 222, 225. We do not find that case applicable {{to the situation before}} us. The police officers in that case located, in an automobile, a party previously named by an informant, who allegedly had counterfeit <b>gas</b> <b>coupons.</b> The defendant Di Re was a passenger in the vehicle and was searched and convicted upon the evidence seized from his person. The court in Di Re held that the warrantless arrest and search of defendant's person when he had committed no offense and was merely present in the vehicle was not justified. This case, involving a warrantless search of an automobile passenger, has no real bearing upon the proper application of section 108-9, which deals only with situations involving warrants. Defendant also has cited Stanford v. Texas (1965), 379 U.S. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 431, 85 S.Ct. 506. In Stanford the court considered a [...] "general warrant" [...] which the federal courts have repeatedly held to be invalid under the Fourth Amendment. In Stanford the officers went to the defendant's residence and seized about half of all the books in his house and all of his personal papers, 14 cartons in all. The court held, and rightly so, that no official of the State shall ransack a person's house and seize his books and papers under the unbridled authority of a general warrant. That is not the situation in the case before us as the officers here were conducting a search in a small bar or saloon under a specific warrant for the discovery of heroin and allied paraphernalia.|$|R
50|$|In 1941, {{during the}} Second World War, Miller {{got a job}} at North American Aviation, where he met Brett Weston. Miller and Weston's pooled <b>gas</b> ration <b>coupons</b> enabled them to drive out to the Valley and {{photograph}} in their free time. When the war ended, Miller took a position as a printer where he was able to test materials and develop his own prints in Gasparcolor (later to become Cibachrome). From 1945-6 he worked as an assistant to photographers Valentino Sarra, Ruzzie Green, and John Engstead on commercial jobs. These positions allowed him to shoot for Family Circle, Parents, American Weekly, Colliers, Life, and Time. In March and April 1946, he photographed Marilyn Monroe, at the time working as a model and still using the name Norma Jeane Dougherty. He sold a cover of her, dressed as a bride and holding his wife's prayer book, to True Romance. He met her again when he was the still photographer on the set of Some Like It Hot.|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{corrosion}} {{tests were conducted}} to investigate the corrosivity of moist plutonium oxide/chloride (PuO{sub 2 }/Cl-) salt mixtures on 304 L and 316 L stainless steel coupons. The tests exposed flat coupons for pitting evaluation and 'teardrop' stressed coupons for stress corrosion cracking (SCC) evaluation at room temperature to various mixtures of PuO{sub 2 } and chloride-bearing salts for periods up to 500 days. The two flat coupons were placed so that the solid oxide/salt mixture contacted about {{one half of the}} coupon surface. One teardrop coupon was placed in contact with solid mixture; the second teardrop was in contact with the headspace gas only. The mixtures were loaded with nominally 0. 5 wt % water under a helium atmosphere. Observations of corrosion ranged from superficial staining to pitting and SCC. The extent of corrosion depended on the total salt concentration and on the composition of the salt. The most significant corrosion was found in coupons that were exposed to 98 wt % PuO{sub 2 }, 2 wt % chloride salt mixtures that contained calcium chloride. SCC was observed in two 304 L stainless steel teardrop coupons exposed in solid contact to a mixture of 98 wt % PuO{sub 2 }, 0. 9 wt % NaCl, 0. 9 wt % KCl, and 0. 2 wt % CaCl{sub 2 }. The cracking was associated with the heat-affected zone of an autogenous weld that ran across the center of the coupon. Cracking was not observed in coupons exposed to the headspace <b>gas,</b> nor in <b>coupons</b> exposed to other mixtures with either 0. 92 wt% CaCl{sub 2 } or no CaCl{sub 2 }. The corrosion results point to the significance of the interaction between water loading and the concentration of the hydrating salt CaCl{sub 2 } in the susceptibility of austenitic stainless steels to corrosion...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the general}} {{environment}} of the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain {{is expected to be}} oxidizing in nature, the local chemistry within fuel canisters may be otherwise. The combination of low dissolved oxygen and corrosion of metallic fuels, such as Hanford's N-Reactor inventory, may produce reducing conditions. This condition may persist for periods sufficient to affect the corrosion and paragenesis of fuels and their reaction products. Starting in September 2001, unirradiated metallic uranium fuel was examined during batch tests under anoxic conditions. A series of tests carried out under inert atmosphere highlighted the rapid corrosion of the metallic uranium in EJ- 13 water at 90 C. During the oxidation of the uranium, uranium dioxide fines spilled from the fuel surface generating copious amounts of colloids. The proportion of uranium-associated colloids accounted for nearly 50 % to > 99 % of the uranium in solution after a brief period where no colloids were detected. The colloids were identified as individual (< 10 nm) and agglomerated uranium dioxide spheres as large as a few hundred nanometers in size. Silicate and alumino-silicate clays of diverse size and shape were also identified. The bulk size distribution as measured by dynamic light scattering was consistent with the microscopy observations in that the polydispersity indices were large, indicating a wide distribution of colloid particle sizes. The colloids were found to persist for periods beyond the scope of these tests and are at least partly stable. The anoxic experiments suggest that at least two mechanisms are responsible for uranium corrosion. The initial corrosion period is variably long but may last more than one month during which there is no net release of gas. Calculations of oxygen concentration in the vessel at the time of vessel closure show that this period is not consistent with the presence of dissolved oxygen, which would suppress H{sub 2 } production in undersaturated conditions. After this induction period, the fuel begins to produce H{sub 2 } <b>gas</b> until the <b>coupon</b> completely disaggregates into fine UO{sub 2 +x} powder...|$|R
