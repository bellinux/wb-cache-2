5|$|Critical {{response}} to Billie was mixed; some critics <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a strong addition to Charmed while others cited Cuoco's acting and the character's story arc with Christy {{as signs of}} the show's declining quality. After speculation about Billie's possible appearance in a spin-off series, it was confirmed all future plans for the show were canceled following The WB's closure to launch The CW. Cuoco later said that she prefer working on sitcoms over dramatic television shows due to demanding shooting schedule that she experienced while working on Charmed.|$|E
5|$|Liukin {{decided that}} she was not done with {{gymnastics}} and made her first post-Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic, where she competed only on balance beam. She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong. Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships, but decided to once again just perform on beam. She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team. Liukin was added to the national team and included in the World Championships selection camp. However, she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not quite up to World Championships standards.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing her}} job, Boisselier moved with her middle child, a son, to Quebec, where her eldest {{daughter}} was a student. Boisselier began {{to travel to}} discuss Clonaid, eventually becoming a high-profile speaker. Around that time, she reached the rank of Bishop within Raëlism.

She moved to the United States and began teaching at State University of New York at Plattsburgh for a short time before moving to Hamilton College in 2000 to teach chemistry.

She claimed she was initially popular at Hamilton College, but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> disrespected after her association with Clonaid was publicized.|$|E

5000|$|Rayburn's {{characterisation}} came in {{for particular}} praise, with Kliatt saying of Maggie that [...] "her personality practically jumps off the page", and that the supporting characters are [...] "nuanced" [...] and [...] "just as well-throughout". Entertainment Weekly described the titular character as [...] "a resourceful, likeable kid" [...] but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> [...] "simply drawn".|$|R

5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
25|$|Frances McDormand as Julie Hastings, a {{district}} attorney and Peyton's love interest. Raimi {{had wanted to}} work with Frances McDormand but the studio resisted this notion and almost cast Julia Roberts before Pretty Woman made her a star. At one point, they wanted Demi Moore for the role. The director even tested Bridget Fonda but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too young for Neeson.|$|E
25|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} relocated {{her job to}} the Pentagon, {{because they}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the UN. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined. The American Spectator alleged that Richardson knew more about the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the grand jury.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} {{elimination}} {{round of the}} Women's (63 kg) category at the 2012 London Olympics, Chaudhary was defeated by Yoshie Ueno by an Ippon in 81 seconds.

25|$|The Wei Shu (魏書) {{mentioned}} that Cao Pi issued an edict to Lady Zhen, {{asking her to}} move to the newly constructed Changqiu Palace (長秋宮) in Luoyang. Lady Zhen declined humbly, stating that she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not capable enough to manage the imperial harem, and also because she was ill. Cao Pi then consecutively sent another two edicts but Lady Zhen rejected both. It was around summer at the time. Cao Pi intended to fetch Lady Zhen from Ye to Luoyang in autumn, when the weather was cooler. However, Lady Zhen died of illness in Ye a few months later. Cao Pi mourned her death and posthumously elevated her to the status of an empress.|$|E

Both Lady Pan and her elder sister ended up as workers in a textile factory. Once, Sun Quan encountered her and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> extraordinary so he took her as his concubine. In 243, while she was pregnant, she dreamt of receiving a dragon head and gave birth to Sun Liang later. In 250, {{in the aftermath of a}} succession struggle between Sun Quan's sons Sun He and Sun Ba, Sun Liang was designated as the crown prince by his father. In the same year, Lady Pan requested Sun Quan to arrange a marriage for her elder sister and he agreed. In 251, Sun Quan instated Lady Pan as the empress. Empress Pan was known for charming but jealous as she never ceased slandering and harming Sun Quan's other wives until her death.|$|E

She had a test depth of [...] Mariotte had two rudders, one above the waterline for submerged use and the other below the waterline for regular use. She had two sets of diving planes, fore and aft, to control her depth below the water. The boat was evaluated in 1914 and the commission <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> generally successful except for her surface speed and range. It noted that she had problems with a following sea as the superstructure rapidly filled with water, but drained slowly so that she was much heavier by the bow and would tend to wallow. It also <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> insufficiently buoyant and had mediocre stability on the surface.|$|E

500|$|A non-canon novelization by Greg Cox {{was later}} {{released}} in 2005 {{to fill in}} the timeframe between [...] "Space Seed" [...] and the film, titled [...] This book expanded on Khan's romance with McGivers, and the author wanted to [...] "give her a spine" [...] as he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not [...] "the pride of Starfleet, and even less of a feminist role-model" [...] in her appearance in [...] "Space Seed".|$|E
500|$|In August she {{met with}} Alexander Kerensky, the Russian Prime Minister. Although she had been active with the socialist-leaning ILP in years past, Pankhurst had begun to see leftist {{politics}} as disagreeable, an attitude which intensified {{while she was in}} Russia. The meeting was uncomfortable for both parties; he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> unable to appreciate the class-based conflict driving Russian policy at the time. He concluded by telling her that English women had nothing to teach women in Russia. She later told the New York Times that he was the [...] "biggest fraud of modern times" [...] and that his government could [...] "destroy civilisation." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of [...] "Blow" [...] has been generally positive, with most critics praising the song's hook, opening, and party anthem vibe, though some found the chorus uninspiring and ordinary. Kesha's vocal work throughout {{the song was}} met with mixed reaction: some critics <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> both sassy and brash, while other critics felt that her personality was missing from the song. Commercially, [...] "Blow" [...] reached the top ten in the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and Australia, becoming her sixth consecutive top-ten hit in both countries as a solo artist. The song also reached the top ten in New Zealand, and the top 20 in Canadian Hot 100 in Canada.|$|E

500|$|After the {{production}} of So Amazin in 2006, Milian began dating Andre Lyon from {{the production}} group Cool & Dre. The pair dated until February 2009, {{when they decided to}} go on a break. Milian said that they were still really close, and decided to break up because it was [...] "hard to grow together when you live on two different coasts". The singer wanted to take more opportunities and learn more about herself, which she often let go when in a relationship, but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in a now-or-never situation. Milian described Lyon as an amazing guy, and said that although there was a chance for the couple in the future, she needed to focus on herself.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Dennis Hopper {{directed}} The Hot Spot, {{in which}} Connelly played Gloria Harper, a woman being blackmailed. The film was a box office failure but Connelly was praised. Stephen Schaefer wrote for USA Today, [...] "Anyone looking for proof that little girls do grow up {{fast in the}} movies should take a gander at curvaceous Jennifer Connelly [...] in The Hot Spot. Not yet 20, Connelly has neatly managed the transition from child actress to ingenue". During an interview with Shaeffer, Connelly commented on her first nude scene: [...] "The nudity {{was hard for me}} and something I thought about...but it's not in a sleazy context". The same year, director Garry Marshall considered her for the role of Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman, but ultimately <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too young for the part.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is part comedy, Cody {{initially}} intended {{for it to be}} a [...] "very dark, very brooding" [...] traditional slasher film. Close to [...] "a third of the way into the process" [...] she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> incapable of doing so because [...] "the humor just kept sneaking in". She stated, [...] "I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot of the things in the movie that are horrifying are funny to me." [...] Feeling that [...] "comedy films and horror films are kind of similar" [...] due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, [...] "They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience. So, I actually think comedy and horror are kind of similar in that way." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{some critics}} {{appreciated}} the features and urban appeal of [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", many criticized Carey's lack of {{presence on the}} song. While describing the singer as taking the [...] "back-seat" [...] throughout {{a large portion of}} the song, Becky Bain from Idolator complimented Carey's vocal runs towards the bridge and final chorus. Spins Julianne Shepherd felt that while a strong release, [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] didn't feature enough of Carey, given the near three-year gap between her last release, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel (2009). A writer from Rolling Stone described the singer as [...] "bewilderingly AWOL" [...] throughout most of the song, but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "on-point" [...] during her part. In a similar vein, Robert Conrey from Digital Spy was disappointed with the song's [...] "lack of Mariah Carey." ...|$|E
500|$|Brooks tolerated Barney's casual affairs {{well enough}} to tease her about them, and had {{a few of her}} own over the years, but could become jealous when a new love became serious. [...] Usually she simply left town, but at one point she gave Barney an {{ultimatum}} to choose between her and Dolly Wilde—relenting once Barney had given in. At the same time, while Brooks was devoted to Barney, {{she did not want to}} live with her as a full-time couple; she disliked Paris, disdained Barney's friends, hated the constant socializing on which Barney thrived, and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fully herself only when alone. To accommodate Brooks's need for solitude they built a summer home consisting of two separate wings joined by a dining room, which they called Villa Trait d'Union, the hyphenated villa. [...] Brooks also spent much of the year in Italy or travelling elsewhere in Europe, away from Barney. They remained devoted to one another for over fifty years.|$|E
500|$|The first actors cast in {{the pilot}} were Kirk Acevedo and Mark Valley in mid January 2008. John Noble and Lance Reddick were next to be cast, {{although}} it was incorrectly believed that Tomas Arana had been cast in Reddick's role. This {{was followed by the}} casting of Anna Torv, Blair Brown and Jasika Nicole. Abrams said that Torv was cast because she was a combination of [...] "sophistication, great talent, amazing looks and a complexity that {{is the key to the}} character being an interesting central character". Kurtzman <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> someone [...] "you want to spend time with", which was critical to a series about science. Joshua Jackson was the last series regular to be cast. Jackson auditioned for the role of James T. Kirk in Abrams' Star Trek and believed this is what impressed the producer to cast him in his television project. According to Abrams, Jackson's casting was [...] "very last minute".|$|E
