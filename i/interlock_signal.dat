40|$|Hardwired {{interlock}} card provides {{signal conversion}} between RS 422 inputs and TTL outputs. The failsafe design {{will be made}} by using additional pull-down and pull-up resistors on the RS 422 inputs. An additional function is the glitch suppression on the inputs to avoid HW interlock malfunction. The input signals should have some minimal duration (~ 0. 1 ms). The output signals are low active, i. e. low level = power channel is active. Two input connectors, one for 12 signals (25 -pin D-SUB male) and second one for one VCSEL <b>interlock</b> <b>signal</b> (9 -pin D-SUB male), are mounted on the crate rear panel.

40|$|The Machine Protection System (MPS) is a device-safety {{system that}} is {{designed}} to prevent damage to hardware by generating interlocks, based upon the state of input signals generated by selected sub-systems. It protects all the key machinery in the R&D Project called the Energy Recovery LINAC (ERL) against the high beam current. The MPS is capable of responding to a fault with an <b>interlock</b> <b>signal</b> within several microseconds. The ERL MPS is based on a National Instruments CompactRIO platform, and is programmed by utilizing National Instruments' development environment for a visual programming language. The system also transfers data (interlock status, time of fault, etc.) to the main server. Transferred data is integrated into the pre-existing software architecture which is accessible by the operators. This paper will provide an overview of the hardware used, its configuration and operation, as well as the software written both on the device and the server side...|$|E

50|$|Ascot {{railway station}} {{is the last}} station in {{metropolitan}} Brisbane to retain semaphore signalling and a mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabin, {{and is one of}} only seven such systems intact in Queensland. In 2008 the seven mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins still commissioned were Ascot (not used), Charters Towers, Ingham, Innisfail, Kuranda, Laidley (rarely used) and Mackay. There are about 19 surviving decommissioned <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins complete with their frames in Queensland (six have been relocated), along with 36 signal cabins minus their signal frames, and 10 known signal frames in various states of intactness. Approximately 100 mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>signal</b> cabins have been demolished at stations around Queensland.|$|R
40|$|Neutral beam {{injection}} (NBI) into low-density plasmas {{can cause}} serious {{damage to the}} vacuum vessel wall. It is necessary to stop the NBI when the plasma terminates. This needs a reliable density monitor for NBI interlock. A three-channel homodyne reflectometer, installed on a large helical device was used for an NBI interlock. Microwaves of 28. 5, 34. 9, and 40. 2 GHz were injected with O mode polarization. At present, a simple homodyne detection scheme is used. The reflected signal consists of a dc component due to local and reflected power and an ac component due to fluctuations {{in the position of}} the cutoff layer. Since the change in dc signal was very small, the root mean square value of the ac signal was used as the <b>interlock</b> <b>signal.</b> At present the 34. 9 GHz O mode channel, whose O mode cutoff density is 1. 5 Ã— 10 ^ 19 m^? 3, is used for the interlock.

40|$|The 2 -GeV {{electron}} linac at Pohang accelerator laboratory (PAL) {{has been}} operated continuously {{as a full}} energy injector for the Pohang Light Source (PLS) since Dec. 1994. There have been continuous {{efforts to improve the}} klystron-modulator (K&M) system more stable and reliable. To improve self-diagnostic, operation, monitoring, and remote communication, we recently developed a new modulator controller based on an industrial PC platform. The modulator controller mainly consisted of an <b>interlock</b> <b>signal</b> conditioning module, a fast pulse signal-conditioning module, and the main PC platform. Operating system of the PC is Windows NT 4. 0, and application software is developed with C++. The interlock signal-conditioning module generally carries digital and slowly varying clean analog signals. The fast pulse signal-conditioning module is used for pre-conditioning fast pulse and DC signals that inherently have high noise levels, such signals as a beam voltage, a beam current, an EOLC current, a HVDC voltage, and a HVDC current. All operation data of the K&M system can be acquired and saved in real time. We are upgrading the main PLS control system with EPICS. The industrial PC platform will function as an Input/Output Controller (IOC) in the future EPICS PLS control system. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen rapid growth in {{ultrasound}} imaging. Usual transducers for real-time scanner typically contain over 300 crystals where each emits and receives an ultrasound beam in rapid succession to form a sweep. The transducer is included in modern ultrasound equipments which are heavy and bulky, hence not suitable to be integrated in wearable systems. The challenging research activity we endeavored to perform is to realize a wearable, portable and automatic ultrasound [1] system integrated with breath and heart apex pulse system detector, which does not require human contribution in positioning and directing the acoustic wave. The novelty is the bi-modal use of the transducer, which, in addition to actively transmit and receive ultrasound signals for detecting heart wall movements, can behave as passive sensor at low frequency and acquire cardiac sound, breathing signal and heart beat-rate. A suitable electronic switching system allows changing from one modality to the other one. In order to assure the bi-modality, the transducer, made of piezoelectric material (PVDF), should have a low Q factor [2]. Q factor {{is defined as the}} ratio between the centre frequency (resonant frequency) and bandwidth, therefore a low value implies a broader working frequency range. The system is based on a textile band containing the transducer, which is connected to an electronic board inserted into a belt through electric paths, realized on a textile substrate. The same transducer excited at high frequency to generate an ultrasound echo, it is also used to acquire cardiac acoustic and breathing signals at low frequency. The system checks the subject status through the low frequency analysis, and when an anomalous event occurs in every part of the signals (shape, frequency etc.) it activates the ultrasound system to emit an impulse train that analyzes the mechanical heart wall movement. A simultaneous ECG signal is acquired to provide the <b>interlock</b> <b>signal</b> in the ultrasound investigation. Moreover it provides information about the electric behavior of the heart and can enrich the clinical picture of the cardiac activity in addition to the signals acquired by the ultrasound transducer. A single signal comprising breath and heart apex pulse is acquired by a charge amplifier. High frequency investigation has shown the movement of the heart wall in terms of spatial length expressed in centimeters. The accuracy of these results (Fig. 1) depends on how good the transducer adheres to the thoracic wall {{as well as on the}} high sampling frequency, and the algorithm implemented to localize the return echo. Nonetheless, several issues should be more deeply addressed. As the system should be wearable and used for a long time, the relative body-transducer displacement as well as skin-electrode mismatch are crucial aspects. Skin transducer or skin-electrode interfaces, indeed, should have a good electric coupling and, at the same time, should be comfortable for the subject wearing the system. As the system is thought to be used by a subject while he is doing usual daily actions, motion body can produce significant artefacts in the mechanical coupling and materials used...|$|E
