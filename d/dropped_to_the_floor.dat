5|$|Crucial to {{road and}} {{airfield}} development was {{the output of}} the Nine Mile Quarry. Initially it was run by the 1st Army Troops Company, which installed suspended electric lighting, allowing the quarry to be worked around the clock from 30 April 1942. Companies A and C of the 96th Engineer Battalion took over the running of the quarry in June. In turn, they were relieved by C Company of the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion in November. Work went on in three eight hour shifts per day, seven days a week. The face of the quarry was drilled from the top and <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> by blasting. Knapping hammers were used to break the stone into small pieces that could be lifted onto trucks by hand. There were two rock crushers on hand; an old model and a modern mobile diesel crusher supplied by the US Army.|$|E
5|$|As Owen Hart {{entered the}} steel cage for his {{championship}} match {{with his brother}} Bret, he immediately attacked Bret. Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT. Owen kicked Bret {{in the head and}} tried to escape from the cage. The brothers both tried to climb over the cage several times, but neither would let the other escape. The match consisted mainly of brawling, including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope. Owen climbed over the cage, but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen's hair. Owen performed a piledriver on Bret, but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars of the cage. As Owen tried to escape, Bret suplexed him back into the ring {{from the top of the}} cage. Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret, but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen. The match ended after Bret threw Owen's head into the steel cage and Owen's leg became trapped between the cage's bars. Bret climbed over the top of the cage and <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers. Neidhart padlocked the cage, and he and Owen attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene.|$|E

500|$|Childhood friends, Donnel Carty, 18, and Delano Brown, 17, {{had earlier}} that evening robbed chef Kurshid Ali, {{a middle-aged man}} in Kensal Green station, 20 minutes before Pryce arrived at the station {{on his way home}} from work. Pryce was walking from Kensal Green Tube station at about 2300 to 2330 GMT, when he was attacked. According to witness reports, Pryce was running along Bathurst Gardens from two black youths. According to {{testimony}} from Delano Brown, Donnel Carty stabbed Pryce after they had chased him from Kensal Green Tube station where police found a trail of blood and belongings, including a pair of gloves and papers regarding Pryce's wedding arrangements. As the youths chased Pryce, Carty [...] "fly-kicked" [...] him in the back and he <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> As Pryce attempted to stand up, Carty kicked him in the face. Trying to get away, Pryce began to fight Carty, as Carty stopped him. Some time during this Pryce was stabbed twice in the chest and once in the hip, the wounds penetrating vital organs including his heart. He also suffered cuts to his head, hands and torso. As Pryce's belongings lay scattered around him, Carty and Brown took Pryce's mobile phone and Oyster card, the only possessions of value Pryce was carrying. Carty then shouted 'What else have you got?' to which Pryce responded 'Nothing. You have got everything'. Carty and Brown then ran off towards Clifford Gardens, heading to Carty's home leaving Pryce dying on the ground. Pryce was later taken to Central Middlesex Hospital, where he was confirmed dead shortly after midnight.|$|E
2500|$|Manipulation of {{the ball}} may also be {{accomplished}} by various tricks, such as [...] "nudging". However, excessive nudging is generally penalized {{by the loss of}} the current player's turn (known as tilting) or ending of the entire game when the nudging is particularly violent (known as slam tilting). This penalty was instituted because nudging the machine too much may damage it. Many games also have a slam tilt {{in the bottom of the}} lower cabinet to end the game if the cabinet is raised and <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in an attempt to falsely trigger the coin counting switch.|$|E
