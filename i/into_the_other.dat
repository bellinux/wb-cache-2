5|$|During this voyage Arniston {{had just}} {{anchored}} at Benkulen on 27 June 1800, when the 26-gun French privateer Confiance attacked her. Arniston cut her anchor and gave chase, firing several broadsides <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ship, but the faster French ship {{was able to}} make an escape.Lindsay 1874, primary sources. On 9 October 1800, the East Indiaman Kent would be less fortunate; Confiance would capture Kent after a two-hour engagement.|$|E
5|$|Peter finds Walter and {{chooses to}} meet his father alone, as he {{believes}} Walter is upset from the past several days. Now at the beach house, Peter and Walter search for and retrieve a device that can seal shut the doorway <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> universe. Walter explains to Peter that he once lost something very dear to him {{and that he had}} to go and bring it back from another reality; the device was created to prevent something from following him.|$|E

5|$|While {{the trio}} attempt to contact {{reinforcements}} from Earth, Zinyak atomizes {{the planet and}} then explodes, killing everyone not already captured by the Zin, including Oleg Kirlov, Josh, Zimos, and Viola. Enraged, the Boss returns to the Steelport simulation to find their friends and reach Zinyak. After rescuing another prisoner of Zinyak, an artificial intelligence later named CID, and providing him with a physical body, the Boss, with his help, goes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Saint's simulations and rescues them from their nightmares.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

5|$|Advanced {{technology}} {{was required for}} the planning and construction of large reservoirs and canals. When constructing reservoirs, the gaps between low ridges in the dry zone plains were used for damming water courses. Two different techniques were used in construction; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to reservoirs. All the reservoirs and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network, so that excess water from one will flow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The locations of these constructions indicate that the ancient engineers were aware of geological formations in the sites as well, and made effective use of them. Underground conduits have also been constructed to supply water to and from artificial ponds, {{such as in the}} Kuttam Pokuna and the ponds at Sigiriya.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Don Brothwell {{considers}} {{that many of}} the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, has contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis and investigation. The use of sophisticated techniques, such as computer tomography (CT) scans, has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such scans allow the reconstruction of the body and internal examination. Of the 27bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The remains have a date range from the early 1st to the 4thcenturies. Investigation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> bodies relies on contemporary descriptions of the discovery.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E

5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 64 {{video game}} console has {{a library of}} games, which were {{primarily}} released in plastic ROM cartridges. Two small indentations {{on the back of}} each cartridge allows it to connect or pass through the system's cartridge dustcover flaps. All regions have the same connectors, and region-locked cartridges will fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> regions' systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge's casing. However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips that will only allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems have the same NTSC lockout, while Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import titles, but a few games require an additional boot code before they can be played.|$|E
5|$|Thus locked together, both captains ordered {{their ships}} to pour fire <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> So closely aligned were they that many cannon on both ships {{could not be}} run out, and instead had to be fired from inside the ships. The heat from this {{sustained}} bombardment was so intense that the wood began to blacken and burn as heavy roundshot smashed gaping holes in the sides of each ship: during the combat the ragged holes torn {{in the side of}} Hercule were so extensive that the planking between the gunports was torn away, leaving wide scars along the ship's sides. Casualties were heavy on both sides: 20 minutes after the action began a musket ball struck Hood in the thigh, severing his femoral artery. Fatally wounded and bleeding profusely, Hood was carried below and command passed to Lieutenant William Butterfield. The French casualties were significantly higher than the British, a result of the much higher rate of fire achieved by Hood's well-trained crew.|$|E

5|$|Twins were {{subjected}} to weekly examinations and measurements of their physical attributes by Mengele {{or one of his}} assistants. Experiments performed by Mengele on twins included unnecessary amputation of limbs, intentionally infecting one twin with typhus or other diseases, and transfusing the blood of one twin <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Many of the victims died while undergoing these procedures. After an experiment was over, the twins were sometimes killed and their bodies dissected. Nyiszli recalled one occasion where Mengele personally killed fourteen twins in one night via a chloroform injection to the heart. If one twin died of disease, Mengele killed the other so that comparative post-mortem reports could be prepared.|$|E
5|$|Alphonse {{is guided}} by the homunculus Wrath to the {{underground}} city beneath Amestris' Central City to reopen the Gate of Alchemy. There, they are attacked by the homunculus Gluttony, who fights and mortally wounds Wrath. At Wrath's insistence, Alphonse transmutes and sacrifices the two homunculi to use as material to open the Gate. Meanwhile, in Munich, the Thule Society persuades Noah into guiding them on how to correctly open the Gate based on what she had learned from reading Edward's mind. Edward learns from Lang that the Thule Society {{plans to use the}} weapons from his world to help Adolf Hitler in his attempt to start a revolution, and heads to stop them. Hohenheim and Envy are both transmuted {{at the same time that}} Alphonse transmutes Gluttony and Wrath. With the Gate opened, Eckhart leads a fleet <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> world, where she gains the ability to use alchemy. However, she begins to go mad with power and fear of her new surroundings and launches an attack on Central City. Alfons launches Edward in a rocket-powered plane to return him to his world before being gunned down.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
