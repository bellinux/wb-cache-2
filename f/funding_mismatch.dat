40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain the causes and {{consequences}} of the U. S. subprime mortgage crisis and how {{this has led to}} a generalized credit crunch in other financial sectors that ultimately affects the real economy. It postulates that despite the recent financial innovations, the financial strategies - leveraging and <b>funding</b> <b>mismatch</b> - that led to the present crisis are similar to those found in the U. S. savings and loans debacle of the late 80 s and in the Asian financial crisis of the late 90 s. However, these strategies contain new innovations that have heightened, not reduced, systemic risks and financial instability. They are as the title implies: old wine in new bottles. Going beyond these financial practices, the underlying structural causes of the crisis are located in the loose monetary policies of central banks, deregulation, and excess liquidity in financial markets that are a consequence of the kind of economic growth that produces various imbalances - trade imbalance, financial sector imbalance, and wealth and income imbalance. The consequences on risks, moral hazards and rolling bubbles are discussed. 11 page(s...|$|E
30|$|Ageing {{is a major}} {{population}} problem worldwide, including Hong Kong. With better medical technology, people typically live longer. In 2012, {{the life}} expectancy {{for men and women}} in Hong Kong was 81 and 86 years, respectively, an increase of 8 years compared with 30 years ago [1]. However, despite a longer lifespan, many elderly people are living with chronic illnesses, creating a huge demand for elderly services. The Hong Kong Government introduced the concept of ‘Ageing in Place’ in 2007. This latest policy paper on ageing explicitly encourages the elderly to stay at home and in the community [2, 3]. Although such a policy seems reasonable on paper, its implementation hinges on many associated supportive policies and services. Even though the number of elderly service providers has increased over the past few years, the demand still far exceeds the supply. In fact, elderly service providers are facing increasing difficulty {{to keep pace with the}} mass demand for their services. With such high demand and limited funding being allocated, elderly service workers are often forced to overwork but are underpaid and experience high work stress [4]. Elders, in turn, are being put at risk for substandard services caused by insufficient <b>funding,</b> <b>mismatch</b> of benefits allocation, the lack of manpower, highly stressed staff and much more. The present study was conducted to examine the recruitment challenges Hong Kong’s elderly care service providers are facing and their perceptions of the HKSAR government’s latest elderly policy, ‘Ageing in Place’, and the role of vocational education in training manpower for the industry.|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of taxpayers’ money has gone {{to a lot of}} SMME {{development}} initiatives. Despite this effort over the past 17 years, South Africa (SA) lags behind other developing countries, in promoting the growth and sustainability of SMMEs. The impact and achievements of government initiatives have fallen disappointingly short of aspiration (Business Development in South Africa. 2009. Occasional paper). Aims and Objectives: •To evaluate and reflect on the OR Tambo District Municipality SMME funding model and establish whether it has made the desired impact. •Determine if funds that have been channelled by the SA government to SMMEs for business expansion, start-ups, grants, and special industry development have yielded quantifiable results and •Assess the private funding institutions in assisting destitute entrepreneurs in the OR Tambo District municipality. Research methodology: The study was conducted using qualitative research and a questionnaire was used as a data collection tool. The researcher was able to get valuable information on stakeholders in the SMME sector. The stakeholders (SMMEs and funders), formed the core research sample. Results: findings suggest that the OR Tambo Municipality has a funding gap and the current funding model both from public and private funders is not effective in developing SMMEs in the municipality. The overwhelming majority of SMMEs agreed that there is a funding gap between funders and enterprises that seek funding in the ORTDM. “Financing gap” terminology, Underhill Corporate Solutions (UCS) (2011 : 52) defines it as, ‘a sizeable share of economically significant SMEs cannot obtain financing from banks, capital markets or other finance suppliers. ’ About 90 percent of the interviewed SMMEs agreed that there is huge funding gap and 10 percent disputed this and said that there is no funding gap; rather, it’s a <b>funding</b> <b>mismatch</b> between the funders and SMMEs which needs to be tackled by all SMMEs stakeholders. The funding model needs to be revamped so it can also be accessible to start-ups, the unemployed, people with less business management experience and limited skills, and to all sectors of the economy. Various recommendations and suggestions for further research are made based on the research findings. Conclusion: The study has shown that the current SMME funding model is not effective and does not assist in developing SMMEs in ORTDM. The research findings depict the funding plight of SMMEs in South Africa; the SMME plight in ORTDM is more real than imaginary. 70 percent of SMMEs expressed less confidence in government SMMEs agencies in terms of assistance. The bigger portion of SMMEs felt that the funds channelled to government agencies were not providing significant assistance in developing SMMEs in ORTDM. Recommendations: The conclusive response from the sample, reflect structural challenges in the current funding model. About 70 percent of funding institution`s officials said “yes”, the low yield on SMME growth is a matter of funding. The funds which were meant to fund SMMEs for one reason or the other do not reach SMMEs which are looking for funding. Hence the funds channelled in the sector in the last 17 years have not yielded the desired results. 40 percent interviewed government officials conceded that there is serious political meddling in funding SMMEs in the whole province and ORTDM could not be an exception to this rule. 80 percent of interviewed SMMEs in ORTDM said funding was their main problem, and the other 20 percent indicated that their problem was not a matter of funding. The public and the private sector must revise the current funding model or devise another funding model that will: •bridge the existing current funding gap, •distribute the SMME allocated budget and achieve maximum efficiency in budget allocation...|$|E
40|$|To open an {{international}} conference on “Rethinking Financial Markets,” this address seeks to frame that inquiry {{from the perspectives of}} scholars in the fields of law, economics, finance, and accounting. In attempting to identify what it is about financial markets that is worth rethinking, the address focuses on market changes that increase decentralization, fragmentation, globalization, disintermediation, and <b>funding</b> <b>mismatches.</b> The address also argues that the scholarly perspectives are inherently interrelated: although scholars in each field proceed from their own toolkits, they all aim for the common normative goal of optimizing financial markets to enable capital formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this Symposium {{originally}} was “Rethinking Financial and Securities Markets. ” It is, of course, somewhat presumptuous for scholars to try to rethink financial markets per se. Markets, including financial markets, are driven primarily by supply and demand. But scholars can and should try to influence the future of financial markets by rethinking their fundamental aspects. This Symposium presents work from leading scholars {{in the fields of}} law, economics, finance, and accounting. I will try to frame the discussion from the perspectives of these four disciplines. First, however, we need to identify what it is about financial markets that is worth rethinking. I will focus on ways in which financial markets have been changing. They are increasingly decentralized and fragmented. They are increasingly direct sources of firm capital—a process called disintermediation. They are increasingly global. They are increasingly creating <b>funding</b> <b>mismatches,</b> as short-term securities are used to finance long-term capital needs. And they (as well as financial market products) are increasingly complex and obscure to market participants, even with full disclosure. I will refer to these “financial market changes” throughout my talk...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energy is}} key to {{decarbonising}} the European economy and mitigating climate change. For national and European Union policies to be successful, {{they need to be}} coherent and work together. We investigated whether EU regional development policies supported the deployment of renewable energy sources in a number of EU Member States. We find that regional policy is not well-aligned with the objective to extend renewables in the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Poland. There are inconsistencies between the two policies including: mismatches in renewables targets and respective cohesion policy allocations; mismatches in operationalization across energy and cohesion policies; insufficiently clear description of the relevance of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAP); and a mismatch between the existing rhetorical commitment for integrating markets and grids, and substantial allocations in EU regional <b>funds.</b> These <b>mismatches</b> may impede the effective use of regional funding to support renewable energy sources...|$|R
5000|$|On 26 April 2015, {{international}} aid agencies and governments mobilized rescue workers and {{aid for the}} earthquake. They faced challenges in both getting assistance to Nepal and ferrying people to remote areas as the country had few helicopters. Relief efforts were also hampered by Nepalese government insistence on routing aid through the Prime Minister's Disaster Relief Fund and its National Emergency Operation Center. After concerns were raised, it was clarified that [...] "Non-profits" [...] or NGOs already in the country could continue receiving aid directly and bypass the official <b>fund.</b> Aid <b>mismatch</b> and supply of [...] "leftovers" [...] by donors, aid diversion in Nepal, mistrust {{over control of the}} distribution of funds and supplies, congestion and customs delays at Kathmandu's airport and border check posts were also reported. On 3 May 2015, restrictions were placed on heavy aircraft flying in aid supplies after new cracks were noticed on the runway at the Tribhuvan airport (KTM), Nepal's only wide-body jet airport.|$|R
40|$|<b>Fund</b> Currency <b>mismatch</b> is {{a vehicle}} that exposes the economy to {{systemic}} risk, {{but it is also}} an engine of growth. We analyze this dual role at the macro and the micro levels. At the aggregate level, we construct a new measure of currency mismatch in the banking sector that controls for bank lending to unhedged borrowers—i. e., those with no foreign currency income. Using our measure, we find that across emerging European economies, increases in currency mismatch are associated with higher growth in tranquil times, but also with more severe crises. On net, after taking into account the crisis period, we find a positive link between currency mismatch and growth. These results are also confirmed for a broader sample of emerging economies. In our firm-level analysis, we find that in emerging Europe, currency mismatch relaxes borrowing constraints and enhances growth across sets of firms that arguably are the most credit constrained—i. e., small firms in non-tradables sectors—but not across large firms. An advantage of our approach is that it considers both listed and non-listed firms, and so we are able to effectively capture the effects of currency mismatch across the entire economy, not just the financially privileged stock market listed firms...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on industrial organization with a particular focus on the structures of financial markets. The first chapter theoretically studies how search friction affects competition and resource allocation in crowdfunding loan markets, which are described using a many-to-one matching framework. Namely, competitive fundraisers must accumulate multiple investors to complete a transaction. I develop a dynamic matching model with a fixed sample search, a la Burdett and Judd (1983), in which fundraisers compete in interest rates while investors look for good investment targets. I highlight two important economic forces in the model. First, investors can only observe {{a limited number of}} quotes. Second, a surplus cannot be created until a fundraiser attracts contributions from enough investors. I show that in the presence of search friction, fundraisers implement mixed strategies to set interest rates in a unique stationary equilibrium, which results in rate dispersion even if the goods are homogeneous. Regarding resource allocation, I show that in the many-to-one market, rate dispersion creates an endogenous coordination mechanism among anonymous and independent investors, thereby making it easy for them to concentrate their investments. In other words, search friction improves allocation efficiency in a crowdfunding market compared with its perfect competition counterpart. Based on the theoretical framework constructed in the first chapter, the second chapter empirically studies the market structure of the crowdfunding market. I construct a novel data set based on a large panel of fundraisers' behaviors. Using reduced form analysis, I find evidence of persistent rate dispersion and <b>funding</b> <b>mismatches,</b> which are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the search model. I also show that the model is identifiable and can be estimated using a non-parametric approach, which allows me to measure the allocation efficiency. Regarding methodology, I demonstrate that it is sufficient to use projects' ranks to recover search friction primitives, which reduces the computational burden and increases the precision. The third chapter studies how the combination of adverse selection and moral hazard affects the design of financial contracts. Specifically, the chapter studies an optimal mechanism design problem,a la Mussa and Rosen (1978), in the presence of limited enforcement. In the study, the bank (principal) designs loan contracts to screen firms (agents) with unobserved productivities. Meanwhile, the bank cannot prevent the firm from consuming acquired funds without producing anything. The impediment of forming contracts creates an endogenous outside option for all borrowers. I show that in the optimal mechanism, loan sizes for higher types are decreased by ironing, i. e., by pooling on the top. In addition, the lower types produce at the second-best level. Moreover, I show that firms' participation is independent of the enforcement level...|$|R

40|$|Essays on Equity Portfolio Management This {{dissertation}} contains three essays involving {{empirical research}} in the area of equity portfolio management. Specifically, two of the essays contribute to the existing funds management literature by examining issues concerning portfolio performance evaluation and asset allocations. These being, equity <b>fund</b> benchmark <b>mismatching,</b> and equity <b>fund</b> industry allocations during the Australian mining boom. The third essay investigates issues relating to socially responsible investing. The first essay uses Australian equity fund data to examine the appropriateness of equity funds’ self-reported benchmarks. Given the lack of regulation surrounding the benchmarking of Australian managed funds and the absence of publicly available equity style indices, this essay explores if fund benchmarks are able to adequately capture passive investment styles and whether funds are better suited to alternative benchmarks. This essay further explores if funds with inappropriate benchmarks are able to outperform relatively, on account of the strategic nature of managers to report underperforming benchmarks, and whether this influences asset flows. The final essay of this dissertation provides a measure for the value of this non-financial satisfaction that accrues to individuals from investing in a socially responsible manner. This non-financial benefit is referred to as the “psychic dividend” of SRI. Previous studies attempt to quantify this value as the difference in certainty equivalent returns of SRI and non-SRI portfolios. This chapter extends the definition of certainty equivalence to consider constant relative risk aversion and loss aversion...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{management}} is a resource management approach that acknowledges our limited {{understanding of how}} natural systems respond to human alterations by treating policies and management interventions in natural systems as experiments from which to learn. In a relatively new field such as river restoration, adaptive {{management is}} especially appealing, as it allows managers to learn while acting and promises to reduce uncertainty. By interviewing practitioners and reviewing restoration and adaptive management plans, I assessed the application of adaptive management in ten river restoration projects {{on the west coast}} of North America. Although definitions and applications of adaptive management vary widely among practitioners, the projects considered here share three common elements: recognition of uncertainty in river restoration and management, a commitment to monitor, and willingness to adjust actions based on information learned about the system. Most interviewees noted that {{it is too early to}} single out any positive ecological or social outcomes or even specific knowledge gained about the system through adaptive management; moreover, the site specific conditions of each stream have largely precluded knowledge transfer between restoration efforts. Practitioners identified a considerable number of barriers in attempting to implement adaptive management. Social and institutional challenges include high costs and limited availability of <b>funding,</b> a <b>mismatch</b> between the lengthiness of the adaptive management process and short funding cycles, agency and stakeholder impatience with the slow pace of adaptive management, a lack of leadership for monitoring and coordinating efforts, and risk aversion among agency personnel and stakeholders. Technical challenges encountered include a limited understanding of how to apply adaptive management and difficulties in translating results from site-level restoration projects to an understanding of the river system. The case study analyses suggest that the successful application of adaptive management will require long-term and stable funding, a long-term institutional commitment, greater leadership, more structured coordination, and training for resource managers...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of corporate debt markets in recent decades, especially short-term debt facilities and bank debt, has made funding more accessible for corporate borrowers. On the other hand, the changing environment of debt markets also creates new challenges for corporate borrowers. First, as the debt maturity structure has become shorter, companies face higher liquidity pressure. Second, since banks also increasingly rely on short-term wholesale <b>funding,</b> the maturity <b>mismatch</b> of bank {{assets and liabilities}} has widened, further increasing economy-wide liquidity risk. These problems were illustrated by the most recent liquidity crisis that lasted from 2007 to 2009. Understanding the implications of borrowing using short-term debt therefore is crucial for the modern corporate finance. Moreover, the issues regarding the maturity mismatch of the banking sector imply that fluctuations in bank credit might increase, as banks become more sensitive to liquidity constraints. This thesis explores {{a number of issues}} regarding the use of short-term debt by non-financial companies, as well as the implications of fluctuations in bank credit for corporate financial and investment policies. The thesis contains three empirical research essays, presented individually in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. The first essay investigates the implications of debt maturity structure on corporate investment activities in the presence of firm specific default risk. The second and the third essays examine the implications of bank credit cycles on corporate activities. Essay 2 studies the effect of bank credit cycles on firms’ choice of external financing issues, whereas Essay 3 examines the effect of bank credit on corporate liquidity management policies and the spending on different types of investment...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} international capital flows on small open economies from a theoretical and empirical perspective. The �first chapter shows that where maturity mismatch is widespread, as in emerging markets, greater capital flow volatility negatively affects investment, output, and aggregate productivity. I build {{a model of a}} small open economy in which �financial frictions force �firms to engage in maturity <b>mismatch,</b> <b>funding</b> long-term projects with short-term debt. Greater uncertainty regarding the future availability of foreign borrowing causes �firms to cut long-term investment, depressing aggregate investment and generating an endogenous drop in aggregate productivity. The second chapter {{examines the}} relationship between capital flow volatility and economic performance using unique monthly frequency data set on international capital flows. I show that it is specifically the volatility of portfolio debt flows that negatively affects investment. Using �financial development as a proxy for the extent of maturity mismatch in the economy, I �find that the negative impact of debt flows is smaller where financial markets are more developed. Finally, I use industry-level data to show capital flow volatility depresses investment more in industries with longer average time-to-build. These �findings are consistent with a role for maturity mismatch in transmitting volatility shocks. The third chapter studies episodes of large capital in flows. These events are typically followed by an economic downturn and a reallocation of labor and capital into the nontradables sector. The extent of labor reallocation is significantly related to the depth and length of the post-episode downturn. We interpret our results using a model of a two sector economy, showing that capital in flows episodes generated by a fall in international interest rates or a rise in future productivity will push labor into the notradables sector. In flows caused by a productivity increase that has already occurred shift labor into tradables production. Allocation of labor therefore provides information on the underlying shock driving the capital inflows...|$|R
