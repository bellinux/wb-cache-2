Although he had several successes on Broadway after the First World War, he encountered strongly negative criticism in a 1921 production of Macbeth and in three productions in a row in 1925. Afterwards, he never again appeared on the New York stage. In 1925 he signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he became a close friend of Louis B. Mayer and for whom he made numerous films.

40|$|The {{development}} of simple regression relationships, based on finite element (FEM) analyses of cutting a sandy loam soil by medium-deep subsoiler will provide confidential and quick tools {{to predict the}} subsoiler draught requirement for any combination of moisture content (w), wet bulk density (rho (w)) and tillage depth (d). Large number of FEM analyses were performed to assess the effect of <b>w,</b> <b>d</b> and rho (<b>w)</b> on subsoiler draught. This draught was calculated from the output of 126 FEM modelling analyses. The model variations were selected based on the interaction among the studied variables, namely, six moisture contents ranging from 0. 03 to 0. 22 m(3) m(- 3), five wet bulk densities ranging from 1. 3 to 2. 0 Mg/m(3) and six tillage depths ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 37 m. The interaction among these three variables was also taken into consideration, and a multiple linear regression analysis was performed aiming at establishing a mathematical relationship for simulating the draught variation {{as a function of}} these variables. Further relationship was developed for relating the variation in draught with iv, d and dry bulk density (rho (d)) The FEM showed that subsoiler draught increased with <b>d,</b> rho (<b>w)</b> and rho (<b>d),</b> whereas it decreased with w. The decrease in draught with w did not extend beyond a w of 0. 17 m(3) m(- 3), since the draught calculated for 0. 22 m(3) m(- 3) w was very close to that calculated for a w of 0. 17 m(3) m(- 3). Regression equations developed to relate the subsoiler draught with <b>w,</b> <b>d,</b> rho (<b>w)</b> and rho (<b>d)</b> were of quite simple forms, and had high determination coefficients (R- 2) close to 0. 95. These equations indicated that the horizontal force varied linearly with w and non-linearly with <b>d,</b> rho (<b>w)</b> and rho (<b>d).</b> This non-linear variation of draught was found to be a quadratic function of <b>d</b> and rho (<b>w)</b> and a cubic function of rho (d). A comparison of the calculated and measured draught for cutting a similar sandy loam soil with a similarly designed subsoiler, showed a good approximation. The small divergence between the calculated and measured draught was attributed to the difference in soil texture and subsoiler chisel length. Thus, the regression equation developed proved to be a capable tool of predicting the draught requirements of the selected tillage tool design, when cutting sandy loam soils under any combination of <b>w,</b> <b>d</b> and rho (<b>w).</b> (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.

In 1913, while on tour in the United States with Fred Karno's comedy group, he {{accepted}} a contract to work for Mack Sennett's Keystone film company. During his time at Keystone, he began writing and directing some of the films in which he starred. Chaplin signed with the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company in 1915, and the year after with the Mutual Film Corporation. In 1918, Chaplin began producing his own films, initially releasing them through First National and then through United Artists, a corporation he co-founded with Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and <b>D.</b> <b>W.</b> Griffith. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Chaplin was accused of being a Communist sympathiser, which he denied. He remained a British subject and, while travelling to England in 1952 to attend the premiere of his film Limelight, his American re-entry permit was rescinded. Chaplin eventually settled in Switzerland, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life. He made his last two films in England.|$|E
5|$|Parallel with {{improvements}} in sound-on-film technology, {{a number of}} companies were making progress with systems that recorded movie sound on phonograph discs. In sound-on-disc technology from the era, a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical interlock to a specially modified film projector, allowing for synchronization. In 1921, the Photokinema sound-on-disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to <b>D.</b> <b>W.</b> Griffith's failed silent film Dream Street. A love song, performed by star Ralph Graves, was recorded, as was a sequence of live vocal effects. Apparently, dialogue scenes were also recorded, but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them. On May 1, 1921, Dream Street was re-released, with love song added, at New York City's Town Hall theater, qualifying it—however haphazardly—as the first feature-length film with a live-recorded vocal sequence. There would be no others for more than six years.|$|E
5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and <b>D.</b> <b>W.</b> Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before {{the development of}} continuity editing, however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E
