It followed Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (Oneida I) (1974), holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction, and was followed by City of Sherrill v.

5|$|Unusually for an aristocrat of the period, Bute owned {{almost all}} of his lands fully, as an owner in <b>fee</b> <b>simple,</b> rather than having his rights diluted through {{arrangements}} with trustees. When he married in 1818, Bute placed his English and Wales estates into a trustee arrangement for any future children, but this agreement expired with Lady Maria's death in 1842; when he remarried in 1845 a similar trustee agreement was set up, although in this version the Glamorgan estates were administered separately from his other holdings in England and Wales. Bute continued to run his network of estates and estate managers personally, helped by Onesipherus Bruce, a barrister-agent and close friend.|$|E

5000|$|Some scholars, such as John V. Orth, {{believe that}} this {{explanation}} (to promote the right to transfer the land) {{of the origin of}} the Rule is inaccurate. In their view the Rule originated as the courts' response to an estate-planning technique in the 14th century, long before the litigation in Shelley's Case. A tax known as the [...] "relief" [...] had to be paid to the feudal lord (the Crown) when a tenant's heir inherited the land. To avoid this estate tax, if the grant to the land were framed in term of a life estate in the grantee followed by a remainder in the grantee's heirs, then upon the grantee's death his heirs would not inherit the land, but received it as a vested remainder. As a consequence, the heir would take the land without having to pay the relief. The courts could not abide such a transparent attempt to circumvent the tax system, and the Rule was invented to deal with this problem by converting these transfers into <b>fees</b> <b>simple</b> absolute so as to allow the relief to be collected upon the grantee's death. Later, when the relief was abolished, the Rule continued to survive in the common law due to inertia ("it is the genius of the common law to add, but not to subtract"), the [...] "promote the right to transfer the land" [...] explanation was concocted to explain the continued existence of the Rule. Note that {{it is not at all}} uncommon for rules of common law, once their original motivation falls away, to acquire a new justification, and in the process also, sometimes, a new meaning. Many examples of such processes are given in Oliver Wendell Holmes's The Common Law.|$|R

We estimate returns from market-timing strategies using aggregate data on net flows for a large sample of equity mutual funds, available to Italian investors, that buy stocks in the following markets: Europe and the euro area, the United States and Emerging markets. In all cases, buy-and-hold over-performs market-timing with extra returns that go from 0. 24 per cent per quarter (Europe and euro area) to 0. 87 per cent per quarter (US market). These differences are not explained by differences in risk and risk exposure.

40|$|The State of Hawaii has {{a unique}} land {{ownership}} problem directly affecting many of the state 2 ̆ 7 s homeowners: {{a handful of people}} own {{a large percentage of the}} land available for residential housing. 2 ̆ 2 Consequently, a significant proportion of homeowners rent, under long-term leases, the land on which their homes are built. In 1967 the Hawaii legislature took action to break up this concentration of ownership by enacting the Land Reform Act. The legislature declared that such ownership was a threat to the health, safety, and welfare of Hawaii 2 ̆ 7 s citizens because of its significant contribution to the spiraling inflation of land values. To alleviate the problem, the Act authorized a redistribution of the <b>fees</b> <b>simple</b> from the few landowner/lessors to the many homeowner/lessees, using the power of eminent domain. Since, at first blush, it appeared that the State of Hawaii was merely transferring private property from one private per son to another in defiance of the public use requirement of eminent domain, serious doubts were raised as to the constitutionality of the Act. The United States Supreme Court, however, had 2 ̆ 2 no trouble concluding 2 ̆ 2 that the Act was a constitutional exercise of the eminent domain power. The Court gave complete deference to the Hawaii legislature 2 ̆ 7 s determination of public use 2 ̆ 2 by classifying the Act as ordinary socio-economic legislation enacted pursuant to the state 2 ̆ 7 s police power. By focusing on the breadth of a state 2 ̆ 7 s police power and on the deferential standard of review, the Court successfully avoided an independent examination of public use, a traditional judicial function. This Note will demonstrate that the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s deference to the Hawaii legislature 2 ̆ 7 s public use determination was an unwarranted departure from case precedent and that the Court should have decided the case on the merits. This Note also will argue that the minimum rationality standard generally used to review socio-economic legislation is inappropriate in state eminent domain cases because only the state 2 ̆ 7 s power is considered, while the interests of the condemnees are ignored...|$|R

40|$|On-street urban {{parking spaces}} are {{typically}} regulated by either a meter fee or a time restriction. This paper shows that, when the off-street parking market is perfectly competitive, meter fees are {{more efficient than}} time restrictions. When on-street parking is free, albeit subject to a time restriction, too many drivers choose to engage in socially wasteful searching for on-street spaces. In contrast, with a meter fee, the relative benefit of parking on-street is reduced, and total search can be minimised. A linear meter fee structure is shown to be optimal. A simple policy prescription is also proposed. Set on-street meter fees equal to off-street parking <b>fees.</b> Finally, a <b>simple</b> numerical model calibrated to central London suggests {{that the use of}} optimal meter fees increases parking welfare vy around 5 % over an optimal time restriction. ...|$|R

We characterize what types of environments lead to a low Price of Simplicity and show that in a range of environments, the loss of revenue from using <b>simple</b> entry <b>fees</b> is small. We then study the Price of Simplicity for a simple non-linear pricing (price discrimination) scheme based on the Paris Metro Pricing.

40|$|Survey {{evidence}} shows that investor expectations on future market realizations are highly correlated with in ows into mutual funds and tend to extrapolate information from past returns. This work investigates cyclical determinants of net aggregate fund ows in Emerging Markets, it measures the profitability of market-timing strategies of Italian investors in equity mutual funds and provides first insights {{about the effects of}} these strategies on asset prices. Chapter 2 investigates how cyclical variables drive net aggregate fund ows towards Emerging Markets (EMs). Through the aggregation of net ows of all open-end dedicated funds, the analysis finds that ows in equity and fixed income are driven by recent past performance in both developed and emerging economies. Further analysis confirms that much of the evidence comes from US and EU larger mutual funds. A structural VAR shows that ows become more responsive through time to market uncertainty and rates. In particular, after the Great Recession ows exhibit a lower reaction to the S&P index, becoming more responsive to market volatility and to US interest rates. Furthermore the US consumer sentiment index has {{a key role in the}} explanation of fund ows and it increased through time with an effect that is more sluggish and persistent with respect to other cyclical determinants. Chapter 3 shows that simple buy-and-hold strategies beat the market-timing strategies effectively used by Italian investors in equity mutual funds.
