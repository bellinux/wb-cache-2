5|$|The Fringe team {{is called}} {{to the scene of}} a robbery of a metal depository; the body of one of the thieves, shot by a {{security}} guard, inexplicably floats off the ground, while a second culprit has gotten away. They find that the thief <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> with a supply of osmium, one of the densest elements, and an autopsy later reveals that the dead thief's body is filled with the metal. Tracking a security card on the body, they enter a warehouse where they find the second culprit, dead, along with the bodies of several more people, all of them paraplegic. Walter (John Noble) notes that the physical properties of osmium (both gravitational and thermal) have been reversed, and by melting the osmium collected from the first victim using liquid nitrogen, they detect the presence of the rarer element lutetium, typically only present in meteorites.|$|E

[...] Anjali Patel of women's magazine Bustle commented that [...] "Hestia's blue chest ribbon has become part of her signature look in the show, a look that girls across Japan — not just cosplayers, but everyday women — are starting to emulate", and [...] "emulating cool anime heroines would definitely earn anyone some major cool points." [...] Alix Culbertson of Sunday Express reported that [...] "hoards of Japanese women are tying ribbons below their breasts and around their arms in a bid to increase their busts", resulting in mixed results. GoBoiano also noted this trend, jokingly adding [...] "such a quality ribbon".|$|E
2500|$|Tom Noyse of TheMusic.com {{gave the}} album an {{overwhelmingly}} positive review, writing [...] "This newfound experimentation from Birds Of Tokyo is fully apparent and it hits hard. The production is quite immaculate and {{is near the}} best they have yet created. March Fires is absolutely brilliant." [...] Like other reviewers, he also noted of the band's musical evolution and light departure from their previous works; [...] "Progression is inevitable. To evolve in music, {{you need to keep}} ideas fresh and move forward. This is truly evident in the fourth album by Perth-bred alternative rockers, Birds Of Tokyo.". Nick Linde of Tom Magazine also gave the album a positive review, and also touched upon the difference of sound March Fires presented, writing [...] "The new album from West Australian band Birds of Tokyo has a little bit of old {{and a little bit of}} new."

2500|$|In early September, it was {{reported}} that Kat would confess the affair to Alfie, but would refuse to name the man involved. Shane Richie spoke to Inside Soap, saying that Alfie has no reason to believe Kat is cheating on him, assumes she is just partaking in harmless flirtation, and fully trusts her. He opined that Alfie believes Kat would not lie to him after having affairs in the past, but does not believe her excuses when she receives flowers from her lover. This leads to Kat confessing. Richie said that Alfie's [...] "heart [...] break in two". Richie went on to describe the Moons' marriage as [...] "a bit staid" [...] because Alfie is [...] "set in his ways" [...] while Kat is [...] "out looking for a bit of fun." [...] He explained that Alfie is very committed to Kat, and is [...] "in this marriage for the long run." [...] He said that viewers may not want to see Kat and Alfie totally happy, describing them as [...] "like Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor [...] They can't be with each other and they can't be without each other." [...] He then promised that [...] "what happens to Alfie next is absolutely great!" [...] When asked what Alfie might do when he finds out who Kat is having the affair with, Richie said that he would get revenge, as [...] "everyone forgets Alfie's been in jail. Marriage <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> his edge, but if he finds out his wife has been with one of his closest friends, well, any bloke would want to cut the other blokes knackers [...] off, wouldn't he?" [...] Richie added that the cast were [...] "thrilled" [...] with the storyline, saying that everyone involved is enjoying it. It was confirmed that viewers would not find out who Kat was having the affair with at this time, and that suspects would still be eliminated one at a time. Inside Soap then reported that a second suspect would be eliminated [...] "very soon". Michael was then eliminated in the episode broadcast on 14 September.|$|E

60|$|Although our author very liberally administers {{relief to}} the people of France, its {{government}} has not been altogether so gracious. Since the peace, she <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> but a single vingtième, or shilling in the pound, and some small matter in the capitation. But, if the government has relieved them in one point, it has only burdened them the more heavily in another. The Taille,[65] that grievous and destructive imposition, which all their financiers lament, without being able to remove or to replace, has been augmented no less than six millions of livres, or 270,000 pounds English. A further augmentation of this or other duties is now talked of; and it is certainly necessary to their affairs: so exceedingly remote from either truth or verisimilitude is the author's amazing assertion, that the burdens of France in the war were in a great measure temporary, and must be greatly diminished by a few years of peace.|$|E
