Yet he {{understood}} what was said. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings {{as if he wanted to}} thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him." ...|$|E

It {{was a strange}} thing, but it was less his talents and his remarkable intelligence that appealed to me, but the defects in his character. I had {{in front of me}} one of the most extraordinary men of our time; big, strong, vigorous, energetic, {{and at the same time}} clever and devious, with a spirit full of resources. [...] This audacious man wasn't afraid to show who he was.... He told me all of his accomplishments during his administrative career, leaving out nothing; he could have talked for six hours without a break, since it was his favourite subject, himself. I wasn't at all displeased.... It seemed to me that he was exactly the man I needed to fight against the ideas and prejudices of a whole school of economics, against devious people and skeptics coming from the Stock Market, against those who were not very scrupulous about their methods; he was just the man. [...] Whereas a gentleman of the most elevated spirit, cleverness, with the most straight and noble character, would inevitably fail, this vigorous athlete... full of audacity and skill, capable of opposing expedients with better expedients, traps with more clever traps, would certainly succeed. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the Paris works and offered to put him in charge." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Medwin and the mumps. Jimmy seemed interested.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> {{it and how}} {{her first}} entreaties had {{referred}} to his forgiveness.|$|R
60|$|First <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> Leonard de Cartienne, his bad {{influence}} over Cecil, and his correspondence with Mr. Marx. He listened without remark. Then I paused to take breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I couldn't bear to {{have him}} think I was better than I really was, or let him care for me unless <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> that miserable old affair." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Robinson, to {{encourage}} him, {{and the story}} made a great impression.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. And when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> your owning Prime Minister he got {{savage and}} {{declared}} that was the very reason why I shouldn't go." ...|$|E
60|$|Jack's face, when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it, was so woebegone that I felt {{a stab of}} remorse, even in {{the heyday}} of my delight.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> what <b>I</b> {{had been}} doing, where I had gone, and {{everything}} I {{could think of}} likely to amuse him, and {{was still in the}} middle of my story when Miss Harmer came in.|$|R
5000|$|Smoltz counts Doc Rivers as a {{personal}} friend dating back to Rivers' playing days in Atlanta. In the edition of January 12, 2008 of the Boston Globe, Rivers is quoted as saying, [...] "I offered him my apartment... <b>I</b> just <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Terry and the Red Sox organization. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> it's a no-brainer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> nothing <b>about</b> it. He {{gave me the}} key, {{and desired}} me to fetch him all the papers. He {{wanted to find a}} letter which uncle Karil wrote him ever so long ago. In that letter uncle Karil {{acknowledges}} that he has the deed." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Perry then, and Dian the Beautiful, and how my {{duty was}} to them first. Afterward I should return and visit him--if I could ever find his island.|$|E
6000|$|... "I meant {{his visit}} to the Farquhar {{homestead}} when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Lucy; but I'll try to answer you. For one reason, I wanted to make amends for my previous--rashness." ...|$|E
60|$|When Steele and I {{were about}} to {{separate}} I remembered a party {{that was to be}} given by Miss Sampson, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it. He shook his head sadly, almost doubtfully.|$|E
60|$|He {{greeted me}} warmly, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> my trouble <b>about</b> the oxen, whereon he sent away the shield-holder, leaving us two together.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed!' {{interrupted}} the cobbler angrily. 'Did {{he tell you}} this? Wait a minute, you rascal! Why <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> it myself only an hour ago, and then he goes off to humbug you. So you were bewitched, my son were you? Wait a bit, and I'll bewitch you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|As I saw he {{was getting}} angry, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> it,--told <b>him</b> how we had hired a {{stranded}} canal-boat and had fitted it up as a house, and how we lived so cosily in it, and had called it [...] "Rudder Grange," [...] and how we had taken a boarder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me begin}} with what I hate most to remember, and so be the sooner done with it--let {{me begin with}} the paltry string of falsehoods which <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> my family troubles.|$|E
60|$|Certainly he had, {{he assured}} me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> {{the date and}} his head and {{shoulders}} disappeared into a cupboard. In a few minutes he withdrew them and called out sharply for his assistant.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} that Perry {{was very much}} excited when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> this Dead World, for he {{seemed to think that}} it explained the hitherto inexplicable phenomena of nutation and the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] I said, at length, [...] "I {{should like}} {{to get him off}} on account of his cousin, Miss Virginia Carvel. And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> Miss Carvel, and how she had helped you with the Union sergeant that day in the hot hospital. And how she had nursed Judge Whipple." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With the lawyer," [...] I returned. [...] "But {{two other}} persons {{have come into}} my mind since I have been anxious. Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> Mr. Guppy, who I feared might have had his vague surmises when I little {{understood}} his meaning, but in whose silence after our last interview I expressed perfect confidence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have two}} {{pictures}} painted by Mr. Somerset's father, have you not? <b>I</b> have already <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> them,' said Miss De Stancy. 'Perhaps Mr. Somerset {{would like to}} see them if they are unpacked?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'They're {{drawing the}} tendrils of the octopus around Black Bill,' says I. And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the deputy sheriff, and how I'd {{described}} {{him to the}} deputy, and what the deputy said about the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I spun him {{a regular}} yarn {{about the place}} and the people. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the captain's wife, and she being an English woman, and how she was taken, which indeed was the way {{of most of the}} women there.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you'll {{come with}} me. He wants you too, you know. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> you. He {{gave me his}} card," [...] Strether pursued, [...] "and his name's rather funny. It's John Little Bilham, and he says his two {{surnames}} are, {{on account of his}} being small, inevitably used together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Kate answered, {{a little}} shyly. [...] "I thought, in fact I know that <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Won't you wish me joy?" [...] she added, holding {{out her hand}} a little timidly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} {{it would be}} wrong! That was what I meant by wanting to be fai'a with Mr. Gregory when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you <b>about</b> <b>him</b> there in Florence. I don't believe but what it had begun then." ...|$|R
6000|$|Doctor Anglin {{was gone}} then, and Doctor Mandeville had his place. I walked right into his office. He didn't know me. [...] "Hello," [...] he said, [...] "this ain't visiting day." [...] "I ain't a visitor," [...] I said. [...] "I'm Tom. I belong here." [...] Then he whistled and showed he was surprised. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> it, {{and showed him}} the marks of the strap halter, and he got madder and madder {{all the time and}} said he'd attend to Mr. Peter Bopp's case.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Jake {{answered}} thoughtfully. [...] "At first, I thought Kenwardine great, and I {{like him}} now. He certainly has charm and you can't believe much against him when he's with you; but it's somehow different at a distance. Still, {{he knew nothing}} about the attacks on you. I saw that when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> them." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> my guide, for I {{was proud}} of what I had done, and my vanity for once got the heels of my prudence. At {{the mention of the}} five shillings he cried out so loud that I made up my mind I should say nothing of the other two, and was glad he could not see my blushes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{stood up}} for you, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Edith's runaway, and then he said, fair and square, that he didn't believe you stopped the horse. He said he guessed my sister pulled him up herself, and that then you came along and grabbed him and took all the credit. He said he thought you were that sort of a fellow.|$|E
6000|$|Here I {{looked at}} <b>him</b> sharply. <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> nothing <b>about</b> Lady Ragnall having lost her wits. How then {{did he know}} of the matter? Still I thought it best to hold my peace. I think that Harût saw he had made some mistake, for leaving the subject of Lady Ragnall, he went on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am trying}} to think what were his words," [...] she said, [...] "but I cannot remember. I spoke more than he did. He said that <b>I</b> should have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Mr Maguire, and I {{tried to explain to}} him that there had been no time to do so. Then I said that he could leave me if he liked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you do, do you! Sure! I {{talk all}} the time! And I'm just a {{business}} man--oh sure!--I'm no Ph.D. like Littlefield, and no poet, and I haven't anything to spring! Well, {{let me tell}} you, {{just the other day}} your darn Chum Frink comes up to me at the club begging to know what I thought about the Springfield school-bond issue. And who <b>told</b> <b>him?</b> <b>I</b> did! You bet your life <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him!</b> Little me! <b>I</b> certainly did! He came up and asked me, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> it! You bet! And he was darn glad to listen to me and--Duty as a host! I guess I know my duty as a host and let me tell you--" ...|$|R
