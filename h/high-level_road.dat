40|$|Efficient path query {{processing}} {{necessary for}} route guidance {{has been identified}} as one of the key requirements for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. While precomputing the view of all shortest paths provides the most efficient path retrieval, the view maintenance and storage costs become unrealistic for large ITS networks. Based on ITS road type classification, we propose a hierarchical path view approach, in which the path view maintenance and storage costs are dramatically reduced at the cost of negligible loss of path optimality. Comparing with the traditional ITS path finding approaches that use A or hierarchical A, our hierarchical approach is superior in three areas: 1) path search is more efficient, 2) the connecting point from the low-level <b>roads</b> to the <b>high-level</b> <b>roads</b> and vice versa are dynamically determined based on the most recent traffic, 3) within one region, the high-level traffic can be dynamically rerouted through the low-level roads.

The typical crowd sourcing geographic data contains GPS track data like OpenStreetMap, collaborative map data like Wikimapia, social websites like Twitter and Facebook, POI signed by Jiepang user and so on. These data will provide canonical geographic information for pubic after treatment. As compared with conventional geographic data collection and update method, the crowd sourcing geographic data from the non-professional has characteristics or advantages of large data volume, high currency, abundance information and low cost and becomes a research hotspot of international geographic information science in the recent years. Large volume crowd sourcing geographic data with high currency provides a new solution for geospatial database updating while it need to solve the quality problem of crowd sourcing geographic data obtained from the non-professionals. In this paper, a quality analysis model for OpenStreetMap crowd sourcing geographic data is proposed. Firstly, a quality analysis framework is designed based on data characteristic analysis of OSM data. Secondly, a quality assessment model for OSM data by three different quality elements: completeness, thematic accuracy and positional accuracy is presented. Finally, take the OSM data of Wuhan for instance, the paper analyses and assesses the quality of OSM data with 2011 version of navigation map for reference. The result shows that the <b>high-level</b> <b>roads</b> and urban traffic network of OSM data has a high positional accuracy and completeness so that thes...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{masonry bridge}} abutments (1865), {{adjacent to the}} Bremer River Rail Bridge in Ipswich, are important in demonstrating the development of Queensland's history insofar that they constitute physical evidence of the establishment of Queensland's first railway, {{an important step in}} the development of the State. They are all that remain of the first Bremer River Road-Rail Bridge, the most substantial structure on this railway. The siting of the 1865 abutments reflects the priorities that influenced the decisions of the Government of the day. Southern Queensland was chosen as the location of the State's first railway because of the priority given to providing a rail link to the coast for the Darling Downs pastoralists. Ipswich was chosen as the eastern terminus because of its importance to the Darling Downs pastoralists as a regional centre and the head of navigation. The location of the bridge within Ipswich was influenced by local demands for a <b>high-level</b> <b>road</b> bridge across the Bremer River.|$|E

40|$|Region-based {{analysis}} is fundamental and crucial in many geospatialrelated applications and research themes, such as trajectory analysis, human mobility study and urban planning. In this paper, {{we report on}} an image-processing-based approach to segment urban areas into regions by road networks. Here, each segmented region is bounded by the <b>high-level</b> <b>road</b> segments, covering some neighborhoods and low-level streets. Typically, road segments are classified into different levels (e. g., highways and expressways are usually high-level roads), providing us with a more natural and semantic segmentation of urban spaces than the grid-based partition method. We show that through simple morphological operators, an urban road network can be efficiently segmented into regions. In addition, we present {{a case study in}} trajectory mining to demonstrate the usability of the proposed segmentation method.

40|$|Existing {{road network}} {{matching}} methods mostly use {{the characteristics of}} the road's own nodes and arcs to carry on the matching process, while less attention is focused on the importance of the road neighborhood elements in the road network matching, thus affecting further improvement of the matching efficiency and accuracy. In response to these problems, a linkage matching method for road network considering the similarity of upper and lower spatial relation is proposed. The linkage matching imitates the human thinking process of searching for target objects by the signal features and spatial correlation when reading maps, regarding matching as a reasoning process of goal feature searching and information association transmitting. Firstly, classify the complex road network by using Stroke technology. Secondly, establish the road network linkage matching model based on road skeleton relation tree. Finally, select the <b>high-level</b> <b>road</b> in the classifying results of the source data as the reference road to start matching, calculate the road between the upper and lower levels of the spatial relationship similarity, and through a step-by-step iteration, make the matching information transmit in the road network linkage matching model thus to obtain the final matching results. Experiment shows that the mentioned algorithm can narrow the search range of the data to be matched, effectively improving the match efficiency and accuracy, especially applicable to the data with large non systematic geometric location deviation...|$|E
40|$|Road {{detection}} is {{an essential}} component of field robot navigation systems. Vision sensors {{play an important role in}} road detection for their great potential in environmental perception. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical vision sensor-based method for robust road detection in challenging road scenes. More specifically, for a given road image captured by an on-board vision sensor, we introduce a multiple population genetic algorithm (MPGA) -based approach for efficient road vanishing point detection. Superpixel-level seeds are then selected in an unsupervised way using a clustering strategy. Then, according to the GrowCut framework, the seeds proliferate and iteratively try to occupy their neighbors. After convergence, the initial road segment is obtained. Finally, in order to achieve a globally-consistent road segment, the initial road segment is refined using the conditional random field (CRF) framework, which integrates <b>high-level</b> information into <b>road</b> detection. We perform several experiments to evaluate the common performance, scale sensitivity and noise sensitivity of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits high robustness compared to the state of the art...|$|R

40|$|SWOV {{has been}} {{requested}} {{to carry out}} a review of Ireland's Road Safety Strategy. This review should pay attention to three aspects: (1) review developments and progress made under the current National Road Safety Strategy 1998 - 2002; (2) place Ireland's performance in an appropriate international context; and (3) suggest options for priorities for the next Strategy to cover period 2003 - 2007, paying regard to recent developments (including relevant international developments). The target of the National Road Safety Strategy was a reduction in the annual number of deaths of 20 %, from 472 in 1997 to 378 in 2002. It is likely that the target in relation to deaths will not be achieved. The target for the number of injuries (also a reduction of 20 %) has already been achieved. The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998 - 2002 is to be regarded as a large step forward in Irish road safety policy. The following elements of the Strategy are regarded as being positive: (a) the formulation of a national target; (b) the definition of a limited number of well-founded spearheads; (c) the policy co-ordination at the national level {{in the shape of a}} <b>High-Level</b> Group on <b>Road</b> Safety; and (d) the publication of an annual progress report. Judged by the policy results it must be concluded that the Irish ambitions have not completely been achieved. The Irish road safety policy strongly relies on positive effects of traffic enforcement and (strict) punishment of offenders. It also strongly relies on public information. The National Strategy gives many possibilities for improving road safety. However, one is also very conscious of the potential obstacles to further improvement. Ireland has started down the right road, and this road has been explored here and there, but not all opportunities are fully exploited. In the next Strategy large steps forward can be made...|$|R
