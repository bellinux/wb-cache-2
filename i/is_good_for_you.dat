25|$|In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad <b>Is</b> <b>Good</b> <b>for</b> <b>You,</b> {{he argues}} that video games in fact demand far more from a player than {{traditional}} games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, {{as well as how}} to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.|$|E
500|$|... (It <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> that I leave), BWV108, is {{a church}} cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He {{composed}} it in Leipzig for Cantate Sunday, the fourth Sunday after Easter, and first performed it on 29 April 1725.|$|E
500|$|The {{similarities}} {{begin with}} the first movement, which {{like that of the}} previous year´s cantata, is given to the bass as the vox Christi. The movement is the quotation of verse 7 from the gospel, beginning: [...] "" [...] (It <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> that I leave; for if I did not go, the Comforter would not come to you.) It is between aria and arioso. An oboe d'amore as the obbligato instrument plays extended melodies. Voice and oboe share the musical material, conveying [...] "the mood of grieving at parting".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{leave that}} silly old book alone. It can't <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> always reading. You'll addle your brain, that's what you'll do, Philip." ...|$|R
500|$|The opening movement, [...] "" [...] (Behold, I {{will send}} out many fishers), {{is given to}} the bass solo, {{possibly}} because Jeremiah has God speak in the first person. The music follows the text in two sections, as in a motet. Probably therefore Bach avoided the title aria and wrote [...] instead. Some cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler from the second annual cycle begin in a similar way with a bible quotation, of Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (I am a Good Shepherd, BWV 85), [...] "" [...] (It <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> that I leave, BWV 108), and Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (Until now you have asked for nothing in My name, BWV 87).|$|E
60|$|CANDIDA. You! Why, you're spoiled {{with love}} and worship: you get far more than <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> No: I mean Eugene.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Gilbert dear, {{will you}} tell me a few things? I do only wish what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Why don't you wish that papa should hear of this book?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Curtis, evidently distressed, [...] "I {{think the}} {{exertion}} would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> {{if you could}} only think so." ...|$|R
50|$|Bilyeu {{has said}} his goal with Quest is to end {{metabolic}} disease and show people that food can <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and still taste good.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But if {{they thought}} it would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to have all my governesses and advantages, and they took pity on my loneliness. What then?' ...|$|R
6000|$|American masses! I do not {{thank you}} for liking me as I am, and liking the touch of me--I [...] know that it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! {{not more}} than <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Abstinence on Fridays--a regular {{confession}} and holy communion and holy mass on Sundays will help to keep you straight before the good God." ...|$|E
60|$|THE STATUE. You {{might as}} well have gone without {{thinking}} such a lot about it, Juan. You are like all the clever men: you have more brains than <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall not}} be able to talk on any other subject than yourselves," [...] {{retorted}} Weissmann, gallantly, [...] "and that would not <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to hear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{have done}} so, child. But you had best retire into the zenana. It would not <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> or me, <b>were</b> I found talking to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not from himself, Anna;--though {{he was the}} messenger. Come and sit here, my dear,--close to me. Have {{you ever}} thought, Anna, that it would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to <b>be</b> married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} {{she knows what}} <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> better than you know {{yourself}}. I suppose she has {{told you that you}} might do a great deal better than trouble yourself with a wife?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{you will have}} to do so, Hallett. It <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> and stirs you up; and I shall risk that onslaught you spoke of, as we go down to the coast again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Curiosity {{killed a}} cat," [...] {{observed}} the Story Girl coolly. [...] "Miss Reade hasn't {{told me that}} she was going to marry anybody. You will find out all that <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to know in due time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If the {{religious}} life <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> trust me, the way will open, however unlikely it may seem. If not, Heaven and the saints will show what your course should be.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} to go somewhere. It can't <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to remain here. Indeed I shall think it wicked, or at any rate weak, if you {{continue}} to seclude yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|Breckenridge saw {{the shadow}} in Grant's face, {{and touched his}} arm. [...] "I'll go in and give the man his dollars, Larry," [...] he said. [...] "You have had about as much worry as <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two flats below with pop," [...] she replied. [...] "He's a bad actor, {{very seldom}} in work, and he drinks. There {{are just the}} two of us. Now you know as much as <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> You're English, ain't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetty {{looked at}} him curiously. [...] "Yes. You know what {{everybody}} means by that, and it's generally a girl of that kind that men with your notions fall in love with. It's because you want {{so much more than}} <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> that you have such notions." ...|$|E
6000|$|The other canon {{shook his}} head in dismay at such arrant folly. [...] "Young stripling, be warned," [...] he said. [...] "Know what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee.</b> Greek <b>is</b> the tongue of heresy." ...|$|R
60|$|HARRY. You've {{been most}} awfully decent about it, but I {{hate to think}} of your {{spending}} day after day entirely by yourself. It can't <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to <b>be</b> so much alone.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{cannot be}} your friend, Marie, if you oppose your uncle. He has done {{everything}} for you, {{and he must}} know best what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> There can be no reason against M.

6000|$|... "Yes, but {{you must}} take what <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> I have ordered up a bottle of the landlord's best, and must insist upon your {{drinking}} a couple of glasses with me. I want it {{almost as much as}} you do, for the atmosphere of that court was enough to poison a dog. I have got the taste of it in my mouth still." ...|$|E
