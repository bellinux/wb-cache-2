5|$|The {{azure-hooded jay}} is omnivorous, eating berries, seeds, and small, dead animals. This species <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> steal and eat bait from traps set for small mammals. The bird tends to forage {{in the forest}} canopy.|$|E
5|$|Young birds {{indulge in}} play fighting, and one bird will often lock {{the neck of}} another under its chin.

5|$|Colbert {{often makes}} digs {{at the expense}} of Daily Show host Jon Stewart. He has implied a {{strained}} relationship with Stewart, in contrast with the real Colbert's admiration for the comedian, and suggests that his departure from The Daily Show occurred under dubious circumstances. The character has described Stewart as a sexual predator and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> become tearful when his name is brought up. On the other hand, Colbert has also implied that he only got his own show by blackmailing Stewart with incriminating photographs.|$|E

5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in late summer and early fall, but are often weak {{by the time they}} reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.|$|E

The following lists include all of {{the cast and crew}} members with whom Lynch has worked on three or more separate projects.|$|E
5|$|Normally shy or {{indifferent}} {{to the presence of}} divers, the Caribbean reef shark <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> become aggressive in the presence of food and grows sufficiently large to be considered potentially dangerous. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 27 attacks attributable to this species, 4 of them unprovoked, and none fatal.|$|E
5|$|The early {{lanthanides}} act {{as essential}} cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective. Praseodymium is otherwise {{not known to}} have a biological role in any other organisms, but is not very toxic either. Intravenous injection of rare earths into animals <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> impair liver function, but the main side effects from inhalation of rare-earth oxides in humans come from radioactive thorium and uranium impurities.|$|E

5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} has few natural predators; attacks on this species have been {{reported}} from bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran), while the related nurse shark <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> fall prey to tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). Known parasites of this species include five species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium, which infest the shark's spiral intestine.|$|E
5|$|The winghead shark {{is found}} in the {{tropical}} central and western Indo-Pacific, from the Persian Gulf eastward across South and Southeast Asia to New Guinea and northern Queensland. Its range extends as far north as Taiwan and as far south as the Montebello Islands off Western Australia. This species inhabits shallow waters close to shore and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> enter estuaries.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{diseases}} that {{can reduce the}} yield and market value of carrots. The most devastating carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> eradicate entire crops. A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas. Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or forked roots, or galls. Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} mainly diurnal, {{especially}} {{in the north of}} its range. Further south it is said to be active in the evening, and it may even be active at night during the summer months. It is predominantly a terrestrial species, although it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> climb up banks and into low bushes in order to bask or search for prey.|$|E
5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes {{was first}} {{described}} in 1840 by English botanist John Lindley, probably from material collected by James Drummond the previous year. There are no recognised varieties, although it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> hybridise with Banksia hookeriana. Widely distributed in south-west Western Australia, B.prionotes is found from Shark Bay (25° S) in the north, south {{as far as}} Kojonup (33°50′S). It grows exclusively in sandy soils, and is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. Pollinated by birds, it provides food for {{a wide array of}} vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. It is an important source of food for honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and is critical to their survival in the Avon Wheatbelt region, where it is the only nectar-producing plant in flower at some times of the year.|$|E
