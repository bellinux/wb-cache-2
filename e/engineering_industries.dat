More than 21% of Jordan's labor force was employed in industry in 2002. In 2014, industry accounted for 6% of the GDP. The main industrial products are potash, phosphates, cement, clothes, and fertilisers. The most promising segment of this sector is construction.

40|$|Purpose. The <b>engineering</b> <b>industry</b> is {{characterized}} by deep specialization and high co-operation, which suggests {{a high degree of}} interaction with other industries and the economy, highly sensitive to external factors. Effective regulation of the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry’s</b> organizational-resource support will ensure coherence of all the subsystems of the market economy, the competitive environment, a full course of the investment process and the success of the industry. Therefore {{there is a need for}} detailed estimation and analysis of the external factors’ influence on the formation and implementation indexes of the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry’s</b> organizational-resource support. Methodology. To establish the close connection between the set of external factors of formation and implementation indexes of the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry</b> organizational-resource support the correlation analysis was used, to calculate the amount of the formation and implementation indexes of the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry</b> organizational-resource support’s change under the influence of the external factors with malleability coefficient were applied. Findings. The external influence factors on the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry</b> organizational-resource support by the source of origin: industrial, economical, political, informational, and social were separated and grouped. The classification of the external factors influence on the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry</b> organizational-resource support, depending on their influence’s direction on the formation and implementation indexes of the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry’s</b> organizational-resource support was made. The connection closeness and the amount of the formation and implementation indexes of the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry</b> organizational-resource support change (the machinery index of and the sales volume machinery index) under the influence of the external factors with malleability coefficient were determined. Originality. The estimation of the external factors influence on the formation and implementation indexes of the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry’s</b> organizationalresource support was improved, which allows identifying the most influenced external factors and the amount of the formation’s and implementation’s indexes of the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry’s</b> organizational-resource support’s change. Practical value. The estimation of the external factors influence on the formation and implementation indexes of the <b>engineering</b> <b>industry’s</b> organizational-resource support allows detecting, developing and adjusting the necessary and effective levers of government regulation...|$|R

25|$|Huddersfield is a {{manufacturing}} town, despite the university being the largest employer. Historically the town produced woollen textiles. This area of business, {{along with the}} chemical and <b>engineering</b> <b>industries</b> that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was {{the basis of the}} town's nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of woollen products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making alternating current electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just £300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest's sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of £4,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas's Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley. Other local manufacturers are Cummins Turbo Technologies, founded in 1952 as Holset by Messrs. Holmes and Croset. (turbochargers), David Brown Gear systems (industrial gearing), Huddersfield Fine Worsteds (textiles), Taylor & Lodge (textiles), C & J Antich (textiles), Syngenta AG (agro-chemicals), Pennine Radio Limited (electronics transformers and sheet metalworking) and a large number of niche manufacturers, such as Dual Seal Glass (maker of spandrel glass panels) and Ellis Furniture (producer of kitchen and bathroom furniture). Huddersfield is home to Andrew Jones Pies, a regional award-winning pie-maker, where a worker was killed in a gas explosion on 10 April 2009. and Mamas and Papas – a manufacturer and retailer of prams, pushchairs and related items.|$|E

2500|$|In 1944 American {{economic}} historian Leland Jenks (having {{conducted an}} analysis based on Joseph Schumpeter's theory of innovation) similarly claims that railroads {{had a direct}} impact on the growth of the United States’ real income and an indirect impact on its economic expansion. [...] In his Rostovian Take-off Thesis, Walt W. Rostow systematically developed the Jenks model that railroads were crucial to American economic growth. According to Rostow, railroads were responsible for the “take-off” of American industrialization in the period of 1843-1860. This “take-off” in economic growth occurred because the railroad helped to decrease transportation costs, transport new products and goods to commercial markets, and generally widen the market. Furthermore, the development of railroads stimulated the growth of the modern coal, iron, and <b>engineering</b> <b>industries,</b> all of which were essential for wider economic growth. According to Rostow’s Take-off Thesis, railroads generated new investment, which simultaneously helped develop financial markets in the United States.|$|E
60|$|If England stood alone, I {{do not see}} why each of the new {{mechanical}} and <b>engineering</b> <b>industries,</b> so soon as it develops sufficiently to have gathered together a body of workers capable of supporting a Trade Union secretary, should not begin to stagnate in the same manner. Only England does not stand alone, and the building trade is so far not typical, inasmuch as it possesses a national monopoly that the most elaborate system of protection cannot secure any other group of trades. One must have one's house built where one has to live, the importation of workmen in small bodies is difficult and dear, and if one cannot have the house one wishes, one must needs have the least offensive substitute; but bicycle and motor, iron-work and furniture, engines, rails, and ships one can import. The community, therefore, that does least to educate its mechanics and engineers out of the base and servile tradition of the old idea of industry will {{in the coming years}} of progress simply get a disproportionate share of the rejected element, the trade will go elsewhere, and the community will be left in possession of an exceptionally large contingent for the abyss.|$|E
