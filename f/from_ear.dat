Police found $5,000 in cash at the scene, which suggested that robbery was not the motive.|$|E

25|$|A triple {{homicide}} {{was committed}} in Waltham, Massachusetts, {{on the evening}} of September 11, 2011. Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman, and Raphael Teken were murdered in Mess's apartment. All had their throats slit <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> to ear, with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. Thousands of dollars' worth of marijuana and money were left covering their mutilated bodies, and $5,000 was left at the scene. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{shape of}} the Irish tonsure is unclear from the early sources, {{although}} they agree that the hair was in some way shorn over the head <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> to ear. In 1639 James Ussher suggested a semi-circular shape, rounded {{in the front and}} culminating at a line between the ears. This suggestion was accepted by many subsequent writers, but in 1703, Jean Mabillon put forth a new hypothesis, claiming that the entire forehead was shaven back to the ears. Mabillon's version was widely accepted, but contradicts the early sources. In 2003 Daniel McCarthy suggested a triangular shape, with one side between the ears and a vertex towards the front of the head. The Collectio canonum Hibernensis cites the authority of Saint Patrick as indicating that the custom originated with the swineherd of Lóegaire mac Néill, the king who opposed Patrick.|$|E

25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Griffith played Taylor as a heavy-handed country bumpkin, {{grinning}} <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> to ear {{and speaking}} in a hesitant, frantic manner. [...] The style recalled that used {{in the delivery of}} his popular [...] monologues such as [...] "What It Was, Was Football". [...] He gradually abandoned the [...] "rustic Taylor" [...] and developed a serious and thoughtful characterization. [...] Producer Aaron Ruben recalled: He was being that marvelously funny character from No Time for Sergeants, Will Stockdale ... One day he said, [...] "My God, I just realized that I'm the straight man. I'm playing straight to all these kooks around me."

500|$|Mu waves, {{also known}} as mu rhythms, comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or {{sensorimotor}} rhythms, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the pyramidal type, {{in the part of}} the brain that controls voluntary movement. These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) Hz, and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest. Unlike the alpha wave, which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the motor cortex, in a band approximately <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> to ear. A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called [...] of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony. The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics. Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that the mirror neuron system is involved in mu wave suppression, although others disagree.|$|E
500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E

500|$|The {{required}} {{direction of}} current depended on {{the direction in which}} electric current was thought to flow in nerves in the human or animal body. [...] For motor functions, for instance, the flow was taken to be from the centre towards the muscles at the extremities, so artificial electrical stimulation needed {{to be in the same}} direction. [...] For sensory nerves, the opposite applied: flow was from the extremity to the centre, and the positive electrode would be applied to the extremity. [...] This principle was demonstrated by Bird in an experiment with a living frog. [...] A supply of frogs was usually on hand, as they were used in the frog galvanoscope. [...] The electromagnetic galvanometer was available at the time, but frogs' legs were still used by Bird because of their much greater sensitivity to small currents. [...] In the experiment, the frog's leg was almost completely severed from its body, leaving only the sciatic nerve connected, and electric current was then applied from the body to the leg. [...] Convulsions of the leg were seen when the muscle was stimulated. [...] Reversing the current, however, produced no movement of the muscle, merely croaks of pain from the frog. [...] In his lectures, Bird describes many experiments with a similar aim on human sensory organs. [...] In one experiment by Grapengiesser, for instance, electric current is passed through the subject's head <b>from</b> <b>ear</b> to ear, causing a sound to be hallucinated. [...] The ear connected to the positive terminal hears a louder sound than that connected to the negative.|$|E

This can include problems with: [...] "...sound localization and lateralization (see also binaural fusion); auditory discrimination; auditory pattern recognition; temporal aspects of audition, including temporal integration, temporal discrimination (e.g., temporal gap detection), temporal ordering, and temporal masking; auditory performance in competing acoustic signals (including dichotic listening); and auditory performance with degraded acoustic signals".|$|E
