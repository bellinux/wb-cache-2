5|$|Josephson {{said that}} Trinity College's long {{interest}} in the paranormal meant {{that he did not}} dismiss these ideas out of hand. Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore {{the idea that there is}} intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several inches above the floor. Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific <b>insights,</b> <b>and</b> that, as a result of it, he had come to believe in a creator.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1984, Michael {{and other}} members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi {{commercial}} overseen by executive Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor. Dusenberry recounted the episode in his memoir, Then We Set His Hair on Fire: <b>Insights</b> <b>and</b> Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a global reach of more than 20 countries and would provide financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi, which later signed other music stars such as Britney Spears and Beyoncé to promote its products.|$|E

40|$|Background: Noncompliance is a {{major problem}} for {{patients}} with a psychotic disorder. Two important risk factors for noncompliance that have a severe negative impact on treatment outcomes are impaired illness <b>insight</b> <b>and</b> lack of motivation. Our cross-sectional study explored how they are related to each other and their compliance with depot medication. Methods: Interviews were conducted in 169 outpatients with a psychotic disorder taking depot medication. Four patient groups were defined based on low or high illness <b>insight</b> <b>and</b> on low or high motivation. The associations between depot-medication compliance, motivation, <b>and</b> <b>insight</b> were illustrated using generalized linear models. Results: Generalized linear model showed a significant interaction effect between motivation <b>and</b> <b>insight.</b> Patients with poor <b>insight</b> <b>and</b> high motivation for treatment were more compliant (94 %) (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 821, 3. 489) with their depot medication than patients with poor <b>insight</b> <b>and</b> low motivation (61 %) (95 % CI: 0. 288, 0. 615). Patients with both <b>insight</b> <b>and</b> high motivation for treatment were less compliant (73 %) (95 % CI: 0. 719, 1. 315) than those with poor <b>insight</b> <b>and</b> high motivation. Conclusion: Motivation for treatment was more strongly associated with depot-medication compliance than with illness insight. Being motivated to take medication, whether to get better or for other reasons, may be a more important factor than having illness insight in terms of improving depot-medication compliance.
