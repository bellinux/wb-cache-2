[...] The opposing cavalry met some [...] south of Rossignol and the French were successful in driving the Germans back and clearing the road. [...] The remainder of the 3rd Division, following in column along a road hemmed in by thick hedgerows and wire fences, was in good spirits in anticipation of an easy march. [...] The French dragoons soon crossed the Semois River and cleared the village of Rossignol before heading into the dense Ligny forest.

2500|$|The {{efforts to}} create a French opera continued. The poet Pierre Perrin persuaded the new Controller General of Finances, Colbert, to {{establish}} an Academy of Opera, and in 1669 Perrin was given a commission by the king to create works [...] "in [...] music and in French verse {{comparable to that of}} Italy." [...] The first opera by Perrin, Pomone, with music by Robert Cambert, was performed on March 3, 1671, inside a converted Jeu de Paume, or tennis court, between the rue des <b>Fossés</b> de Nesles (now rue Mazarine) and the rue de Seine. It was an enormous success, running for one hundred forty-six performances. Seeing the success of Perrin's work, the official court composer, Lully, moved quickly; he persuaded royal government to issue a decree banning any theatrical performances with more than two songs or two instruments without Lully's written permission. In 1671 alone, Lully wrote and presented five new operas. On November 15, 1672, he opened his own opera house in the jeu de paume du Bel-Air (also known as jeu de paume de Bécquet). He also demanded and received from the king the exclusive rights to use the theater of the Palais-Royal, until then used by the theater company of Molière, giving him control over any and all musical performances in Paris. He presented a new opera each year, entirely funded by the royal treasury. In April 1673, he premiered Cadmus et Hermione, the first French opera in the lyric-tragedy form. This form, which dominated French opera for the next two centuries, but was rarely exported, featured stories based on mythology and ancient heroes. The performances made maximum use of machinery, allowing the creation on stage of storms, monsters, and characters descending or ascending into the heavens. The texts involved recitation of verse in a classical half-spoken, half-sung style, borrowed from Racine and Corneille, with a vocal range of an octave, words mingled with sighs, exclamations and vibrato. The works included not only singing, but also dance. The operas were all dedicated to the glory of the Sun King: in the dedication of Armide, Lully wrote: [...] "All of the praises of Paris are not enough for me; it is only to you, Sire, that I want to consecrate all the productions of my genius." ...|$|E

Whereas the mediæval was always {{shutting}} himself into castles, and behind <b>fosses,</b> and drawing brickwork neatly, and beds of flowers primly, our painters delight in getting to the open fields and moors; abhor all hedges and moats; never paint anything but free-growing trees, and rivers gliding [...] "at their own sweet will"; eschew formality down to the smallest detail; break and displace the brickwork which the mediæval would have carefully cemented; leave unpruned the thickets he would have delicately trimmed; and, carrying the love of liberty even to license, {{and the love of}} wildness even to ruin, take pleasure at last in every aspect of age and desolation which emancipates the objects of nature from the government of men;--on the castle wall displacing its tapestry with ivy, and spreading, through the garden, the bramble for the rose.|$|E
6000|$|Milton's effort, in {{all that}} he tells us of his Inferno, {{is to make it}} indefinite; Dante's, to make it definite.

[...] But Dante's Inferno is accurately separated into circles drawn with well-pointed compasses; mapped and properly surveyed in every direction, trenched in a thoroughly good style of engineering from depth to depth, and divided in the [...] "accurate middle" [...] (dritto mezzo) of its deepest abyss, into a concentric series of ten moats and embankments, like those about a castle, with bridges from each embankment to the next; precisely in the manner of those bridges over Hiddekel and Euphrates, which Mr. Macaulay thinks so innocently designed, apparently not aware that he is also laughing at Dante. These larger <b>fosses</b> are of rock, and the bridges also; but as he goes further into detail, Dante tells us of various minor <b>fosses</b> and embankments, in which he anxiously points out to us not only the formality, but the neatness and perfectness, of the stonework. For instance, in describing the river Phlegethon, he tells us that it was [...] "paved with stone at the bottom, and at the sides, and over the edges of the sides," [...] just as the water is at the baths of Bulicame; and for fear we should think this embankment at all larger than it really was, Dante adds, carefully, that it was made just like the embankments of Ghent or Bruges against the sea, or those in Lombardy which bank the Brenta, only [...] "not so high, nor so wide," [...] as any of these. And besides the trenches, we have two well-built castles; one like Ecbatana, with seven circuits of wall (and surrounded by a fair stream), wherein the great poets and sages of antiquity live; and another, a great fortified city with walls of iron, red-hot, and a deep fosse round it, and full of [...] "grave citizens,"--the city of Dis.|$|E

These great bodies of troops were the celebrated Roman legions, and they were renowned throughout the world for their discipline, their admirable organization, the celerity of their movements, and for the indomitable courage and energy of the men. Each legion constituted, in fact, a separate and independent community. Its camp was its city. Its general was its king. In time of war it moved, of course, from place to place, as the exigencies of the service required; but in time of peace it established itself with great formality in a spacious and permanent encampment, which was laid out with great regularity, and fortified with ramparts and <b>fosses.</b> Within the confines of the camp the tents were arranged in rows, with broad spaces for streets between them; and in a central position, before a space which served the purpose of a public square, the rich and ornamented pavilions of the commander and chief, and of the other generals, rose above the rest, like the public edifices of a city.

6000|$|It was {{probably}} after this amour ended that Sordello sat out upon his travels, visiting most courts, and dwelling long in Provence, {{where he learned}} to poetize in the Provençal tongue, in which he thereafter chiefly wrote, and composed many songs.

The Mantuan historian, Volta, says that some of Sordello's Provençal poems exist in manuscript in the Vatican and Chigi libraries at Rome, in the Laurentian at Florence, and the Estense at Modena. He was versed in arms as well as letters, and he caused Mantua to be surrounded with <b>fosses</b> five miles beyond her walls; and the republic having lodged sovereign powers in his hands when Eccelino besieged the city, Sordello conducted the defense with great courage and ability, and did not at all betray the place to his obliging brother-in-law, as the latter expected. Verci, from whose [...] "History of the Eccelini" [...] we have drawn the account of Sordello's intrigue with Cunizza, says: [...] "The writers represent this Sordello as the most polite, the most gentle, the most generous man of his time, of middle stature, of beautiful aspect and fine person, of lofty bearing, agile and dexterous, instructed in letters, and a good poet, as his Provençal poems manifest. To these qualities he united military valor in such degree that no knight of his time could stand before him."
