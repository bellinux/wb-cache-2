5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton <b>has</b> <b>undertaken</b> the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to this analysis, {{about a quarter of the}} sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that {{the proportion}} of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise {{the proportion of}} barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E

5|$|Falkner Island Light, {{also known}} as the Faulkner Island Lighthouse, is a {{lighthouse}} in Connecticut, United States, on Falkner Island which is off Guilford Harbor on Long Island Sound. The lighthouse was constructed in 1802 and commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson. The lighthouse has had three keeper's houses: the original house of 1802 was rebuilt in 1851 and then again in 1871. The 1871 keeper's house survived to 1976, when it was destroyed by fire; the Coast Guard repaired and automated the lighthouse two years later. A volunteer group, the Faulkner's Light Brigade, <b>has</b> <b>undertaken</b> the restoration and preservation of the lighthouse since 1991, completing the last major restoration work in March 2011. Access to Falkner Island and the light is restricted during the nesting season of the roseate terns from May to August yearly. The Falkner Island Lighthouse, as the second oldest extant lighthouse in Connecticut, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
