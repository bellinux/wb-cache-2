5|$|Gaza's Jewish {{community}} was roughly 3,000 years old, and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households. Most of them fled <b>from</b> <b>Gaza</b> after the 1929 Palestine riots, when they consisted of fifty families. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey, Gaza had {{a population of}} 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust {{between them and the}} Arab majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.|$|E

The Mongols retaliated by launching a massive artillery assault on the citadel and when it became apparent that an-Nasir Yusuf was unable to relieve the city with a newly assembled army, the garrison surrendered.|$|E

5|$|The Netzarim junction, {{where the}} {{shooting}} took place, is {{known locally as}} the al-Shohada (martyrs') junction. It lies on Saladin Road, a few kilometres south of Gaza City. The source of conflict at the junction was the nearby Netzarim settlement, where 60 Israeli families lived until Israel's withdrawal <b>from</b> <b>Gaza</b> in 2005. A military escort accompanied the settlers whenever they left or arrived at the settlement, and an Israeli military outpost, Magen-3, guarded the approach. The area had been the scene of violent incidents {{in the days before}} the shooting.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{was born}} in Cairo, Egypt. His father, Abdel Raouf al-Qudwa al-Husseini, was a Palestinian <b>from</b> <b>Gaza</b> City, whose mother, Yasser's {{paternal}} grandmother, was Egyptian. Arafat's father battled in the Egyptian courts for 25 years to claim family land in Egypt {{as part of his}} inheritance but was unsuccessful. He worked as a textile merchant in Cairo's religiously mixed Sakakini District. Arafat was the second-youngest of seven children and was, along with his younger brother Fathi, the only offspring born in Cairo. His mother, Zahwa Abul Saud, was from a Jerusalem-based family. She died from a kidney ailment in 1933, when Arafat was four years of age.|$|E
5|$|Gaza {{experienced}} destructive earthquakes in 1903 and 1914. In 1917, during World War I, British forces {{captured the}} city. Gaza grew {{significantly in the}} first half of the 20th century under Mandatory rule. The population of the city swelled as a result of the Palestinian exodus during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Gaza came under Egyptian rule until it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War. Gaza became a center of political resistance during the First Intifada, and under the Oslo Accords of 1993, it was assigned to be under the direct control of the newly established Palestinian Authority. Israel unilaterally withdrew <b>from</b> <b>Gaza</b> in 2005. By 2007, Hamas emerged both as the victor in Palestinian elections and in factional fighting with rival Fatah in the city and in the wider Gaza Strip and has since been the sole governing authority. Israel subsequently blockaded the Strip and launched assaults against it in 2008–2009, 2012 and 2014, as a response to rocket attacks.|$|E

5|$|On {{the coast}} the 52nd (Lowland) Division was fought a fierce action after {{crossing}} the Wadi el Hesi {{on the coast}} north of Gaza. By the morning of 8 November, two infantry brigades had crossed the Wadi el Hesi near its mouth and, despite some opposition established themselves on the sand dunes to the north towards Askelon. Sausage Ridge, on their right stretched from Burberah to Deir Sineid, was held in considerable strength, as the ridge covered the road and railway <b>from</b> <b>Gaza</b> to the north. During the afternoon the 155th Brigade moved to attack Sausage Ridge, but it was threatened by a counterattack on the left forcing, the brigade to halt and face north to meet this attack. When the 156th Brigade arrived from Sh. Ajlin on the Wadi el Hesi, the 157th Brigade attacked the southern portion of the ridge, and gained a footing as darkness fell. They lost this precarious position four times to fierce Ottoman counterattacks, before strongly attacking and throwing the defenders off the ridge by 21:00. The two attacking brigades lost 700 men in this action.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September, {{the brigade}} {{was once again}} moved to the front line and given {{responsibility}} for patrolling the area between the Desert Mounted Corps and the XXI Corps, taking under command the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment on 20 October. At the time the brigade was the only mounted formation not under the direct command of the Desert Mounted Corps, remaining Army Troops. The next British attack was the capture of Gaza in November 1917; the plan was for the infantry to capture their initial objectives, then the brigade would be released to advance along the Mediterranean coastline, turn right and attack the Turkish rear and their headquarters at Nuzzle. When the battle started, the British infantry captured {{all but one of}} their objectives, but as the brigade started to move out, a Turkish counter-attack regained their previous positions, so the brigade's advance was called off. However, by the night of 6/7 November, continued British attacks forced the Turkish to withdraw <b>from</b> <b>Gaza</b> and the brigade was ordered forward to pursue them. By 13:00 the brigade was north of Gaza when the Mysore Lancers' leading squadron located the Turkish rearguard, which included a heavy machine-gun position. At 15:00 the Hyderabad Lancers and the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment attacked Beit Hanun, {{while the rest of the}} brigade attacked Beit Lahi. As the Hyderabad Lancers approached their objective, they came under a heavy artillery bombardment. Leaving one squadron and their machine-guns behind to provide fire support, the rest of the Lancers attacked, capturing the Wadi Safieh line. The Lancers, still under artillery fire, held out until 16:30, when they were ordered to withdraw and rejoin the rest of the brigade now concentrated at Beit Lahi.|$|E
