40|$|AbstractSince April 1, 2015, {{for those}} non-residential gas users, the stock gas and {{incremental}} <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> have been unified, and direct-supply <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> have been released. This means that natural <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> reform has {{entered a new}} stage of development in China. In view of this, we first summarized and analyzed the achievements, status quo and existing problems in natural <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> reform {{in recent years in}} China. Then, we made an overview on the global natural <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> and marketing experiences and domestic situation in natural gas sector. On this basis, we presented the following proposals and implement approaches to ultimately achieving the market-oriented reform of natural <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> in China. First, the ex-factory prices for those residential gas users will be adjusted, which should be differentiated from those for the non-residential gas users. Second, the present natural <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> mechanism should be perfected with pipeline fees and gas storage fees being both added. Third, an integrated natural <b>gas</b> <b>pricing</b> system should be improved with differential prices implemented. Fourth, natural gas spot transaction should be promoted and energy measurement in <b>gas</b> metering and <b>pricing</b> should also be put into practice...|$|R

2500|$|Gasification [...] of coal or lignite or {{pet coke}} {{produces}} syngas or coal gas or {{coke oven gas}} which {{is a mixture of}} hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases. Coal gas can be converted into synthetic natural gas (SNG) by using Fischer–Tropsch process at low pressure and high temperature. Coal gas can also be produced by underground coal gasification where the coal deposits are located deep in the ground or uneconomical to mine the coal. [...] CNG and LNG are emerging as economical alternatives to diesel oil with the escalation in international crude oil prices. Synthetic natural gas production technologies have tremendous scope to meet the transport sector requirements fully using the locally available coal in India. Dankuni coal complex is producing syngas which is piped to the industrial users in Calcutta. Many coal based fertiliser plants which are shut down can also be retrofitted economically to produce SNG as LNG and CNG fetch good price by substituting imports. Recently, Indian government fixed the natural <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> at producer end as 5.61 US$ per mmbtu on net calorific value (NCV) basis which is at par with the estimated SNG price from coal.|$|E
2500|$|Interstate {{pipeline}} {{companies in}} the US {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Prior to 1992, these companies owned all the gas that flowed through their systems. This also included gas in their storage facility, over which they had complete control. Then FERC Order 636 was implemented. This required the companies to operate their facilities, including gas storage on an open access basis. For gas storage, this meant that these companies could only reserve the capacity needed to maintain system integrity. The rest of the capacity would be available for leasing to third parties on a nondiscriminatory basis. Open access has opened a wide variety of application for gas storage, particularly for marketers which can now exploit price arbitrage opportunities. Any storage capacity would be priced at cost-based pricing, unless the provider can demonstrate to FERC that it lacks market power, in which case it may be allowed to price at market-based rates to gain market share. FERC defines market power as [...] "..the ability of a seller profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time.". The underlying pricing structure for storage has discouraged development in the gas storage sector, which has not seen many new storage facilities constructed, besides current ones being expanded. In 2005, FERC announced a new Order 678 targeted particularly to gas storage. This rule is intended to stimulate the development of new gas storage facility in the ultimate goal of reducing natural <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> volatility. Commission Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher observed: [...] "Since 1988, natural gas demand in the United States has risen 24 percent. Over the same period, gas storage capacity has increased only 1.4 percent. While construction of storage capacity has lagged behind the demand for natural gas, we have seen record levels of price volatility. This suggests that current storage capacity is inadequate. Further, this year, what storage capacity exists may be full far earlier than in any previous year. According to some analysts, that raises the prospect that some domestic gas production may be shut-in. Our final rule should help reduce price volatility and expand storage capacity." ...|$|E
