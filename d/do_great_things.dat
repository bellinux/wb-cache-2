25|$|Asafa {{opened his}} 2011 season on 16 April at the National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica. He ran the 200m {{where he came}} in third after {{what looked to be}} a good first 140m, slowing down {{significantly}} at {{the last quarter of the}} race. His time was 20.55s for the race behind Yohan Blake and Daniel Bailey. Powell ran his next race was the 4x100m relay USA vs The World at the Penn Relays 2011, on 28 April. He ran the unusual first leg for Jamaica as he blasted off like a bullet to give Jamaica the lead. Jamaica won the event in a world leading time of 38.33s, ahead of USA Red and USA Blue teams respectively. He stated after the run that he was in good shape and was looking forward to <b>do</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> in the year ahead. Powell next ran the 200m at the Jamaica International Invitational Meet on 7 May. He looked promising in the first 120m, after which he slowed down drastically, finishing in last place with a time of 21.40s, in a race won by Jamaican Nickel Ashmeade. He later stated that he felt a minor pain in his hamstring and he backed off as a precaution, but insisted that it was nothing serious.|$|E
500|$|Pujols and the Cardinals set a {{deadline}} {{for the start of}} 2011 spring training for contract extension negotiations but failed to reach an agreement. After Pujols struggled in his first 30 games of the season in batting [...]231, he batted [...]316 with 30 home runs in his final 117 games. Against the Cubs, he hit consecutive extra-inning walk-off home runs on June 4 and 5 {{for the first time since}} Albert Belle in 1995. [...] Carpenter noted after the game that Pujols' slump earlier in the year was over: [...] "He continues to <b>do</b> <b>great</b> <b>things,</b> there's no doubt about it", he said. [...] "The things that he's done the last few days have been just like the old Albert." ...|$|E
500|$|Alice {{was engaged}} to Prince Louis of Hesse on 30 April 1861, {{following}} the Queen's consent. The Queen persuaded the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, to vote Alice a dowry of £30,000 [...] (£ as of [...] ). Although the amount was considered generous at the time, Prince Albert remarked that [...] "she {{will not be able}} to <b>do</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> with it" [...] in the little realm of Hesse, compared to the riches that her sister Victoria would inherit as future Queen of Prussia and German Empress. Furthermore, the couple's future home in Darmstadt, the Grand Ducal seat, was uncertain. Although Queen Victoria expected that a new palace would be built, the people of Darmstadt did not want to meet that expense, and the resulting controversy caused resentment there. This meant that Alice was unpopular in Darmstadt before she even arrived.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lyrics are}} said to be {{intended}} to poke fun at University President Colonel Prather. Prather had attended Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, whose president, Robert E. Lee, would frequently tell his students, [...] "the eyes of the South are upon you." [...] Prather was known for including in his speeches a similar admonition, [...] "The Eyes of Texas are Upon You," [...] meaning that the state of Texas was watching and expecting the students to go out and <b>do</b> <b>great</b> <b>things.</b> Prather enjoyed the song and promoted its usage. He died not long thereafter, and the song was played at his funeral.|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-one reviews {{appeared}} in London, and later one in Dublin. The British reviewers mostly regarded The Whale as [...] "a phenomenal literary work, a philosophical, metaphysical, and poetic romance". The Morning Advertiser for October 24 was {{in awe of}} Melville's learning, of his [...] "dramatic ability for producing a prose poem", and of the whale adventures which were [...] "powerful in their cumulated horrors." [...] To its surprise, John Bull found [...] "philosophy in whales" [...] and [...] "poetry in blubber", and concluded that few books that claimed to be either philosophical or literary works [...] "contain as much true philosophy and as much genuine poetry as {{the tale of the}} Pequods whaling expedition", making it a work [...] "far beyond the level of an ordinary work of fiction". The Morning Post found it [...] "one of the cleverest, wittiest, and most amusing of modern books", and predicted that it was a book [...] "which will <b>do</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> for the literary reputation of its author".|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, or (in {{the opinion}} of some commentators) subsequently, Saul and David were {{reconciled}} following a similar occurrence when David was able to infiltrate Saul's camp on the hill of Hachilah and remove his spear and a jug of water from his side while he and his guards lay asleep. In this account (1 Samuel 26), David is advised by Abishai that this is his opportunity to kill Saul, but David declines, saying he will not [...] "stretch out [...] hand against the Lord’s anointed". David shows, by removing Saul's spear, that he had chance to take Saul's life but did not do so. Saul confesses {{that he has been}} wrong to pursue David, blesses him and promises that he [...] "will <b>do</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> and surely triumph". David prays that his own protection will be like his protection of Saul. The New King James Version and the New International Version both identify this episode as a second reconciliation between Saul and David (with no account of any intervening dispute) but theologian Albert Barnes says the incident [...] "is of a nature unlikely to have occurred more than once". This, it seems, was their last interview; after this they saw each other no more.|$|E

2500|$|When Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{began to}} lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In {{preparation}} for the 1993 election, Chrétien {{won the right to}} have the final say over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétien's use of this power caused some protests within the Liberal Party with John Nunziata publicly complaining that [...] "The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all". Chrétien told one prospective Liberal candidate Hec Clouthier, who informed Chrétien that was probably going to win the nomination to be the Liberal candidate for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, defeating the incumbent Len Hopkins that: [...] "Well, you might [...] But you're {{not going to get the}} chance...I am the boss. I have the right to make this decision. I have an agenda for this country. I want to be prime minister and <b>do</b> <b>great</b> <b>things,</b> and I've got to put people in place who I can know can win". Chrétien added that he knew Hopkins could win because he won his seat eight times in a row while Clouthier had no equivalent record. When Clouthier refused to withdraw his candidacy as ordered and looked certain to win the Liberal nomination for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, he was expelled from the Liberal Party. Chrétien was so confident that he was going to win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the hand-over of power 13 months before it actually happened.|$|E
