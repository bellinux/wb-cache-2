40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new blind {{adaptive}} technique {{used for the}} <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> space-time block coded (STBC) signals transmitted over a dispersive MIMO channel. The proposed approach is based on minimising {{the difference between the}} probability density function (PDF) of the equalizer output — estimated via the Parzen window method — and a desired PDF based on the source symbols. The cost function combines this PDF fitting with an orthogonality criterion derived from the STBC structure of the transmitted data in order to discourage the extraction of identical signals. This cost function motivates an effective and low-cost stochastic gradient descent algorithm for adapting the equaliser. The performance is demonstrated in a number of simulations and benchmarked against other blind schemes for the <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> STBC over broadband MIMO channels. 1...|$|R

Frequency-domain {{differential detection}} and equalisation (FDDDE) for {{the reception of}} differentially encoded DS-CDMA signals transmitted over a frequency-selective fading channel is proposed. At a transmitter, the differentially encoded data symbol is spread and transmitted. At a receiver, differential detection, equalisation and despreading are simultaneously performed in the frequency-domain. Compared with that of coherent FDE, FDDDE is much more robust against fast fading.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the factors governing the spatial distribution of effort, it is essential to better understand the relationship between CPUE and abundance. In this study the spatial distribution of effort of the Namibian hake trawl fleet is examined by looking at competitive abilities among vessels, spatial allocation of effort, competition between vessels and <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> catch per unit effort (CPUE). The Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) was used as the foundation for deriving the tests. The results show that interference competition does not occur among vessels. Nevertheless, the prediction of the IFD <b>of</b> the <b>equalisation</b> <b>of</b> CPUE was confirmed in this fishery and indicates that the number of vessels in a specific area reflects stock density. Since there is no interference competition among vessels, the catchability coefficient (q) is not affected by this factor. Moreover, we infer that the CPUE from the whole area is not distorted as an index of abundance by the way effort is allocated in this fishery...|$|R
