We focus on the management problems, the relationship between ownership and <b>managerial</b> <b>authority</b> in small and medium-sized family businesses which play an important role, especially in the southeast coastal areas of China. From now on is the peak period of China’s first generation of family business transfer to the second generation successor and family management deficiencies have become increasingly prominent in the further development and enlarge process. It is good time to separate the ownership and <b>managerial</b> <b>authority,</b> employ professional managers. But there are also have some problems and difficulties during this process. The main content of the thesis is “why”, “how” and “what” about the issue of separation the ownership and <b>managerial</b> <b>authority,</b> employ professional managers. We focus on the reasons and difficulties to separate. And how does family business operate in the pattern of professional manage. At last we will get the conclusion and point out some recommendation...|$|R

40|$|Although McMahon {{offers a}} {{potentially}} valuable extension of Joseph Raz's conceptualization of authority by distinguishing three {{different kinds of}} authority, this paper argues, first, that {{his account of the}} conditions and considerations that would justify <b>managerial</b> <b>authority</b> is problematic because it relies on a conception of reasons for action that excludes precisely the kind of rationality that {{plays an important role in}} the␣explanation and justification of authority in economic␣organization. This paper explains, second, why McMahon's thesis of the justificatory similarity of authority in governments and nongovernmental organizations can also be seen to hold for corporate governance of publicly owned firms more specifically. Finally, this paper raises some critical objections against McMahon's presumption of democratic governance in governments and NGO's alike. The thrust of these objections is that democratic corporate governance does not make sense in the publicly owned firms because: (1) it will not produce results that are fair or welfare maximizing, and (2) it will undermine the legitimacy of <b>managerial</b> <b>authority</b> in such firms...|$|R
40|$|The {{perceived}} {{failure of}} the 2004 Disciplinary and Grievance Regulations to stem the rising number of industrial tribunals has revived interest in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques. With {{the publication of the}} Gibbons report in the UK, mediation was singled out as the process of choice for reform of the tribunal system. This paper examines research from the US / UK to develop a theoretical framework that relates forms of dispute resolution to underlying philosophical assumptions about authority and knowledge. The dominant discourse is rooted in top-down <b>managerial</b> <b>authority</b> driven by a belief in the legitimacy of disciplinary and grievance processes as a way of differentiating right from wrong. Research findings from the US suggest that improved employee relations can be achieved by adopting transformative mediation processes that support the development of conflict resolution skills. By investigating the philosophical assumptions of mediation, its link to direct democracy and challenge to <b>managerial</b> <b>authority</b> are revealed at the level of both theory and practice...|$|R

2500|$|ISKCON {{is seen as}} an {{extension}} of the Gaudiya-Vaishnava tradition and thus participates in the disciplic succession from Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In most Indic [...] traditions spiritual authority rests in one person, or acharya, head of a monastery or a whole sampradaya. ISKCON is sometimes described as the [...] "first global Vaisnava movement" [...] and is different. ISKCON is a multi-guru organization that places the ultimate <b>managerial</b> <b>authority</b> in its Governing Body, a group rather than a single person. Current ISKCON Guru System is developed by the group of leaders, Governing Body Commission, (GBC), the <b>managerial</b> <b>authority</b> of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. ISKCON Guru system [...] was originally initiated and put in place by ISKCON's founder, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada who organized and sometimes himself conducted initiations since early 1970s. Currently the GBC is entrusted with both spiritual and secular leadership of the ISKCON communities, as well as the power to appoint new gurus. According to a GBC confidence survey [...] "those holding critical views of the GBC were far less committed to ISKCON" [...] and it was also noted that householder members of ISKCON provides less support for ISKCON's gurus and the guru institution than the residents of ISKCON asramas controlled by GBC.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} case made by Christopher McMahon for {{managerial}} democracy. Specifically, I examine {{the extent to}} which McMahon’s account is able to address a series of objections against the case for managerial democracy as articulated by Thomas Christiano. Christiano articulates two sets of objections. First, Christiano argues that McMahon does not succeed in ruling out the possibility that <b>managerial</b> <b>authority</b> is best understood as promissory in its basis, in which case there is no presumption in favor of its democratic exercise. Second, Christiano raises a series of objections to the effect that even if we accept McMahon’s account of the nature of <b>managerial</b> <b>authority,</b> the conclusion for the democratic exercise of that authority by workers at the level of individual economic enterprises does not follow. In the end, I argue that McMahon’s account contains the resources to address these objections if one adopts a specific view about the moral limits to relationships that involve the submission of the will on the part of one person to another. Adoption of this view, however, appears to {{come at the expense of}} what I take to be the account’s commitment to liberalism. As such, what I understand this paper to reflect more generally is the apparent difficulty for liberals in arguing that there is something inherently morally troubling about capitalist work relations.
