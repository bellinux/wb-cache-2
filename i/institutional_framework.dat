5|$|Croatia is {{a unitary}} {{democratic}} parliamentary republic. Following {{the collapse of}} the ruling Communist League, Croatia adopted a new constitution in 1990 – which replaced the 1974 constitution adopted by the Socialist Republic of Croatia – and organised its first multi-party elections. While the 1990 constitution remains in force, it has been amended four times since its adoptionin 1997, 2000, 2001 and 2010. Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991, which led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. Croatia's status as a country was internationally recognised by the United Nations in 1992. Under its 1990 constitution, Croatia operated a semi-presidential system until 2000 when it switched to a parliamentary system. Government powers in Croatia are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers. The legal system of Croatia is civil law and, along with the <b>institutional</b> <b>framework,</b> is strongly influenced by the legal heritage of Austria-Hungary. By the time EU accession negotiations were completed on 30 June 2010, Croatian legislation was fully harmonised with the Community acquis. Croatia became a member state of the European Union on 1 July 2013.|$|E

This alternative replaces the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a smaller (coordinating) Bureau of Foreign Affairs, allowing professional competence to be developed within existing sectoral ministries of government. Though our argument is a general one, we illustrate it with reference to the Norwegia...|$|R

We examine the potential of formal contracting and relational governance developed at the partnership level to overcome the formal and informal institutional gap at the country level. Empirical results from a sample of 184 international partnerships of large US firms support an overall substitutive relationship between informal <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> and interorganizational relational arrangements whereby the performance benefits of relational governance are reinforced at higher degrees of informal institutional distance. Contrastingly, formal <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> and contractual governance are {{found to have a}} complementary relationship, with performance gains from formal contracting undermined at higher degrees of formal distance...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article.

The <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> considered are central bank independence (CBI), inflation targeting (IT), currency boards (CB) and monetary unions (MU). Against the vast literature that argues for the price stabilizing effects of each of these institutions, the empirical evidence presented here suggests that countries that have adopted the IT and CB regimes have, on average, been associated with lower inflation rates than others during the past decade. This finding is robust to various control variables, while governance appears to be a substitute to formal mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Analysis and {{engagement}} with partners working on ecosystem services transactions, policies and laws {{over the past}} 10 years have demonstrated a clear need {{to better understand the}} legal and <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> that have the potential to promote or hinder the development of payments for ecosystem services (PES) schemes, as well as the complex legal considerations that affect ecosystem services projects. In response, the IUCN Environmental Law Centre and The Katoomba Group have worked on a joint initiative to analyze the legal and <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> of water-related PES schemes and projects in four Andean countries: South America (Northeastern) -Brazil; Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. It has resulted in this report. Country-based analysts with experience in ecosystem services transactions have developed country and project assessments to define existing and recommend future regulatory and <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> that enable equitable and long-lasting ecosystem services transactions. Partners from North America (Central America) -Costa Rica; North America-Mexico; Ecuador and the North America-United States provided feedback on the assessments. The country assessments yielded lessons which were used to develop a set of recommendations on legal frameworks, property rights, enabling institutions, PES contracts, and governance issues supporting the future development of PES schemes...|$|R
40|$|The East African Community (EAC) {{suffers from}} a {{critical}} lack of cross-border railway networks that, if remedied, could improve regional connectivity and boost intraregional trade. The region would also become more investor friendly. Cross-border railway connectivity is particularly important owing to the challenging geographical location and small, uncompetitive and inefficient Partner States. The EAC Partner States have embarked on an ambitious programme to jointly revamp the region’s railways to address the transport deficits. Joint implementation of transport infrastructure projects offers economies of scale. However, joint efforts are constrained by inefficiencies of the region’s legal and <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks.</b> The region is characterised by inefficient legal and <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks.</b> This research argues that {{it is critical to}} first address the legal and institutional bottlenecks which will in turn constitute the backbone to support EAC’s efforts towards development and sustainable management of cross-border railways in the EAC. The research reviews effectiveness of the existing legal and <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks,</b> identifies gaps and, using Southern African Development Community (SADC) as a benchmark proposes solutions for improvement.
