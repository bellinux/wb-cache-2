5000|$|Generally, {{the term}} bitch is still {{considered}} offensive, and not accepted in formal situations. According to linguist Deborah Tannen, [...] "Bitch is the most contemptible thing {{you can say about}} a woman. Save perhaps the four-letter C word."It's common for the word to be censored on Prime time TV, often rendered as [...] "the b-word".

[...] The event was reported in censored format:On CNN's [...] "The Situation Room," [...] Washington Post media critic and CNN [...] "Reliable Sources" [...] host Howard Kurtz observed that [...] "Senator McCain did not embrace the 'b' word that this woman in the audience used."

5000|$|Also in October 2015, MSNBC {{was criticized}} for using a series of Israel-Palestine maps that have long been discredited as {{historically}} inaccurate and labeled as anti-Israel propaganda. The attempt by anchor <b>Kate</b> <b>Snow</b> and reporter Martin Fletcher was to show Israel's [...] "encroachment" [...] on [...] "historically Palestinian land" [...] since 1946. One of the biggest distortions was the first map claiming there was a State of Palestine that belonged to Palestinian Arabs in 1946, when in fact the territory was under British mandate at the time. The second map was the U.N.'s 1947 partition plan, which recommended the territory (still under British control) {{be divided into two}} states, one for Jews and one for Arabs, but the network did not acknowledge that the Arabs rejected the plan. Israel also did not claim independence until 1948, which further proved the maps to be inaccurate. After being called out, Fletcher, who had claimed that Jewish settlements will continue to eat up the land, acknowledged the errors on Facebook saying, [...] "The first of the four maps was dead wrong and should not have been included. I wish I had pointed that out when I first saw it." [...] A network spokesman said the attempt was to [...] "shed light on the geographic context of the Israeli-Palestinian issue" [...] and that it would re-broadcast the correct maps the following week, which it did.|$|E
