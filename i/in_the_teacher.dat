Williams, and had [...] "the chilliest {{relationship}} with the mayor" [...] of any Council member. Chavous was an early supporter of Councilmember Carol Schwartz's tax cut package in March 1999, which became law in May. Chavous also led a nine-month effort to reconstitute and reform the D.C. Board of Education. [...] After a long battle with Mayor Williams and other Council members, the Council approved a plan {{to reduce the size}} of the board, and make four of the nine members subject to mayoral appointment (with Council confirmation). Voters were asked to approve the [...] "hybrid" [...] board, which they did so in a close vote in June 2000. According to The Washington Post, the bruising school board battle helped and hindered Chavous politically. While his allies said it showed he could tackle tough problems, dissenters argued that Chavous avoided the real issues (lack of money for schools and crumbling infrastructure). Chavous blamed the lengthy legislative process on unnamed individuals who he said did not engage in good faith in the process, but critics argued that Chavous never engaged in the kind of political hardball that was needed to move the reform bill along faster. Larry Gray, legislative chairman of the D.C. Congress of PTAs, blamed Chavous for deep cuts in the school budget during the past four years, failures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> certification program, and significant delays in getting technology into the classroom.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the major}} aspects of {{sustainable}} education is personality type and the hierarchy of motives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher's</b> professional activity motivation. If the motives related to satisfying basic needs play <b>the</b> major role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher's</b> professional development, <b>the</b> personality type remains an unfulfilled potential. <b>The</b> participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> research were primary school teachers and primary and basic school sports teachers. C. Zamfir's Work Motivation Inventory (WMI) {{has been used to}} study the hierarchy of motives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher's</b> professional activity motivation structure; N. Obozov's inventory “Determining Personality Type” (DPT) has been used to identify <b>the</b> <b>teacher's</b> personality type. <b>The</b> motives related to satisfying basic needs play <b>the</b> major role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher's</b> motivation structure. No statistically significant correlation between personality type and professional activity motivation has been detected. The necessity to satisfy meta-needs related to professional growth and self-realisation motives is being actualised only on condition basic needs are satisfied...|$|R
60|$|This {{suggests}} that God {{is no more}} idle now than He was at the beginning, but that He is still and forever shaping the human chaos into the instruments and means of beauty. It may also suggest to that scholar- pride, that vanity of technique, which is so apt to vaunt itself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> that {{the best he can}} do, after all, is to let the pupil teach himself. If he comes with divine authority to the thing he attempts, he will know how to use the appliances, of which the teacher is only the first.|$|E
60|$|Still, however, if {{cases are}} often {{referred}} to them, the feeling will gradually creep in, that the school is managed on republican principles, as they call it; and they will, unless this point is specially guarded, gradually lose that spirit of entire and cordial subordination, so necessary {{for the success of}} any school. It should often be distinctly explained to them, that a republican government is one, where the power essentially resides in the community, and is exercised by a ruler, only so far as the community delegates it to him; whereas in the school, the government is based on the principle, that the power, primarily and essentially, resides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> the scholars exercising only such as he may delegate to them.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps some individuals, {{who have}} had some {{collision}} with their trustees or committee, will ask me if I mean, that a teacher ought to be entirely and immediately under the supervision {{and control of the}} trustees, just as a mechanic is when employed by another man. By no means. There are various circumstances connected with the nature of this employment; the impossibility of the employers fully understanding it in all its details; and the character and the standing of the teacher himself, which always will, in matter of fact, prevent this. The employers always will, in a great many respects, place more confidence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> and in his views, than they will in their own. But still, the ultimate power is theirs. Even if they err,--if they wish to have a course pursued which is manifestly inexpedient and wrong, they still have a right to decide. It is their work: it is going on at their instance, and at their expense, and the power of ultimate decision, on all disputed questions, must, from {{the very nature of the}} case, rest with them. The teacher may, it is true, have his option either to comply with their wishes or to seek employment in another sphere; but while he remains in the employ of any persons, whether in teaching or in any other service, he is bound to yield to the wishes of his employers, when they insist upon it, and to submit pleasantly to their direction, when they shall claim their undoubted right to direct.|$|E

60|$|So {{much for}} the {{tangible}} facts. We come now to {{the account of the}} phenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the world. It appears that in the Sussexville Proprietary School, Plattner not only discharged the duties of Modern Languages Master, but also taught chemistry, commercial geography, bookkeeping, shorthand, drawing, and any other additional subject to which the changing fancies of the boys' parents might direct attention. He knew little or nothing of these various subjects, but in secondary as distinguished from Board or elementary schools, knowledge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> is, very properly, by no means so necessary as high moral character and gentlemanly tone. In chemistry he was particularly deficient, knowing, he says, nothing beyond the Three Gases (whatever the three gases may be). As, however, his pupils began by knowing nothing, and derived all their information from him, this caused him (or anyone) but little inconvenience for several terms. Then a little boy named Whibble joined the school, who had been educated (it seems) by some mischievous relative into an inquiring habit of mind. This little boy followed Plattner's lessons with marked and sustained interest, and in order to exhibit his zeal on the subject, brought, at various times, substances for Plattner to analyse. Plattner, flattered by this evidence of his power of awakening interest, and trusting to the boy's ignorance, analysed these, and even, made general statements as to their composition. Indeed, he was so far stimulated by his pupil as to obtain a work upon analytical chemistry, and study it during his supervision of the evening's preparation. He was surprised to find chemistry quite an interesting subject.|$|E
