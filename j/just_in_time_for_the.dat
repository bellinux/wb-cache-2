It also located Sputnik 2's carrier rocket at just after midnight on 16 November 1957.|$|E

5|$|Woodfull {{started the}} 1929–30 Australian season by scoring an unbeaten 100 against the touring MCC, {{overseeing}} a successful run-chase. However, his season {{was cut short}} in the third match when he suffered a broken hand after {{being hit by a}} short ball from Hugh Thurlow in a match against Queensland.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. In step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E
5|$|Wells {{had survived}} {{the death of his}} first wife and all four of his brothers; he also had no children, leaving him without a clear heir. His estate was further {{complicated}} by his lack of a will. Accordingly, under New York law at the time, his holdings were divided among his widow, fifteen nephews and one grand nephew. They decided to subdivide and sell the property, and within a few years more buildings had gone up, <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1848, which laid its track on a causeway right across the river's mouth. Over the next several decades, as Yonkers' population grew rapidly, leading it to incorporate as a village and then, in 1872, a city, the rest of the estuary was filled in and narrowed and the bluffs on its south side graded out of existence.|$|E

5|$|In May 1911, the Pennsylvania General Assembly {{passed the}} Sproul Roads Act, which created the Pennsylvania state road system {{and allowed the}} state to take over turnpikes. Baltimore Pike was {{designated}} Legislative Route 42 from the Maryland state line northwest to the borough of Gettysburg. The Sproul Roads Act was challenged as being unconstitutional, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the legislation on June 27, 1913. The state took over the Gettysburg and Petersburg Turnpike and abolished tolls the next day, <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> March to Gettysburg ahead of the 1913 Gettysburg reunion. Baltimore Pike was improved as a macadam road from the state line to Gettysburg by 1916. The highway from the state line to US 15 {{at the intersection of}} Baltimore Street and Steinwehr Avenue (then Emmitsburg Road) was designated the northernmost part of US 140 in 1927. US 140 was widened and resurfaced with concrete from Gettysburg to Littlestown between 1941 and 1943. The remainder of the highway through Littlestown to the Maryland state line was widened and resurfaced with asphalt between 1943 and 1953. US 140's interchange with modern US 15 was completed when the thentwo-lane US 15 bypass opened in June 1963, immediately before the centennial of the Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Marthandan {{arrives at}} Ratnapuri. Vijayavarman asks {{him to stay}} in an {{isolated}} palace on the outskirts and tells him that he should not meet his wife Manohari until the coronation, as the current moment is inauspicious. On entering a hotel in Ratnapuri, Veerangan and Sagayam beat up a gang of rowdies. Hired by Vijayavarman, they mistake Veerangan for Marthandan. Veerangan is chased by palace guards and ends up in Marthandan's room. Marthandan and Veerangan meet face to face. Veerangan tells him of the pathetic state the people of Ratnapuri, and Marthandan agrees to set everything right as soon as he takes charge. On the eve of the coronation, Vijayavarman arranges for Marthandan to be poisoned. He carries out his plan with the help of Karmegam, a royal advisor. Marthandan swoons after drinking a few sips of the poisoned beverage, but is soon saved by Veerangan and Ratnapuri's commander-in-chief. However, Marthandan is still unconscious and incapacitated. The commander-in-chief, and one of the ministers, persuade Veerangan to take Marthandan's place to ensure that the coronation takes place as scheduled. A reluctant Veerangan agrees {{to do so in the}} interests of the state, and arrives <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coronation. It takes place smoothly and Veerangan, as Marthandan, becomes Ratnapuri's new king. Vijayavarman and Pingalan are taken aback and send men to investigate. They find the unconscious Marthandan and kidnap him.|$|E
