5|$|The same period, when a {{battered}} Byzantium defended <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> enemies on all fronts, {{also saw the}} emergence of a new, unexpected threat: the Rus' made their first appearance in Byzantine history with a raid against Paphlagonia in the 830s, followed by a major expedition in 860.|$|E
5|$|Although {{weakened}} {{and pushed}} south beyond the Huai River, the Southern Song found {{new ways to}} bolster its strong economy and defend <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> the Jin dynasty.

5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to defend <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

5|$|The French Republican {{position}} {{became increasingly}} difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for {{support of a}} counter-revolution abroad. Chief among them were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien.

5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident, they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family; this Declaration of Pilnitz threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.

5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Atlantic torpedo {{is capable}} of {{generating}} up to 220volts of electricity to subdue its prey or defend <b>itself</b> <b>against</b> predators. Its diet consists mainly of bony fishes, though it also feeds on small sharks and crustaceans. It is an aplacental viviparous species, wherein the developing embryos are nourished by yolk and later maternally provided histotroph ("uterine milk"). Females give birth to up to 60 young following a gestation period of one year. The electric shock of this species can be quite severe and painful, {{though it is not}} fatal. Because of its electrogenic properties, the Atlantic torpedo was used in medicine by the Ancient Greeks and Romans and became the namesake of the naval weapon. Prior to the 19th century, its liver oil was used as lamp fuel, but it is no longer of any economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; it is caught unintentionally by commercial and recreational fishers, but the impact of these activities on its population is unknown.|$|E
