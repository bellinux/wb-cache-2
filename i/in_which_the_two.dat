5|$|A third North American genus called Stegomus {{was named}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1896. Marsh had a long-time rivalry with Cope {{that was made}} famous in the Bone Wars of the late 19th century, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> tried to out-compete {{one another in the}} field and in {{scientific}} literature. Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, Stegomus was found from the eastern United States in Connecticut. Marsh also recognized Stegomus as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in his initial description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes to belong to phytosaurs during this time period.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Challenge (known as Dueling Dragons from 1999 to 2010) {{was a pair}} of intertwined, {{inverted}} {{roller coasters}} in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter area of Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, United States. The ride was themed to two chasing dragons, one side being Chinese Fireball and the other Hungarian Horntail. It featured a layout <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> trains shared adjacent lift hills but traversed two unique courses. The ride was designed by Bolliger & Mabillard of Switzerland. The Chinese Fireball dragon reached a top speed of 60mph, and the Hungarian Horntail dragon reached a top speed of 55mph. Both versions featured five inversions and a total ride time of two minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E

5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> no longer saw each other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E

5|$|Early writers {{claimed the}} Mascarene parrot {{was found on}} Madagascar, an idea that led the French naturalist and ornithologist René Primevère Lesson to coin the junior synonym Mascarinus madagascariensis in 1831. His new genus name prevailed and, when Tommaso Salvadori {{combined}} it with the earlier specific name in 1891, it became a tautonym (a scientific name <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> parts are identical). Lesson also included species of the Tanygnathus and Psittacula genera in Mascarinus, {{but this was not}} accepted by other writers. The following year, the German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler erected the genus Coracopsis for the Mascarene parrot (which became Coracopsis mascarina under this system) and the lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). The English zoologist William Alexander Forbes, believing that mascarinus was invalid as a specific name, since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name Mascarinus duboisi in 1879, in honour of Dubois. The binomial name was emended from M. mascarinus to M. mascarin by the IOC World Bird List in 2016, to conform with how other species epithets by Linnaeus have been treated.|$|E

5|$|From {{the spring}} of 1944, the Corps focused {{increasingly}} on fighting the Partisans penetrating Serbia from Bosnia and the Sandžak, and the first clashes with Chetnik groups did not occur until 1944. On 5 January 1944, combat with the Partisans in Klenak resulted {{in the deaths of}} three Cossacks of the 1st Regiment. On 18 January, the 5th Regiment was formed in Obrenovac. The 3rd Regiment outfought a 2,400-strong Partisan force advancing towards Jošanička Banja on 31 March. On 28 April, the 1st Regiment prepared defences along the Drina in Zvornik, Bajina Bašta and Loznica areas expecting the 16th and 17th Partisan Divisions to attempt a crossing there. On 30 April, the headquarters of the 4th Regiment was moved to Aleksinac. On 1–2 May, the 5th Regiment fought the Partisans in the village of Mravinci, sustaining casualties of 11 killed and 25 wounded. That summer, the Corps mediated an agreement between one group of Chetniks and the Germans <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> parties agreed to fight the Partisans in Serbia. On 18 July, the 5th Regiment fought in Jošanička Banja and its regimental headquarters was moved there from Obrenovac, with battalion headquarters being established in Zvečan, Jošanička Banja, Ušće and Vučitrn. Elements of the 3rd and 5th Regiments fought the Partisans on 4–5 August near the village of Rudnik. The Partisans attacked the positions of the 5th Regiment in Leposavić on 24 August.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Earl of Pembroke {{had been}} {{negotiating}} with France {{to resolve the}} long-standing disagreements over the administration of Gascony, {{and as part of}} this Edward and Isabella agreed to travel to Paris in June 1313 to meet with Philip IV. Edward probably hoped both to resolve the problems in the south of France and to win Philip's support in the dispute with the barons; for Philip it was an opportunity to impress his son-in-law with his power and wealth. It proved a spectacular visit, including a grand ceremony <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> kings knighted Philip's sons and 200 other men in Notre Dame, large banquets along the River Seine, and a public declaration that both kings and their queens would join a crusade to the Levant.

In between those clashes, on 23 April 2011, Benzema scored a goal and assisted on another in a 6–3 win over Valencia. On 30 April, he scored a goal in the team's 3–2 loss to Real Zaragoza. It was the only match of the campaign that Real Madrid loss, in which Benzema scored. To close out the campaign, Benzema scored another double in an 8–1 win over Almería. He finished the campaign second on the team behind Ronaldo with 26 goals as Real Madrid captured the Copa del Rey giving Benzema his first honour with the club. For his performances during the campaign, particularly during the second half, Benzema was praised by Mourinho, club officials Florentino Pérez and Emilio Butragueño, as well as national team manager Laurent Blanc.|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the 2011 Orange Bowl focused on the manner <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> teams involved had reversed their fortunes during the 2010 college football season. Stanford had its longest winning streak since 1991 its most wins in history, and was four years removed from a one-win season, while Virginia Tech became the first team in college football history to win 11 consecutive games in a season after losing its first two. The two teams had never played each other, but they shared a common 2010 opponent, Wake Forest. Before the Orange Bowl, Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said he didn't see much difference in quality. Another point of conversation was the poor performance of the ACC in nonconference games and Virginia Tech's poor past performance against teams ranked in the top 5. The Hokies had won just one of 27 games against teams in that category. Partially because of this factor, spread bettors favored Stanford by three points when the first odds were released December 10, a margin that various organizations either kept constant or raised to 3.5 points by the day of the game. It was the first time all season the Hokies were point spread underdogs.|$|E
5|$|Since 2009, the {{intensity}} of the rivalry has waned as the duo's domination of the domestic game has decreased. This is partly due to the resurgence of North Belfast derby clubs, Cliftonville and Crusaders. In 2013, Cliftonville became the first club other than Linfield or Glentoran to lift the league title since Portadown did so in 2002. In 2014, Cliftonville went on to retain the title {{for the first time in}} the club's history, with Crusaders then winning the 2014–15 title in convincing fashion, finishing 10 points ahead of runners-up Linfield. During this time, Glentoran lifted the Irish Cup in 2013 and again in 2015, but their overall fortunes on the field have taken a relative downturn. The club has won only three league titles since the turn of the 21st century; in 2002–03, 2004–05 and 2008–09. Since then, they have finished as low as ninth place in the 2016–17 season. The last season <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> clubs finished as champions and runners-up in either order was 2008–09, and they have not met in a major domestic cup final since 2006, when they contested both the Irish Cup and the League Cup finals.|$|E
