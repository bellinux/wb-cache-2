5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'. He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not open himself to other men and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not open himself to greatness.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> deploy as many boats as he chose, {{being paid}} defined {{fees for the}} weight and {{distance}} of goods carried, and for passage of empty boats through each lock. Passenger fees were also defined. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> deploy armed guards to enforce regulations.|$|E

5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> judge the quality of the voice acting since <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|A libertinus was not {{entitled}} to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play a priestly role in {{the cult of the}} emperor. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law. Any future children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie {{also had}} the option to avoid a pitched battle, instead {{beginning}} siege operations against the French position. His force was large enough that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have fully invested the French position and fended off any arriving reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|After the diagnosis, Ryan White was too ill {{to return}} to school, but by early 1985 {{he began to feel}} better. His mother asked if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> return to school, but was told by school {{officials}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not. On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{allegations}} that Leopold's surrender {{had been an}} act of collaboration provoked a political crisis, known as the Royal Question, about whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> return to the throne, which ultimately ended with his abdication.|$|E
5|$|After this arrangement, Constantine {{ruled the}} dioceses of Pannonia and Macedonia and took {{residence}} at Sirmium, whence <b>he</b> <b>could</b> wage {{war on the}} Goths and Sarmatians in 322, and on the Goths in 323.|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned away}} with a dull sickening pain at his heart. The worst he had not told her. How <b>could</b> <b>he?</b> How <b>could</b> <b>he</b> add another to her sorrows by telling her of the peril in which <b>he</b> stood? How <b>could</b> <b>he</b> tell her what he {{suspected}} to be true--that in that quiet little Italian town English detectives were watching his every movement, and that at any moment he might be arrested? With her joyless life, and with this new misery closing around her, {{would it not be}} well for her to die? ...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. He did not feel <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E

5|$|By 1801, Priestley {{had become}} so ill that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer write or experiment. He died {{on the morning of}} 6 February 1804, aged seventy and was buried at Riverview Cemetery in Northumberland, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer}} travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> easily {{walk to the}} government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache {{and most of his}} facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Despite having bested the Romans {{in their}} battles, Pyrrhus had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. With his Italian allies wavering, Pyrrhus decided {{to abandon his}} campaign against Rome. At this point in time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> return to Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant {{by the death of}} King Ptolemy Keraunos {{at the hands of the}} Gallic invaders of Greece. Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC. Alternatively, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> respond to the appeal of the Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression.|$|E

5|$|Hergé {{requested}} that Jean Dupont, {{the editor of}} L'Écho illustré– the magazine in which The Adventures of Tintin was serialised in Switzerland– send him documentation on Swiss railways which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> draw from. He also {{requested that}} his Swiss friend Charly Fornora send him a bottle of Valais wine which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> again use as a model from which to draw. Hergé subsequently travelled to Switzerland himself to produce accurate sketches of scenes around Geneva which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> then incorporate into the story; these included at Geneva Cointrin International Airport, Genève-Cornavin railway station, and the Cornavin Hotel, {{as well as the}} road through Cervens and Topolino's house in Nyon. Despite this realism, a number of minor errors were made in Hergé's depiction of Geneva.|$|E
5|$|In 1482, Leonardo, who {{according}} to Vasari was a talented musician, created a silver lyre {{in the shape}} of a horse's head. Lorenzo de' Medici sent Leonardo to Milan, bearing the lyre as a gift, to secure peace with Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. At this time Leonardo wrote an often-quoted letter describing the many marvellous and diverse things that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> achieve in the field of engineering and informing Ludovico that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also paint.|$|E
