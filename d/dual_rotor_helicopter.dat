40|$|Controlling {{an indoor}} flying robot through an {{on-board}} processor has drawn the attentions of many researchers. While {{most of them}} use single rotor conventional helicopter and program their robots with low-level language such as C, we researched a different approach by proposing an on-board computation of sensing, actuator control and communication system for a coaxial helicopter with Java. Once we have developed a robust and time efficient Java control system, then we can research flight control and navigation of the helicopter {{with the aim of}} eventually using it in site assessment tasks in urban disaster search and rescue. The coaxial helicopter has advantages over other aerodynamic structures in indoor flight. So, we choose the Lama X. R. B coaxial helicopter and research how to convert it into a computer controlled helicopter. As Java is a high-level safe language, its object-oriented and safe features can be advantageous when we develop a complicated real-time system. A series of problems need to be solved in order to develop such system. The problems can be categorized into four main areas: (a) controlling the four actuators that control the helicopter, (b) reading and processing the sensor data, (c) communication with the host over a wireless network, and (d) developing a software architecture to achieve all the above in real-time, with sufficient CPU time left for flight control and navigation in subsequent research projects. Flight control requires both good actuator control and an accurate model of the dynamics. This thesis focuses on actuator control, leaving flight control for future research. To solve these problems, we have obtained a Sun SPOT for use as an on-board processor to control the helicopter’s actuators and to manage the on-board sensors. Also, one of our colleagues had developed a real-time operating system called JARTOS and we can embed JARTOS into the Sun SPOT to manage this system to make sure the higher priority processes run in real-time. In order to control the helicopter’s actuators, we developed pulse train generation software to simulate the radio control pulse train. For managing the on-board sensors, we developed software I 2 C protocol to read sensor information. We also redesigned all the software to allow each function running under the management of JARTOS. Finally, all the communication between the remote helicopter and the host Macintosh are done by internal IEEE 802. 15. 4 software support in the Sun SPOT. However, we found that incomplete support of the Sun SPOT firmware and uncertain behaviours of the Java virtual machine brought us a series of problems, mainly performance problem. We know that controlling an aerial vehicle’s actuators requires micro second level accuracy. But with the Sun SPOT’s multi layer architecture, time is wasted in inter-board communication. We have provided evidences of possible performance improvement with a proposed new firmware release as reference for future development. Thus, we have developed a prototype on-board system for the control of a <b>dual</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopter.</b> We have researched the requirements of each area of the software: actuator control, sensor reading, wireless communication and host graphical user interface. First, we wrote standalone programs to experiment in each area. Then we decomposed each program into sets of interacting processes that can run under JARTOS. The result is a working system that is too slow for flight control. The main problem is that the I 2 C communication is very slow. We are discussing a fix for this with Sun...|$|E
50|$|The W.11 was a {{development}} of the Weir W.6 <b>dual</b> transverse <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopter.</b> It is the only helicopter of its type ever built and included three lifting rotors all turning in the same direction. The adoption of three rotors was due to concerns over the capability of a single large rotor to generate the required lift.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a set of}} governing coupled differential equations for {{a model of a}} hybrid aircraft. The model consists of multiple rotor systems connected by an elastic interconnecting structure, with options to add any combination of or all of the following components; i. e., thrusters, a buoyant hull, and an underslung weight. The dynamic equations are written for the individual blade with hub motions, for the rigid body motions of the whole model, and also for the flexible modes of the interconnecting structure. One of {{the purposes of this study}} is to serve as the basis of a numerical study aimed at determining the aeroelastic stability and structural response characteristics of a Hybrid Heavy Lift Airship (HHLA). It is also expected that the formulation may be applicable to analyzing stability and responses of <b>dual</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters</b> such as a Heavy Lift Helicopter (HLH). Futhermore, the model is capable of representing coupled rotor/body aeromechanical problems of single <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters...</b>|$|R
50|$|Tandem <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{typically}} {{require less}} power to hover and achieve low speed flight {{as compared to}} single <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters.</b> Both configurations typically require the same power to achieve high speed flight.|$|R
50|$|Single <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters</b> need a {{mechanism}} to neutralize the yawing movement produced by the single large rotor. This is commonly accomplished by a tail rotor, coaxial rotors, and the NOTAR systems. Tandem <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters,</b> however, use counter-rotating rotors, with each cancelling out the other's torque. Therefore all of the power from the engines {{can be used for}} lift (force), whereas a single <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopter</b> uses some of the engine power to counter the torque. An alternative is to mount two rotors in a coaxial configuration. The first successful tandem <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopter</b> was built by Nicolas Florine in 1927.|$|R

5000|$|Tandem rotor {{aerodynamics}} is {{a complex}} subject. Tandem <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{have the advantage of}} being able to hold more weight with shorter blades, since there are two sets. However, the rear rotor works in the aerodynamic shadow of the front rotor, which reduces its efficiency. This loss can be minimized by increasing the distance between the two rotor hubs, and by elevating one hub over the other. [...] Tandem <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters</b> tend to have a lower disk loading than single <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters.</b>|$|R

Counter-rotating rotor blades won't collide with and destroy each other if they flex into the other rotor's pathway.|$|R

25|$|Single <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{are limited}} in forward speed by a {{combination}} of sonic tip speed and retreating blade stall. As the advance ratio increases, the relative velocity experienced by the retreating blade decreases so that the tip of the blade experiences zero velocity at an advance ratio of one. <b>Helicopter</b> <b>rotors</b> pitch the retreating blade to a higher angle of attack to maintain lift as the relative velocity decreases. At a sufficiently high advance ratio, the blade will reach the stalling angle of attack and experience retreating blade stall. Specially designed airfoils can increase the operating advance ratio by utilizing high lift coefficient airfoils. Currently, single <b>rotor</b> <b>helicopters</b> are practically limited to advance ratios less than 0.7.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} a five {{degrees of freedom}} (5 -DOF) model for aeroengine spindle dual-rotor system dynamic analysis. In this system, the <b>dual</b> <b>rotors</b> are supported on two angular contact ball bearings and two deep groove ball bearings, one of the latter-mentioned bearings works as the inter-shaft bearing. Driven by respective motors, the <b>dual</b> <b>rotors</b> have different co-rotating speeds. The proposed model mathematically formulates the nonlinear displacements, elastic deflections and contact forces of bearings with consideration of 5 -DOF and coupling of <b>dual</b> <b>rotors.</b> The nonlinear equations of motions of <b>dual</b> <b>rotors</b> with 5 -DOF are solved using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm. In order to investigate {{the effect of the}} introduced 5 -DOF and nonlinear dynamic bearing model, we compare the proposed model with two models: the 3 -DOF model of this system only considering three translational degrees of freedom (Gupta, 1993, rotational freedom is neglected); the 5 -DOF model where the deep groove ball bearings are simplified as linear elastic spring (Guskov, 2007). The simulation results verify Gupta's prediction (1993) and show that the rotational freedom of rotors and nonlinear dynamic model of bearings have great effect on the system dynamic simulation. The quantitative results are given as well...|$|R
