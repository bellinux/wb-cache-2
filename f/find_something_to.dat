5|$|Meanwhile, Claire is {{reunited with}} Sherry and discovers that the mutated Birkin has {{implanted}} his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by Birkin leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory to <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> treat her wounds. He {{is interrupted by}} a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant – which falls into a pit of molten metal – seemingly {{at the cost of}} her own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow, implying Ada's survival and escape with the G-virus in the pendant. Birkin– now mutated into a large agglomeration of flesh and teeth– follows the protagonists, but is destroyed when a self-destruct system causes the train to explode. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for her brother. Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, is able to successfully complete his G-virus retrieval mission.|$|E

As they are cacti, overwatering is a concern for home growers. As their growth continues, these climbing plants will <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> climb on, which can involve putting aerial roots down from the branches {{in addition to the}} basal roots. Once the plant reaches a mature 10 pounds in weight, the plant may flower.|$|E

They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E

[...] Reviewers lauded the many customization options available to players: Watters and Kuchera praised the concept of psych profiles to hone more agreeable teammate selections, but questioned its effectiveness; G4 considered Reachs Forge World more expansive and impressive than Halo 3s Forge offerings; and Lynch wrote that the sheer quantity of multiplayer options would give the game a long life cycle for players.|$|E

500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that we felt we should take our time, and also {{we wanted to make}} sure that it was the best it could possibly be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> go back and change." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} editors writing for People also praised the record's [...] "fresh and original" [...] melodies and [...] "quick-tempoed cool", adding, [...] "Kudos to Green Day, young punk's reigning purists, for {{sticking}} {{with what they}} know best." [...] Sandy Masuo of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "mature songwriting that really makes this album tick", noting that [...] "Naturally, a couple of thrash 'n' bash hard-core paeans are included, but they're surrounded by songs that are surprisingly varied in character and grounded in a pop aesthetic that evokes a gaggle of great tunesmiths." [...] Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "If Green Day still has a loyal following, its fans are bound to <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> like on Nimrod; for all the attempts at diversity, the record is packed with mile-wide hooks and sing-along anthems." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Walton, {{while writing}} for GameSpot, {{thought that the}} general idea for the game was good, but that the {{gameplay}} was [...] "tiresome" [...] and failed to excite. He said that the animation was [...] "woefully bad", and there were several bugs such as the cover taking mechanism failing to work on several occasions. An attempt to bring variety to the game through minigames was seen as [...] "a poor mishmash of those from other games", and compared those sections to other games such as Portal and the Uncharted series. Walton explained that the game made [...] "small wins" [...] by including the voice acting from the same cast as the movie, but {{said that there were}} [...] "too many glaring problems" [...] with the game to <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> like. He gave it a score of 3.5 out of ten for the version on PC.|$|E

500|$|Halo 3 {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. It holds {{an average of}} 93.53% and 94/100 on aggregate web sites GameRankings and Metacritic. Pro-Gs Wesley Yin-Poole assured readers that Halo 3 {{lived up to the}} enormous hype surrounding it, writing that the game was [...] "everything we hoped it would be, and much, much, more". Reviewers including Eurogamers Rob Fahey, GamesRadar's Charlie Barrett, and GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann felt that the underlying formula of previous Halo games was unchanged, but {{that this was not a}} detriment. [...] "Every type of Halo fan, from the hardcore to the casual to the brand new, will <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> satisfy them in Master Chief's third adventure," [...] Barrett asserted, [...] while IGN's Hilary Goldstein referred to Halo 3 as [...] "the most complete game available on any console", specifically stating [...] "the Forge and the replay functionality raise the bar for console shooters so high, it may never be surpassed this generation." [...] The gameplay additions to the game, such as equipment and new vehicles, were praised; Gerstmann and Goldstein noted that equipment had much more relevance in multiplayer matches than the campaign.|$|E
500|$|Absolute Garbage {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinqumani gave a positive {{overview of the}} compilation, writing that the album [...] "serves as an anthropological study of the musical relics of a bygone era", while Laila Hassani of Heat summed up her five-star review by writing, [...] "Few modern female-fronted rock bands {{stand the test of}} time, but this reminds you why, along with Gwen Stefani's No Doubt, Garbage are one of them." [...] A reviewer for Instinct wrote [...] "this hits collection is loaded with songs best described as massive... you'll <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> love here". Jaime Gill, in a review for BBC Music, felt that [...] "Absolute Garbage is a fine legacy, the sound of a briefly brilliant and always interesting band" [...] and that overall the album [...] "sounds like no other greatest hits you own." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine wrote, [...] "By wrapping their nut-grabbing hooks and transcendent melodies in layers of gutsy guitars, Garbage managed to make pop music for people who thought they didn't like pop music. For that reason, whatever happens next, they deserve to be remembered fondly." [...] A reviewer for the Daily Mail described it as [...] "a slick blend of grunge-rock power and sultry girl-group harmonies" [...] and added, [...] " [...] already sounds dated, but the songs stand up well." ...|$|E
500|$|Composer Tim Larkin, a sound {{designer}} and audio director at Cyan {{who had previously}} worked on realMyst and , was given the task of developing Myst Vs musical score. Larkin stated that whereas earlier Myst games had been constrained by technological limitations, the available technology allowed End of Ages {{to have a more}} dynamic environment, with the music changing with various timings of different sound effects. Surround sound provided a more realistic and immersive gameplay experience. A major challenge in writing the music was that the score had to be flexible enough to match the non-linear gameplay events. [...] "Games are totally interactive experiences," [...] Larkin explained. [...] "You don't guide a player through, since you can't count on being at a certain place at a certain time. I can't write cue music to get the player to do this, this and then this. One player might hear the cue and run the other way!" [...] Larkin had to step away from what he had learned as a jazz composer and musician writing pieces with a definite beginning and end, instead creating music with [...] "less arc" [...] and structure. Larkin admitted that some Myst fans would have preferred a musical style similar to Robyn Miller's scores for Myst and Riven, but replied by saying that change happens and players would <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> like in the new music if they kept an open mind.|$|E

500|$|Like the {{original}} release, The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of GamePro praised its updated audio, {{and said that}} the new graphics [...] "blow the old clunker visuals ... out of the water". He cited its script, humor, plot, puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points, and finished, [...] "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is impressive, hilarious and downright worth your money." [...] Daemon Hatfield of IGN wrote, [...] "Almost 20 years after its release, [...] remains a blast to play." [...] He called the new graphics [...] "slick, if a little generic", and noted that the [...] "original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don't." [...] However, he enjoyed the redone music, the new hint function, and the added sound effects and voice acting. He summarized it as [...] "one of the best times you'll ever have pointing and clicking", and noted that [...] "few games are this funny." [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot noted that [...] "the Special Edition looks much better and {{is the only way to}} play if you want to hear ... what characters are saying, whereas {{the original}} game's interface is less clunky." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it's difficult to go back to the original edition." [...] He praised its humor, writing, puzzles and characters, and he believed that it had aged well. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead wrote, [...] "Purists like me will almost certainly <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> grumble about over the span of the game, but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better." [...] However, he preferred the original game's Guybrush design, and believed that the new control system was [...] "rather less intuitive" [...] than the old one. He finished by stating that [...] "few games can stand the test of time with such confidence".|$|E
