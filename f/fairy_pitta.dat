25|$|Earthworms {{form the}} {{major part of}} the diet of pittas, {{followed}} by snails in order of importance. Earthworms may however become seasonally unavailable in dry conditions when the worms move deeper into the soil. In addition a wide range of invertebrate prey is eaten, including many insects groups such as termites, ants, beetles, true bugs, and lepidopterans; as well as freshwater crabs, centipedes, millipedes, and spiders. In addition to invertebrates some species, such as the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> and rainbow pitta, have been recorded feeding on vertebrate prey. These include skinks, frogs, snakes and, {{in the case of the}} <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta,</b> shrews.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{diversity of}} pittas {{are found in}} South-east Asia. Of the three genera, the large genus Pitta is the most widespread. The two species found in Africa are from this clade, as are the most northerly species (the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta)</b> and the most southerly (the noisy pitta). The most remote insular endemics are in this group as well, including the black-faced pitta, which is endemic to the Solomon Islands. The pittas of the clade Erythropitta are mostly found in Asia with one species, the Papuan pitta, reaching the north of Australia. The Hydrornis pittas are exclusively Asian. Some pittas have large distributions, like the hooded pitta, which ranges from Nepal to New Guinea, others have much smaller ones, like the superb pitta, which is endemic to the tiny island of Manus in the Admiralty Islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{movements}} of pittas are poorly known and notoriously difficult to study. Bird ringing studies have not shed much light on this, one {{study in the}} Philippines ringed 2000 red-bellied pittas but only recaptured ten birds, and {{only one of these}} recaptures was more than two months after the initial capture. Only four species of pitta are fully or mostly migratory, all in the genus Pitta, the Indian pitta, African pitta, <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> and blue-winged pitta. In addition to these four the northern subspecies of the hooded pitta (cucullata) is a full migrant. Other species make smaller or more local, and poorly understood, movements across small parts of their range, for example the noisy pitta of Australia. The migration of pittas is apparently nocturnal, and pittas migrate in small loose flocks which use the same resting and foraging sites each year.|$|E
50|$|On a meta-population level, it {{is thought}} that the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta’s</b> {{relatively}} narrow distribution in Northeast Asia and the species’ regionally specific breeding and wintering grounds are lowering the genetic diversity and fragment the genetic structure of populations. Although more research is needed, this is suspected to compromise its fitness.|$|R
50|$|Human {{disturbances}} also {{directly affect}} individual <b>fairy</b> <b>pittas.</b> In Jeju Island, South Korea, window strikes {{are one of}} the leading factors endangering the bird. As more buildings are built in the vicinity of breeding sites, accidental window strikes have consequently increased. Moreover, in Taiwan as well as in Jeju Island, many nests are disturbed by hikers, amateur photographers, birdwatchers, and researchers, which may alter the bird’s behavior and increase nest predation risk.|$|R
2500|$|Both parents {{incubate}} the clutch, {{the period}} between laying and hatching being between 14 and 18 days (14 to 16 being more typical). The chicks usually hatch asynchronously, {{over a number of}} days, but in some species the hatching is synchronous. On hatching the parents of at least two species are reported to consume the eggshells. The behaviour ensures that the calcium used to create the eggs is not lost. It is not known if other species do this, but it is a common behaviour in the bird world. As with the incubation period both parents participate in rearing the chicks. The chicks of pittas are entirely altricial, hatching both naked and blind, and dependent upon their parents for warmth, food and nest sanitation. Young chicks are brooded continuously, with the female brooding during the night and the duties being shared during the day. The males and females make regular feeding trips to the chicks; [...] one study of Gurney's pittas found a pair made 2300 feeding visits to the nest, traveling an estimated [...] over the nestling stage. Earthworms are important food items for many species, and the dominant item in the nestling diet of some. 73% of the parental visits of <b>fairy</b> <b>pittas,</b> 63% in rainbow pittas, up to 79% in Gurney's pittas are with earthworms. Parents can and do carry more than one item in their bills during visits; in a study of breeding <b>fairy</b> <b>pittas</b> as many as six items could be brought in a single visit, although less than four was typical. When the chicks are small prey may be broken up prior to being fed to the chicks, and larger prey items like skins and snakes are only fed to the older chicks able to manage them.|$|R
2500|$|The pittas are {{generally}} birds of tropical forests, semi-forests and scrub. Most species need forests {{with lots of}} cover, a rich understory, and leaf litter for feeding, and they are often found near waterways as well. Some species inhabit swamps and bamboos forests, and the mangrove pitta, as its name suggests, is a mangrove specialist. A number of species are lowland forest specialists, for example the rainbow pitta is not found above , whereas other species may occur at much higher elevations, for example rusty-naped pittas have been found up to [...] This varies in the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> across its range, reaching up to [...] in Taiwan but at much lower levels in Japan. In addition to natural habitats pittas may use human altered habitats, for example migrating blue-winged pittas and hooded pittas use parks and urban gardens in Singapore.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> {{was first}} {{described}} {{as a member of}} the order Passeriformes and the family Pittidae in 1850. It was originally considered to be the same species as the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), native to India and Pakistan. However, due to differences in plumage, morphology, and vocalization, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> was recognized as a separate species in 1996. In contemporary taxonomy, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> forms a superspecies with the Indian pitta, mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha) and blue-winged pitta (P. moluccensis). Among the 30 species of Pittidae worldwide, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> is the most northerly and only species breeding in Northeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|A {{species with}} a similar {{appearance}} is the blue-winged pitta, which {{is larger than the}} <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta.</b> The blue-winged pitta has buff crown sides and supercilia, rather than the chestnut of the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta,</b> brighter upper tail coverts, darker yellowish brown belly, and vivid blue on upper wing coverts.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> {{arrives at}} both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific sides of {{southern}} Japan, including the islands of Kyushu, Honshu, Shikoku, Tsushima, with notable populations in Miyazaki Prefecture, Kōchi Prefecture, Hiroshima Prefecture, and {{as far north as}} Hokkaido, in mid-May. Similar to the groups breeding in Korea, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> in Japan favors places with dense undergrowth of bushes, ferns, scrub, and grass, but with good visibility to be aware of predators or disturbances. The bird here exclusively nests in coastal deciduous evergreen forests. In 1991, 93.5% of the breeding sites were found in broadleaf evergreen or deciduous forest, whereas only 6.5% were in mixed coniferous-broadleaf forest. In recent years, however, a trend of the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> nesting in plantations has been noticed. In Kōchi Prefecture, for instance, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> prefers Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) forest during the early days of its breeding season. The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> in Japan mostly dwells on hill slopes below the altitude of 500 m, but occasional recordings indicate that some pairs live at altitudes as high as 1,200 m.|$|E

50|$|The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> leaving from Borneo {{in spring}} {{arrives in the}} Korean Peninsula in early or mid-May and departs back to south in October. However, migrations occur {{throughout}} the country in spring and winter. The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> breeds on the coasts, islands, or in dense and moist deciduous forests, such as camellia forest, in Hwanghae Province, Gyeonggi Province, South Gyeongsang Province, and South Jeolla Province. Among those habitats, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> mostly prefers islands off {{the southern part of}} Korea. Especially in Geoje in South Gyeongsang Province and Jeju Island, regular visits of the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> to the same locations have been reported. In Jeju Island alone, more than 60 pairs are thought to be breeding regularly in the altitude of 100 m to 600 m in Halla Mountain, making the island the most important breeding ground in South Korea. Subspecies in the Korean Peninsula is distributed to East China, as far as to the Shandong Peninsula, and limited regions in Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> is a {{territorial}} bird, and {{the male}} defends its territory through calls. Its general habit is however secretive. From mid-May to early June, sometimes to late July, it likes to perch on a high tree branch in a posture resembling that of a kingfisher. However, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> tends to repeatedly shake its tail up and down while singing on a branch.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> (Pitta nympha) is a {{small and}} brightly colored {{passerine}} bird that mainly feeds on earthworms, spiders, insects, slugs, and snails. It is also called “little forest angel” in Taiwan and “eight colored bird" [...] in Japan, Taiwan, North Korea and South Korea. The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> breeds in East Asia and migrates south to winter in Southeast Asia. Due to various habitat and anthropogenic disruptions, such as deforestation, wildfire, hunting, trapping, and cage-bird trade, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> is rare and the population is declining in most places. Listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II, this bird is classified as vulnerable on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
50|$|The {{causes of}} habitat disruption, which {{encompasses}} deforestation in the bird’s breeding range, are essentially {{the results of}} human activity, but the characteristics of threats vary from one region to another. In Japan, where the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> was originally more common, significant areas of forest have been cleared since the 19th century for fuel and throughout the 20th century for the building of plantations. Since the logging has ceased and old growth forests have begun to recover, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> population is expected to gradually increase. In contrast, vast forested areas in Southeast China have in the last 50 years been clear-cut or converted due to an increased demand for timber and farmland. There is also a lack of control of forest fires. In Borneo, a <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> wintering ground, the continuing destruction of the Sundaic lowland primeval forest is more devastating. It {{is one of the}} most important Biodiversity hotspots in the world, but the deforestation is ongoing even in the protected areas and jeopardizing not only the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta,</b> but also many other tropical species. Large scale developments also endanger local populations. In Yunlin County, Taiwan, the largest known breeding group of the species is being severely impacted by the flooding from the Hushan Dam project. Despite the imminent threats that the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> is facing in Taiwan, however, quantitative data on the impact of human disturbance on the population remains limited, undermining the conservation efforts.|$|E
50|$|The {{song of the}} <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> {{is clear}} and whistled kwah-he kwa-wu, {{which is similar to}} that of the blue-winged pitta, but longer and slower.|$|E
50|$|As a {{response}} to rapidly declining populations in most areas, {{an increasing number of}} studies has focused on the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> in recent years, and the species is now protected under various national conservation laws. The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> is classified as a Nationally Protected Species in China, Category II protected species in Taiwan, National Endangered Species in Japan, Category I protected species in North Korea, and a Natural Monument in South Korea. Many pairs benefit from breeding in national parks or reserves that were initially designed to protect other species.|$|E

5000|$|Dapu Township (...) is a rural {{township}} in Chiayi County, Taiwan. Part of the Siraya National Scenic Area, Dapu gets a {{major portion}} of its revenue from tourism. Among the birds that {{can be seen in the}} area is the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta.</b>|$|E
50|$|In China, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> {{seems to}} be widely {{distributed}} in the mountains in the southeast, in mixed forests at altitudes between 500 m and 1,500 m. The same preference extends to Hong Kong, where the bird stops along its course of migrations.|$|E
50|$|The predators most {{affecting}} the reproductive {{success of the}} <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> are snakes, followed by mammals such as macaques, cats and weasels. The raiding of nests by jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) and cat snakes during breeding season has also been reported frequenelty. During migrations, the bird is exposed to danger from falcons. The rate at which adult fairy pittas return from the wintering grounds appears to be 16-26%; most casualties happening on the bird’s northward migrating and during breeding seasons from May to July. Fewer birds are lost during the autumn migration in October. Another cause of mortality is window strikes. As for many other species of bird, casualties from human-bird interaction are identified as {{a leading cause of}} decline in the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pittas {{are among}} the few Old World suboscine birds. The Indian pitta is the basal member of a {{distinct}} clade that includes many of the Oriental species. It forms a superspecies with the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> (P. nympha), mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha) and blue-winged pitta (P. moluccensis).|$|E
5000|$|It qualifies the {{criterion}} 2, {{because it provides}} habitat for endangered species of fern, as is explained in paragraph 2 of this article. # In addition, Gotjawal forest is also a regular breeding site for endangered bird species, including the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta,</b> Pitta brachyura nympha, and Japanese paradise flycatcher, Terpsiphone atrocaudata.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> is a {{migratory birds}} and travels from Northeast Asia, where it breeds in summer (April-September) to South and Southeast Asia {{to spend the}} winter (October-March). Sightings have been {{reported}} from India and Indochina, including both the Bruneian and Kalimantan sides of the island of Borneo, and New Guinea, {{as well as in}} China, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan. Recorded stopovers are in North Korea, Vietnam, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Thailand. Following the same migratory routes in both spring and autumn every year, the majority of passages occur in April and September to October. Even though the bird is fairly widespread throughout the eastern part of Asia, {{the fact that it is}} highly localized in subtropical forests suggests that the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> is faithful to wintering sites and requires specific habitat conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{threat of}} hunting has been {{prevalent}} in Guangxi, China and Taiwan. Particularly in Taiwan, specimen-collecting and cage-bird trading {{are thought to}} have severely reduced the local breeding population in the 20th century. However, as more conservation efforts are made and the significance of the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> is recognized locally, hunting is expected to diminish.|$|E
50|$|The bird has a {{chestnut}} crown. From its {{forehead to}} the back of its head is mantled with brown plumage, whereas its median is striped with black from lores (between the eye and the beak) to nape. The off-white supercilia (eyebrows) extend across the nape. The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> has a white throat and a black beak.|$|E
50|$|The German naturalist Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller first {{described}} the blue-winged pitta in 1776. It forms a superspecies with the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> (P. nympha) and mangrove pitta (P. megarhyncha). Alternate common names include: lesser blue-winged pitta, the little blue-winged pitta, the Moluccan pitta, the brève à ailes bleues (French), the Kleine Blauflügelpitta (German) and the pita aliazul (Spanish).|$|E
50|$|The female lays from 4 to 6 eggs per bredding attempt, from May to mid-July. The egg has a light gray {{background}} {{with small}} light brownish purple and grey dots, and is 25-27.5 mm {{in the major}} axis and 19-22.5 mm in the minor axis. Both male and female incubate the eggs; the female usually feeds the hatchlings, while the male keeps watch. In the first 4 days after hatching, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> rarely leaves the nest. This is probably because temperatures are low {{during the rainy season}} and the nestling hatches without any down feathers. The nestling has its first plumage within 14 days after hatching. Throughout the breeding season, the adult bird rarely goes farther than 100-400 m from the nest. In June or July, the chick fledges, but the rearing continues until the nestling is ready to migrate south. The average reproductive success of the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> is 41.9%.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> has a {{body length}} of 16-19.5 cm and is easily discernable for its plumage of seven {{different}} colors {{reminiscent of a}} rainbow. Its back and wing bows are green, scapulars (shoulders) and upper tail coverts are green and cobalt. There is a blue rump on upper tail coverts. The tail is dark green with a cobalt tip, and the tarsi (legs) are yellowish brown.|$|E
50|$|The National Park {{is known}} to have 1142 species of plants {{including}} Red Pine, Black Pine, Common Camellia, Serrata Oak, Cork Oak as well as rare species such as Nadopungnan (Sedirea Japonica), Daeheongnan (Cymbidium Nipponicum) and the Korean winter hazel. It boasts 25 mammal species, 115 bird species, 16 reptile species, 1,566 insect species, and 24 freshwater fish species, including the vulnerable bird species Pitta nympha, also known as the <b>Fairy</b> <b>Pitta.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> has {{different}} colors of wing coverts as well. Its primary coverts are dark blue, secondary coverts are greenish blue, greater and middle coverts are dark green, and lesser coverts are cobalt or bright blue. The bird’s white patch {{on each of}} their brownish-black primaries are noticeable when it flies. Its lower body, including nape (side back), chest, and side, is cream-colored, except for the lower belly and undertail coverts, which are red.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> makes a {{relatively}} large nest in the dark place, {{such as in the}} crevice between rocks in thick broadleaf forest or foliage on a slope, 1-5 m above the ground. The entrance is lined with cattle dung and the nest itself is lined with lichen. If necessary, the male aggressively defends the nest, chases after and attacking intruders. Such defensive behavior is only displayed until the eggs are laid.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mangrove}} pitta {{was first}} described by German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel in 1863. Its species name {{is derived from}} the Ancient Greek words mega- [...] "large", and rhynchos [...] "beak". It forms a superspecies with the Indian pitta (P. brachyura), <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> (P. nympha) and blue-winged pitta (P. moluccensis). Alternate common names include: Larger blue-winged/Malay pitta, Brève des palétuviers (in French), Große Blauflügelpitta (in German), and Pita de Manglar (in Spanish). There are no recognized subspecies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> mostly {{feeds on}} the ground, {{wandering}} solitarily. Its diet largely consists of earthworms of several species, beetles, and other hard-shelled insects. A {{variety of other}} small animals such as lepidoptera larvae and adults, spiders, snails, lizards, frogs, small snakes, and shrews, occasionally form part of its diet. Earthworms make up 73%-82% of the diet fed to the nestlings, followed by homoptera larvae (4%-8.6%). Although not entirely identifiable, lepidopteran adults and pupae likely make up 11% of the nestling diet. The fairy pitta's preference for earthworms with their high energy content makes the abundance of this food item critical for nesting success.|$|E
50|$|The {{mangrove}} pitta (Pitta megarhyncha) is {{a species}} of passerine bird in the Pittidae family native to the eastern Indian Subcontinent and western Southeast Asia. It {{is part of a}} superspecies where it is placed with the Indian pitta, the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> and the blue-winged pitta but has no recognized subspecies. A colourful bird, it has a black head with brown crown, white throat, greenish upper parts, buff underparts and reddish vent area. Its range extends from India to Malaysia and Indonesia. It is found in mangrove and nipa palm forests where it feeds on crustaceans, mollusks and insects. Its call, sometimes rendered as wieuw-wieuw, is sung from a high perch on a mangrove tree.|$|E

This varies in the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta</b> across its range, reaching up to 1300 m in Taiwan but at much lower levels in Japan. In addition to natural habitats pittas may use human altered habitats, for example migrating blue-winged pittas and hooded pittas use parks and urban gardens in Singapore.The greatest diversity of pittas are found in South-east Asia. Of the three genera, the large genus Pitta is the most widespread. The two species found in Africa are from this clade, as are the most northerly species (the <b>fairy</b> <b>pitta)</b> and the most southerly (the noisy pitta).
