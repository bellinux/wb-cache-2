25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill <b>informed</b> <b>me</b> {{that he had not}} read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in front of me.|$|E

I did appoint proper persons to do that business; who were sworn by me to do their duty faithfully by the request of Col. Sterling.

He told Al Arabiya that [...] "I returned from Davos to Egypt because of the current situation in Egypt. The new Prime Minister had contacted me for the same position in the new cabinet, I refused because I want fresh blood." [...] Regarding the travel ban, he commented, [...] "I had no idea about the accusations, I served for six and half years and I am completely ready to face any accusation. No one had <b>informed</b> <b>me</b> of this decision and I heard it from the news." [...] He was considered a possible candidate for Prime Minister before the protests.|$|E
500|$|While all of {{the direct}} {{evidence}} given by eyewitnesses supports {{the findings of the}} Court of Inquiry, some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham, Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help, and suggest that they might have simply deserted when the battle got rough. Proponents of this desertion theory frequently portray Burnham as a man who embellished facts and coerced eyewitnesses into falsifying statements. The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan, a cousin of Southern Rhodesia's first Prime Minister, Charles Coghlan. John Coghlan wrote to a friend, John Carruthers, on 14 December that year that [...] "a very reliable man <b>informed</b> <b>me</b> that Wools-Sampson told him" [...] that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed (in 1899) that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord. This double hearsay confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which instead recounts the events as generally recorded.|$|E
500|$|Discussing his beliefs, in 2009 Ebert {{wrote that}} he did not [...] "want to provide a {{category}} for people to apply to [...] " [...] because he [...] "would not want [...] convictions reduced to a word", and stated, [...] "I have never said, although readers have freely <b>informed</b> <b>me</b> I am an atheist, an agnostic, {{or at the very least}} a secular humanist– which I am". In the same blog entry, he also said [...] "I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking how? I am more content with the question than I would be with an answer." [...] In March 2013, he wrote: [...] "I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born." [...] He also stated: [...] "I consider myself Catholic, lock, stock and barrel, with this technical loophole: I cannot believe in God. I refuse to call myself an atheist however, because that indicates too great a certainty about the unknowable." ...|$|E

500|$|On January 5, 1996, a new {{development}} thrust the travel office matter again to the forefront. A two-year-old memo from White House director of administration David Watkins surfaced that identified First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as the motivating force behind the firings, with the additional involvement of Vince Foster and Harry Thomason. [...] "Foster regularly <b>informed</b> <b>me</b> that the First Lady was concerned and desired action. The action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff." [...] Written in fall 1993, apparently intended for McLarty, the Watkins memo also said [...] "we both know {{that there would be}} hell to pay" [...] if [...] "we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes." [...] This memo contradicted the First Lady's previous statements in the GAO investigation, that she had played no role in the firings and had not consulted with Thomason beforehand; the White House also found it difficult to explain why the memo was so late in surfacing when all the previous investigations had requested all relevant materials. [...] House committee chair Clinger charged a cover-up was taking place and vowed to pursue new material.|$|E
500|$|... "You Rock My World" [...] was {{recorded}} by Michael Jackson for his studio album, Invincible (2001). The song was written and composed by Michael Jackson and produced by Jackson and Jerkins. [...] "You Rock My World" [...] was officially released {{as the lead}} single from the album in mid-August 2001, by Epic Records. Prior to the singles official release it had been leaked to two New York radio stations on Friday, August 17. Immediately after the songs radio airplay the radio stations had received [...] "a herd of [...] callers asking for more." [...] "You Rock My World" [...] was first played on the WJTM-FM station at 6 p.m., with WKTU-FM airing the song 45 minutes later. Both stations had played the single every two hours until around 6 p.m. Saturday, when Jackson's record label, Epic Records, called the program director for both stations, Frankie Blue, {{who was also a}} friend of Jackson, and asked him to stop. Blue later recalled, [...] "They <b>informed</b> <b>me</b> of the dangers of playing a song too early." [...] He refused to say how the song came into his possession.|$|E
500|$|Colonial-era {{histories}} {{called this}} the Shangani Patrol, and hailed Wilson and Borrow as national heroes. Their last stand together {{became a kind}} of national myth, as Lewis Gann writes, [...] "a glorious memory, [...] own equivalent of the bloody Alamo massacre and Custer's Last Stand in the American West". The version of events recorded by history is based on the accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes' column. While all of the direct evidence given by eyewitnesses supports the findings of the Court of Inquiry, some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham, Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help, and suggest that they might have simply deserted when the battle got rough. The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is long after the event in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan to a friend, John Carruthers, that [...] "a very reliable man <b>informed</b> <b>me</b> that Wools-Sampson told him" [...] that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson, and had simply left on their own accord. This double hearsay confession, coming from an anonymous source, is not mentioned in Gooding's 1899 obituary, which instead recounts the events as generally recorded. Several well-known writers have used the Coghlan letter, as shaky as it is, as clearance to create hypothetical evidence in an attempt to challenge and revise the historical record.|$|E

500|$|Soaps In Depth {{reported}} that Engen quickly gained viewer support after joining the cast as Adam, {{as did the}} character's romance with Heather. The support continued when the character took a dark turn. Engen said, [...] "To {{think there was any}} likability left in the character baffles me! I'm very grateful to the fans...they've been so supportive." [...] The actor said fans wanted Adam either redeemed or turned into a gray character. Davidson credited the character's likability to Engen's looks, saying, [...] "...he really nailed this character. Chris' all-American looks add another layer to this story: he looks like he regrets being so evil, but he can't help himself. When Chris <b>informed</b> <b>me</b> he was leaving, I told him he really accomplished something by being so likable playing this villain." [...] Nelson Branco repeatedly praised Engen's acting and Adam's storyline with Ashley and Victor, saying, [...] "he Haunting of Ashley is fast becoming one of my favorite all-time soap storylines ever. It's so 1970s. I have no doubt former Another World master scribe and Paul Rauch BFF/frenemy, Harding Lemay, is freaking if he's watching this gothic, macabre and super-creepy mystery. Moreover, camp-ilicious Chris Engen (Adam) is stealing the story with his very bitchy, and sexy performance of a deranged son scorned." [...] Soaps In Depth also commended Adam's storyline. The magazine awarded Engen a gold star for portraying Adam as a gray character with [...] "sardonic humor". Soap Opera Digest named Engen [...] "performer of the week" [...] for his final scenes as Adam, saying the actor [...] "gave a performance that elevated Adam from an average villain to a complex mastermind".|$|E
