5|$|Heath {{died of a}} <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> in Seattle at age 60. He had {{suffered}} a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> in 1957 {{at the age of}} 43. He was survived by two daughters and one son.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke in the past. One study found that among those who have never had a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke.|$|E

50|$|While {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that NRT can increase the risk of <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or recent <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> should consult a physician before initiating NRT.|$|R
50|$|However, late in {{his life}} his health {{declined}} substantially: he was diabetic, and had an incurable heart disease, causing him to suffer three <b>heart</b> <b>attacks.</b> The last of these <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> led to congestive heart failure.|$|R
50|$|There is {{interest}} amongst researchers as {{to whether}} CNCCs {{can be used to}} repair human <b>heart</b> tissue. <b>Heart</b> <b>attacks</b> in humans are common and their rate of mortality is high. There are emergency treatments that hospitals can administer, such as angioplasty or surgery, but after that patients will likely be on medication for the long term and are more susceptible to <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> in the future. Other complications of <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> include cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.|$|R
5|$|Everton legends William Ralph 'Dixie' Dean {{and former}} manager Harry Catterick both died at Goodison Park. Dean {{suffered}} from a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> aged 73 in 1980, whilst Catterick died five years later, also suffering a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> aged 65.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} have already had a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke, taking aspirin daily for two years {{prevented}} 1 in 50 from having a cardiovascular problem (<b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> stroke, or death), but also caused non-fatal bleeding problems to occur in 1 of 400 people.|$|E
5|$|Graves {{died of a}} <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> on July 19, 1965 while {{skiing in}} Del Norte, Colorado, twenty years after the Slotin accident, {{at the age of}} 55. He had {{suffered}} from hypertension even before the 1946 accident, and had a minor <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> in December 1955. His father had also died of a <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> A 1978 follow-up study of the Slotin accident victims suggested that latent systemic damage from the accident contributed to heart failure. He was interred in the Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|E
40|$|The role of plasma {{fibrinogen}} as {{a potential}} indicator of susceptibility to <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> was studied {{in a sample of}} 297 men aged 40 - 69 years at entry who were initially free from overt coronary heart disease. During a mean observation period of 7. 3 years (range 0. 1 - 16. 1) new <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> occurred in 40 men. There was a significant positive correlation between initial plasma fibrinogen levels and the subsequent incidence of <b>heart</b> <b>attacks.</b> In men with high cholesterol or high systolic blood pressure levels the incidence of <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> was respectively six times and 12 times greater in those with high plasma fibrinogen levels than in those with low fibrinogen levels. In multivariate models plasma fibrinogen was a highly significant and independent explanatory variable, at least as important as serum cholesterol, blood pressure or cigarette smoking. These results suggest that high plasma fibrinogen levels are an important coronary risk factor and should be included in profiles used to identify those at high risk of <b>heart</b> <b>attacks...</b>|$|R
