Efforts were made to stock 8 <b>Field</b> <b>Supply</b> Depot with seven days' supply of fuel and stores, and 500 rounds per gun of ammunition. The effort to do so {{proceeded}} satisfactorily despite Italian air raids and blinding sand storms. Last-minute {{efforts were made to}} rectify the 6th Division's remaining equipment shortages. Over the last few days before the battle, some 95 additional vehicles were obtained, of which 80 were assigned to hauling ammunition. A consignment of 11,500 sleeveless leather jerkins for protection against the cold and barbed wire were distributed, as were 350 sets of captured Italian wire cutters. The 17th Infantry Brigade finally received its 3-inch mortars but found them lacking their sights. An officer dashed back to Cairo to obtain these in time. Some 300 pairs of gloves and [...] of marking tape arrived with only hours to go. The gloves were distributed, but the tape did not reach the 16th Infantry Brigade in time, so rifle cleaning flannelette was torn into strips and used instead.|$|E

A Method of Attack on an entrenched Camp in the Desert was distributed to units ready for Training Exercise No 2. The 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Indian Division were reinforced with the British 16th Infantry Brigade, the 7th RTR and the Matruh Garrison Force of a Coldstream Guards battalion and a battery of field artillery; the 7th Indian Brigade was {{to act as a}} reserve and protect the lines of communication. Guarded by the Support Group, the rest of 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Indian Division were to drive between Nibeiwa and the Sofafi camps and then attack Nibeiwa from the west with the 11th Indian Infantry Brigade (Colonel Reginald Savory) and 47 Matilda II tanks of the 7th RTR. The cruiser tanks of the 7th Armoured Division were to prevent a counter-attack from Sofafi and cover the left flank of the 4th Indian Division once Nibewa had been captured the attackers would move on to the Tummars. Each division was to have a <b>field</b> <b>supply</b> depot about [...] west of Matruh, which were elaborately camouflaged and filled sufficient for five days' operations and two day's supply of water.|$|E
