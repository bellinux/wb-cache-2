40|$|A time-efficient {{solution}} {{to estimate the}} error of satellite surface soil moisture from the land parameter retrieval model is presented. The errors are estimated using an analytical solution for soil moisture retrievals from this radiative-transfer-based model that derives soil moisture from low-frequency passive microwave observations.

25|$|The Predator air {{vehicle and}} sensors are {{controlled}} {{from the ground}} station via a C-band line-of-sight data link or a <b>Ku-band</b> satellite data link for beyond-line-of-sight operations. During flight operations the crew in the ground control station is a pilot and two sensor operators. The aircraft is equipped with the AN/AAS-52 Multi-spectral Targeting System, a color nose camera (generally used by the pilot for flight control), a variable aperture day-TV camera, and a variable aperture thermographic camera (for low light/night). Previously, Predators were equipped with a synthetic aperture radar for looking through smoke, clouds or haze, but lack of use validated its removal to reduce weight and conserve fuel. The cameras produce full motion video and the synthetic aperture radar produced still frame radar images. There is sufficient bandwidth on the datalink for two video sources to be used at one time, but only one video source from the sensor ball can be used at any time due to design limitations. Either the daylight variable aperture or the infrared electro-optical sensor may be operated simultaneously with the synthetic aperture radar, if equipped.|$|E

Astronauts Naoko Yamazaki and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger began activating and checking out the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) also known as the Canadarm. While Metcalf-Lindenburger and Yamazaki were working with Canadarm, Stephanie Wilson was getting equipment together and set up to record the inspections of the shuttle's heat shield. The inspections were recorded so they could be downlinked to the ground once docked to the ISS. Once all that work was done, commander Poindexter and pilot Dutton joined Metcalf-Lindenburger, Yamazaki, and Wilson to conduct the inspection of the shuttle's heat shield. While the inspection was going on, Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson were on the mid-deck of Discovery checking out the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) and getting them ready for their three spacewalks.

40|$|Backscattering {{measurements}} were acquired with airborne scatterometers over {{a site in}} Cass County, North Dakota on four days in the 1981 crop growing season. Data were acquired at three frequencies (L-, C- and <b>Ku-bands),</b> two polarizations (like and cross) and ten incidence angles (5 degrees to 50 degrees in 5 degree steps). Crop separability is studied in an hierarchical fashion. A two-class separability measure is defined, which compares within-class to between-class variability, to determine crop separability. The scatterometer channels with the best potential for crop separability are determined, based on this separability measure. Higher frequencies are more useful for discriminating small grains, while lower frequencies tend to separate non-small grains better. Some crops are more separable when row direction is taken into account. The effect of pixel purity {{is to increase the}} separability between all crops while not changing the order of useful scatterometer channels.

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is an {{emerging}} {{remote sensing technique}} that uses navigation signals reflected on the Earth’s surface as sources of opportunity for scatterometry and altimetry. The time-domain statistics of the electromagnetic bias in GNSS-R altimetry are investigated to assess the residual electromagnetic bias after averaging during the dwell time (as long as 100 s). A three-dimensional time-evolving sea surface is generated using Elfouhaily’s ocean surface height spectrum and spreading function. This surface is illuminated by a right hand circular polarization electromagnetic wave at L-band. Then, the scattered waves are computed using the Physical Optics method under the Kirchhoff Approximation. The electromagnetic bias is estimated using a numerical technique previously validated at C- and <b>Ku-bands,</b> and then extrapolated at L-band. Montecarlo simulations for different sea surface realizations consecutive in time are performed so as to analyze the electromagnetic bias statistics up to the 4 PthP order moments. Histograms and distribution of the time domain electromagnetic bias are also used for statistical interpretation. All statistical descriptors confirmed that the electromagnetic bias has a non-Gaussian behavior.

40|$|Microwave {{backscatter}} from vegetated surfaces {{is influenced}} by vegetation structure and vegetation water content (VWC), which varies with meteorological conditions and moisture in the root zone. Radar backscatter observations are used for many vegetation and soil moisture monitoring applications {{under the assumption that}} VWC is constant on short timescales. This research aims to understand how backscatter over agricultural canopies changes in response to diurnal differences in VWC due to water stress. A standard water-cloud model and a two-layer water-cloud model for maize were used to simulate the influence of the observed variations in bulk/leaf/stalk VWC and soil moisture on the various contributions to total backscatter at a range of frequencies, polarizations, and incidence angles. The bulk VWC and leaf VWC were found to change up to 30 % and 40 %, respectively, on a diurnal basis during water stress and may {{have a significant effect on}} radar backscatter. Total backscatter time series are presented to illustrate the simulated diurnal difference in backscatter for different radar frequencies, polarizations, and incidence angles. Results show that backscatter is very sensitive to variations in VWC during water stress, particularly at large incidence angles and higher frequencies. The diurnal variation in total backscatter was dominated by variations in leaf water content, with simulated diurnal differences of up to 4 dB in X- through <b>Ku-bands</b> (8. 6 – 35 GHz).
