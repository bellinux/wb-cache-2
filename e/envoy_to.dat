5|$|Warelwast was {{probably}} sent as an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> Urban in 1096 to bribe the pope into recalling the papal legate Jarento, {{who had been}} sent to England to protest the king's conduct towards the church.

5|$|As a cardinal, Paul had {{previously}} maintained neutrality between {{the great powers}} of Spain and France that had dominated the previous conclave and {{were present in the}} current one as well. While he had been the papal <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> Spain and was receiving a pension from them, he was largely low profile as a cardinal and perceived as neutral. At 52, Paul was young {{at the time of his}} election, and was anticipated to have a lengthy papacy, not requiring a third conclave soon.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} at Gythium, Pythagoras had joined Nabis at Sparta, {{bringing}} with him 3,000 men from Argos. When Nabis discovered that Gythium had surrendered {{he decided to}} send an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> Flamininus to open negotiations on {{the terms of a}} peace. Nabis offered to withdraw the rest of his garrison from Argos and to hand over to the Romans any deserters and prisoners. Flamininus called another war council. Most of the council felt that they should capture Sparta and unseat Nabis.|$|E

5|$|Flamininus first sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> Sparta, {{demanding}} that Nabis either surrender Argos to the Achaean League or face war with Rome and her Greek allies. Nabis refused {{to comply with}} Flamininus' ultimatum, so 40,000 Roman soldiers and their Greek allies advanced towards the Peloponnese. Entering the Peloponnese, Flamininus joined his force {{with that of the}} Achaean commander, Aristaenos, who had 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Cleonae. Together, they advanced towards Argos.|$|E
5|$|Having settled {{these matters}} he {{traveled}} to Cyrrhus, a city in Syria between Antioch and the Euphrates, where he {{spent the rest of}} AD 18 in the winter quarters of the Legion X Fretensis. Evidently here Piso attended Germanicus, and quarreled because he failed to send troops to Armenia when ordered. Artabanus sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> Germanicus requesting that Vonones be moved further from Armenia as to not incite trouble there. Germanicus complied, moving Vonones to Cilicia, both to please Artabanus and to insult Piso who Vonones was friendly with.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, now already {{sixty years}} old, {{he got the}} chance to put his preachings on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch {{government}} appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Romania, a country in the throes of political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm Philips.|$|E

In January 1880 – 1881, Kogălniceanu oversaw the first diplomatic contacts between Romania and Qing China, as an exchange of correspondence between the Romanian Embassy to France and Zeng Jize, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, died in May 1705. His successor, Joseph I, took to {{government}} with {{a burst of}} ebullience. Following the Battle of Turin, a decisive Imperial victory, the Emperor sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> Florence to collect feudal dues, amounting to 300,000 doubloons, an exorbitant sum; and to force Cosimo to recognise the Archduke Charles as King of Spain. Fearing a Franco-Dutch invasion, Cosimo III refused to recognise Charles's title, but he did pay {{a fraction of the}} dues.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September Paskevich sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> Warsaw {{requesting}} surrender {{and promising}} {{revision of the}} constitution. Only three out of ten members of the Diplomatic Commission voted in favour of further negotiations, and on 5 September the Russian commander was informed that the only acceptable solution had already been made known in the declaration of the Sejm. The Poles requested that all lands taken by Russia in the partitions of Poland be restored, and that the deposition of Nicholas I as the king of Poland (of 25 January 1831) still be valid.|$|E

The primary Welsh Government Office is based out of the Washington British Embassy, with satellites in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Atlanta.

5|$|A {{group of}} {{powerful}} lords—including the Šubići, Kőszegis and Csáks—urged CharlesII of Naples {{to send his}} grandson, the 12-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary {{in order to become}} king. The young Charles Robert disembarked in Split in August 1300. Most Croatian and Slavonian lords and all Dalmatian towns but Trogir recognized him as king before he marched to Zagreb. The Kőszegis and Matthew Csák, however, were shortly reconciled with Andrew, preventing Charles' success. Andrew's <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> the Holy See noted that Pope Boniface VIII did not support Charles Robert's adventure, either. Andrew, who had been in poor health for a while, was planning to capture his opponent, but he died in Buda Castle on 14 January 1301. According to historians Attila Zsoldos and Gyula Kristó, the contemporaneous gossip suggesting that Andrew was poisoned cannot be proved.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the need}} to defend against these incursions, the Byzantines could not afford to use all their forces against the Persians. Heraclius sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> the Avar Khagan, saying that the Byzantines would pay a tribute in return for the Avars to {{withdraw}} north of the Danube. The Khagan replied by asking for a meeting on 5 June 623, at Heraclea in Thrace, where the Avar army was located; Heraclius agreed to this meeting, coming with his royal court. The Khagan, however, put horsemen en route to Heraclea to ambush and capture Heraclius, so they could hold him for ransom.|$|E
5|$|By 1071, Robert, {{together}} with his brother Roger, {{had taken over the}} last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, Bari. By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily, ending the Islamic Emirate of Sicily. In 1073, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> Robert offering the hand of his son Constantine to Robert's daughter Helena. Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne. This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Dato Mogol died in 1620 and was {{succeeded by}} his eldest son, Sulaiman. A period of turmoil erupted {{ten years later}} when the Queen of Pattani branded the new ruler of Siam, King Prasat Thong, a usurper and tyrant. The queen {{withheld}} tribute and ordered attacks on Ligor (present-day Nakhon Si Thammarat) and Bordelongh (present-day Phatthalung); Ayuthaya responded by blockading Pattani with an army of 60,000 men, as well as enlisting {{the help of the}} Dutch people in capturing the City. Singora became involved in the dispute and in 1633 sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> Ayuthaya requesting help. The outcome of this request is not known, but Dutch records show that Singora was severely damaged and the pepper crop destroyed.|$|E
