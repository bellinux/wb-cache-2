5|$|Kishimoto {{has noted}} that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's {{intelligent}} but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru {{if he were a}} girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, he <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair.|$|E
5|$|The Earps {{hired an}} {{experienced}} trial lawyer, Thomas Fitch, as defense counsel.

He detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they intended to disarm the cowboys. He said they fired in self defense. Fitch managed to produce testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross-examination that was contradictory, or appeared to dodge his questions, or in which they {{said they could not}} remember.|$|E
5|$|The French army {{formed on}} the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under d'Erlon with 16,000 {{infantry}} and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under Reille with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn La Belle Alliance were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the Imperial Guard, and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.|$|E

5|$|WilliamI {{inherited}} the Anglo-Saxon {{system in which}} the king <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> revenues from: a mixture of customs; profits from re-minting coinage; fines; profits from his own demesne lands; and the system of English land-based taxation called the geld. William reaffirmed this system, enforcing collection of the geld through his new system of sheriffs and increasing the taxes on trade. William was also famous for commissioning the Domesday Book in 1086, a vast document which attempted to record the economic condition of his new kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers such as David Morrison {{argue that}} the galactic equator is an entirely {{arbitrary}} line and can never be precisely drawn, because {{it is impossible to}} determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger {{was allowed to}} sit in the jump seat in the cockpit. The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued {{to sit in the}} cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E

5|$|General George S. Patton {{himself had}} a gunfight {{when he was}} a young second {{lieutenant}} chasing Pancho Villa all over northern Mexico in 1916. Patton and 10 enlisted men had been sent to San Miguelito Ranch to look for Villa, who had recently raided the city of Columbus, New Mexico. Patton positioned his men by the south gate and was making his way up to the north gate when a trio of Villa's men came into the ranch on horseback. Patton <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> obsolete single-action Colt Peacemaker revolver and shot two of the men. The first man had been fatally wounded in the exchange and tried to draw his pistol before Patton killed him with a single shot. After his troops took down the remaining outlaw, Patton tied the three dead men to the hood of his touring car and drove the bodies back to his commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 1987, {{entrepreneur}} Jerry Richardson {{announced his}} bid for an NFL expansion franchise in the Carolinas. A North Carolina native, Richardson was a former wide receiver on the Baltimore Colts who had used his 1959 league championship bonus to co-found the Hardee's restaurant chain, later becoming president and CEO of TW Services. Richardson <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> inspiration to pursue an NFL franchise from George Shinn, who had made a successful bid for an expansion National Basketball Association (NBA) team in Charlotte, the Charlotte Hornets. Richardson founded Richardson Sports, a partnership consisting of himself, his family, {{and a number of}} businessmen from North and South Carolina were also recruited to be limited partners. Richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium, ultimately choosing uptown Charlotte. In choosing the team name, the Richardsons did not run focus groups with potential fans. Their intention had always been the 'Panthers'; Jerry Richardson began driving a car with the license plate 'PNTHRS' near the end of 1989.|$|E
5|$|The general {{success of}} William L. Mayo and his college even {{inflamed}} {{the passions of}} their competitors, most especially T. Henry Bridges, the head of Henry College in nearby Campbell. According to William E. Sawyer, {{in the aftermath of}} Reconstruction the Southern-educated Bridges viewed the Northern-educated Mayo as a carpetbagger. After a battle of words between the two college presidents in local newspaper columns, on August 24, 1896, Bridges drove into Commerce in his buggy to confront Mayo, first asking him to sign a statement retracting his written claims. When Mayo refused, Bridges <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> revolver on Mayo, and after he missed his target twice, Bridges proceeded to strike Mayo with 15 to 20 lashes of his whip. The disturbance attracted an angry mob of ETNC students, who drove Bridges out of town. Bridges' Henry College would ultimately become defunct in 1901.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} season at Oxford, Tarr played for the 'A' team, which also {{included}} another future England player Anthony Henniker-Gotley. He was later selected for the senior team and gained three Blues from 1907 to 1909. He won his first Blue in the 1907 Varsity Match on 10 December, alongside Henry Vassall. Cambridge, with some notable international players on the team, were the clear favourites on the day. After they won the toss and elected to kick off with the wind behind them, {{the majority of the}} first 40 minutes was played in Oxford's half, much of it in their 25. Yet Cambridge failed to break through Oxford's defence, chiefly that of the centres Vassall and Tarr. Just before half time, with a scrum deep in Oxford's half, Rupert Williamson fed George Cunningham. The ball came to Tarr, who <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> opposite man, K. G. Macleod, and timed his pass to Vassall so that he, in turn, drew the Cambridge left wing near the half-way line and put H. Martin to run in a try from there. Oxford went on to win 16–0.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{significant}} events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of Intaphernes, {{one of the seven}} noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with his wife. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{arrived at}} the hill without incident and began {{to prepare for the}} attack; however, just prior {{to the beginning of the}} attack there were several loud explosions from the rear of the hill. The antitank grenades carried by the sappers had accidentally detonated, killing all but two of them. The battalion lost the element of surprise, and Hill immediately ordered the two companies to advance up the hill. The force reached the top and engaged a mixed force of German and Italian soldiers, who were assisted by three light tanks. Hill <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> revolver, and with his adjutant and a small group of paratroopers advanced on the tanks, firing shots through their observation ports in an attempt to persuade the crews to surrender. This tactic worked on two tanks, but upon reaching the third tank Hill and his men were fired upon by the tank's crew; Hill was shot three times in the chest and his adjutant wounded, although the tank crew were swiftly dispatched with smallarms fire. Hill survived because of prompt medical treatment, and was replaced as commander of the battalion by Major Pearson, who supervised the routing of the rest of the German and Italian soldiers.|$|E

Two days later the battalion moved from Beja to an area south of Mateur, where it linked up with Allied ground forces and came under the command of an armoured regimental group known as 'Blade Force'; the battalion remained in the area in conjunction with 'Blade Force' until it was withdrawn on 11 December.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E
5|$|For {{the period}} prior to Augustine's arrival in 597, Bede drew on earlier writers, {{including}} Solinus. He {{had access to}} two works of Eusebius: the Historia Ecclesiastica, and also the Chronicon, though he had neither in the original Greek; instead he had a Latin translation of the Historia, by Rufinus, and Saint Jerome's translation of the Chronicon. He also knew Orosius's Adversus Paganus, and Gregory of Tours' Historia Francorum, both Christian histories, {{as well as the}} work of Eutropius, a pagan historian. He used Constantius's Life of Germanus as a source for Germanus's visits to Britain. Bede's account of the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons is drawn largely from Gildas's De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae. Bede would also have been familiar with more recent accounts such as Eddius Stephanus's Life of Wilfrid, and anonymous Lives of Gregory the Great and Cuthbert. He also drew on Josephus's Antiquities, and the works of Cassiodorus, and there was a copy of the Liber Pontificalis in Bede's monastery. Bede quotes from several classical authors, including Cicero, Plautus, and Terence, but he may have had access to their work via a Latin grammar rather than directly. However, it is clear he was familiar with the works of Virgil and with Pliny the Elder's Natural History, and his monastery also owned copies of the works of Dionysius Exiguus. He probably <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> account of St. Alban from a life of that saint which has not survived. He acknowledges two other lives of saints directly; one is a life of Fursa, and the other of St. Æthelburh; the latter no longer survives. He also had access to a life of Ceolfrith. Some of Bede's material came from oral traditions, including a description of the physical appearance of Paulinus of York, who had died nearly 90 years before Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica was written.|$|E
