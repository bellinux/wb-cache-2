5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} {{and sent to}} the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the <b>diagnoses</b> <b>of</b> the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E

25|$|The various biographies on Johnson have {{provided}} evidence for several posthumous <b>diagnoses</b> <b>of</b> Johnson. Before {{the writings of}} Lawrence C.

25|$|Substance use {{disorders}} can {{be confused}} with other psychiatric disorders.

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} {{sensitivity}} and specificity <b>of</b> Ic-VEP in <b>diagnose</b> <b>of</b> early and middle stage glaucoma. METHODS: All the participants included glaucoma patients and normal people came from Beijing Aier-Intech Eye Hospital from October 2014 to October 2016. All the participants performed slit lamp examination, fundus examination, Goldmann applanation tonometer, Humphery visual field examination, retinal nerve fiber layer(RNFL) thickness and macular ganglion cell complex(GCC) thickness examination and Ic-VEP. The {{sensitivity and specificity}} <b>of</b> Ic-VEP in <b>diagnose</b> <b>of</b> glaucoma were main results. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity <b>of</b> Ic-VEP in <b>diagnose</b> <b>of</b> glaucoma is 82 % and 92 % respectively. The area under ROC curve was 0. 872.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for the <b>diagnosing</b> <b>of</b> leaks from liquid {{transmission}} pipelines is proposed in this paper. The solution consists in the acquiring {{of the new}} diagnostic information (i. e. the new diagnostic signals).

During experimental tests it has been determined that thanks to the use of these new diagnostic signals improving the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>diagnosing</b> <b>of</b> leaks is possible...|$|R
25|$|However, {{because of}} Duchardt's {{aforementioned}} pseudocyesis defense, Montgomery's unfavorable background and separate <b>diagnoses</b> <b>of</b> mental illness were not fully {{revealed to the}} jury until after her conviction, by her appeals team. Critics including the Guardian journalist David Rose thus argue that Duchardt provided an incompetent legal defense for Montgomery. Judge Fenner required Duchardt to be cross-examined in November 2016. Duchardt rejected all criticism and defended his conduct.|$|E
25|$|From {{the above}} {{examples}} {{one can see}} why understanding of referred pain can lead to better <b>diagnoses</b> <b>of</b> various conditions and diseases. In 1981 physiotherapist Robin McKenzie described what he termed centralization. He concluded that centralization occurs when referred pain moves from a distal to a more proximal location. Observations {{in support of this}} idea were seen when patients would bend backward and forward during an examination.|$|E

30|$|Preoperative <b>diagnose</b> <b>of</b> carcinosarcoma is difficult.

In our case, preoperative PET-CT was not performed. If it showed abnormally intense FDG uptake despite being a small tumor, then it may have become an evidence for judging before the operation. However, high SUVmax value of the tumor does not influence the treatment strategy. So, in fact, it is not realistic to perform PET-CT for all patients with tumor of Vater’s papilla.|$|R
