5|$|Coonhounds existed as a {{distinct}} type by the mid-to-late 1800s. By 1885 a raccoon pelt sold for approximately 25 cents, a fair price for the time. Up to World War I raccoons were very common despite being hunted often, and were sometimes poisoned to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from destroying crops.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the war, Göring was {{repeatedly}} ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to Tellancourt airdrome, then to Darmstadt.

5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} {{found themselves in}} a difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> open. Napoleon realized that to capitalize on the success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E

5|$|The breed {{is quick}} to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct {{training}} can become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a regular exercise routine to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E

5|$|They {{are kind}} birds but the male Sebright may get {{protective}} around hens and may turn {{on its own}} owners like all roosters may do.

Sebrights are not prolific egglayers and hens are only expected to produce 60-80 creamy-white eggs each season.|$|E

5|$|After {{the breakup}} with Esperanza, Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and {{eventually}} proposes marriage to her, {{in order to}} improve his chances of winning custody of the three siblings. The judge, who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who hate her as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants to <b>keep</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among {{the extreme}} trans-Neptunian objects are two high {{perihelion}} objects: Sedna and 2012 VP113. Sedna and 2012 VP113 are distant detached objects with perihelia greater than 70 AU. Their high perihelia <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> at a sufficient distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous {{explanations for the}} high perihelion of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on a distant orbit and a distant encounter with a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore.

Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water.

5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Connections with Francia {{went beyond}} {{trade and the}} royal marriages Æthelberht and Eadbald made with Frankish princesses. Eadbald's granddaughter, Eorcengota, became a nun at Faremoutiers, and his great-granddaughter, Mildrith, was a nun at Chelles. When Edwin was killed in about 632, Æthelburg, escorted by Paulinus, fled by sea to Eadbald's court in Kent, but in a further sign of her family's ties across the channel she sent her {{children}} {{to the court of}} King Dagobert I of the Franks, to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> safe from the intrigues of Eadbald and Oswald of Northumbria.|$|E
