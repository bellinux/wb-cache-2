40|$|Extracts of Dermatophagoides <b>farinae</b> cultured on Gaines dog-meal plus yeast, and in {{particular}} the `protein' fraction precipitated by ammonium sulphate, give stronger skin test reactions in house dust sensitive patients than extracts of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and of house dust. Specific IgE was found against the D. <b>farinae</b> extract in eighteen out of twenty house dust sensitive subjects. Precipitins were found in human sera against extracts of D. <b>farinae,</b> D. pteronyssinus and house dust and also against antigens in cereal and vegetable dusts. These precipitin tests provided evidence of related antigens in extracts of house dust and D. <b>farinae</b> and in extracts of house dust and D. pteronyssinus, but not in D. <b>farinae</b> and D. pteronyssinus...|$|R

5|$|On 21 October 1999, Warnock {{announced}} her departure {{at the next}} election for personal reasons, and threw her support behind former Town of Vincent mayor John Hyde, {{a member of the}} Centre faction of the Labor Party who had the support of the Left faction and some Centre members of Parliament. However, the key Centre unions had backed former ministerial adviser Adele <b>Farina</b> for the post, and Labor's affirmative action policy for candidates in winnable seats meant that failing to pick a female candidate would risk sitting male MPs. A week later, the Centre faction openly split, with a breakaway group endorsing Hyde. On 5 November, <b>Farina</b> withdrew from the contest, leaving Hyde to be preselected unopposed ahead of the 2001 election. He maintained the seat for Labor at the election, becoming the first openly gay man to sit in the Western Australian parliament.|$|E

5|$|The {{outcome of}} the match led to debates about the format of {{qualification}} tournaments, with the Australian manager Frank <b>Farina</b> and Thompson feeling that preliminary rounds should be introduced to avoid such unbalanced matches, views shared by the international footballing body FIFA. It {{eventually led to the}} introduction of a preliminary round in the Oceanian zone qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The unbalanced level of opponents also partly contributed to Australia's move to the Asian Football Confederation in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard <b>Fariña</b> (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|Australia's manager Frank <b>Farina</b> criticised the {{qualification}} {{format and}} questioned {{the need for}} these kind of matches. Archie Thompson, who scored a record-setting 13 goals, was delighted with his record, but he also agreed with Farina's comments. FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper agreed with both comments and suggested {{a change in the}} qualification format, with the smaller teams entering a preliminary round. However, Oceania Football Confederation chairman Basil Scarsella, opposed both comments and claimed that the smaller teams have the right to face Australia and New Zealand, similar to Australia having the rights to face stronger opponents such as Brazil and France.|$|E
5000|$|Senator Jinggoy Estrada asked House {{prosecutor}} Rodolfo <b>Fariñas</b> on {{why he did}} {{not sign}} the impeachment complaint; <b>Fariñas</b> replied {{that he was a}} [...] "slow reader", and that the 188 representatives who signed were [...] "speed readers", and that his signature was no longer needed. <b>Fariñas</b> then discussed with Enrile on how the House of Representatives' impeachment process works, and that the House of Representatives and the Senate are working together to oust Corona.|$|R

5|$|On September 16, 1944, {{leaders of}} the Blocco del popolo (Popular Front) in Sicily, the {{communist}} Girolamo Li Causi and Pantaleone, went {{to speak to the}} landless labourers at a rally in Villalba, challenging Don Calò in his own personal fiefdom. In the morning tensions rose when Christian Democrat mayor Beniamino <b>Farina</b> – a relative of Vizzini as well as his successor as mayor – angered local communists by ordering all hammer-and-sickle signs erased from buildings along the road on which Li Causi would travel into town. When his supporters protested, they were intimidated by separatists and thugs.|$|E

25|$|Since Leonardo <b>Fariña</b> was {{the husband}} of {{television}} personality Karina Jelinek, the government tried to treat the program's revelations as a dispute between TV presenters on its controlled TV channels to discredit it. It hoped focusing <b>Fariña</b> would deflect attention from Kirchner. This attempt failed, and the extended coverage increased awareness of the controversy among the apolitical population. Details of the money's being weighed (instead of counted) and politicians' home vaults increased lay understanding of the corruption controversy's scope.|$|E
