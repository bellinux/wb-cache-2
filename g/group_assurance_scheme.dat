The {{purpose of this paper is}} to consider the global activities, highlighting the UK, concerned with farm <b>assurance</b> <b>schemes</b> and associated food labelling seeking to identify their contribution towards improving primary production standards. Design/methodology/approach ??? A desk study focusing on published literature and historical documentation. Findings ??? The majority of primary production standards are based upon codes of good practice with only tenuous links between the standards and the required environmental outcomes. Owing to the difficulties of comparing like with like here is little conclusive evidence that such standards are producing environmental benefits. Practical implications ??? If it depends on <b>assurance</b> <b>schemes</b> to improve farming practices then a European-wide standard is required that is not compromised by variations in national laws and codes of practice. Originality/value ??? This review is of academic value and of value to those working to improve primary production standards.

40|$|Quality <b>assurance</b> <b>schemes</b> are {{increasing}} in importance {{all over the}} European Union. They have considerable influence on the marketing of food products. Two main types can be identified: in-chain quality management schemes and market differentiation schemes.

This chapter discusses perceptions of stakeholders and the functioning of selected schemes using two sets of the data gathered from stakeholder hearings (and panels) and economic analyses of eight case studies.

Therefore any data fusion <b>assurance</b> <b>scheme</b> must be power efficient as well as secure. There are currently several methods of data fusionassurance that have been proposed.

40|$|This chapter {{reflects}} critically on {{the relevance}} of current quality grading and <b>assurance</b> <b>schemes</b> to small accommodation enterprises in which a home dimension is a common feature. The discussion focuses specifically on the cases of New Zealand and Scotland, looking comparatively at the nature of small tourist accommodation businesses and at the quality grading and <b>assurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in place in those contexts. It is suggested that the benchmark for such quality <b>assurance</b> and grading <b>schemes</b> should be a much greater emphasis upon {{the importance of the}} host-guest relationship. Rather than simply being concerned with the objective facets of accommodation, allowance needs to be taken of subjective elements of the accommodation experience; what it feels like for the guest who is staying, and what guest has to say about a place. In this way, it is suggested that a tendency towards standardization, perceived to be harmful to the reality of the accommodation product, might be avoided...|$|R
