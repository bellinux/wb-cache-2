The following three genes in Arabidopsis thaliana possess both common and independent functions in floral transition: FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), LEAFY (LFY), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1, also called AGAMOUS-LIKE20). SOC1 is a MADS-box-type gene, which integrates responses to photoperiod, vernalization and <b>gibberellins.</b>|$|E
25|$|Auxin stimulates cell {{elongation}} by stimulating wall-loosening factors, such as elastins, {{to loosen}} cell walls. The effect is stronger if <b>gibberellins</b> are also present.

Some seeds germinate best after a fire. For some seeds, fire cracks hard seed coats, while in others, chemical dormancy is broken in reaction to the presence of smoke.

25|$|The {{transition}} from the vegetative phase to a reproductive phase involves {{a dramatic change in}} the plant’s vital cycle, perhaps the most important one, as the process must be carried out correctly in order to guarantee that the plant produces descendents. This transition is characterised by the induction and development of the meristem of the inflorescence, which will produce a collection of flowers or one flower, where only one is produced. This morphogenetic change contains both endogenous and exogenous elements: For example, in order for the change to be initiated the plant must have a certain number of leaves and contain a certain level of total biomass. Certain environmental conditions are also required such as a characteristic photoperiod. Plant hormones play an important part in the process, with the <b>gibberellins</b> having a particularly important role.|$|E

Between the 1930s and 1950s {{it was determined that}} ATP, located in mitochondria, was the source of cellular chemical energy and the constituent reactions of photosynthesis were progressively revealed. Then, in 1944 DNA was extracted for the first time. Along with these revelations there was the discovery of plant hormones or [...] "growth substances", notably auxins, (1934) <b>gibberellins</b> (1934) and cytokinins (1964) and the effects of photoperiodism, the control of plant processes, especially flowering, by the relative lengths of day and night.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Gibberellins,</b> or GAs, {{include a}} large range of {{chemicals}} that are produced naturally within plants and by fungi. They were first discovered when Japanese researchers, including Eiichi Kurosawa, noticed a chemical {{produced by a}} fungus called Gibberella fujikuroi that produced abnormal growth in rice plants. <b>Gibberellins</b> are important in seed germination, affecting enzyme production that mobilizes food production used for growth of new cells. [...] This is done by modulating chromosomal transcription. [...] In grain (rice, wheat, corn, etc.) seeds, a layer of cells called the aleurone layer wraps around the endosperm tissue. Absorption of water by the seed causes production of GA. [...] The GA is transported to the aleurone layer, which responds by producing enzymes that break down stored food reserves within the endosperm, which are utilized by the growing seedling. GAs produce bolting of rosette-forming plants, increasing internodal length. They promote flowering, cellular division, and in seeds growth after germination. <b>Gibberellins</b> also reverse the inhibition of shoot growth and dormancy induced by ABA.|$|E
40|$|The {{sites of}} <b>gibberellin</b> (GA) {{synthesis}} in light grown sunflower plants were studied. The results of organ excision and the exogenous application of {{indole acetic acid}} and gibberellic acid indicated that <b>gibberellin</b> synthesis occurred in the young leaves of the apical bud. This was substantiated {{using a combination of}} diffusion and extraction techniques. Diffusion of sunflower apical buds on agar for 20 hours revealed a level of <b>gibberellin</b> greater than that obtained by solvent extraction of a similar number of apices, indicating that synthesis of <b>gibberellin</b> was occurring in those apices during the diffusion period. The <b>gibberellin</b> level of apices extracted following a 20 hour diffusion period was the same as that obtained from buds extracted immediately following excision from the plant, again suggesting that apical buds are sites of <b>gibberellin</b> synthesis.

The content of Ps 3 ox mRNA in the weeping type was much greater than that in the upright type, while the endogenous <b>gibberellin</b> level was much higher in the elongating zone of the weeping type. These results suggest that the amount and distribution of synthesized <b>gibberellin</b> regulate secondary xylem formation, and the unbalanced distribution of <b>gibberellin</b> affects the gravi-response of the Prunus tree...|$|R

40|$|The hormone <b>gibberellin</b> (GA) {{is a key}} {{regulator}} {{of plant}} growth. Many {{of the components of}} the <b>gibberellin</b> signal transduction [e. g., <b>GIBBERELLIN</b> INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID 1) and DELLA], biosynthesis [e. g., GA 20 -oxidase (GA 20 ox) and GA 3 ox], and deactivation pathways have been identified. <b>Gibberellin</b> binds its receptor, GID 1, to form a complex that mediates the degradation of DELLA proteins. In this way, <b>gibberellin</b> relieves DELLA-dependent growth repression. However, <b>gibberellin</b> regulates expression of GID 1, GA 20 ox, and GA 3 ox, and there is also evidence that it regulates DELLA expression. In this paper, we use integrated mathematical modeling and experiments to understand how these feedback loops interact to control <b>gibberellin</b> signaling. Model simulations are in good agreement with in vitro data on the signal transduction and biosynthesis pathways and in vivo data on the expression levels of gibberellin-responsive genes. We find that GA–GID 1 interactions are characterized by two timescales (because of a lid on GID 1 that can open and close slowly relative to GA–GID 1 binding and dissociation). Furthermore, the model accurately predicts the response to exogenous <b>gibberellin</b> after a number of chemical and genetic perturbations. Finally, we investigate the role of the various feedback loops in <b>gibberellin</b> signaling. We find that regulation of GA 20 ox transcription plays a significant role in both modulating the level of endogenous <b>gibberellin</b> and generating overshoots after the removal of exogenous <b>gibberellin.</b> Moreover, although the contribution of other individual feedback loops seems relatively small, GID 1 and DELLA transcriptional regulation acts synergistically with GA 20 ox feedback...|$|R

In consequence, the well-known growth-promoting properties of <b>gibberellin</b> are due to its activity as an "inhibitor of an inhibitor" [Brian Pw. Sym Soc.

40|$|The {{increase}} in diffusible auxin in the dwarf pea following treatment with <b>gibberellin</b> {{has been shown}} not to involve the inhibition of IAA oxidase, the rate of basipetal auxin transport, decrease in growth inhibitor, {{the formation of a}} complex between <b>gibberellin</b> and auxin, or the enzymatic conversion of tryptophan to ether-soluble auxin. The tryptophan con-version system from p'ants treated with <b>gibberellin</b> formed four times more water-soluble auxin than did the enzyme preparation from control plants. Thus the {{increase in}} water-soluble auxin appears to be the major cause of the higher auxin level in plants treated with <b>gibberellin.</b> In a previous paper (i) the evidence has been presented for the theory that the effect of <b>gibberellin</b> on stem elongation is the result of an increase in the amount of diffusible auxin. There are several possibilities for the mecha-nism whereby a higher auxin level is brought about through treatment with <b>gibberellin.</b> (1) <b>Gibberellin</b> may directly inhibit IAA oxidase or, it may promote the formation of an inhibitor of the enzyme, bringing about an increase in auxin level in either event. Although several investigators have reported lower activities of IAA oxidase (2) and peroxidase (3) in tissue treated with <b>gibberellin,</b> others have found no change in the enzyme activity (4, 5), and HAYASHI, MURAKAMI and MATSUNAKA (6) find an increase in activity of per-oxidase after treatment with <b>gibberellin.</b> GALSTON (7) has reported an increase in an inhibitor of IAA oxidase following treatment with <b>gibberellin.</b> Because of the conflicting results of these studies employing in vitro measurements, an in vivo measurement originated by SHOJI and ADDICOTT (5) was used in this investigation to establish the effect of <b>gibberellin</b> treatment on the activity of Abbreviation: IAA, indole- 3 -acetic acid...|$|R

50|$|<b>Gibberellins</b> are tetracyclic {{diterpene}} acids. There are {{two classes}} {{based on the}} presence of either 19 or 20 carbons.

The 19-carbon forms are, in general, the biologically active forms of <b>gibberellins.</b> Hydroxylation also has a great effect on the biological activity of the gibberellin. In general, the most biologically active compounds are dihydroxylated <b>gibberellins,</b> which possess hydroxyl groups on both carbon 3 and carbon 13.

40|$|The {{plant hormones}} <b>gibberellin</b> and abscisic acid {{regulate}} gene expression, secretion and cell death in aleurone. The emerging picture is of <b>gibberellin</b> perception at the plasma membrane whereas abscisic acid acts {{at both the}} plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm - although <b>gibberellin</b> and abscisic acid receptors {{have yet to be}} identified. A range of downstream-signalling components and events has been implicated in <b>gibberellin</b> and abscisic acid signalling in aleurone. These include the G(alpha) subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein, a transient elevation in cGMP, Ca 2 +-dependent and Ca 2 +-independent events in the cytoplasm, reversible protein phosphorylation, and several promoter cis-elements and transcription factors, including GAMYB. In parallel, molecular genetic studies on mutants of Arabidopsis that show defects in responses to these hormones have identified components of <b>gibberellin</b> and abscisic acid signalling. These two approaches are yielding results that raise the possibility that specific <b>gibberellin</b> and abscisic acid signalling components perform similar functions in aleurone and other tissues...|$|R
40|$|In the {{elongation}} {{zone of the}} Arabidopsis thaliana plant root, cells undergo rapid elongation, {{increasing their}} length by ∼ 10 -fold over 5 h while maintaining a constant radius. Although {{progress is being made}} in understanding how this growth is regulated, little consideration has been given as to how cell elongation affects the distribution of the key regulating hormones. Using a multiscale mathematical model and measurements of growth dynamics, we investigate the distribution of the hormone <b>gibberellin</b> in the root elongation zone. The model quantifies how rapid cell expansion causes <b>gibberellin</b> to dilute, creating a significant gradient in <b>gibberellin</b> levels. By incorporating the <b>gibberellin</b> signaling network, we simulate how <b>gibberellin</b> dilution affects the downstream components, including the growth-repressing DELLA proteins. We predict a gradient in DELLA that provides an explanation of the reduction in growth exhibited as cells move {{toward the end of the}} elongation zone. These results are validated at the molecular level by comparing predicted mRNA levels with transcriptomic data. To explore the dynamics further, we simulate perturbed systems in which <b>gibberellin</b> levels are reduced, considering both genetically modified and chemically treated roots. By modeling these cases, we predict how these perturbations affect <b>gibberellin</b> and DELLA levels and thereby provide insight into their altered growth dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The Arabidopsis hypocotyl, {{together}} with hormone mutants and chemical inhibitors, {{was used to}} study the role of auxin in cell elongation and its possible interactions with ethylene and <b>gibberellin.</b> When wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on media containing a range of auxin concentrations, hypocotyl growth was inhibited. However, when axr 1 - 12 and 35 S-iaaL (which have reduced auxin response and levels, respectively) were grown in the same conditions, auxin was able to promote hypocotyl growth. In contrast, auxin does not promote hypocotyl growth of axr 3 - 1, which has phenotypes that suggest an enhanced auxin response. These {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that auxin levels in the wild-type hypocotyl are optimal for elongation and that additional auxin is inhibitory. When ethylene responses were reduced using either the ethylene-resistant mutant etr 1 or aminoethoxyvinylglycine, an inhibitor of ethylene synthesis, auxin responses were unchanged, indicating that auxin does not inhibit hypocotyl elongation through ethylene. To test for interactions between auxin and <b>gibberellin,</b> auxin mutants were grown on media containing <b>gibberellin</b> and <b>gibberellin</b> mutants were grown on media containing auxin.
