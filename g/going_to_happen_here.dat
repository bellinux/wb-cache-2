40|$|One of {{the most}} {{cherished}} of the priorities of the College of William and Mary is 2 ̆ 2 First School of Law in the Country [...] 1779. 2 ̆ 2 Now {{it seems that the}} claim that this is the oldest law school in the country is in jeopardy, due to recent Department of the Interior certification of the Litchfield School, Litchfield, Conn., as the oldest law school. This move causes the second major Virginia-New England hassle over historical claims, though it may never reach the proportions of the Thanksgiving dispute. The Marshall-Wythe School of Law, as it is now known, was founded December 4, 1779, when the board of visitors established a professorship of law and police. George Wythe, under whom Thomas Jefferson once studied, was the first law professor. The College claims that this school was predated by only Oxford and perhaps Trinity College of schools in the English- speaking world. The claim made by Litchfield is that though it is not connected with a school, which William and Mary readily admits, it began its teaching of law before this institution. The Connecticut school, classified as independent or 2 ̆ 2 proprietary 2 ̆ 2 law school, claims that is founder Tapping Reeve began teach on or 2 ̆ 2 talking law 2 ̆ 2 sometime prior to the 1779 date. The school itself was founded in 1784. Professor James P. Wythe of the Marshall-Wythe faculty, says this claim is 2 ̆ 2 ridiculous. It is not the first law school. We have always assumed that we were the first school of law; in fact, a Harvard dean in a recent book admits that we are. It looks like a city chamber of commerce type maneuver to place a historical monument in the town. They may have had a building called a law school [...] anybody could have such a building [...] but we are the first law school. 2 ̆ 2 Dean Joseph Curtis of the local law school agrees. 2 ̆ 2 I don 2 ̆ 7 t think we were given proper consideration when this thing came up. We were never contacted or requested to submit our documents and claims to our being the oldest law school. I don 2 ̆ 7 t really know what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> from <b>here.</b> 2 ̆ 2 William F. Swindler, also on the college faculty, has been to Washington this past week to see First District Representative Thomas Downing to see if anything can be done to alleviate the situation. The Department of the Interior has already placed a historical landmark in the Connecticut town calling it the site of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s oldest law school. The concern here {{stems from the fact that}} the Department never mentioned such a commemoration to college officials. Word was received only last week through a newspaper clipping from a Connecticut paper. The turmoil boils, and no one here seems to know when or how it will simmer. [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|Paul Pettengale {{reviewed}} Eye of Doom for Arcane magazine, rating it a 3 out of 10 overall. He {{began the}} review by stating: [...] "A {{couple of months}} ago the Monstrous Arcana series for AD&D kicked off with the rather good I, Tyrant book, detailing everything you could ever want to know about Beholders. Unfortunately, Eye of Pain, the first in a three-part series of 32-page adventures involving a hive of beholders and their less than wholesome kin, was less than impressive ... Regrettably, the second part in the series, Eye of Doom, is no better." [...] Pettengale describes the task of the characters infiltrating the Unblinking Eye as [...] "a feat which would seem somewhat improbable given that members of the group know who they are (having recently ambushed them and all). This section of the adventure (which forms the bulk of it, it's that short) seems like a contrived attempt at getting the players involved in some roleplaying instead of hacking their way to glory. But, regrettably (again), it doesn't really come off." [...] He continued: [...] "Another problem with it {{is the way in which}} the adventure ends. Of course, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> divulge what <b>happens</b> <b>here</b> - that would spoil it for everybody - suffice to say that unless you intend to run the final scenario in the series, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be immensely disappointed with the conclusion. It leaves the whole plot hanging, which is bad enough, but what's worse is that it would be very difficult for the DM to fix it so that the players can do anything else before having to progress further into this plot. The party is left, in effect, in a position from where there is no conceivable way back until they've taken on that final horror - a horror which isn't encountered until the next installment is available." [...] Pettengale concluded the interview by saying, [...] "So, another one to avoid. I'm afraid. I would show a little optimism and say let's hope the final part is better, but I'm not at all convinced that it will be, and besides, it will be pretty hard to play unless the party has ploughed its way through the previous two scenarios. And I wouldn't wish that on anybody. Unfortunately, this series, thus far, has been a waste of a great foe - the beholder is a unique monster in AD&D, and one that deserves far, far better than this." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project is to {{determine}} the impact of solar cells and electrical vehicles on the future electricity grid and distribution network. Future electricity grids will be affected differently than it does today. Therefore, it is important to determine the impacts so that the current electricity distribution system can be developed and redesign to achieve the future demand. In Sweden, government has changed rules and laws {{in order to make it}} easier for private sector to invest in renewable energy sources. Our project focused on the impact of the solar cells and electric vehicles on the low voltage electricity distribution. Solar cells have become more popular than ever and that leads to many countries in utilizing their energy needs from solar and the same is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>here</b> in Sweden. It is needed to find out how the impacts on the low voltage grids will be if many private individual install solar panels in their own homes and what will happen when they start to supply electricity, which is excess from the production of their solar cells, back to the grid? What should be done in order to maintain the electricity’s quality in term of voltage? Meanwhile, electric vehicle popularity rises every year, which means that electricity demand will rise proportionally with the number of electric cars in the country. Should something be done with the power supply to meet the power needs of electric cars? Is it possible to use the electrical car battery as a backup power? How electric vehicle charging’s behavior will impact on the low voltage? In this project, data and pictures has taken from different sources and consolidated for analysis purpose. This thesis contained information about solar radiation, solar cells, electric vehicles, and batteries, rules for installation of solar cells regulations, electricity grids, and electrical power quality, results of researching and eventual solutions for expected problems.
