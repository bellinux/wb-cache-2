When a hummingbird feeds on nectar, the bill is usually opened only slightly, allowing the tongue to dart out and into the interior of flowers. Hummingbird bill sizes range from about 5 mm to as long as 100 mm (about 4 in). When catching insects in flight, a hummingbird's jaw flexes downward to widen the gape for successful capture.|$|R

According to the quantity of the modeling data, Grey judgment of gross error and robust estimation theory is used separately for finding the gross error exit whether or not from the modeling data.

From the examples, A quarter of fitting precision of robust estimation is less than 1 %, and 75 % is 1 ～ 5 %; and <b>half</b> of <b>fitting</b> precision of LIR algorithm is less than 1 %, and half is 1 ～ 5 %.

40|$|URL] The {{objective}} of this work was to estimate the height growth of Eucalyptus using the Chapman-Richards model considering for the errors the distributions normal, Student t (t) and Cauchy. The data set came from a hybrid of Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus tereticornis x E. pellita (controlled pollination), of the Forestry Experimental Module in the Gypsum Pole of Araripe, established in 2002. Eighty-three trees were used which heights were measured in all trees for six and <b>half</b> years. The <b>fittings</b> consisted on the estimation of {{the parameters of the}} Chapman-Richards model maximizing the log-likelihood of the error distributions using the symmetric distributions normal, t and Cauchy. For comparison of the adjusted models were used the criteria of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The model using the t distribution with 2 degrees of freedom (t 2) had lower values of AIC and BIC and the model of Cauchy had lower value for MAPE. The results indicate that the model considering the t distribution for the errors presented best estimates of height growth of Eucalyptus clones in Gypsum Pole of Pernambuco...|$|R
40|$|This study evaluated, in vivo, the {{efficacy}} of a denture glazing material (Palaseal) in modifying plaque colonization of dentures. Ten subjects were selected and received maxillary temporary partial removable dentures, with complete acrylic palatal coverage. The right <b>half</b> of the <b>fitting</b> surface of the denture bases were glazed with Palaseal, whereas the other half was not glazed. One month after insertion, two fragments of the resin base of all dentures were removed (one from the glazed side and another from the non-glazed side). These samples were prepared and examined by scanning electron microscopy. Three months after insertion, other fragments were obtained and analyzed. Microscopic observation at 1 month revealed that, for all patients, the plaque film was thinner on the treated side {{in comparison to the}} non-treated side. However, at the 3 -month evaluation, some areas of the glaze showed cracking, and both glazed and non-glazed sides were covered by a dense bacterial plaque film. In conclusion, the findings of this clinical experiment showed that glazing denture’s fitting surface did not prevent bacterial colonization, but favored plaque removal while the glaze layer remained intact. After three months, glaze cracks created microretentive areas that increased plaque accumulation. Key Words: denture plaque, denture glaze, scanning electron microscopy...|$|R

Volume 4, {{published by the}} Thomason Civil Engineering College, Roorkee. He describes the Kirk to have commenced divine services in November 1864. The church has a length of 93 ft., width of 57 ft. and consisted of a nave covered by a slated pent roof, and aisles on the sides with Bengal terrace roofing. The church was built to accommodate 500 people. The tower was originally {{intended to be a}} steeple has a height of 90 ft., nave to the wall plates under the roof trusses was 34 ft., and the side aisles were 23 ft. Brickwork, plastering and chunam (lime) was used in the construction. Ample ventilation and light was made possible by including clerestory windows of the nave, and main and circular windows on the side aisles. There was no transept to break the voice and the acoustics were excellent. The cost of construction was BINR 40,000, with this cost including the furniture and <b>fittings.</b> <b>Half</b> of this cost was raised by public subscription, and the other half met by the Government of Madras. Excluding the furniture and fittings, the cost of construction was BINR 5 per ft2.|$|R
40|$|The point spread {{function}} of the SXT telescope aboard Yohkoh has been measured in flight configuration in three different X-ray lines at White Sands Missile Range. We have fitted these data with an elliptical generalization of the Moffat function. Our fitting method consists of chi squared minimization in Fourier space, especially designed for matching of sharply peaked functions. We find excellent fits with a reduced chi squared of order unity or less for single exposure point spread functions {{over most of the}} CCD. Near the edges of the CCD the fits are less accurate due to vignetting. From fitting results with summation of multiple exposures we find a systematic error in the fitting {{function of}} the order of 3 % near the peak of the point spread function, which is close to the photon noise for typical SXT images in orbit. We find that the full width to <b>half</b> maximum and <b>fitting</b> parameters vary significantly with CCD location. However, we also find that point spread functions measured at the same location are consistent to one another within the limit determined by photon noise. A 'best' analytical fit to the PSF as function of position on the CCD is derived for use in SXT image enhancemnent routines. As an aside result we have found that SXT can determine the location of point sources to {{about a quarter of a}} 2. 54 arc sec pixel...|$|R
40|$|Phosphate {{minerals}} such as β-tricalcium phosphate and fluorapatite are abundant, {{exhibit a}} large chemical variability and samples of both phases {{are often used}} for geochronometry; so their stability over thousands of years is known. This makes them attractive as nuclear waste forms as they are stable over {{extended periods of time}} and are able to accommodate a range of waste species. In particular, due to the difficulty of incorporating halides in conventional waste forms (in particular glass), fluorapatites are considered as potential hosts for radioactive waste streams containing both actinides and halides. β -tricalcium phosphate, a structure related to fluorapatite, is not only used as a precursor for preparing apatites, but could itself be used as a host for radioactive waste. To better understand the structure and stability of these phases, atomic scale computer simulation has been employed (both dynamic and static), using classical pair potentials. One site in the β -tricalcium phosphate structure has previously been assigned a <b>half</b> occupancy from <b>fitting</b> to Rietveld power diffraction experimental data. The half occupancy gives rise to an ordering effect where the Ca 2 + ions are arranged over the half occupied Ca(4) sites, in many different configurations. A comparison of different cell sizes (and increasing configuration number) is given and reported in terms of lattice energy and structural parameters. The largest cell size considered here generates the most stable structures, which have a symmetry group related to the experimentally derived average primitive unit cell. Simulated X-ray diffraction patterns indicate a difference in spectra for these low energy configurations. However, experimental X-ray diffraction patterns fail to differentiate between low energy structures. The results of the experiment and small difference in lattice energy for the most stable structures, indicate that domains containing different low energy structures are likely to exist. The configurations described here are also discussed in terms of statistical analysis. Substitutions of a range of isovalent and trivalent cations have been carried out (and compared) at Ca 2 + sites in both fluorapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate structures. The defect and solution energies were calculated for both structures and compared, in order to predict the partitioning across the two phases. For the isovalent defects investigated, the defects segregate to the β-tricalcium phosphate lattice. The trivalent defects present a different trend such that defects with a smaller ionic radii than Ca 2 + have an energy preference for β-tricalcium phosphate, but for those with atomic radii closer to that of the host cation the preference for either structure is indistinguishable. The ramifications of cation partitioning are discussed. Cation and anion migration in fluorapatite is considered, where the overriding feature of migration in this structure is that ionic transport (of either cations or anions) occurs preferably along the c-axis. Consideration of fluorine transport yields a more sophisticated migration mechanism than that reported previously. A “concerted mechanism” for fluorine ion transport in the lattice is discussed fully and described using fluorine density plots, over a range of temperatures. Radiation damage effects in these minerals and their ability to recover and resist damage is a crucial consideration when designing a nuclear waste host. This thesis compares the Kinchin- Pease model of threshold displacement energies to full radiation cascades. Furthermore, the effect of radiation damage on the lattice is considered by virtue of incident damage, defect types, phosphate group response and recovery of the lattice. These results indicate that the fluorapatite lattice is “relatively tolerant” to radiation damage, especially with regard to the phosphate tetrahedra, but more cascades should be considered to obtain a more statistically reliable prediction. Finally, loss of material from the waste form is most likely to occur at a surface and understanding the processes by which this occurs is important. Therefore, it is necessary to first model the surfaces, which involves static simulations of surfaces to predict surface formation energies. These energies are used as the basis for predictions of particle morphology and the effect of isovalent defect incorporation near the surface of fluorapatite.
