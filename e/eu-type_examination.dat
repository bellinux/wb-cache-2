40|$|Bringing into {{commercial}} {{circulation of}} tracked excavators is uniformly regulated in the States of the European Union {{according to the}} European Directive 84 / 532 /EEC. The sound power level L_W_A in dB to be determined {{within the scope of}} the <b>EU-Type</b> <b>Examination</b> for the conveyor of soil proper and the sound pressure level L_n_A are regulated by the EU-Directives 86 / 662 /EEC and 89 / 514 /EEC. The present limit values for the sound power level L_W_A= 106 dB to 113 dB dependend on the performance are the basic precondition for the participation in the free movement of goods within the EU-States. These limit values do not always meet the present state of the sound insulation technology. The Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) has extended to awarding catalogue for the eco-label 'Blauer Engel RAL-UZ 53 '' for low-noise building machines and devices by the category of the excavators of high capacity (P_N> 85 kW). The present report shows that it is possible from the economic and technical aspect to introduce on the market of the EU states tracked excavators of the 40 tons category with a sound power level L_W_A= 101 dB and with a sound pressure level L_p_A= 71 dB at the operator's place at the dynamic working cycle according to the EU-Direktive 89 / 514 /EEC. In this connection sound insulation measures were carried out at the source of relatively low-noise driving motors and passive sound insulation measures (exhaust emission air inlet silencers, optimized silencers, full encasing/partial encasing).
