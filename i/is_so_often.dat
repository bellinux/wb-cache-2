25|$|The Code {{recognized}} the importance of intent. A man who killed another in a quarrel must swear he did not do so intentionally and was then only fined according to the rank of the deceased. The Code does not say what would be the penalty of murder, but death <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> awarded where death is caused, that we can hardly doubt that the murderer was put to death. If the assault only led to injury and was unintentional, the assailant in a quarrel had to pay the doctor's fees. A brander, induced to remove a slave's identification mark, could swear to his ignorance and was free. The owner of an ox that gored a man on the street was only responsible for damages if the ox was known by him to be vicious—even if it caused death. If the mancipium died a natural death under the creditor's hand, the creditor was free. In ordinary cases, a person was not responsible for accident or if they exercised more than proper care. Poverty excused bigamy {{on the part of a}} deserted wife.|$|E
25|$|In early {{times the}} choir alone possessed seats, the nave being left bare. Gradually benches were introduced, {{and during the}} 15th century became universal. The poppyhead form of B {{ornament}} now reached perfection and was constantly used enc for seats other {{than those of the}} choir. The name refers en a. to the carved finial which <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> used to complete the top of the bench end and is peculiarly English in character. In Devon and Cornwall it is rarely met with (Ilsington, Devon). In Somerset it is more common, while in the eastern counties thousands of examples remain. The quite simple fleur-de-lys form of poppyhead, suitable for the village, is seen in perfection at Trunch, Norfolk, and the very elaborate form when the poppyhead springs from a crocketed circle filled in with sculpture, at St Nicholas, King's Lynn. Often the foliage contained a face (St Margaret's, Cley, Norfolk), or the poppyhead consisted of figures or birds only (Thurston, Suffolk) or a figure standing on a dragon (Great Brincton, Northampton); occasionally the traditional form was departed from and the finial carved like a lemon in outline (Bury St Edmuncis) or a diamond (Tirley, Glos.). In Denmark an ornament {{in the form of a}} large circle sometimes takes the place of the English poppy-head. In the Copenhagen Museum there is a set of bench ends of the 15th century with such a decoration carved with coats of arms, interlacing strap-work, etc. But the old 15th-century bench end did not depend entirely on the poppy-head for its embellishment. The side was constantly enriched with elaborate tracery (Dennington, Norfolk) or with tracery and domestic scenes (North Cadbury, Somerset), or would consist of a mass of sculpture in perspective, with canopy work, buttresses and sculptured niches, while the top of the bench end would be crowned with figures carved in the round, of the finest craftsmanship. Such work at Amiens cathedral is a marvel alike of conception, design and execution. In the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin some beautiful stall ends are to be seen. Out of a dragons mouth grows a conventional tree arranged and balanced in excellent proportion. On another, stall end a tree is carved growing out of the mouth of a fool. This custom of making foliage grow out of the mouth or eyes is hardly defensible, and was by no means confined to any country or time. We have plenty of Renaissance examples of the same treatment.|$|E

500|$|The eighth {{song and}} second {{instrumental}} on Why Should the Fire Die?, [...] "Stumptown", {{was written by}} Chris Thile. The song was written {{as a tribute to}} Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Chris Thile's favorite coffee house in the world. [...] "Stumptown" [...] is also the album's shortest song, at one minute and forty three seconds. [...] "Anthony", the ninth track, is the only song recorded by Nickel Creek that was written solely by Sara Watkins. [...] "Anthony", which features a ukulele melody, was described by several critics to be [...] "old-timey". One of three Thile-Watkins-Watkins composed pieces on the album, [...] "Best Of Luck" [...] was the tenth track on Why Should the Fire Die?. Sara Watkins had the lead vocal for [...] "Best Of Luck", and was complimented by critics for her [...] "snippy" [...] and [...] "assertive" [...] vocal. prefix Magazine pegged the song to be the formula that makes [...] "this album, and trio, unstoppable". The eleventh track, [...] "Doubting Thomas", was written by Chris Thile and is named after Doubting Thomas, a biblical term. All the members of Nickel Creek came from devout Christian families, and the song is about questioning faith. The third and final instrumental, [...] "First and Last Waltz", is Why Should the Fire Die?s twelfth track. One of the three songs written by all of Nickel Creek's members, it comes before the penultimate track, [...] "Helena". At Nickel Creek's concerts, the song was played as a segue into [...] "Helena". The album recording of [...] "First And Last Waltz" [...] has been called a [...] "chilly effects-draped recital piece", due to its use of sound effects. [...] "Helena", the penultimate track, was written by Chris Thile. Producer Eric Valentine provided drumming duties for this song. Thile described the track to be what he considered [...] "the ultimate climax" [...] of Why Should the Fire Die?, and some contemporary critics found the song to be the highlight of the album. [...] The final song on Why Should the Fire Die?, the title track, is a slow waltz. PopMatters described the song as being [...] "gorgeously sung", but [...] "an odd choice to conclude a record that <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> bidding for the true fun of pop music".|$|E

2500|$|... sudo ( [...] or [...] ) is {{a program}} for Unix-like {{computer}} operating systems that allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user, by default the superuser.

2500|$|... "The Mulatto" [...] is a melodrama {{with the}} gothic {{elements}} of curses, suicide, murder, and the monstrous.

Melodrama in a domestic setting was particularly transferrable to interracial questions of family legitimacy:"Dramas of patriarchal right, and hyperbolic investments in moral polarities of good and evil, virtue and villainy, are about investing the family with new symbolic potency ... In the context of Saint-Domingue and Louisiana, and in 'Le Mulâtre,' the symbolic crisis of the Law of the Father and of social legitimacy is lived literally and viscerally. The colonial family romance here really means killing the father, as the conflict between slave and slave master <b>is,</b> <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> a family drama too." ...|$|E

[...] "In my youth I had been taught in school and at home not only to love the good of my own country, but also to seek to understand and to respect the individualities of other nations.

2500|$|Further {{evidence}} for the reported text theory is provided in how other plays are used throughout The Contention.

Even a line from 3 Henry VI is used in Act 3, Scene 1 ("If our King Henry had shook hands with death" [...] (1.4.103)), all of which seems to suggest that, as <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> {{the case in the}} bad quartos, the reporter was filling in blanks (i.e. passages he couldn't remember) with extracts from other plays.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was born}} Jean de Hollingue either in 1459 or earlier, but records {{of his early}} life, as <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> the case with Renaissance composers, are scanty. Most likely he was {{from the village of}} Haut-Wignes (now Wirwignes), near Boulogne-sur-Mer, in Samer. [...] He {{probably}} began his first job, singer and teacher at the collegiate church in Saint Omer, then moved to Nesle (southeast of Amiens) in 1477, and in 1483 was made maître de chapelle there. Sometime around this time he became a priest, and in 1500 {{he was in charge of}} choirboys at the cathedral in Amiens. In 1501 he was in Grenoble, teaching choirboys, but he left the next year, most likely entering the service of Queen Anne of Brittany, and in 1509 he was granted a position again in Grenoble which he could hold in absentia. Mouton was now the principal composer for the French court. For the remainder of his life he was employed by the French court in one capacity or another, often writing music for state occasions—weddings, coronations, papal elections, births and deaths.|$|E
