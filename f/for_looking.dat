5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third-person {{perspective}} with full camera control in most areas {{and the ability to}} use a first-person perspective <b>for</b> <b>looking</b> around a location, with the players able to use a widescreen mode, provided that their console is hooked up to a television set that has widescreen capabilities. The game's story focuses on two different styles of gameplay which the player switches between at various points.|$|E

Sandro arrives {{in the middle of}} the fight to see the match end in Ray's disqualification for illegal shoving. When Diana arrives home, Sandro berates her <b>for</b> <b>looking</b> like a loser.

She reveals that Bob Harvey, a suspect in Luke's murder, died in the car crash in New Orleans. Reyes stresses her vision's importance, but Doggett dismisses it. Reyes goes to visit Jeb's sister, Katha, and learns {{he did not know}} Bob Harvey. While Reyes is there, Katha receives a call from Jeb, but tells him to call later. As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption.

5|$|In {{addition}} to CAP's own corporate fleet, many member-owned aircraft are {{made available for}} official tasking by CAP's volunteers should the need arise. Aircraft on search missions are generally crewed by at least three qualified aircrew members: a Mission Pilot, responsible for the safe flying of the aircraft; a Mission Observer, responsible for navigation, communications and coordination of the mission as well as ground observation; and a Mission Scanner who is responsible <b>for</b> <b>looking</b> for crash sites and damage clues. Additionally, the mission scanner may double as a satellite digital imaging system (SDIS) operator. Larger aircraft may have additional scanners aboard, providing greater visual coverage. Because of the additional ARCHER equipment, the crew of a Civil Air Patrol GA8 Airvan may also include an operator of the ARCHER system, depending upon {{the requirements of the}} mission and the capabilities of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Like most shooter games, first-person {{shooters}} involve an avatar, {{one or more}} ranged weapons, and a varying {{number of}} enemies. Because they {{take place in a}} 3D environment, these games tend to be somewhat more realistic than 2D shooter games, and have more accurate representations of gravity, lighting, sound and collisions. First-person shooters played on personal computers are most often controlled with a combination of a keyboard and mouse. This system has been claimed as superior to that found in console games, which frequently use two analog sticks: one used for running and sidestepping, the other <b>for</b> <b>looking</b> and aiming. It is common to display the character's hands and weaponry in the main view, with a head-up display showing health, ammunition and location details. Often, it is possible to overlay a map of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commanded}} by 62-year-old Captain Edward John Smith, {{the most senior}} of the White Star Line's captains. He had four decades of seafaring experience and had served as captain of , from which he was transferred to command Titanic. The {{vast majority of the}} crew who served under him were not trained sailors, but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible <b>for</b> <b>looking</b> after the engines; or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers. The 6watch officers and 39able-bodied seamen constituted only around 5percent of the crew, and most of these had been taken on at Southampton so had not had time to familiarise themselves with the ship.|$|E

5|$|On 19 February, General Smith {{got word}} that the Peshwa was headed for Pandharpur. General Smith's troops {{attacked}} the Peshwa at Ashti en route. During this battle, Gokhale died while defending the Peshwa from the British. The Raja of Satara was captured along with his brother and mother. The Maratha king, first imprisoned by Tarabai in the 1750s had lost power much earlier but was reinstated by Madhav rao Peshwa in 1763 after Tarabai's death. Since then the king had retained a titular position of appointing the Peshwas. The Emperor Alamgir II in his farman to the Peshwa had complimented them <b>for</b> <b>looking</b> after the Chhatrapati family. The Chhatrapati declared in favour of the British and this ended the Peshwa's legal position {{as head of the}} Maratha confederacy, this was done by a jahirnama which stated Peshwas were no longer the head of the Maratha confederacy. However Baji Rao II challenged the jahirnama of removing him from his position as Peshwa by issuing another jahirnama removing Mountstuart Elphinstone as British Resident to his state. The death of Gokhale and the skirmish at Ashti hastened the end of the war. Soon after this Baji Rao was deserted by the Patwardhans.|$|E
5|$|Redfield and Alomar {{board the}} tanker and {{encounter}} Gionne, who escapes after dropping {{a case of}} syringes; Alomar keeps several. When Redfield and Alomar reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Redfield and Alomar defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Redfield and Alomar that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Alomar realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Redfield and Alomar follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Redfield and Alomar disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Redfield and Alomar through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Redfield and Alomar are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Redfield and Alomar fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Redfield wonders if the world is worth fighting <b>for.</b> <b>Looking</b> at Alomar and Valentine, he decides {{to live in a}} world without fear.|$|E

25|$|Other post-processualists have instead {{taken the}} view of {{sociologist}} Karl Marx (1818–1883) that class conflict was the force for this social change.

25|$|In the {{reflection}} electron microscope (REM) {{as in the}} TEM, an electron beam is incident on a surface but instead of using the transmission (TEM) or secondary electrons (SEM), the reflected beam of elastically scattered electrons is detected.

Another variation is spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SPLEEM), which is used <b>for</b> <b>looking</b> at the microstructure of magnetic domains.|$|E
