5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the <b>forebrain,</b> midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the <b>forebrain</b> becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E
5|$|Below and {{in front}} of the {{striatum}} are a number of basal <b>forebrain</b> structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal <b>forebrain,</b> in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|TBR1 {{expression}} {{has been}} shown to be downregulated by embryonic exposure to cocaine. Prenatal cocaine exposure in a mouse model caused a decrease in both GABA neuron migration from the basal to the dorsal <b>forebrain</b> and radial neuron migration in the dorsal <b>forebrain.</b> This exposure also decreased TBR1 and TBR2 expression. However, further research showed that cocaine exposure only delayed TBR1 expression and did not cause permanent downregulation. Therefore, in models of prenatal cocaine exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed.|$|E

30|$|Parts of <b>forebrains</b> {{from all}} groups were rapidly frozen with liquid {{nitrogen}} after adding Phosphate buffer solution (PH 7.2 – 7.4). Samples then were melted at 2 – 8  °C.|$|R
50|$|Dysregulation of NGF {{signaling}} {{has also}} been linked to Alzheimer's disease. Connective tissue cells genetically engineered to synthesize and secrete NGF and implanted in patients' basal <b>forebrains</b> reliably pumped out NGF, which enhanced the cells’ size {{and their ability to}} sprout new neural fibers. The treatment also rescued vulnerable cells, even if they already showed the trademark signs of Alzheimer’s pathology. In some patients, these beneficial effects lasted almost 10 years after the treatment. Even patients who died responded positively to the therapy. Even pathological cells with protein clumps in their cell bodies and surroundings extended their fibers toward the NGF source, maintained a healthy size and activated pro-survival signals that boosted their stress resilience. Two other patients received direct injections of modified viruses containing the NGF gene directly to their basal <b>forebrains.</b> This allowed the gene to express longer in the brain.|$|R
5|$|The {{developing}} <b>forebrain</b> {{surrounds the}} neural cord. As the <b>forebrain</b> develops, the neural cord within {{it becomes a}} ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid plexus develops, producing and releasing CSF. The CSF quickly fills the neural canal. Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminal}} nerves, olfactory nerves (I) and optic nerves (II) {{emerge from}} the cerebrum or <b>forebrain,</b> and the remaining ten pairs arise from the brainstem, which is {{the lower part of}} the brain.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the <b>forebrain</b> to the {{midbrain}} is the diencephalon (in the diagram, {{this structure}} {{is below the}} optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The pineal body lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{proportions of}} four myelin basic proteins (preL, L, preS,S) were determined in myelin subfractions prepared from the <b>forebrains</b> of quaking and littermate control mice. The distribution pattern of each protein was similar in both mutant and control fractions. The S component {{was the only}} basic protein present in low amounts in myelin from the mutant...|$|R
50|$|Retinoid receptors are nuclear receptors (a {{class of}} proteins) that bind to retinoids. When bound to a retinoid, {{they act as}} {{transcription}} factors, altering the expression of genes with corresponding response elements. Significant age-related declines in the levels of retinoid receptors in the <b>forebrains</b> of rats have been reversed by supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which can restore neurogenesis.|$|R
25|$|Bird {{intelligence}} {{has been studied}} through several attributes and abilities. Many of these studies have been on birds such as quail, domestic fowl and pigeons kept under captive conditions. It has, however, been noted that field studies have been limited, unlike those of the apes. Birds in the crow family (corvids), and parrots (psittacines) {{have been shown to}} live socially, have long developmental periods, and possess large <b>forebrains,</b> and these may be expected to allow for greater cognitive abilities.|$|R
5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the <b>forebrain</b> (prosencephalon); the {{adjoining}} curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The <b>forebrain</b> separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon {{gives rise to the}} cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E
5|$|TBR1 is {{also used}} in {{immunohistochemical}} techniques in neurological research. It {{has been used to}} identify layer VI developing cortical neurons as well as the prethalamic eminence, pallium, and dorsal <b>forebrain.</b> The presence of TBR1 in stem cells responding to telencephalon injury implicates the normal function of these cells in this region of the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is a small}} region at {{the base}} of the <b>forebrain,</b> whose complexity and importance belies its size. It is composed of numerous small nuclei, each with distinct connections and neurochemistry. The hypothalamus is engaged in additional involuntary or partially voluntary acts such as sleep and wake cycles, eating and drinking, and the release of some hormones.|$|E
40|$|Monocularly {{deprived}} kittens {{were compared}} with littermates that had had their eyelids sutured for the same time but that had, in addition, been treated with 6 -hydroxydopamine to deplete their <b>forebrains</b> of catecholamines. The visual cortices of all the catecholamine-depleted kittens showed high proportions of binocular neurons, {{in contrast to the}} control group, most of whose visual cortical neurons were driven exclusively by the nondeprived eye. Catecholamines may {{play an important role in}} the maintenance of cortical plasticity during the critical period...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of excitatory amino acids-(EAA) stimulated inositol phosphates (IPs) turnover during postnatal development {{was investigated in}} synaptoneurosomes prepared from rat <b>forebrains.</b> The two main EAA agonists which induce the IPs synthesis were quisqualate (QA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The QA and NMDA stimulations of IPs formation present a particular developmental pattern, characterized by an active phase during rat synaptogenesis. The QA-evoked IPs accumulation peaked in synaptoneurosomes prepared from 8 -day-old rat <b>forebrains</b> while that evoked by NMDA peaked in synaptoneurosomes from 12 -day-old rats. These two developmental patterns are specific of the EAA agonists since the other various neuroactive substances tested (carbachol (Carb), noradrenaline, and high concentrations of potassium) induced an IPs accumulation, which increases during development and reaches a maximum in synaptoneurosomes of adult animals. Aging leads to {{a decrease in the}} capability of EAAs and muscarinic agonists to stimulate IPs formation in synaptoneurosomes, whereas the stimulation of IPs turnover by noradrenaline remains constant. Taken together, these results suggest that EAAs play a key role during brain development by sequentially activating two receptor subtypes, a new QA receptor, and a NMDA receptor, linked to the phosphoinositide metabolism. They may also indicate that these EAA-induced IPs responses are related to neuronal plastic events, the amplitude of which decreases with aging...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} ethanol on synaptosomal free calcium {{concentration}} ([Ca 2 +]i) and 45 Ca 2 + uptake was studied in vitro. Synaptosomes were prepared from <b>forebrains</b> of adult rats and incubated {{in the presence}} of ethanol 50 500 mM. [Ca 2 +]i determined by means of the Ca 2 +-sensitive dye, fura- 2, was increased by ethanol in polarized and depolarized synaptosomes, whereas 45 Ca 2 + uptake was decreased. The results suggest that ethanol may influence neuronal calcium homeostasis by increasing rather than decreasing [Ca 2 +]i...|$|R
5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the {{olfactory}} lobes, a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the <b>forebrain.</b>|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the <b>forebrain,</b> midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the <b>forebrain</b> splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
5|$|TBR1 was {{identified}} in 1995 by the Nina Ireland Laboratory of Developmental Neurobiology Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The gene, initially named TES-56, {{was found to}} be largely expressed in the telencephalic vesicles of the developing <b>forebrain</b> of mice. The protein product of TES-56 was discovered to be homologous to the Brachyury protein, a T-box transcription factor, which plays a role in establishing symmetry during embryonic development. Thus, due to its relation to T-box genes (such as Tbx-1, Tbx-2, Tbx-3), TES-56 was renamed TBR1.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{in humans}} and animal models link {{maternal}} infection and imbalanced levels of inflammatory mediators in the foetal brain to the aetiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. In {{a number of}} animal models, it was shown that exposure to viral or bacterial agents during a period that corresponds to the second trimester in human gestation triggers brain and behavioural abnormalities in the offspring. However, {{little is known about}} the early cellular and molecular events elicited by inflammation in the foetal brain shortly after maternal infection has occurred. In this study, maternal infection was mimicked by two consecutive intraperitoneal injections of 200 &#x 3 BC;g of LPS (lipopolysaccharide) /kg to timed-pregnant rats at GD 15 (gestational day 15) and GD 16. Increased thickness of the CP (cortical plate) and hippocampus together with abnormal distribution of immature neuronal markers and decreased expression of markers for neural progenitors were observed in the LPS-exposed foetal <b>forebrains</b> at GD 18. Such effects were accompanied by decreased levels of reelin and the radial glial marker GLAST (glial glutamate transporter), and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in maternal serum and foetal <b>forebrains.</b> Foetal inflammation elicited by maternal injections of LPS has discrete detrimental effects on brain development. The early biochemical and morphological changes described in this work begin to explain the sequelae of early events that underlie the neurobehavioural deficits reported in humans and animals exposed to prenatal insults...|$|R
40|$|Radial glia {{function}} during CNS development both as neural progenitors {{and as a}} scaffolding supporting neuronal migration. To elucidate pathways {{involved in}} these functions, we mapped in vivo the promoter for Blbp, a radial glial gene. We show here that a binding site for the Notch effector CBF 1 is essential for all Blbp transcription in radial glia, and that BLBP expression is significantly reduced in the <b>forebrains</b> of mice lacking the Notch 1 and Notch 3 receptors. These results identify Blbp as the first predominantly CNS-specific Notch target gene and suggest that it mediates some aspects of Notch signaling in radial glia...|$|R
40|$|A protein with an {{apparent}} molecular size of 490 kDa {{was found in}} the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction iso-lated from porcine cerebral cortices and rat <b>forebrains,</b> and this 490 kDa protein accounted for 3 % of the total protein of these samples. Matrix-assisted laser desorp-tion ionization-time of flight mass spectrometric and Western blotting analyses consistently indicated that this 490 kDa protein consisted primarily of the heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein (cDHC). Immunocytochemical analy-ses showed that cDHC was found in 92 % and 89 % of the phalloidin-positive protrusions that were themselves associated with discrete clusters of synaptophysin, a presynaptic terminal marker, and PSD- 95, a postsynap-tic marker, on neuronal processes, respectively. Quanti-tative Western blotting analyses of various subcellula...|$|R
5|$|The {{basal ganglia}} are {{a group of}} {{interconnected}} structures in the <b>forebrain.</b> The primary function of the basal ganglia appears to be action selection: they send inhibitory signals to {{all parts of the}} brain that can generate motor behaviors, and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition, so that the action-generating systems are able to execute their actions. Reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the basal ganglia.|$|E
5|$|Size, however, is not {{the only}} difference: there are also {{substantial}} differences in shape. The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the <b>forebrain,</b> which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. The cerebral cortex is {{the part of the brain}} that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex. Several areas at the edge of the neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebral}} {{region of}} the brain is separated {{from the rest of}} the brain by a distinct compression caused in the endocranial cavity. The rearmost part of the cerebral {{region of the}} braincase has a top with a small expansion. This is different from Jainosaurus. However, relatively much larger expansions are known in the diplodocoid sauropods Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus. In MCCM-HUE-8741, the small opening in the skull roof middle is responsible for a swelling on the endocast that is suggestive of a pineal system. It is in the exact position where the pineal gland is expected to have been, between the <b>forebrain</b> and the midbrain.|$|E
40|$|Testicular orphan nuclear {{receptor}} 4 (TR 4) {{has been}} suggested to play important roles in the develop-ment and functioning of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). We find reduced myelination in TR 4 knockout (TR 4 /) mice, which is particularly obvious in fore-brains and in early developmental stages. Further analysis reveals that CC- 1 -positive (CC- 1) oligo-dendrocytes are decreased in TR 4 / <b>forebrains.</b> The O 4 signals are also reduced in TR 4 / fore-brains when examined at postnatal d 7. However, the number and proliferation rate of platelet-derived growth factor receptor -positive (PDGFR) oligo-dendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) remain unaf-fected in these regions, suggesting that loss of TR 4 interrupts oligodendrocyte differentiation.

40|$|The authors {{explored}} {{the possibility that}} there are different neural consequences, beyond the primary site of brain damage, following perirhinal cortex (PRh) lesions made in different ways. Fos expression was used as a marker for neuronal activation and compared across the <b>forebrains</b> of rats that underwent the different types of surgery. Electrolytic and excitotoxic PRh lesions produced dramatic increases in Fos expression in the cortex, and excitotoxic and aspiration PRh lesions increased Fos expression in the dentate gyrus. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that different lesion methods have separable effects on neural function in regions outside the lesion site that could account for inconsistencies in the literature regarding the behavioral effects of PRh lesions on tests of spatial memory...|$|R

5|$|The {{olfactory}} system {{is made up}} in part of the RMS which stretches from the subventricular zone in {{the wall of the}} lateral ventricle, through the basal <b>forebrain,</b> to the olfactory bulb (OB). VONS is the name given to this pathway, and it consists of the subventricular zone, the RMS, the olfactory tract and the olfactory bulb. Developing neurons leave the subventricular zone and enter the RMS and travel caudally and ventrally along the undersurface of the caudate nucleus; this {{is referred to as the}} descending limb. Upon reaching the ventral side of the caudate nucleus, the neurons follow the rostral limb and travel ventrally and rostrally, entering the anterior olfactory cortex (AOC). The AOC gives rise to the olfactory tract, which ends in the olfactory bulb.|$|E
5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the <b>forebrain</b> and is the most complex and most recent {{evolutionary}} development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the <b>forebrain,</b> midbrain and hindbrain. Neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest. The neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E
40|$|AbstractNogoA, a myelin-associated component, {{inhibits}} neurite outgrowth. Nogo 66, {{a portion}} of NogoA, binds to Nogo 66 receptor (NgR) and induces the inhibitory signaling. LINGO- 1 and p 75 neurotrophin receptor (p 75), the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor, are also required for NogoA signaling. However, signaling mechanisms downstream to Nogo receptor remain poorly understood. Here, we observed that NgR and p 75 were colocalized in low-density membrane raft fractions derived from <b>forebrains</b> and cerebella {{as well as from}} cerebellar granule cells. NgR interacted with p 75 in lipid rafts. In addition, disruption of lipid rafts by β-methylcyclodextrin, a cholesterol-binding reagent, reduced the Nogo 66 signaling. Our results suggest an important role of lipid rafts in facilitating the interaction between NgRs and provide insight into mechanisms underlying the inhibition of neurite outgrowth by NogoA...|$|R
40|$|Danger {{and harm}} are avoided by {{strategic}} decisions made {{at all three}} levels of the triune forebrain: rational (neomammalian), emotional (paleomammalian), and instinctive (reptilian). This applies also to potential harm from conspecifics, {{which leads to a}} choice between escalating and de-escalating strategies. Anxiety is a component of de-escalating strategies mediated by the paleomammalian and reptilian <b>forebrains.</b> When the neomammalian (rational) brain fails to deal with the threat of conspecific danger, these more primitive de-escalating strategies may be activated and may present as anxiety disorders. The capacity for concealment of anxiety and other forms of negative affect has also evolved, and excessive concealment may lead to psychopaihology by breaking the negative feedback loop of excessive motivation, leading to impaired performance, leading to signals of distress, and leading to reduced exhortation to succeed on the part of parents and teachers; this situation is illustrated by a model based on the Yerkes-Dodson law...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that chronic hypoxia disrupts mitochondrial function via oxidative stress in fetal organs. Pregnant guinea pig sows {{were exposed to}} either normoxia or hypoxia (10. 5 % O 2, 14 days) in {{the presence or absence}} of the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Near-term anesthetized fetuses were delivered via hysterotomy, and fetal livers, hearts, lungs, and <b>forebrains</b> harvested. We quantified the effects of chronic hypoxia on cytochrome oxidase (CCO) activity and 2 factors known to regulate CCO activity: malondialdehyde (MDA) and CCO subunit 4 (COX 4). Hypoxia increased the MDA levels in fetal liver, heart, and lung with a corresponding reduction in CCO activity, prevented by prenatal NAC. The COX 4 expression paralleled CCO activity in fetal liver and lung, but was unaltered in fetal hearts due to hypoxia. Hypoxia reduced the brain COX 4 expression despite having no effect on CCO activity. This study identifies the mitochondrion as an important target site in tissue-specific oxidative stress for the induction of fetal hypoxic injury...|$|R
