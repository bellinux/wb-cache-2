5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> with them, but their diet in nature {{consists}} {{almost entirely of}} grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E
5|$|With a more {{streamlined}} form {{than other}} nurse sharks, the {{tawny nurse shark}} {{is believed to be}} a less benthic, more active swimmer. The characteristics of its body, head, fins, and teeth are comparable to other active reef sharks sharing its range, such as the sicklefin lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Tawny nurse sharks are primarily nocturnal, though they are said to be active at all hours off Madagascar, and in captivity they will become diurnally active <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> with food. During the day, groups of two dozen or more sharks can be found resting inside caves and under ledges, often stacked atop one another. Individual sharks have small home ranges that they consistently return to each day.|$|E

25|$|Along with dingos, {{introduced}} {{species such as}} foxes, feral cats, and both domestic and feral dogs, {{pose a threat to}} kangaroo populations. Kangaroos and wallabies are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> with the option. If pursued into the water, a large kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it. Another defensive tactic described by witnesses is catching the attacking dog with the forepaws and disembowelling it with the hind legs.|$|E
25|$|Later onset {{forms of}} OTC {{deficiency}} can have variable presentations. Although late onset {{forms of the}} disease are often considered milder than the classic infantile presentation, any affected individual is at risk for an episode of hyperammonemia that could still be life-threatening, <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> with the appropriate stressors. These patients will often present with headaches, nausea, vomiting, delayed growth {{and a variety of}} psychiatric symptoms (confusion, delirium, aggression, or self-injury). A detailed dietary history of an affected individual with undiagnosed OTC deficiency will often reveal a history of protein avoidance.|$|E
25|$|None {{of these}} bills were {{important}} enough to dissolve parliament and seek a new mandate at a general election. Asquith and Lloyd George believed the peers would back down <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> with Liberal objectives contained within a finance bill—the Lords had not obstructed a money bill since the 17th century, and after initially blocking Gladstone's attempt (as chancellor) to repeal Paper Duties, had yielded in 1861 when it was submitted again in a finance bill. Accordingly, the Liberal leadership expected that after much objection from the Tory peers, the Lords would yield to policy changes wrapped within a budget bill.|$|E
50|$|Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) {{is used in}} the United States {{and most}} {{commonly}} refers to the solar energy transmittance of a window or door as a whole, factoring in the glass, frame material (wood, aluminum, etc.), sash (<b>if</b> <b>present),</b> divided lite bars (<b>if</b> <b>present)</b> and screens (<b>if</b> <b>present).</b> SHGC may also refer to the solar energy transmittance of the glass alone (sometimes more specifically termed center-of-glass SHGC), in which case it is analogous to g-value.|$|R

25|$|In June 1896, Ghenadie {{received}} {{an order from}} the Attorney General to vacate the Metropolitan's Palace. He objected, arguing that the Synod had broken the governing law, and stating that he would only leave <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> with a Royal Decree. As a consequence, Ghenadie {{was taken into custody}} by the authorities, driven out of the Palace through a side door, and taken by Romanian Police carriage to Căldărușani Monastery, where his banishment came in effect. Reportedly, the prosecutors caused embarrassment when they also proceeded to evacuate Ghenadie's friends and supporters, including Conservative politico Lascăr Catargiu, out of the repossessed building. A while after, Carol signed a Royal Decree confirming his government's decision, and the interim leadership was left to a triumvirate of bishops: Partenie Clinceni, Iosif Naniescu, Gherasim Timuș.|$|E
500|$|A common {{example of}} synesthesia is the {{association}} between graphemes and colors, usually referred to as grapheme-color synesthesia. Here, {{letters of the alphabet}} are associated with vivid experiences of color. Studies have indicated that the perceived color is context-dependent and is determined by the extracted meaning of a stimulus. For example, an ambiguous stimulus '5' that can be interpreted either as 'S' or '5' will have the color associated with 'S' or with '5', depending on the context in which it is presented. <b>If</b> <b>presented</b> among numbers, it will be interpreted as '5' and will associate the respective color. <b>If</b> <b>presented</b> among letters, it will be interpreted as 'S' and will associate the respective synesthetic color.|$|E
500|$|Until he read Warner's Cricket Between Two Wars {{during the}} Second World War, Fingleton was unaware that Warner {{assumed he was}} {{responsible}} for the leak. When he found out, Fingleton wrote to Warner, who replied that although he believed Fingleton to be the source, he would publish a correction <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> with evidence to the contrary. Fingleton did not pursue the case. Australian cricketer Bill O'Reilly wrote that during the 1948 tour of England, he and Fingleton confronted Warner, who apologised as he no longer believed Fingleton to be the culprit. Fingleton thought the belief he was responsible cost him a place on the 1934 tour to England, although there were other possible factors in his exclusion. According to Fingleton, Woodfull later told him that the controversy had led to his missing selection. A letter which Woodfull wrote to Fingleton in 1943 stated [...] "I can assure you that I did not connect your name with the passing on of that conversation." ...|$|E

500|$|On 22 December Dönitz ordered Bey to {{be ready}} to go to sea on a three-hour notice. Later that day, {{reconnaissance}} aircraft located a convoy of some 20 transports escorted by cruisers and destroyers approximately [...] west of Tromsø. The convoy was spotted again two days later, and it was determined that the course was definitively toward the Soviet Union. A U-boat reported the convoy's location at 09:00 on 25 December, and Dönitz ordered Scharnhorst into action. In his instructions to Bey, Dönitz advised him to break off the engagement <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> with superior forces, but to remain aggressive. Bey planned to attack the convoy at 10:00 on 26 December if the conditions were favorable for the attack. At this time of year, there was only 45minutes of full daylight and six hours of twilight, which significantly limited Bey's operational freedom. The Germans were concerned with developments in Allied radar-directed fire control, which allowed British battleships to fire with great accuracy in the darkness; German radar capabilities lagged behind those of their opponents.|$|E
500|$|A major issue, {{going into}} the 1896 {{election}} cycle, was {{the question of the}} currency. [...] The United States, since 1873, had effectively been on the gold standard—the metal, <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> to the government, would be assayed and struck into coin for a slight charge to cover expenses. [...] Silver, on the other hand, though widely mined, could not be presented for conversion into coin, but had to be sold as a commodity. [...] The gold standard was unpopular in many agricultural and mining areas, as the quantity of gold available limited the money supply, making it difficult for farmers to obtain loans and pay debts. [...] Advocates of the free and unlimited coinage of silver believed that doing so would cure the country's economic malaise by increasing the money supply. [...] Advocates of the gold standard argued that a [...] "free silver" [...] policy (sometimes called [...] "bimetallism") would inflate the currency, and lead to difficulties in international trade with nations on the gold standard. [...] At the time, the precious metal in a silver dollar was worth about $0.53, and under such proposals, silver worth that much would be returned to depositors as a one-dollar coin, [...] "free"—that is, without a charge for the Mint's costs for assaying and coining.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of the five-cent copper-nickel piece greatly decreased the popularity {{and use of the}} three-cent piece. The three-cent piece had debuted in 1865 with a mintage of over eleven million and nearly five million in 1866; thereafter strikings declined, falling to under a million by 1871, a figure the coin would thereafter exceed only twice. The public had preferred small bronze coins to paper money, then the three-cent nickel piece rather than the bronze; they now preferred the five-cent nickel to the three. One reason for this was that the base metal five-cent piece would be redeemed by the government <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> in $100 lots pursuant to a provision in the authorizing legislation. There was no such provision for the three-cent nickel piece; neither was there any for the other base metal coins. Following Pollock's resignation in 1866 over his objections to President Johnson's Reconstruction policies, the new Mint Director was Henry Linderman, who in his first annual report in 1867, described the redemption clause in the nickel's authorizing legislation as [...] "a most wise and just provision", urging its extension to the cent, two-cent piece, and three-cent piece. Postmasters were compelled to take three-cent nickel pieces in exchange for stamps, but had difficulty in depositing them in the Treasury in payment of their obligations, as the government would take no more than sixty cents worth of them in a single transaction. Private individuals and firms similarly refused them beyond the legal tender limit; those with a surplus of base metal coins often sold them at a discount.|$|E

2500|$|Like Wilko, it {{had been}} appealed from the Second Circuit, where William Timbers, who had argued before the Court for the SEC as amicus in Wilko, wrote for a panel that {{reversed}} the district court's holding that the 1934 Act claims were arbitrable. He allowed that the Allegaert precedent he upheld might not survive higher review.

2500|$|It took a {{year from}} Byrd {{for one of the}} {{circuits}} to consider one of these cases. In McMahon v. Shearson/American Express, the Second Circuit followed the Supreme Court in ordering state-law claims arbitrated and the federal ones litigated. It believed that public policy and precedent were on the side of resolving the latter judicially. [...] "Although Scherk and Byrd may cast some doubt on whether the Supreme Court, <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> with the issue, would hold [...] claims ... to be non-arbitrable," [...] wrote William Homer Timbers, [...] "it would be improvident for us to disregard clear judicial precedent in this Circuit based on mere speculation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins [...] (1938), {{overruled}} earlier precedent, {{and held}} [...] "There is no federal general common law," [...] thus confining {{the federal courts}} to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. E.g., Texas Industries v. Radcliff, [...] (without an express grant of statutory authority, federal courts cannot create rules of intuitive justice, for example, a right to contribution from co-conspirators). Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule <b>if</b> <b>presented</b> with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of banknotes, precious or semi-precious metals minted into coins to certify their substance were widely used as a medium of exchange. The value that people attributed to coins was originally based upon the value of the metal unless they were token issues or had been debased. Banknotes were originally a claim for the coins held by the bank, but due to the ease with which they could be transferred and the confidence that people had in the capacity of the bank to settle the notes in coin <b>if</b> <b>presented,</b> they became a popular means of exchange in their own right. They now make up a very small proportion of the [...] "money" [...] that people think that they have as demand deposit bank accounts and electronic payments have negated the need to carry notes and coins.|$|E
