5000|$|An <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connection</b> {{may exist}} with Aβ and C fibers, which may form a synapse {{on the same}} {{projection}} neuron. The same neurons may also form synapses with an inhibitory interneuron that also synapses on the projection neuron, reducing the chance that the latter will fire and transmit pain stimuli to the brain (image on the right). The inhibitory interneuron fires spontaneously. [...] The C fiber's synapse would inhibit the inhibitory interneuron, indirectly increasing the projection neuron's chance of firing. The Aβ fiber, on the other hand, forms an excitatory connection with the inhibitory interneuron, thus decreasing the projection neuron's chance of firing (like the C fiber, the Aβ fiber also has an excitatory connection on the projection neuron itself). Thus, depending on the relative rates of firing of C and Aβ fibers, the firing of the nonnociceptive fiber may inhibit the firing of the projection neuron and the transmission of pain stimuli.|$|E

Here we analyzed the lateral connectivity that links neighboring columns in layer 2 / 3, which is necessary for integrating information across whiskers.

Since swimming is the main functional behaviour of the animal at the considered stage of development, we expect that its stability region would most likely occupy a large area in parameter space. Therefore, we first study bifurcations under variation of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connection</b> strength w_inh. We then study codimension-two bifurcations by varying w_inh together with either w_ampa or w_nmda (Sect.  3.4).

It is interesting that double coherence resonance (DCR) with the combination of synaptic input correlation and noise intensity is finally attained after the processing layer by layer in FFNs.

40|$|A {{number of}} memory {{models have been}} proposed. These all have the basic structurethat {{excitatory}} neurons are reciprocally connected by recurrent connections togetherwith the connections with inhibitory neurons, which yields associative memory (i. e.,pattern completion) and successive retrieval of memory. In most of the models, asimple mathematical model for a neuron {{in the form of}} a discrete map is adopted. It has not, however, been clarified whether behaviors like associative memory andsuccessive retrieval of memory appear when a biologically plausible neuron modelis used. In this paper, we propose a network model for associative memory andsuccessive retrieval of memory based on Pinsky-Rinzel neurons. The state of patterncompletion in associative memory can be observed with an appropriate balanceof excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connection</b> strengths. Increasing of the connectionstrength of inhibitory interneurons changes the state of memory retrieval from associativememory to successive retrieval of memory. We investigate this transition...|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{we studied}} {{a family of}} {{balanced}} excitatory–inhibitory firing rate networks that satisfy Dale’s law for arbitrary network size N. When there is no variance in synaptic connections—each excitatory connection has strength μ_E/√(N), and each <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connection</b> has strength μ_I/√(N)—we find a family of deterministic solutions whose existence can be inferred from the underlying symmetry structure of the network. These solutions persist in the dynamics of networks with quenched variability—that is, variance in the connection strengths— even when the variance is large enough that the envelope of the spectrum of the connectivity matrix approaches that of a Gaussian matrix. This offers a striking example in which linear stability theory is not useful in predicting transitions between dynamical regimes. Given the increasing interest in network science and, in particular, networked dynamical systems, such observations concerning the impact of symmetry of connectivity can be extremely valuable for studying stability, bifurcations, and reduced-order models.|$|E
5000|$|Neuregulin 1 {{is thought}} {{to play a role}} in {{synaptic}} plasticity. It has been shown that a loss of Neuregulin 1 within cortical projection neurons results in increased <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connections</b> and reduced synaptic plasticity. [...] Similarly, overexpression of Neuregulin 1 results in disrupted excitatory-inhibitory connections, reduced synaptic plasticity, and abnormal dendritic spine growth. Mutations in human L1 cell adhesion molecules are reported to cause a number of neuronal disorders. In addition, recent research in Drosophila model has also shown Nrg's involvement in regulating dendritic pruning in ddaC neurons in a Rab5/ESCRT-mediated endocytic pathway. Thus, careful regulation of the amount of Neuregulin 1 must be maintained in order to preserve an intricate balance between excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connections</b> within the central nervous system (CNS). Any disruption in this inhibitory system may contribute to impaired synaptic plasticity, a symptom endemic in schizophrenic patients.|$|R

To gain insight on connections and functional interactions between intrinsic SG neurons, simultaneous tight-seal, whole-cell recordings were made from pairs of neurons in rat spinal cord slices to examine whether impulses in one cell generated synaptic activity in the other. Most SG neuron pairs sampled lacked synaptic interaction. Those showing a linkage included a recurring pattern consisting of a monosynaptic, bicucullinesensitive <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connection</b> from an islet cell to a transient central neuron, each of which received direct excitatory input from different afferent C-fibers.

40|$|The cytoarchitectonic {{similarities}} {{of different}} neocortical regions have {{given rise to}} the idea of 'canonical' connectivity between excitatory neurons of different layers within a column. It is unclear whether similarly general organizational principles also exist for inhibitory neocortical circuits. Here we delineate and compare local inhibitory-to-excitatory wiring patterns in all principal layers of primary motor (M 1), somatosensory (S 1) and visual (V 1) cortex, using genetically targeted photostimulation in a mouse knock-in line that conditionally expresses channelrhodopsin- 2 in GABAergic neurons. Inhibitory inputs to excitatory neurons derived largely from the same cortical layer within a three-column diameter. However, subsets of pyramidal cells in layers 2 / 3 and 5 B received extensive translaminar inhibition. These neurons were prominent in V 1, where they might correspond to complex cells, less numerous in barrel cortex and absent in M 1.

40|$|A major {{function}} of central nervous systems is to discriminate different categories or types of sensory input. Neuronal networks accomplish such tasks by learning different sensory maps at several stages of neural hierarchy, such that different neurons fire selectively to reflect different {{internal or external}} patterns and states. The exact mechanisms of such map formation processes in the brain are not completely understood. Here we study the mechanism by which a simple recurrent/reentrant neuronal network accomplish group selection and discrimination to different inputs in order to generate sensory maps. We describe the conditions and mechanism of transition from a rhythmic epileptic state (in which all neurons fire synchronized and indiscriminately to any input) to a winner-take-all state in which only a subset of neurons fire for a specific input. We prove an analytic condition under which a stable bump solution and a winner-take-all state can emerge from the local recurrent excitation-inhibition interactions in a three-layer spiking network with distinct excitatory and inhibitory populations, and demonstrate the importance of surround <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connection</b> topology on the stability of dynamic patterns in spiking neural network...|$|E

40|$|People {{with autism}} {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) tend to detect lo-cal patterns of visual stimuli {{more quickly than}} global patterns, which is opposite to the behavior of typically developing peo-ple.

Stronger <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connections</b> could diminish the neural activities and thus prevent global fea-ture integration, whereas properly balanced connections would enable the cortex to detect features of any size.

Asynchronous Boolean modelling of the network was used to compare simulation results with reported experimental observations.

The revised gene regulatory network reproduced previously observed cell state switches between progenitor cells observed in knock-out animal models or in experiments where the transcription factors were overexpressed. Furthermore the network predicted the inhibition of Irx 3 by Nkx 2. 2 and this prediction was tested experimentally.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the balance in inhibitory and excitatory couplings in the brain has increasingly been realized. Despite the key role played by inhibitory-excitatory couplings in the functioning of brain networks, {{the impact of a}} balanced condition on the stability properties of underlying networks remains largely unknown. We investigate properties of the largest eigenvalues of networks having such couplings, and find that they follow completely different statistics when in the balanced situation. Based on numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the transition from Weibull to Fréchet via the Gumbel distribution can be controlled by the variance of the column sum of the adjacency matrix, which depends monotonically on the denseness of the underlying network. As a balanced condition is imposed, the largest real part of the eigenvalue emulates a transition to the generalized extreme value statistics, independent of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connection</b> probability. Furthermore, the transition to the Weibull statistics and the small-world transition occur at the same rewiring probability, reflecting a more stable system. Comment: 7 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{mathematical}} model describing the generation and propagation of epileptiform activity in a cerebral cortical network is presented. The model consists {{of a system of}} nonlinear delay differential equations. Physiological properties are taken into account as nonlinear transmission of signals at the synapse, temporal and spatial summation of incoming signals at the soma, active membrane characteristics, and dendritic and axonal propagation times. The influence of the connectivity and the temporal parameters on the oscillatory properties of the model is studied. The computer simulations are in agreement with experimental observations in cortical networks: whereas a weak excitatory or strong inhibitory synaptic connection strength produces a stationary status with short-lasting responses to external stimuli, increases in excitation or decreases in inhibition induce spontaneous and stimulus-evoked rhythmic discharges. Synaptic burst-like activity is observed only for an intermediate range of excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connection</b> strengths and external inputs. The form and duration of the bursts can also be controlled by the temporal parameters.

Here, we recorded from individual nucleus isthmi pars parvocellu-laris (Ipc) neurons in the turtle eye-attached whole-brain preparation {{in response to a}} range of computer-generated visual stimuli. Ipc neurons responded to a variety of moving or flashing stimuli as long as those stimuli were small. When mapped with a moving spot, the excitatory receptive field was of circular Gaussian shape with an average half-width of less than 3. We found no evidence for directional sensitivity. For moving spots of varying sizes, the measured Ipc response-size profile was repro-duced by the linear Difference-of-Gaussian model, which is consistent with the superposition of a narrow excitatory center and an inhibitory surround. Intracellular Ipc recordings revealed a strong <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connection</b> from the nucleus isthmi pars magnocellularis (Imc), which has the anatomical feature to provide a broad inhibitory projection.

40|$|Whether {{the timing}} of action {{potentials}} in the brain is semi-random, or is a “temporal code” that carries information, is a long-standing debate in neuroscience. One potential form of temporal coding is sharp synchrony between action potentials in different neurons, at the near-millisecond or sub-millisecond scale. Such synchrony has been observed in a few brain areas (retina, thalamus, cortex), and has been attributed either to electrical coupling by gap junctions or to shared excitatory inputs. Theoretical studies and computer models suggest that precise synchrony can also arise from reciprocal inhibitory synapses; however, {{this has not been}} confirmed experimentally. We recorded simultaneous spike trains from pairs of mouse cortical inhibitory interneurons connected by inhibitory synapses, either during epochs of network activity, or when the two interneurons were depolarized in isolation, and observed precise, sub-millisecond firing synchrony, even when the neurons were not coupled electrically. The degree of synchrony correlated with the strength of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connection,</b> and synchrony persisted when ionotropic glutamate receptors were blocked but was strongly reduced by blocking GABAA receptors.

40|$|Abstract. We {{studied the}} {{dynamics}} of a neural network that has both recurrent excitatory and random <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connections.</b> Neurons started to become active when a relatively weak transient excitatory signal was presented and the activity was sustained due to the recurrent excitatory connections.

The random <b>inhibitory</b> <b>connections</b> modulated the activity patterns of neurons so that the patterns evolved without recurrence with time. Hence, a time passage between the onsets of the two transient signals was represented by the sequence of activity patterns.
