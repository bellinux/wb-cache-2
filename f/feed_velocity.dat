At low pressure, low feed concentration, and high <b>feed</b> <b>velocity,</b> concentration polarisation effects are minimal and flux is almost proportional to trans-membrane pressure difference. However, in the high pressure range, flux becomes almost independent of applied pressure. Deviation from linear flux-pressure relation is due to concentration polarisation.

30|$|Raster path {{is usually}} adopted for the {{fabrication}} of square-shaped optics. During polishing with raster path, the tool feeds along {{a straight line}} and then translates to another parallel line. This process is repeated to cover the whole surface. The pitch between adjacent path lines is commonly set identical (i.e. uniform pitch) on the whole surface, and the <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> along each path is instantaneously controlled based on the local removal [14]. It is obvious that for a uniform removal map of a certain removal amount, the smaller the path pitch, the larger the <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity.</b> However, if the desired <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> {{is larger than the}} largest one allowed by the machine, the actual <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> has to be changed to the largest one, which will introduce extra dwell time leading to material over-removal. As the tool feeds fast at lower region while slowly at higher region with the uniform pitch path, the smallest removal region (lowest region) will commonly bring with such over-removal. Since, the decreased pitch is propitious to restraint of MSF errors [15]. On the other hand, the decreased pitch will greatly increase over-removal especially in the lowest region deteriorating the form correction precision. Hence, it is needed to develop an optimized tool path planning method which can solve this problem.|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to study the {{influence}} of cutting conditions - cutting speed, <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> and feed per tooth - on tool life and surface finish of the workpiece in the face milling of flat surfaces. Aiming to achieve this goal, several milling experiments were carried out with different cutting speeds, feed velocities and feeds per tooth.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} for choosing the optimal load resistance, <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> and residence time for a reverse electrodialysis stack based on minimizing the levelized cost of electricity. The optimal load resistance maximizes the gross stack power density and results from a trade-off between stack voltage and stack current. The primary trade-off governing the optimal <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> is between stack pumping power losses, which reduce the net power density and concentration polarization losses, which reduce the gross stack power density. Lastly, the primary trade-off governing the optimal residence time is between the capital costs of the stack and pretreatment system.

Under ultrasonic irradiation, changes and damages in membrane structure were found on PVDF membrane, while the pore size and the stretching strain of PP fibers were also enlarged and declined, respectively. The PTFE hollow fiber was selected to carry out USDCMD. The results showed that ultrasonic irradiation could effectively enhance mass transfer. Under the ultrasonic irradiation of 20 kHz and 260 W, the maximum permeate flux enhancement of 60 % was obtained under conditions of feed temperature of 53 degrees C, <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> of 025 m/s and feed salt concentration of 140 g/L.

A series of particles with their densities ranging from 760 kg/m 3 to 1380 kg/m 3 were fed into the Vorsyl separator with water by means of tangential inlet. The simulation showed that the feed materials acquired centrifugal force which allows most portion of the particles with a density less than water {{to move to the}} center of the separator, enter the vortex finder and leave the separator through the bottom outlet. While the particles heavier than water move to the wall, reach the throat area and leave the separator through the side outlet. The particles were thus separated and particles collected at the bottom outlet are pure and clean. The influence of particle density on separation efficiency was investigated which demonstrated a positive correlation of the separation efficiency with increasing density difference between medium liquid and the particle. In addition, the influence of the split ratio on the performance was studied which showed that the separation efficiency of the Vorsyl separator can be improved by the increase of split ratio.

40|$|In {{recent years}} various {{simulation}} tools {{with which the}} <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> can be optimized {{have been developed for}} an efficient milling of complex components. Hitherto, the material removal rate has been calculated and the respective commands in the NC-program have been adapted. Further approaches include the mechanical tool load which is determined analytically. Equally, the material removal rate has a significant influence on the thermal tool load. This paper describes an approach with which both the mechanical as well as the thermal load is calculated for a given NC-tool path. If a certain value is overstepped, the <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> is reduced respectively. As a result the <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> is optimally adjusted to the engagement conditions. In addition, the calculation of the wear is carried out. In cutting experiments with Ck 45 and Inconef 718 it was possible to reduce the primary processing time significantly. Furthermore, regarding Ck 45 it was possible to predict the wear with a small fault tolerance. Concerning that NC-speed already assures a maximum economy of time for machining of 20 % compared to a not optimized NC-Code, this clarifies the achieved results. Against this background it seems not negative at all, that the tool wear is not reduced through the integration of technology inside the optimization, Furthermore it has to be stated positively that the tool wear does not rise despite the significant decreased machining time. Another objective of the cutting experiment was the verification of the calculated tool wear with the measured one. It may declared, that the results are in good agreement for the fourth and the fifth section of the cutting edge. However, generally the cutting experiment shows that a prediction of the tool wear is possible with a sufficient accuracy for deciding if a tool change is necessary or not. Thus the achieved benefit may help to improve the process reliability and reduce the tool costs. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|E

The dispersion of values for m {{can be explained by the}} diversity of mechanisms and the mean flow parameters, as well as differences in experimental methods (Shook and Roco 1991). However, this effect will be up to a certain velocity and afterwards the erosion rate would increase only slightly.

Brittle particles break intensely upon impact with the target material, which causes a sharp decline in the value of exponent m.|$|E
30|$|The AFM is {{controlled}} to scan with a setting scan size regularly. As shown in Figure  1 c, the AFM tip {{moves from the}} initial position (denoted by 1) to the end position (denoted by 2) to achieve one scanning cycle.

Two conditions can be generated: the stage moves {{in the same direction}} with the tip <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> (V tip); the stage moves in the opposite direction to the tip <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> (V tip). The scan size of AFM and the displacement moved by the high-precision stage are to control the width and the length of the nanochannel, respectively.

30|$|In summary, {{this letter}} {{presents}} an AFM-based nanomachining method to fabricate nanochannels with ladder nanostructure at the bottom. The ladder nanostructures {{can be obtained}} by continuous scanning of the AFM tip according to the matching relation of the velocities of the tip feeding and the precision stage moving. With the high-precision stage moving in the same direction with the tip <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity,</b> the tip <b>feed</b> can hardly reach as large as the value to ensure the cutting state playing a main role in the scratching test. Simultaneously, in this condition, when the stage moving velocity is larger than the tip <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity,</b> the nanochannel cannot be obtained due to extremely small attack angle in the machining process and the materials cannot be effectively removed. On the contrary, when the stage moves opposite to the feeding direction, an appropriate feed value can be easily achieved. Moreover, the edge of the tip {{plays an important role in}} the scratching tests. The materials are mainly removed by the cutting state in this condition resulting in good surface quality. The perfect nanochannel with ladder nanostructure at the bottom can be obtained under this condition. Moreover, a large scale of the length of 500  μm and the width of 10  μm of such kind of nanochannel is machined successfully using this novel method.|$|R
