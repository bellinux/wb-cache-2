5|$|After the election, the Conservative {{party were}} charged with {{improper}} election spending, {{in a case that}} became known as the In and Out scandal. It <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> for years, but in 2012 they took a plea deal, admitting both improper spending and falsifying records to hide it.|$|E
5|$|This dilemma was {{to result}} in another costly delay for the company, as Brunel's {{negotiations}} with the Bristol Dock Board <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> for months.

5|$|This {{plan was}} {{affected}} by {{the needs of the}} war. As the fighting <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been stripped to a total less than half that of Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E

5|$|As {{that battle}} on the Somme <b>dragged</b> <b>on,</b> the Canadian Corps {{was brought up}} and the AIF was {{withdrawn}} from the line to re-organise and reform, having suffered almost 23,000 casualties {{over the course of}} the 45 days that they had been involved. The 5th Division had been so badly mauled, having been incapacitated by the losses they had suffered at Fromelles, that it was not until October that the 5th Division finally returned to the line and joined the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions on the Somme near Flers.|$|E
5|$|As the 11th New York Regiment had {{experienced}} first hand, the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861 {{had taken a}} heavy toll on Union forces, including those from New York City. As the war <b>dragged</b> <b>on,</b> a military manpower shortage occurred in the Union and Congress passed the first conscription act in United States history on March 3, 1863, authorizing the President to draft male citizens {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35 for a three-year term of military service.|$|E
5|$|As the {{libel suit}} against Marshall <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> in Mercer County Circuit Court, Innes {{and his allies}} hired author William Littell to publish Innes' version of his {{interactions}} with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most popular history of Kentucky at the time. When Street returned to Kentucky to give a deposition in the case in 1814, Innes swore out a writ against him to collect the damages awarded in his case against Street. Unable to pay, Street was imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|During her trials, UB-7 {{developed}} a leak which {{took some time}} to repair. In the meantime, she was assigned the Austrian number of U-7 and an Austrian commander. Her German crew at Pola—since it was still the intent for UB-7 {{to be transferred to}} the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms. As time <b>dragged</b> <b>on,</b> the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austrian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E

5|$|Operation Chronicle, the {{landings}} at Kiriwina and Woodlark Islands, was the VII Amphibious Force's first operation, presented {{no great}} difficulty as the islands {{were known to}} be unoccupied. However half the assault troops experienced seasickness, problems were encountered with clearing the sand bar at the entrance to Guasopa Harbor, and Barbey's decision to land at night and withdraw before dawn in order to avoid encountering Japanese aircraft highlighted the inexperience of his crews and deficiencies in their training. Unloading activities on the coral-fringed Kiriwina <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> for a fortnight.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Solachon {{was fought}} in 586 CE in {{northern}} Mesopotamia between the East Roman (Byzantine) forces, led by Philippicus, and the Sassanid Persians under Kardarigan. The engagement {{was part of}} the long and inconclusive Byzantine–Sassanid War of 572–591. The Battle of Solachon ended in a major Byzantine victory which improved the Byzantine position in Mesopotamia, but it was not in the end decisive. The war <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> until 591, when it ended with a negotiated settlement between Maurice and the Persian shah KhosrauII (r. 590–628).|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} control {{was not without}} dispute, however, with both Vale Royal Abbey and St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester {{claiming}} the valuable church advowson. Legal action <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> for some years, before Vale Royal Abbey ultimately prevailed. Control was also challenged by the Crown itself in 1398, and by Strata Florida Abbey in 1435. Vale Royal found keeping the appropriated church difficult, with the locals being at times difficult (for reasons that were not hard to discover).|$|E
5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{itself had}} no notable effect on {{relations between the}} people and the occupying Americans, which were already deteriorating as the siege <b>dragged</b> <b>on.</b> This was {{due in part to the}} fact that the Americans, rather than paying for their supplies in coin, paid with Continental paper currency or promissory notes, deemed to be of little worth by the locals.|$|E

5|$|The untangling of his {{accounts}} <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> until 1819, prolonged by {{his enemies}} at the Navy Office {{and his own}} fiscal incapacity. At length a balance of £220,000 was found against him, but by this time his career was hopelessly ruined. He left office as a groom of the bedchamber in 1815, but retained his vice-admiralty sinecures until his death. In 1824, he became heir presumptive to the Earldom of Clarendon but died in 1827 without inheriting it.|$|E
5|$|War {{broke out}} between Pyrrhus and Demetrius in 290 BC when Lanassa, wife of Pyrrhus, {{daughter}} of Agathocles of Syracuse, left him for Demetrius and offered him her dowry of Corcyra. The war <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> until 288 BC, when Demetrius lost {{the support of}} the Macedonians and fled the country. Macedonia was then divided between Pyrrhus and Lysimachus, the former taking western Macedonia and the latter eastern Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|William, {{moving quickly}} {{in support of}} his own claims, had already seized Negroponte. Gradenigo and his Venetians {{attacked}} and took the city, but William responded by sending his nephew the baron of Karytaina, Geoffroy de Bruyères, who recaptured Negroponte and launched devastating raids in Euboea. Venice then laid siege to the city, which <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> for thirteen months until its defenders capitulated in early 1258. An Achaean counterattack was repulsed by Venetian infantry sallying forth and defeating the famed Achaean cavalry before the city's walls.|$|E
50|$|To achieve powered, {{forward flight}} birds must {{counteract}} drag forces that act opposite {{the direction of}} flight. <b>Drag</b> forces acting <b>on</b> a flying animal are composed of parasitic <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the body fuselage and induced <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the wings, both acting against the relative direction of flight. Adjusting the angle of attack while wing beat frequency is held constant, birds are able to direct {{a component of the}} lift produced by their wings backwards, thus producing propulsive force known as thrust.|$|R

5|$|Cagney's last {{movie in}} 1935 was Ceiling Zero, his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien {{received}} top billing, {{which was a}} clear breach of Cagney's contract. This, combined {{with the fact that}} Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt in a position to offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.|$|E
5|$|European {{companies}} which bought foreign patents the Wrights {{had received}} sued other manufacturers in their countries. Those lawsuits were only partly successful. Despite a pro-Wright ruling in France, legal maneuvering <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> until the patent expired in 1917. A German court ruled the patent not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Chanute in 1903.
