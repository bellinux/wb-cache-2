Podkreślono ich znaczenie w rozwoju obszarów górskich. Przeprowadzone analizy wykazały, że leje źródłowe powinny być traktowane jak integralne części zlewni górskich, a kompleksowe podejście do lejów źródłowych jest możliwe dzięki stosowaniu metod badawczych z różnych dziedzin naukowych. Wyniki wielu badań pozwoliły wnioskować, że wykształcenie lejów źródłowych bezpośrednio wpływa na dostawę energii i materii do systemu fluwialnego, a tym samym na natężenie procesów hydrologicznych i geomorfologicznych poniżej tych lejów. Rola lejów źródłowych w rozwoju rzeźby jest więc istotna nie tylko z punktu widzenia morfometrii pasm górskich, ale również ze względu na częstość występowania i natężenie różnych procesów morfogenetycznych. <b>Headwater</b> {{areas are}} complex systems {{affected}} {{by a number of}} morphological, hydrological and biological processes. This complexity is of interest to researchers. Many papers underscore the difference between <b>headwater</b> systems and mountain fluvial systems with respect to hydrology, geomorphology and biology. The differences are rooted in the close relationship between slope processes and river channel processes. In this paper, the <b>headwater</b> area is defined as a depressed landform with older Pliocene and Pleistocene setting, which forms a complex morphological subsystem of a mountain catchment and is located on the boundary between two subsystems – the slope subsystem and the fluvial subsystem. The <b>headwater</b> area develops via the joint action of surface processes and linear processes, which vary in intensity. <b>Headwater</b> areas develop differently, as the action of surface and linear processes is different in each case. The purpose of the paper is to describe the complexity of <b>headwater</b> areas in terms of relief and rates of morphological change as well as the role <b>headwater</b> areas play in mountain area development. The complexity of <b>headwater</b> areas demands an interdisciplinary approach based on a large variety of analytical methods including methods related to geomorphology, sedimentology, hydrology, hydrochemistry, dendrochronology, geodesy, statistics and geographic information systems. <b>Headwater</b> areas are Neogene landforms with sides and a floor – features typical of river valleys. Important parts of a <b>headwater</b> area include an upper edge and a transition zone. The presence of an upper edge suggests the action of mass movements shaping relief. The transition zone is the area between the <b>headwater</b> area and the fluvial system. This is the area where top-acting slope processes interact with bottom-acting fluvial processes. <b>Headwater</b> areas are classified as erosion-type and landslide-type based on the dominant morphological process present. Landslide action alters the longitudinal and transversal profiles of <b>headwater</b> areas. This leads to parts of slopes with unusually large gradients for a middle mountain region. Erosion-type <b>headwater</b> areas retain most of their older relief (Pleistocene, Pliocene). Erosion incisions and generally landforms shaped by the flow of water are very common. Steep slopes and steep sides of incisions are uncommon. Neotectonic activity also affects the formation of <b>headwater</b> areas. Neotectonic lift makes <b>headwater</b> areas deeper. A <b>headwater</b> area is a buffer zone between the slope system and the river channel system. Its relief directly affects the flow of energy and matter to the fluvial system. Slope processes and fluvial processes overlap in first-order and second-order stream channels depending on just how developed a given valley is. Research on buffer zone relief has shown that a gradient threshold value can be identified for areas homogeneous in terms of relief and geological structure. This value is important from the perspective of clastic material reaching the fluvial system. Clastic material is transported via slope processes such as sliding, torrential flow as well as debris and mud flow. The deposition of transported material usually occurs in the buffer zone. The development of a flood wave in higher-order streams, and consequently the energy in a river channel system, depends on the morphometry of the given <b>headwater</b> area. One of the better units of measurement of the energy in the transition zone between the <b>headwater</b> area and the fluvial system is unit stream power, which can be expressed as the relationship between <b>headwater</b> surface area, mean <b>headwater</b> area gradient, and stream channel width in the transition zone. Unit stream power was calculated for 108 <b>headwater</b> areas located in the flysch Outer Carpathians. Unit stream power increases with <b>headwater</b> surface area. The location of <b>headwater</b> areas affects the morphometry of the entire mountain range. Existing research has suggested that mountain passes are extensions of valleys and erosion incisions and are the result of back erosion acting over a very long period of time. This is especially true if erosion incisions on two sides of a ridge point to the same location on the ridge. The authors of this paper, on the other hand, believe that valleys and passes follow tectonic lines and do not result from intense backward erosion. Analysis of <b>headwater</b> areas in the Gorce, Beskid Sądecki and Bieszczady mountain ranges suggests that their relief is connected to geological structure. The presence of numerous and expansive <b>headwater</b> areas fragments mountain slopes and alters their longitudinal profile. Slopes become depressed in <b>headwater</b> areas and the top parts of slopes become steeper due to <b>headwater</b> areas becoming deeper. The development of <b>headwater</b> areas via sliding and creeping moves the tops of ridges further back. In effect, the <b>headwater</b> area assumes a convex-concave longitudinal profile. <b>Headwater</b> areas without a clear edge line tend to assume a concave longitudinal profile. Natural processes acting on <b>headwater</b> areas also alter the transversal profiles of slopes. The relief of the transversal profile is linked to older parts of <b>headwater</b> areas. These landforms tend to resemble wide and shallow valleys, which are often filled with colluvia at the bottom. At lower elevations, <b>headwater</b> areas become flat valleys filled with colluvia. In some cases, <b>headwater</b> areas become V-shaped valleys. The role played by <b>headwater</b> areas in relief development is relevant from the perspective of mountain range morphometry as well as in terms of the frequency and intensity of morphological processes. <b>Headwater</b> area relief affects natural processes further downstream. This is the direct result of mineral matter transport conditions in the <b>headwater</b> area...|$|R

40|$|A strong {{connection}} to the landscape means that small <b>headwater</b> stream metabolism is easily disturbed by land management practices such as forestry. A current landscape ecology framework, the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm, was applied to examine the heterogeneity of small <b>headwater</b> stream metabolism {{and how it is}} affected by anthropogenic disturbance. Metabolism was examined at several scales to elucidate specific metabolic components and processes, including microbial community structure, bacterial carbon productivity, cellulose decomposition potential, algal accumulation, and ecosystem respiration and productivity. Firstly, in-stream metabolic patch dynamics was examined throughout a calendar year. Small <b>headwater</b> streams displayed very low metabolic rates dominated by heterotrophic processes. Predictable spatial and temporal patterns in population-level, community-level, and whole system-level metabolisms were observed, shaped by temperature, hydrology, and the physical and chemical properties of patches. Secondly, an inundation experiment was conducted to examine metabolic patch dynamics in a small <b>headwater</b> landscape. Inundation resulted in increased metabolic response and a change in the metabolic community profile of the terrestrial patch. It is suggested that regular, above-bank flows are likely to transfer the complexities of in-stream patch dynamics into the terrestrial environment, exemplifying the strong connection between <b>headwater</b> streams and the surrounding landscape. Thirdly, the impact of forestry on stream metabolism was examined by a survey of small <b>headwater</b> streams 2 - 5 years after logging. Forestry stimulated autotrophy and lead to increased metabolic rates. Methods that incorporate temporal variability, such as cellulose decomposition potential, provided a strong assessment of forestry impact and are recommended as robust indicators of disturbance. Fourthly, the potential recovery of stream metabolism from the impacts of forestry was examined by a survey of small <b>headwater</b> streams 2 - 15 years after logging. Only autotrophic processes displayed recovery over time, with a sustained change in heterotrophic form and function. It is suggested that, together, these surveys demonstrate a lack of resistance and resilience to forestry disturbance in the key metabolic processes of small <b>headwater</b> streams. Finally, through the description of metabolic patterns a metabolic ‘signature’ of small <b>headwater</b> streams is presented. The metabolic signature provides a characterisation of small <b>headwater</b> stream metabolism and contributes to our understanding of small <b>headwater</b> stream ecology...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} a first national-scale {{assessment of the}} nutrient status of British <b>headwater</b> streams within the wider river network, by joint analysis of the national Countryside Survey <b>Headwater</b> Stream and Harmonised River Monitoring Scheme datasets. We apply a novel Nutrient Limitation Assessment methodology to explore {{the extent to which}} nutrients may potentially limit primary production in <b>headwater</b> streams and rivers, by coupling ternary assessment of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) depletion, with N:P stoichiometry, and threshold P and N concentrations. P limitation was more commonly seen in the rivers, with greater prevalence of N limitation in the <b>headwater</b> streams. High levels of potential P and N co-limitation were found in the <b>headwater</b> streams, especially the Upland-Low-Alkalinity streams. This suggests that managing both P and N inputs may be needed to minimise risks of degradation of these sensitive <b>headwater</b> stream environments. Although localised nutrient impairment of <b>headwater</b> streams can occur, there were markedly lower rates of P and N impairment of <b>headwater</b> streams relative to downstream rivers at the national scale. Nutrient source contributions, relative to hydrological dilution, increased with catchment scale, corresponding with increases in the extent of agricultural and urban land-use. The estimated nutrient reductions needed to achieve compliance with Water Framework Directive standards, and to reach limiting concentrations, were greatest for the Lowland-High-Alkalinity rivers and streams. Preliminary assessments suggest that reducing P concentrations in the Lowland-High-Alkalinity <b>headwater</b> streams, and N concentrations in the Upland-Low-Alkalinity rivers, might offer greater overall benefits for water-quality remediation at the national scale, relative to the magnitude of nutrient reductions required. This approach could help inform the prioritisation of nutrient remediation, as part of a directional approach to water quality management based on closing the gaps between current and target nutrient concentrations...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} stream water quality across {{a range of}} catchments which are representative of the key environments and land uses of rural south-west England. These catchments included: (a) an acidic upland <b>headwater</b> catchment, rising on the moorlands of Dartmoor, with low-intensity sheep rearing; (b) a <b>headwater</b> catchment rising on the weathered granite lower slopes of Dartmoor, with cattle farming; (c) a lowland <b>headwater</b> clay catchment with sub-surface drainage and high intensity livestock farming, fodder crop cultivation, and hard-standing/slurry storage; and (d) the main River Taw, a lowland river system receiving drainage from a range of tributaries, exemplified by the above catchment types.

Within the livestock-dominated <b>headwater</b> streams, total phosphorus (TP) was dominated by particulate phosphorus (PP).

40|$|Abstract Background In {{agricultural}} regions, streamside forests {{have been}} reduced in age and extent, or removed entirely to maximize arable cropland. Restoring and reforesting such riparian zones to mature forest, particularly along <b>headwater</b> streams (which constitute 90 % of stream network length) would both increase carbon storage and improve water quality. Age and management-related cover/condition classes of <b>headwater</b> stream networks {{can be used to}} rapidly inventory carbon storage and sequestration potential if carbon storage capacity of conditions classes and their relative distribution on the landscape are known. Results Based on the distribution of riparian zone cover/condition classes in sampled <b>headwater</b> reaches, current and potential carbon storage was extrapolated to the remainder of the North Carolina Coastal Plain stream network. Carbon stored in <b>headwater</b> riparian reaches is only about 40 % of its potential capacity, based on 242 MgC/ha stored in sampled mature riparian forest (forest > 50 y old). The carbon deficit along 57, 700 km <b>headwater</b> Coastal Plain streams is equivalent to about 25 TgC in 30 -m-wide riparian buffer zones and 50 TgC in 60 -m-wide buffer zones. Conclusions Estimating carbon storage in recognizable age-and cover-related condition classes provides a rapid way to better inventory current carbon storage, estimate storage capacity, and calculate the potential for additional storage. In light of the particular importance of buffer zones in <b>headwater</b> reaches in agricultural landscapes in ameliorating nutrient and sediment input to streams, encouraging the restoration of riparian zones to mature forest along <b>headwater</b> reaches worldwide has the potential to not only improve water quality, but also simultaneously reduce atmospheric CO 2. </p...|$|R
