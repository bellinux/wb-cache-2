5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
5|$|Schenn {{spent the}} 2008–09 season {{playing with the}} Wheat Kings and served as their co-captain {{alongside}} Matt Calvert. In January 2009, he was named the WHL and CHL Player of the Week, after scoring 7 points in two games. Also in January, Schenn {{was selected as the}} winner of the H. L. (Krug) Crawford Memorial Medal which <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> athletic achievement in western Manitoba. He finished the season with 85 points in 69 games to lead the Wheat Kings in scoring a second consecutive season. He finished seventh overall in scoring for the WHL, and was named to the WHL's Eastern Conference Second All-Star Team. During the season, Schenn played in the CHL Top Prospects Game and represented the WHL in the ADT Canada-Russia Challenge.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} games, Dead Phoenix was {{canceled}} and only P.N.03 retained {{its status as}} a GameCube exclusive, though it was a critical and commercial failure. Both Viewtiful Joe and Killer7 sold modestly, the former despite critical acclaim and the latter owing to polarized reviews. Even so, Killer7 gained a significant cult following, effectively launching the career of director Suda51. Resident Evil 4 was the runaway success of the five, though its GameCube sales were undercut by the announcement of a Sony PlayStation 2 port to be released later in 2005. Viewtiful Joe also saw a PlayStation 2 version with expanded features, and Killer7 debuted on multiple platforms simultaneously. Since the release of the Nintendo 64, Nintendo has struggled to attract third-party developers like Capcom to produce games for its systems. Industry analysts see the Capcom Five case, particularly the loss of GameCube exclusivity for Resident Evil 4, as a major blow to Nintendo–Capcom relations and <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> Nintendo's failure to attract third-party support during the GameCube era.|$|E

25|$|The purna kumbha or full pot {{of water}} {{is the second most}} {{discernible}} element of the Ganga iconography. Appearing first also in the relief in Udayagiri Caves (5th century), it gradually appeared more frequently as the theme of the goddess matured. By the seventh century it had become an established feature, as seen, for example, the Dashavatara temple, Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh (seventh century), the Trimurti temple, Badoli, Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, and at the Lakshmaneshwar temple, Kharod, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, (ninth or tenth century), and seen very clearly in frame 3 above and less clearly in the remaining frames. Worshipped even today, the full pot <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> the formless Brahman, as well as of woman, of the womb, and of birth. Furthermore, The river goddesses Ganga and Saraswati were both born from Brahma's pot, containing the celestial waters.|$|E

According to The Independent, there was [...] "no suggestion that McKinsey was complicit in the subsequent scandal, [...] critics say the arrogance of Enron's leaders <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> the McKinsey culture." [...] The government did not investigate McKinsey, who said they did not provide advice on Enron's accounting, but some questioned whether McKinsey knew about Enron's accounting problems or ignored warning signs.|$|E
500|$|Deception in Barton Fink <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> Hollywood's {{focus on}} low culture, its {{relentless}} desire to efficiently produce formulaic entertainment {{for the sole}} purpose of economic gain. Capitol Pictures assigns Barton to write a wrestling picture with superstar Wallace Beery in the leading role. Although Lipnick declares otherwise, Geisler assures Barton that [...] "it's just a B picture". Audrey tries to help the struggling writer by telling him: [...] "Look, it's really just a formula. You don't have to type your soul into it". This formula is made clear by Lipnick, who asks Barton in their first meeting whether the main character should have a love interest or take care of an orphaned child. Barton shows his iconoclasm by answering: [...] "Both, maybe?" [...] In the end, his inability to conform to the studio's norms destroys Barton.|$|E
500|$|The less ornate Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove, {{which has}} also been known {{traditionally}} as the Rod of Equity and Mercy, <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> his or her spiritual role. It is a bit longer at [...] but weighs {{about the same as}} the Sceptre with Cross. The sceptre is decorated with 285 gemstones, including 94 diamonds, 53 rubies, 10 emeralds, 4 sapphires and 3 spinels. At the top is a gold monde set with diamonds and topped by a plain cross, on which sits a white champlevé enamelled dove with its wings outspread; the eyes, beak and feet are gold leaf. The dove has been used to represent the Holy Ghost, who guides the sovereign's actions, for many centuries. Circling the rod are bands of precious stones. The Sceptre with Dove is the final piece of regalia delivered to the monarch in the investment part of a coronation. It is borne in the left hand, and as the monarch holds both sceptres, he or she is crowned with StEdward's Crown.|$|E

500|$|Feng's case {{became a}} focal point for {{newspaper}} editorials against China's one-child policy and abortion in general. Opponents of the one-child policy said the case is a potential turning point in the efforts to end the rule. [...] On June 26, Reuters said the story had sparked [...] "a firestorm domestically and around the world," [...] explaining that [...] "Feng Jianmei's abortion was portrayed in the Chinese and international press {{as an example of the}} extreme measures some officials would take to control China's population, even if it meant breaking Chinese law." [...] A story in The Wall Street Journal remarked that the case [...] "dramatize the harshness of the one-child policy." [...] The incident prompted Evan Osnos, the New Yorker writer, to create a feature piece titled [...] "Abortion and Politics in China." [...] Osnos said that [...] "the Feng case <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> some of the most inflammatory issues on Chinese public life," [...] including money, government corruption, the household registration system, and of course family planning, and that [...] "the case is a dramatic demonstration of exactly why the Communist Party had reason to be afraid of the Internet." ...|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{thought he}} {{lost touch with}} American values while living in Paris, but his biographer Michael Reynolds claims the opposite, seeing {{evidence}} of the author's midwestern American values in the novel. [...] Hemingway admired hard work. He portrayed the matadors and the prostitutes, who work for a living, in a positive manner, but Brett, who prostitutes herself, <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> [...] "the rotten crowd" [...] living on inherited money. It is Jake, the working journalist, who pays the bills again and again when those who can pay do not. Hemingway shows, through Jake's actions, his disapproval {{of the people who}} did not pay up. [...] Reynolds says that Hemingway shows the tragedy, not so much of the decadence of the Montparnasse crowd, but of the decline in American values of the period. As such, the author created an American hero who is impotent and powerless. Jake becomes the moral center of the story. He never considers himself part of the expatriate crowd because he is a working man; to Jake a working man is genuine and authentic, {{and those who do not}} work for a living spend their lives posing.|$|E
500|$|Vaughn said he {{shot the}} film {{in a way it}} resembled the {{productions}} of the 1960s, with [...] "very traditional framing, and camera movement when it needs to move, not just throwing it around and whizz-bang", and using the anamorphic format [...] "to create a widescreen experience, which <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> '60s movies, such as the James Bond films". The director had to hire five cinematographers - with sole credit being given to John Mathieson, who came halfway through the shoot and did [...] "forty-five percent, fifty-five percent" [...] of the film - and four assistant directors to successfully convey the look he wanted for the film. Visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson added that for the lighting of the digital interior of Cerebro, [...] "keeping with the '60s vibe, we put in some old school elements such as lens flare and chromatic aberration and edge fringing." [...] The aesthetics of the decade were also invoked by designers Simon Clowes and Kyle Cooper of Prologue Films, who were responsible for the end credits and tried to do something that [...] "could be done with traditional optical". The credits animation depicts DNA strands through simple geometric shapes, drawing inspiration from both Saul Bass and Maurice Binder's work in the Bond films.|$|E

500|$|Eno {{has also}} said the album is about [...] "paint {{a picture of the}} human trying to survive in an {{increasingly}} digital world" [...] and Byrne considered his job as lyricist to [...] "bring more humanity" [...] to Eno's instrumentals, which can be [...] "cold and academic." [...] Themes of humanity struggling with technology are apparent on several tracks and Byrne has characterized the [...] "overall vibe" [...] of the album as [...] "We're going to get through this. Humanity will prevail." [...] The lyrical content includes [...] "a sinister inflection" [...] but [...] "many songs feel fairly uplifting and the overall tone is hopeful." [...] Byrne focused on mundane events and attempted to write in a style that was [...] "simple but not corny, basic but heartfelt." [...] His inspiration in writing lyrics for [...] "OneFineDay" [...] was the story of ValentinoAchakDeng as told in DaveEggers' —the two are thanked in the liner notes and Byrne had previously performed at a fundraiser for Eggers' 826Valencia. The story of the LostBoys of Sudan <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> the spiritual themes of the album as they go through [...] "all kinds of unrelenting horrors, but [...] eternally hopeful and even cheerful, in a way that defies all logic." [...] The music on this album also expresses homesickness—a lyrical trend that is apparent in Byrne's work with TalkingHeads.|$|E
500|$|With {{the advent}} of {{recorded}} music and radio, [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] began to cross over from primarily a gospel standard to secular audiences. The ability to record combined with the marketing of records to specific audiences allowed [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] to take on thousands of different forms in the 20th century. Where Edwin Othello Excell sought to make the singing of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] uniform throughout thousands of churches, records allowed artists to improvise with the words and music specific to each audience. AllMusic lists more than 7,000 recordings including re-releases and compilations as of September 2011. Its first recording is an a cappella version from 1922 by the Sacred Harp Choir. It was included from 1926 to 1930 in Okeh Records' catalogue, which typically concentrated strongly on blues and jazz. Demand was high for black gospel recordings of the song by H. R. Tomlin and J. M. Gates. A poignant sense of nostalgia accompanied the recordings of several gospel and blues singers in the 1940s and 1950s who used the song to remember their grandparents, traditions, and family roots. It was recorded with musical accompaniment {{for the first time}} in 1930 by Fiddlin' John Carson, although to another folk hymn named [...] "At the Cross", not to [...] "New Britain". [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> several kinds of folk music styles, often used as the standard example to illustrate such musical techniques as lining out and call and response, that have been practiced in both black and white folk music.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{characters}} in the film who represent actual people, Jack Jones, a billionaire investment banker and real estate tycoon, is a composite character, who <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> [...] "big business" [...] in general. The character may be a reference to Nixon's meetings with Clint Murchison, Sr., although he also illuminates Nixon's relationships with Howard Hughes, H. L. Hunt and other entrepreneurs.|$|E

2500|$|Alternatively, {{it could}} be argued that [...] "Oroonoko" [...] is a {{homophone}} for the Orinoco River, along which the English settled, and it is possible to see the character as an allegorical figure for the mismanaged territory itself. Oroonoko, and the crisis of values of aristocracy, slavery, and worth he represents to the colonists, <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> the new world and colonisation itself: a person like Oroonoko is symptomatic of a place like the Orinoco.|$|E
2500|$|...

2500|$|Like many of Poe's tales, [...] "The Masque of the Red Death" [...] {{has been}} {{interpreted}} autobiographically, by some. In this point of view, Prince Prospero is Poe as a wealthy young man, part of a distinguished family much like Poe's foster parents, the Allans. Under this interpretation, Poe is seeking refuge from {{the dangers of the}} outside world, and his portrayal of himself as the only person willing to confront the stranger <b>is</b> <b>emblematic</b> <b>of</b> Poe's rush towards inescapable dangers in his own life. Prince Prospero is also the name of a character in William Shakespeare's The Tempest.|$|E
