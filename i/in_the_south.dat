5|$|After {{successful}} test marketing from 1974, John Smith's Bitter {{was distributed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> of England from 1979 onwards, {{accompanied by an}} extensive marketing budget. As research by Courage indicated that Southern drinkers considered Yorkshire bitter to be superior, the beer was sold there under the name John Smith's Yorkshire Bitter. Sales of the beer doubled in 1981 owing {{to the increase in}} free trade outlets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> stocking the beer.

However, as the nation came closer to civil war, demand dropped and sales <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> became impossible. The factory was closed in 1861, not only due to poor sales, but because Allen enlisted in the Union Army.|$|E

5000|$|Historians {{who argue}} {{in favor of}} soil {{exhaustion}} as an explanation for slave importation into <b>the</b> Deep <b>South</b> posit that exporting states emerged as slave producers because of the transformation of agriculture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>south</b> and <b>the</b> increased demand for labor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Deep <b>South</b> due to <b>the</b> success of sugar and cotton crops. [...] Because of the deterioration of soil {{and an increase in}} demand for food products, states <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>south</b> shifted crop emphasis from tobacco to grain which required less slave labor. This decreased demand left states <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper <b>South</b> with an excess supply of labor.|$|R
