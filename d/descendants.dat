5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{over whether}} temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians), {{or whether the}} whole group died out without leaving any <b>descendants.</b> Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the <b>descendants</b> of temnospondyls, another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as <b>descendants</b> of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls, and hearing structures link the two groups.|$|E

5|$|Robie Mortin {{came forward}} as a {{survivor}} during this time; {{she was the}} only one added to the list who could prove she lived in Rosewood in 1923, totaling nine survivors who were compensated.

5|$|The {{final scene}} {{is the story}} of Noah's drunkenness. After the Flood, Noah tills the soil and grows vines. He is shown doing so, in the {{background}} of the picture. He becomes drunk and inadvertently exposes himself. His youngest son, Ham, brings his two brothers Shem and Japheth to see the sight but they discreetly cover their father with a cloak. Ham is later cursed by Noah and told that the <b>descendants</b> of Ham's son Canaan will serve Shem and Japheth's <b>descendants</b> forever. Taken together, these three pictures serve to show that Humankind had moved a long way from God's perfect creation.
