25|$|Charlie Brown returns, and, {{with his}} friends, plays the Little League Baseball Championship. After some mishaps, the team finally manages {{to make some}} progress. Charlie Brown {{steps up to the}} plate, and despite his valiant efforts, strikes out and loses the game. We learn that this was a flashback, and Charlie Brown expresses his deep sorrow to his pen pal ("T-E-A-M (The Baseball Game)"). Lucy takes a crabbiness survey and Linus says that her crabbiness rating is ninety-five. After {{punching}} him, she realizes that she, in reality, <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> crabby.|$|E
500|$|Recalling {{the release}} in a special-edition issue of Mojo magazine, Peter Doggett writes that [...] "The papers got all trippy for Yellow Submarine". Beat Instrumental bemoaned {{the paucity of}} new {{material}} by the band, but added: [...] "be not of bad cheer. The George Martin score to the film <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> nice, and two tracks by George Harrison redeem the first side. Both [...] are superb pieces, considerably more enthralling than the most draggy All Together Now, a rather wet track." [...] In a review for International Times, Barry Miles considered Martin's score [...] "superbly produced" [...] and, of the songs, wrote only of [...] "It's All Too Much", which he described as, variously, [...] "Endless, mantric, a round, interwoven, trellised, tessellated, filigreed, gidouiled, spiralling" [...] and [...] "Happy singalong music". Writing in their book [...] (1975), NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler bemoaned the commercial considerations {{that resulted in a}} full soundtrack album, saying that the four new songs [...] "would have made a superb EP".|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "In My Eyes" [...] {{utilizes}} tingling synths. Colly {{said that}} Robyn is [...] "an encouraging den mother" [...] on the song, singing [...] "Little star, I got you. You'll be okay." [...] Luke O'Neill of The Boston Globe {{said that the}} song showcases [...] "the tension-and-catharsis approach Robyn is capable of achieving with her vocals." [...] The second track, [...] "Include Me Out" [...] {{was referred to as}} [...] "digitised stop-start funk". The song begins with the line, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> simple, just a single pulse repeated at a regular interval", which according to O'Neill described [...] "the main sonic trick employed on a lot of her dance-ready songs." [...] On the song, Robyn plays a party-starter that is [...] "repping matriarchs and cross-dressers alike" [...] with the line [...] "This one's for the granny, take a bow... Come on all you trannies, click your heels for me." [...] "Hang with Me", carries a [...] "fierce, club-wrecking beat", with [...] "relentlessly energetic bass" [...] and synth arpeggios. Lyrically, the song speaks of trust in a relationship, with lines such as [...] "Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said that the song views [...] "the perspective of someone who's a bit too tightly buttoned-up to let her defences down." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Love Kills" [...] was described as a [...] "discofied, sharp-edged" [...] song, with fierce vocals and [...] "haunting Pet Shop Boys flourishes." [...] "We Dance to the Beat" [...] is a techno song, with an [...] "apocalyptic, big-beat". It features a [...] "sort of spoken-word hype-up jam" [...] that was compared to [...] "Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do". The song features lines such as [...] "We dance to the beat of your brains not evolving fast enough" [...] and [...] "We dance to the beat of bad kissers clicking teeth." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{not clear}} whether the Department of State or Lodge was {{enthusiastic}} about the political change in Saigon at the time, but if they were not, they were handed a fait accompli. A CIA report from Saigon soon after the seizure of power told the State Department that [...] "It {{is safe to say that}} Khánh's group will be essentially pro-American, anti-communist and anti-neutralist in general orientation." [...] As far as Harkins was concerned, with US policy committed to maintaining leadership in the hands of senior military officers, there were no other apparent options; he told General Taylor, [...] "One thing is for sure with this coup. We've gone through all the eligible general officers." [...] For his part, Lodge chose not to warn the junta, to which the embassy had pledged their support, as to the imminent plot, despite being well aware of it. He said in a cable a few days after the coup that [...] "General Khánh's coup was extremely disconcerting at first blush", but that the lack of public reaction to the overthrow of Minh indicated that Khánh's actions were not something to be alarmed about. He wrote that the progress of history was often made in many phases by different individuals or groups, using the analogy that in an American political party, the people who manage the primary campaigns are different from those who run the national elections, while the officer-holders are entirely separate. Lodge speculated that while Minh and his generals were successful in removing Diệm—something Lodge strongly encouraged—they may not be the ideal administrators of a nation themselves. With respect to the prospects of defeating the communists, he said [...] "Our side knows how to do it; we have the means with which to do it; we simply need to do it. This requires a tough and ruthless commander. Perhaps Khánh is it." [...] Blair said that Lodge's habit of looking for American parallels to Vietnamese situations hindered his judgment, pointing out that Khánh's rule merely saw more instability and chaos. At the end of February, Lodge was still positive and cabled Washington to say that [...] "I continue to be favorably impressed by him. He <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> much more able than the Minh, Don, Kim group and, of course, he is so far above Diệm and Nhu that there is no comparison." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} Sherlock Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet (1887), Doctor Watson compares Holmes to Dupin, to which Holmes replies: [...] "No doubt {{you think you}} are complimenting me ... In my opinion, Dupin was a very {{inferior}} fellow... He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appears to imagine". Alluding to an episode in [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", where Dupin deduces what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, [...] Holmes remarks: [...] "That trick of his breaking in on his friend's thoughts with an apropos remark... <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> showy and superficial"; nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same 'trick' on Watson in [...] "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box".|$|E

2500|$|You scold {{me so much}} in {{the nice}} long letter which I have this moment {{received}} from you, that I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together. I can expose myself however, only once more, because he leaves the country soon after next Friday, on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. He is a very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man, I assure you. But as to our having ever met, except at the three last balls, I cannot say much; for he is so excessively laughed at about me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of coming to Steventon, and ran away when we called on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago.[...] [...]After I had written the above, we received a visit from Mr. Tom Lefroy and his cousin George. The latter <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> well-behaved now; and as for the other, he has but one fault, which time will, I trust, entirely remove — it is that his morning coat is a great deal too light. He is a very great admirer of Tom Jones, and therefore wears the same coloured clothes, I imagine, which he did when he was wounded.|$|E
