40|$|We have {{developed}} combined transgene/virus vector {{systems for the}} expression of heterologous proteins in plants. The systems are based on the bipartite RNA plant virus, cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), and involve the amplification of integrated copies of either full-length or deleted versions of RNA- 2 carrying a foreign gene. In the case of plants transgenic for full-length versions of RNA- 2 carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP), amplification can be achieved by supplying RNA- 1 either <b>exogenously</b> <b>or</b> by crossing. This allows either inducible or constitutive expression of the foreign gene and results in an infection that can be passaged to further plants. Replication of deleted versions of RNA- 2 harbouring GFP requires the presence of both RNA- 1 and a suppressor of gene silencing, a function which we show can be supplied by HcPro from potato virus Y. Replication of the deleted versions of RNA- 2 can be achieved by supplying the suppressor and RNA- 1 either <b>exogenously</b> <b>or</b> by crossing, showing that this system can also be used in an inducible and constitutive format. The use of deleted forms of RNA- 2 has the advantage that no infectious virus is produced, providing an effective method of biocontainment.

The secondary task required identifying, without time constraints, a visual stimulus (S 2) that appeared randomly to the left or right of screen center. Results showed that there was a correspondence (i. e., a cross-task Simon effect) between the location of R 1 and the location of S 2 when S 2 was presented alone.

This study therefore addresses qualifications in prior research about the generalizability of cognitive disclosure phenomena to a strategic disclosure environment.

40|$|SummaryProper {{distribution}} of mitochondria within axons and at synapses {{is critical for}} neuronal function. While one-third of axonal mitochondria are mobile, a large proportion remains in a stationary phase. However, the mechanisms controlling mitochondrial docking within axons remain elusive. Here, we report a role for axon-targeted syntaphilin (SNPH) in mitochondrial docking through its interaction with microtubules. Axonal mitochondria that contain <b>exogenously</b> <b>or</b> endogenously expressed SNPH lose mobility. Deletion of the mouse snph gene results in a substantially higher proportion of axonal mitochondria in the mobile state and reduces the density of mitochondria in axons. The snph mutant neurons exhibit enhanced short-term facilitation during prolonged stimulation, probably by affecting calcium signaling at presynaptic boutons. This phenotype is fully rescued by reintroducing the snph gene into the mutant neurons. These findings demonstrate a molecular mechanism for controlling mitochondrial docking in axons that has a physiological impact on synaptic function...|$|R
