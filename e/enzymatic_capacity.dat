Cell death counters proliferation of lymphocytes, allowing the immune system to achieve dynamic homeostasis whereby it can defend against pathogens and avoid autoimmunity. The two reported siblings have C>T transitions, causing R248W loss-of-function mutations in the gene.

40|$|BackgroundFruit {{taste is}} largely {{affected}} by the concentration of soluble sugars and organic acids and non-negligibly by fructose concentration, which is the sweetest-tasting sugar. To date, many studies investigating the sugars in fruit have focused on a specific sugar or enzyme and often on a single variety, {{but only a few}} detailed studies addressing sugar metabolism both as a whole and dynamic system are available. In commercial peach fruit, sucrose is the main sugar, followed by fructose and glucose, which have similar levels. Interestingly, low fructose-to-glucose ratios have been observed in wild peach accessions. A cross between wild peach and commercial varieties offers an outstanding possibility to study fruit sugar metabolism. ResultsThis work provides a large dataset of sugar composition and the capacities of enzymes that are involved in sugar metabolism during peach fruit development and its genetic diversity. A large fraction of the metabolites and enzymes involved in peach sugar metabolism were assayed within a peach progeny of 106 genotypes, of which one quarter displayed a low fructose-to-glucose ratio. This profiling was performed at six stages of growth using high throughput methods. Our results permit drawing a quasi-exhaustive scheme of sugar metabolism in peach. The use {{of a large number of}} genotypes revealed a remarkable robustness of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>capacities</b> across genotypes and years, despite strong variations in sugar composition, in particular the fructose-to-glucose ratio, within the progeny. A poor correlation was also found between the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>capacities</b> and the accumulation rates of metabolites. ConclusionsThese results invalidate the hypothesis of the straightforward enzymatic control of sugar concentration in peach fruit. Alternative hypotheses concerning the regulation of fructose concentration are discussed based on experimental data.

After identifying twelve bacterial strains from two petroleum-contaminated sites, we experimentally explored the impact of biodiversity on total density by manipulating the number of strains in culture.

However, bacteria cultured in the crude oil of their origin (autochthonous) reached higher densities than bacteria from another origin (allochthonous) and the relationship between diversity and density was stronger for autochthonous bacteria. By measuring the relative contribution of each strain to total density we showed that the observed positive effect of increasing diversity on total density was mainly due to positive interactions among species and not the presence of a particular species. Our findings {{can be explained by the}} complex chemical composition of crude oil and the necessity of a diverse array of organisms with complementary <b>enzymatic</b> <b>capacities</b> to achieve its degradation.

Intriguingly, {{there is no evidence}} that members of the Barnadesioideae produce STLs, specialized metabolites thought to have contributed to the adaptive success of the Asteraceae family outside South America. The biosynthesis of STLs requires the intimate expression and functional integration of germacrene A synthase (GAS) and germacrene A oxidase (GAO) to sequentially cyclize and oxidize farnesyl diphosphate into the advanced intermediate germacrene A acid leading to diverse STLs. Our previous discovery of GAO activity conserved across all major subfamilies of Asteraceae, including the phylogenetically basal lineage of Barnadesioideae, prompted further investigation of the presence of the gateway GAS in Barnadesioideae. Herein we isolated two terpene synthases (BsGAS 1 /BsGAS 2) from the basal Barnadesia spinosa (Barnadesioideae) that displayed robust GAS activity when reconstituted in yeast and characterized in vitro. Despite the apparent lack of STLs in the Barnadesioideae, this work unambiguously confirms the presence of GAS in the basal genera of the Asteraceae. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the two BsGASs fall into two distinct clades of the Asteraceae's GASs, and BsGAS 1 clade is only retained in the evolutionary closer Cichorioideae subfamily, implicating BsGAS 2 is likely the ancestral base of most GASs found in the lineages outside the Barnadesioideae.

We analysed routine metabolic rate (RMR) during acute thermal challenge and after acclimation, extra- and intracellular acid-base status, mitochondrial as well as <b>enzymatic</b> <b>capacities</b> and lipid composition. Our results showed partially compensated RMR after warm acclimation and no effect of increased PCO 2 on the RMR. Hypercapnic acclimation led to a general overcompensation of extracellular pH. Intracellular pH displayed a slight acidosis in liver after warm normocapnic/hypercapnic acclimation, whereas white muscle remained well buffered under hypercapnia. Mitochondrial state III respiration in liver was unaffected by temperature acclimation, but depressed in the hypercapnia acclimated animals, which went along with reduced rates of proton leak. The activities of the mitochondrial enzymes citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase increased during hypercapnia acclimation in red and white muscle, but not in liver and heart. Furthermore, there was a trend towards an enrichment of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in liver mitochondria towards the warm hypercapnic conditions. We conclude that N. rossii possesses basic acclimatory capacities towards ocean warming and acidification.

These studies demonstrate that skin has the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>capacity</b> to synthesize porphyrins from added ALA and that cutaneous porphyrinogenesis from ALA is deficient in patients with acute intermittent porphyria...|$|E
40|$|The {{kynurenine pathway}} {{converts}} tryptophan into various compounds, including L-kynurenine, {{which in turn}} can be converted into the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist kynurenic acid. The ionotropic glutamate receptors have been considered to be attractive targets for new anticonvulsants in neurological disorders such as epileptic seizure. This {{study was designed to}} examine the conversion Of L-kynurenine to kynurenic acid and to investigate the effects of kynurenic acid on pentylenetetrazole-treated rat brain slices, and in parallel {{to draw attention to the}} fact that a well-designed in vitro model has many advantages in pharmacological screening. Schaffer collateral stimulation-evoked field EPSPs were recorded from area CA 1 of rat hippocampal slices in vitro; drugs were bath-applied. Pretreatment with the kynurenic acid precursor L-kynurenine led to the elimination of the effect of pentylenetetrazole on hippocampal slices in vitro. N-Omega-nitro-L-arginine, which inhibits kynurenine aminotransferase I and II, abolished this neuroprotective effect. This study has furnished the first in vitro electrophysiological evidence that rat brain slices have the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>capacity</b> to convert exogenously administered L-kynurenine (16 mu M) to kynurenic acid in an amount sufficient to protect them against pentylenetetrazole (1 mM) -induced hyperexcitability.

40|$|Solid tumors contend with, {{and adapt}} to, a hostile micro-environment that {{includes}} limited availability of nutrient fuels and oxygen. The presence of hypoxia (O 2 < 5 %) stabilizes the transcription factor Hif 1 {{and results in}} numerous cellular adaptations including increased flux of glucose through glycolysis. Increasingly, more sophisticated analysis of tumor oxygenation has revealed large gradients of oxygen tension and significant regions under severe hypoxia (O 2 ∼ 0. 1 %). The present investigation has demonstrated {{a significant increase in}} the glycolytic flux rate when tumor spheroids were exposed to 0. 1 % O 2. The severe hypoxia was associated with uniform pimonidazole adduct formation and elevated levels of Hif 1 α and c-Myc. This resulted in elevated expression of GLUT and MCT transporters, in addition to increased activity of PFK 1 in comparison to that observed in normoxia. However, the protein expression and <b>enzymatic</b> <b>capacity</b> of HK 2, G 6 PDH, PK, and LDH were all reduced by severe hypoxia. Clearly, the effects of exposure to severe hypoxia lead to a significantly abridged Hif 1 response, yet one still able to elevate glycolytic flux and prevent loss of intermediates to anabolism...|$|E
40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that exercise training can provide a level of protection against disuse muscle atrophy. Endurance exercise training imposes oxidative, metabolic, and heat stress on skeletal muscle which activates a variety of cellular signaling pathways that ultimately leads to the increased expression of proteins that have been demonstrated to protect muscle from inactivity –induced atrophy. This review will highlight the effect of exercise-induced oxidative stress on endogenous <b>enzymatic</b> antioxidant <b>capacity</b> (i. e., superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase), the role of oxidative and metabolic stress on PGC 1 -α, and finally highlight the effect heat stress and HSP 70 induction. Finally, this review will discuss the supporting scientific evidence that these proteins can attenuate muscle atrophy through exercise preconditioning...|$|R
40|$|Certain species {{belonging}} to the Astragalus genus (Fabaceae) have the extraordinary ability to hyperaccumulate up to 0. 6 % of their shoot dry weight as selenium (Se). Given that the biochemical properties of Se parallel those of sulfur (S), we probed enzymes involved in Se/S metabolism in these plants and identified metabolic factors that influence their ability to hyperaccumulate Se. We demonstrate that Se hyperaccumulation in Astragalus species is linked with over production of S-methylcysteine (MeCys) Se-methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys) through elevation of selenocysteine methyltransferase (SMT) activity, and we show that this unique enzyme is structurally and functionally related to enzymes that belong {{to the family of}} homocysteine methyltransferases. Furthermore, key S assimilatory enzymes ATP sulfurylase (APS) and APS reductase (APR) were found to be major contributors to selenate reduction in planta. However, total <b>enzymatic</b> <b>capacities</b> of these key enzymes are not altered in Se hyperaccumulators compared to non-accumulators. We conclude that Se hyperaccumulation in Astragalus is not driven by an overall increase in the total capacity of these Se/S assimilatory enzymes, but rather by an increased Se flux through the S/Se assimilatory pathway, generated by the SMT-dependent production of the sink metabolites MeCys or MeSeCys. Consistent with this model, the hyperaccumulator SMT enzyme was found to be localized in the chloroplast, the major organelle associated with S/Se reduction. ^ Intriguingly, both Se hyperaccumulating and non-accumulating Astragalus species were found to produce an SMT-like enzyme. The primary structure of these SMT enzymes are very similar, however they do contain conserved amino acid residues {{that can be used to}} classify the SMTs from hyperaccumulator and non-accumulator species. Enzymatic analysis of both cell-free extracts and recombinant enzymes revealed that the SMT enzyme from the non-accumulators has a very low specific activity for methylating selenocysteine and cysteine, explaining their inability to synthesize either MeCys or MeSeCys. ...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria {{and fungi}} {{dominate}} the decomposition of aquatic plants, a major {{process in the}} carbon and nutrient cycling in many aquatic systems. Although phylogenetically distant, bacteria and fungi often live in close proximity with each other. Since these microorganisms also have similar ecological functions, interactions have developed between them. This thesis explores the nature of such interactions, and the potential effects on key components of the decomposition process. The thesis includes a critical assessment of the ergosterol method for determination of fungal biomass, {{a survey of the}} environmental factors determining the distribution and taxa numbers of litter-decomposing bacteria and fungi in lakes, and a number of experiments on the interactions between bacteria and fungi. In all the experiments performed, fungi responded to bacterial presence through antagonism, although different fungal strains, bacterial communities and substrates were used. The antagonism seemed to be caused by interference competition for substrate. The fungal effect on bacteria was less consistent. Bacterial growth was suppressed, unaffected, or even enhanced by the presence of fungi. Fungi contributed more to extracellular enzyme production than bacteria, and bacteria were probably able to assimilate intermediate decomposition products formed through the activity of extracellular enzymes of fungal origin. Thus, the effect on bacteria from interacting with fungi was determined by the balance between competition and benefit from excreted enzymes. Bacteria and fungi also used different size fractions of the organic matter, according to their different <b>enzymatic</b> <b>capacities.</b> Hence, bacteria appeared to assimilate low-molecular-weight compounds, while high-molecular-weight compounds were utilized primarily by fungi. In brief, the ecological interactions influenced the growth and hence also the biomass development of bacteria and fungi, which affected enzyme activity as well as utilization of dissolved organic matter. Therefore, I suggest that interactions between bacteria and fungi influence degradation of plant litter in aquatic systems...|$|R
