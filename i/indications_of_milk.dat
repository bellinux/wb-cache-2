40|$|Testicular orphan nuclear {{receptor}} 4 (TR 4) is {{a member}} of the nuclear receptor superfamily for which a ligand has not yet been found. In vitro data obtained from various cell lines suggest that TR 4 functions as a master regulator to modulate many signaling pathways, yet the in vivo physiological roles of TR 4 remain unclear. Here, we report the generation of mice lacking TR 4 by means of targeted gene disruption (TR 4 –/–). The number of TR 4 –/– pups generated by the mating of TR 4 +/– mice is well under that predicted by the normal Mendelian ratio, and TR 4 –/– mice demonstrate high rates of early postnatal mortality, as well as significant growth retardation. Additionally, TR 4 –/– females show defects in reproduction and maternal behavior, with pups of TR 4 –/– dams dying soon after birth with no <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> intake. These results provide in vivo evidence that TR 4 plays important roles in growth, embryonic and early postnatal pup survival, female reproductive function, and maternal behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> products, especially {{made from}} raw milk, {{have been reported}} to be associated with food borne diseases. Since most sheep’s milk products are made from raw milk, it is clear how udder health is an important prerequisite to produce hygienic milk. Ewes with mastitis, particularly in their subclinical form, serve as reservoir of pathogens that can be shed into the milk and constitute a potential risk for human health. Milk somatic cell count (SCC) is not a public health concern itself but it is an indicator of the general state of udder health in a dairy sheep flock and can be used as an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> hygienic <b>milk</b> and to improve safety of dairy products. This thesis presents three different strategies, within a comprehensive SCC control program in dairy ewes. All the studies were carried out at the University of Wisconsin, Madison dairy sheep research facility, which is the only University dairy sheep research station in North America. The study presented in Chapter 2 describes an automated method to assess SCC on farm. In Chapter 3 is presented a study aimed to determine the effect of intramammary antibiotic dry treatment on intramammary infection and somatic cell count in the subsequent lactation. Chapter 4 presents a study carried out {{to assess the impact of}} premilking teat sanitation on somatic cell count in dairy ewes.

However, scientific data on milk quality {{in terms of}} somatic cell count (SCC) in Uganda and most developing countries has been lacking. This study used SCC to compare Southwestern Uganda’s milk quality against international standards. The study also sought to assess dairy farmers’ perceptions about milk quality. Milk samples were obtained from 100 farms in Mbarara and Kiruhura districts, the major cattle corridor in Uganda. The milk’s SCC was analyzed using a DeLaval DCC. A structured questionnaire surveyed farmers on milking procedures and milk-quality perception. Descriptive statistics and qualitative {{analysis was used to}} characterize and compare milk quality against the international benchmark. 	The study found that the 100 farms had an average SCC of 507, 000 cells/ml. About 34 % of farms in the study had SCC under 200, 000 cells/ml, an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> high-quality <b>milk.</b> Excluding 7 % of the farms with SCC over 1, 000, 000 cells/ml, the remaining 93 % had an average SCC of 276, 000 cells/ml, a level comparable to international standards, well below the EU threshold of 400, 000. 	The study also revealed that 98 % <b>of</b> farmers considered <b>milk</b> quality as important or very important both to them and to the milk buyers. However, all farmers reported that they currently do not receive a milk-quality premium and are not penalized for poor quality. Seventy-nine percent of farmers reported the cooperative they belong to as their main source of information on management practices. 	An improved perception <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> quality both domestically and internationally will benefit Uganda’s dairy farmers and its dairy industry at large. Consumers must be assured that Uganda’s dairy industry, its government, industry stakeholders such as the Dairy Development Authority, the Uganda National Bureau of Standards, and the private sector place the utmost importance on the quality and safety <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and other dairy products. New technologies to measure for SCC and strict food safety regulations will help improve the country’s milk-quality image, allowing Uganda’s dairy industry to tap into major milk export markets.

Multi-trait random regression models were separately applied to estimate genetic parameters of test-day records for each parity. The model included fixed herd test-day effects, calving age and season effects, and random regressions for additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. Abundance of variation of acetone may provide a more sensitive <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> ketosis than many zero observations in concentration <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> BHBA. Heritabilities <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> BHBA levels ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 17 with a mean of 0. 09 for the interval between 4 and 305 days in milk during three lactations. The average heritabilities for milk acetone concentration were 0. 29, 0. 29, and 0. 22 for parities 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There was no clear genetic association of the concentration of two ketone bodies with three test-day milk production traits, even if some correlations among breeding values of the test-day records in this study were observed. These results suggest that genetic selection for low susceptibility of ketosis in early lactation is possible.

40|$|Foaming can be {{beneficial}} or undesirable {{depending on the}} temperature at/to which milk is foamed. For instance, foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is beneficial when making Italian style coffee such as cappuccino where steam from a steam generator is injected into milk to create a foam and to simultaneously heat the milk to ~ 65  70 °C. Foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is undesirable during operations such as pumping of cold (5 °C) milk in a dairy processing plant. The main objective {{of this study was}} to develop an understanding of the foaming patterns <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and the factors that affect the foaming properties in the temperature range 5  85 °C and use this understanding to devise treatments and additives to improve/reduce the foaming <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> depending on the end stage application. A review of literature showed that very little information was available on the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> as a function of temperature. Moreover a clear gap existed between an understanding of the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> proteins in single or binary systems and the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> per se. Foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> over a broad temperature range were studied using a specially designed foaming apparatus, which enabled foams to be produced under standardised conditions. Foaming patterns of a range <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> which included raw whole milk, pasteurised homogenised full-cream milk, pasteurised skim milk, UHT homogenised full-cream milk, UHT skim milk and reconstituted milks made from low-, medium- and high-heat skim milk powder, were established as a function of temperature (5  85 °C). The foaming properties <b>of</b> a given <b>milk</b> were largely determined by the temperature at which milk was foamed, its fat content, and the processing conditions used during its manufacture. Skim milks had a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C when foamed over a temperature range of 5  85 °C. Image analysis <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams, as observed under a light microscope, showed that the surface <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams coarsened over time. This occurred most rapidly in foams produced at 5 °C and least rapidly in those produced at 45 °C. The foaming properties <b>of</b> full-cream <b>milks</b> were largely determined by the physical state <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat. Milk fat was detrimental to foam formation and stability <b>of</b> full-cream <b>milks</b> when milk fat globules contained both solid and liquid fat i. e. in the temperature range 5  40 °C. The extent of whey protein denaturation had a positive effect on the foam stability <b>of</b> reconstituted <b>milks</b> at lower temperatures (< 45 °C) and a negative correlation with foam stability at higher temperatures When skim milk was separated into its micellar, ultracentrifugal and defatted ultracentrifugal fractions, the foaming pattern <b>of</b> the parent <b>milk</b> as a function of temperature (5  85 °C), resembled that of the micellar fraction, with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C. The foaming pattern of the serum phase <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> could not be determined due to precipitation of calcium, when the defatted ultracentrifugal supernatant was heated to temperatures G 45 °C. The sedimentable interfacial material isolated by low-speed centrifugation <b>of</b> collapsed skim <b>milk</b> foams was made up of large-sized casein micelles; particle size measurements and electrophoretic analysis of this material showed that the stability <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams was mainly determined by the ability of micellar caseins to adsorb and form a stabilising network at the air serum interface of the foams. Addition of calcium-chelating agents, which increased the non-micellar casein content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> decreased foam stability, while addition of calcium salts, which increased the micellar casein content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> increased foam stability, reinforcing the observation that adsorption of micellar caseins is required for the stability <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams. The role of whey proteins in the stabilisation <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams could not be determined from a study of the sedimentable interfacial material, as they were lost in the supernatant during low speed centrifugation <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> foams. Lipolysis as measured by the FFA content <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> had a negative effect on the steam foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> with foamability and foam stability decreasing and the coarseness of foam increasing with an increase in the FFA content. The destabilising effect of the products of lipolysis was higher when milk was foamed at lower temperatures. A good correlation was observed between surface tension, FFA content and foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> However, natural variations in other surface active components <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> such as fat, protein and phospholipids, tend to mask the effect of changing FFA content on the surface tension value <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and as a result it was difficult to arrive at an absolute surface tension value <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> below which foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> were adversely affected. Increasing the total solids content <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> decreased foamability and increased foam stability due to an increase in the viscosity coupled with an increase in the amount of protein available for adsorption at the airserum interface <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foams. As in the case of increasing total solids content, addition of H-carrageenan decreased foamability and increased the foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> due to an increase in viscosity <b>of</b> the <b>milk.</b> Emulsification <b>of</b> oils such as olive, canola and sunflower oils in skim milk using a microfluidiser resulted in a pronounced increase in the foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The foaming patterns <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> containing oil instead <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat resembled that <b>of</b> skim <b>milk</b> with a pronounced foam stability peak at 45 °C. This suggested that lipids which are fully liquid above 0 °C are not detrimental to the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foamed in the temperature range 5  85 °C. The higher foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milks</b> containing added oil, when compared to the parent skim milk, was attributed to an increase in the viscosity <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> as a result of the added oil. Pre-heat treatment <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> to temperatures G 65 °C altered the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The foamability <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> increased with an increase in the temperature of preheat treatment from 65 to 85 °C, while the foam stability was highest when milk was subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65 °C. Lowering of the measurable FFA content <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> by the likely binding of FFA to BSA and I-lactoglobulin, and the lack of whey protein denaturation, could be responsible for the higher foam stability <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> subjected to a pre-heat treatment of 65 °C. The present study represents a significant step forward in understanding the foaming behavior <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> which is determined by the complex interplay between temperature, the structure, conformation and distribution <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> proteins, and the nature of other components <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> such as fat, mineral salts and FFAs. An understanding of the importance of caseins in the stabilisation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> foams and the effect of the physical state <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> fat on the foaming properties <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> achieved in the present study, opens up exciting avenues for the manipulation of the foaming behavior <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> especially to produce specialty milks with improved foaming properties...|$|R

A two-stage multinomial logit model is employed to investigate determinants and effects of market channel choices <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> producers. While modern marketing channels have emerged in the Indian dairy sector, the traditional sector is still dominant. Farmers sell nearly 85 per cent <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> to traditional channels. The share of the modern organized sector is growing but at a slow pace. The dominance of the traditional channel is an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> a very competitive and cost-effective traditional market in linking producers and consumers.

Household's socio-economic variables (farm size, age and education) are important determinants of marketing channel choice {{in the case of the}} modern private sector. Large farmers have better opportunity to participate in modern private channels. Market infrastructure such as road, provision of veterinary services, distance from milk collection centre, markets, milk collection centres, price risks, etc. have significant effect on farmers' marketing choices.

40|$|The {{somatic cell}} count (SCC; leukocytes and {{epithelial}} cells) in milk {{is used as}} an indicator of udder health status. A SCC above the regulatory standard is generally considered as an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> mastitis. Therefore, <b>milk</b> with a SCC equal to or greater than the regulatory limit cannot be sold to the public because it is unsuitable for human consumption. This study was performed to determine whether SCC levels above the regulatory limit observed in goats during late lactation are a physiologic or a pathological response of the goat mammary gland. Differential counts of cells in nonmastitic goat milk samples during late lactation revealed that approximately 80 % of the cells were polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). In addition, microchemotaxis assay results indicated that normal nonmastitic late-lactation-stage goat milk is significantly higher (P < 0. 001) in PMN chemotactic activity than early-lactation-stage goat milk, with a mean chemotactic activity of 14. 9 and 42. 7 /mg of protein for early and late lactation stages, respectively. Physicochemical analyses also suggest that the PMN infiltration observed in normal late-lactation-stage goat milk is due to a PMN chemotactic factor(s) that is different from the PMN chemotactic factor(s) present in mastitic milk. Interestingly, the PMN chemotactic factor in late-lactation-stage goat milk is highly acid resistant (pH 2), suggesting that the factor is able to survive the highly acidic gastric environment and may therefore be important in the augmentation of the immune systems of sucklings. These results indicate that the chemotactic factor(s) present in the <b>milk</b> <b>of</b> normal late-lactation-stage goats is nonpathological and may play a physiologic regulatory role in mammary gland involution. Hence, the regulatory standard for goat milk needs to be redefined in order to reflect this...|$|R

The stimulus for gallbladder contraction was 165 ml <b>of</b> half cream <b>milk.</b> Gallbladder dynamics were studied for 20 minutes following the ingestion <b>of</b> the <b>milk.</b> The mean percentage change in gallbladder volume after 10 and 20 minutes gave <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> gallbladder motility. Results: Moderate and periodic alcohol intake did not stimulate rapid postprandial gallbladder emptying. Conclusion: The protective effect of alcohol against biliary cholesterol cholelithiasis could not be due to stimulation of gallbladder emptying...|$|R

40|$|The study {{conducted}} during 1994 - 95 in Jalgaon and Kolhapur districts of Maharashtra showed two differing scenarios {{insofar as the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> cooperatives on production and marketed surplus is concerned. While milk cooperatives had positive and significant impact on both production and marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> in Kolhapur district, such impact could not be ascertained in Jalgaon district. The study also showed lower production and marketed surplus during summer season followed by rainy and winter seasons. However, the percentage marketed surplus was the highest in summer season followed by winter and rainy seasons. The higher percentage of marketed surplus in summer season was due to lower milk production, higher demand and higher prices offered by various agencies compared to other seasons. On an average, nearly three-fourths <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> produced was sold in extension and two-thirds in control area of both the selected districts. However, this proportion differed in different seasons and herd size categories. An analysis drawn from Marketed Surplus Function (MSF) also showed that total milk production in the household was the single most significant factor contributing to marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The next important variable positively affecting the marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> was the education level {{of the head of}} the household, particularly in control area of both the districts. Further, the negative impact of family size on the marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> could be ascertained only in Kolhapur district. In general, price <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> had very little influence on the marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> Relatively small variation in price <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> within a season {{could be one of the}} reasons for lack of impact of price on marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> Since in the short run there was no possibility <b>of</b> increasing <b>milk</b> production despite variation in prices, the MSF did not show significant influence of prices on marketed surplus <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{elaborated}} a detailed {{review of literature}} to illuminate the importance <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording in breeds of dairy cows, which illustrates the benefits <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording for breeders. The emergence <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording in the Czech Republic dates back to 1905, when it began milk recording {{carried out by the}} Danish model. From the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>milk</b> recording was not met with such great success. Over time, the importance <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording in the Czech Republic grew. Patronage over milk recording over the years was taken by the International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR), which includes the Czech Republic since 1992. The milk recording in the Czech Republic is performed using several methods. Official method A and unofficial methods B and F, wherein the method A is divided into A 4 -P, A 4 -A and A 4 -T. Milk recording in the Czech Republic is performed only properly educated personnel, who takes sample in individual farms. After sampling, the samples are transported and subsequently processed in laboratories for analysis <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> Results <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording are important for the monetization <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and breeding organization. The results of many years of breeding work, the main base are just the results <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording, were the reduction cows and increase milk production. Only the number of cows in lactation period from the year 2005 to 2014 fell by 50, 636 dairy cows. To reduce dairy cows occurred precisely because <b>of</b> the increasing <b>milk</b> production. Larger quantities <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> milked from each cow meant that {{there was no need for}} such a large amount <b>of</b> dairy cattle. <b>Milk</b> production from 2005 to 2014 increased on average by 1, 477 kg, which is the result of breeding work. Importance <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording is currently mainly breeding again. Results <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> recording are used to select animals and to organize and manage the herd. Results of performance tests are also used in numerous researches...|$|R
