5|$|Parents of {{children}} with ASD <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress. Siblings {{of children}} with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings {{of children with}} Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.|$|E
5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E

25|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, women's {{fragrances}} tend to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> aromatic compounds than men's fragrances. Fragrances {{marketed to}} men are typically sold as EdT or EdC, rarely as EdP or perfume extracts. Women's fragrances used to be common in all levels of concentration, but today are mainly seen in parfum, EdP and EdT concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Greyhounds <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> {{red blood}} cells than other breeds. Since {{red blood cells}} carry oxygen to the muscles, this higher level allows the hound to move larger {{quantities}} of oxygen faster from the lungs to the muscles. Conversely, Greyhounds have lower levels of platelets than other breeds. Veterinary blood services often use Greyhounds as universal blood donors.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine examined the health effect of childhood locus of control. 7,500 British adults (followed from birth), who had shown an internal locus of control at age 10, {{were less likely to be}} overweight at age 30. The children who had an internal locus of control also appeared to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> self-esteem.|$|E

25|$|Regional disparities {{and income}} {{inequality}} are {{a feature of}} the Mexican economy. While all constituent states of the federation have a Human Development Index (HDI) higher than 0.70 (medium to high development), the northern and central states <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> HDI than the southern states. Nuevo León, Jalisco and the Federal District have HDI levels similar to European countries, whereas that of Oaxaca and Chiapas {{is similar to that of}} China or Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Women <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parental {{investment}} {{because they}} carry the developing child, and higher {{confidence in their}} maternity since they witness giving birth to the child. Hence women have reason to accept greater responsibility for raising their children. By comparison, males have no objective way of being certain that the child they are raising is biologically theirs. Because of this difference, males have to adapt their own sexual strategies to accommodate the strategies of the females around them.|$|E
25|$|Globally, {{symptomatic}} HAV {{infections are}} believed to occur in around 1.4 million people a year. About 114 million infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) occurred all together in 2015. Acute hepatitis A resulted in 11,200 deaths in 2015. Developed countries have low circulating levels of hepatovirus A, while developing countries <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> circulation. Most adolescents and adults in developing countries have already had the disease, thus are immune. Adults in midlevel countries {{may be at risk}} of disease with the potential of being exposed.|$|E

40|$|Social assets is a {{composite}} score that measures closeness and support from friends and family. Mothers <b>having</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> social assets removes the negative relationship between children’s social, emotional and behavioural (SEB) wellbeing and living in lone/separated families. Furthermore, children living in the lowest household income have SEB wellbeing that extends above the average for all children when their mothers <b>have</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> social assets...|$|R

25|$|Children's {{motivation}} to learn is not solely influenced on {{their desire to}} belong but also their eagerness to see their community succeed. Children from Navajo communities were shown to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> social concern than Anglo American children in their schools. By having high levels of social concern the indigenous children are showing concern for not only their learning but also their peers', which serves {{as an example of}} their instilled sense of responsibility for their community. They wish to succeed as a united group rather than just themselves.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholism {{does not}} have uniform effects on all families. The levels of {{dysfunction}} and resiliency of the non-alcoholic adults are important factors in effects on children in the family. Children of untreated alcoholics score lower on measures of family cohesion, intellectual-cultural orientation, active-recreational orientation, and independence. They <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> conflict within the family, and many experience other family members as distant and non-communicative. In families with untreated alcoholics, {{the cumulative effect of}} the family dysfunction may affect the children's ability to grow in developmentally healthy ways.|$|E
25|$|People {{who lived}} in the PFOA {{contaminated}} area around DuPont's Washington Works Washington, WV facility were found to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> PFOA in their blood from drinking water. The highest PFOA levels in drinking water were found in the Little Hocking water system, with an average concentration of 3.55 parts per billion during 2002–2005. Individuals who drank more tap water, ate locally grown fruits and vegetables, or ate local meat, were all associated with having higher PFOA levels. Residents who used water carbon filter systems had lower PFOA levels.|$|E

25|$|Forms {{of mercury}} {{exposure}} include metal, vapor, salt, and organic compound. Most exposure is from eating fish, amalgam based dental fillings, or exposure at work. In fish, those higher {{up in the}} food chain generally <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> mercury. Less commonly poisoning may occur {{as an attempt to}} end one's life. Human activities that release mercury into the environment include the burning of coal and mining of gold. Tests of the blood, urine, and hair for mercury are available but do not relate well to the amount in the body.|$|E
25|$|Findings {{have shown}} in {{specific}} cases that paranormal belief {{acts as a}} psychodynamic coping function {{and serves as a}} mechanism for coping with stress. Survivors from childhood sexual abuse, violent and unsettled home environments have reported to <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> paranormal belief. A study of a random sample of 502 adults revealed paranormal experiences were common in the population which were linked to a history of childhood trauma and dissociative symptoms. Research has also suggested that people who perceive themselves as having little control over their lives may develop paranormal beliefs to help provide an enhanced sense of control.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{are less}} willing to state they have {{negative}} feelings about sex than girls when they describe their sexual self-schemas. Boys are not divided into positive and negative sexual self-concepts; they are divided into schematic and non-schematic (a schema is a cluster of ideas about a process or aspect of the world; see schema). Boys who are sexually schematic are more sexually experienced, <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> sexual arousal, and are more able to experience romantic feelings. Boys who are not schematic have fewer sexual partners, a smaller range of sexual experiences and are much less likely than schematic men {{to be in a}} romantic relationship.|$|E
