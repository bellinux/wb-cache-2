2500|$|The United States adopted two anti-boycott {{laws that}} seek to {{counteract}} the participation of U.S. citizens in other nation's economic boycotts or embargoes (although these laws do not restrict the ability to engage in disinvestment campaigns.) These laws are the 1977 amendments to the Export Administration Act (EAA) and the Ribicoff Amendment to the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (TRA). The antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) apply to all [...] "U.S. persons," [...] defined to include individuals and companies located in the United States and their <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates,</b> and prohibit {{them to participate in}} unsanctioned boycotts against other nations, punishable by fines of up to $50,000 or five times the value of the exports involved or jail term of up to 10 years.|$|E
2500|$|He {{supports}} U.S. political {{intervention and}} {{economic sanctions against}} state sponsors of terrorism. Santorum views [...] "Islamic-fascism" [...] in Iran {{as the center of}} the [...] "world's conflict", and his geo-political strategy for peace involves the United States promoting [...] "a strong Lebanon, a strong Israel, and a strong Iraq." [...] He sponsored the Syria Accountability Act of 2003 to require Syria cease all activity with Lebanon and end all support for terrorism. In 2005, Santorum sponsored the Iran Freedom and Support Act, which appropriated $10 million aimed at regime change in Iran. The Act passed with overwhelming support. However, Santorum nevertheless voted against the Lautenberg amendment, which would have closed the loophole that allows companies like Halliburton to do business with Iran through their <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates.</b> Santorum reflected on his last year in the Senate as one spent talking a lot about Iran, and was characterized by The Atlantic Wire as an [...] "extreme hawk" [...] in his approach with Iran. Santorum stated that Iran was the creator of Hezbollah and the driving force of Hamas. He said Iran {{was at the center of}} [...] "much of the world's conflict" [...] but he was opposed to direct military action against the country in 2006. Santorum was one of only two senators who voted against confirming the nomination of Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. Santorum stated that his objection was to Gates' support for talking with Iran and Syria, because it would be an error to talk with radical Islamists.|$|E

We emphasize the strong links between service FDI and trade, since a large proportion of trade is facilitated through <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliate</b> sales. Trade barriers and corruption in the importing country have a strong negative impact on service trade and <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliate</b> sales. We find a strong home market effect in service trade, and rich countries do not tend to import more, which may indicate that rich countries have a competitive advantage in service trade.

Using comprehensive firm-level panel data of German multinationals, we investigate how changes in a host country 2 ̆ 019 s patent protection influence the extensive and intensive margin of foreign direct investment (FDI) decisions. We isolate the effect of patent protection by estimating a difference-in-difference type approach and controlling for an extensive set of fixed effects. At the extensive margin, we find that strengthening patent protection increases the probability of locating a <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliate,</b> whereby the effect is stronger for firms that highly depend on patent protection. The effect depends further on a host country 2 ̆ 019 s initial legal and economic development. Given that a parent has established a <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliate,</b> no systematic effects of patent protection are found for the decision on how much {{to invest in the}} affiliate at the intensive margin.
