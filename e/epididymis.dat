25|$|The non-motile {{spermatozoa}} are {{transported to}} the <b>epididymis</b> in testicular fluid secreted by the Sertoli cells {{with the aid of}} peristaltic contraction. While in the <b>epididymis</b> the spermatozoa gain motility and become capable of fertilization. However, transport of the mature spermatozoa through the remainder of the male reproductive system is achieved via muscle contraction rather than the spermatozoon's recently acquired motility.|$|E
25|$|Epididymitis, {{a painful}} {{inflammation}} of the <b>epididymis</b> or epididymides frequently caused by bacterial infection but sometimes of unknown origin.|$|E

25|$|In {{surgical}} sperm retrieval (SSR) {{the reproductive}} urologist obtains sperm from the vas deferens, <b>epididymis</b> or {{directly from the}} testis in a short outpatient procedure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the duct persists, and forms the tube of the <b>epididymis,</b> the ductus deferens and the {{ejaculatory}} duct, while the seminal vesicle arises {{during the third}} month as a lateral diverticulum from its hinder end. A {{large part of the}} head end of the mesonephros atrophies and disappears; of the remainder the anterior tubules form the efferent ducts of the testis; while the posterior tubules are represented by the ductuli aberrantes, and by the paradidymis, which is sometimes found in front of the spermatic cord above the head of the <b>epididymis.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{factor contributing to}} infertility is {{the high rate of}} anomalies of the <b>epididymis</b> in boys with cryptorchidism (over 90% in some studies). Even after orchiopexy, these may also affect sperm maturation and motility at an older age.|$|E
25|$|Amiodarone is {{sometimes}} responsible for epididymitis, {{a condition of}} the <b>epididymis,</b> and is normally associated with bacterial infections but which can also occur as a non-bacterial inflammatory condition. Amiodarone accumulates in {{the head of the}} organ and can cause unilateral or bilateral inflammation. It tends to resolve if amiodarone is stopped.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of testicular cancer requires examining the histology of tissue obtained from an inguinal orchiectomy - that is, surgical excision {{of the entire}} testis along with attached structures (<b>epididymis</b> and spermatic cord). A biopsy should not be performed, as it raises the risk of spreading cancer cells into the scrotum.|$|E

Using a {{piezoelectric}} polymer that will deform {{when exposed to}} a specific electric field broadcast from a key fob (like a car alarm) the valve will open or close, preventing the passage of sperm, but not seminal fluid. Located in {{a section of the}} vas deferens that occurs just after the <b>epididymis,</b> the implantation can be carried out by use of a hypodermic needle.|$|E
25|$|Gonorrhea, also spelled gonorrhoea, is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Many people have no symptoms. Men may have burning with urination, discharge from the penis, or testicular pain. Women may have burning with urination, vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding between periods, or pelvic pain. Complications in women include pelvic inflammatory disease and in men include inflammation of the <b>epididymis.</b> If untreated, gonorrhea can spread to joints or heart valves.|$|E
25|$|In men, {{inflammation}} of the <b>epididymis,</b> prostate gland, and urethra can result from untreated gonorrhea. In women, the most common result of untreated gonorrhea is pelvic inflammatory disease. Other complications include {{inflammation of}} the tissue surrounding the liver, a rare complication associated with Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome; septic arthritis in the fingers, wrists, toes, and ankles; septic abortion; chorioamnionitis during pregnancy; neonatal or adult blindness from conjunctivitis; and infertility. Men {{who have had a}} gonorrhea infection have an increased risk of getting prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|The androgens {{function}} as paracrine hormones {{required by the}} Sertoli cells to support sperm production. They are also required for masculinization of the developing male fetus (including penis and scrotum formation). Under the influence of androgens, remnants of the mesonephron, the Wolffian ducts, develop into the <b>epididymis,</b> vas deferens and seminal vesicles. This action of androgens {{is supported by a}} hormone from Sertoli cells, Müllerian inhibitory hormone (MIH), which prevents the embryonic Müllerian ducts from developing into fallopian tubes and other female reproductive tract tissues in male embryos. MIH and androgens cooperate to allow for movement of testes into the scrotum.|$|E
25|$|Gap Junctions {{have been}} {{observed}} in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in crayfish nerves, rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, <b>epididymis,</b> duodenum, muscle, Daphnia hepatic caecum, Hydra muscle, monkey retina, rabbit cornea, fish blastoderm, frog embryos, rabbit ovary, re-aggregating cells, cockroach hemocyte capsules, rabbit skin, chick embryos, human islet of Langerhans, goldfish and hamster pressure sensing acoustico-vestibular receptors, lamprey and tunicate heart, rat seminiferous tubules, myometrium, eye lens and cephalopod digestive epithelium. Since the 1970s gap junctions have continued {{to be found in}} nearly all animal cells that touch each other. By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Gap junctions appear to be in all animal organs and tissues and {{it will be interesting to}} find exceptions to this other than cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases this may not be the case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions. An indication of what results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers or the aging process.|$|E

2500|$|Spermatogenesis {{takes place}} within several {{structures}} of the male reproductive system. The initial stages occur within the testes and progress to the <b>epididymis</b> where the developing gametes mature and are stored until ejaculation. The seminiferous tubules of the testes are {{the starting point for}} the process, where spermatogonial stem cells adjacent to the inner tubule wall divide in a centripetal directionbeginning at the walls and proceeding into the innermost part, or lumento produce immature sperm. Maturation occurs in the <b>epididymis.</b> The location [...] is specifically important as the process of spermatogenesis requires a lower temperature to produce viable sperm, specifically 1°-8°C lower than normal body temperature of 37°C (98.6°F). Clinically, small fluctuations in temperature such as from an athletic support strap, causes no impairment in sperm viability or count.|$|E
2500|$|The {{species are}} {{moderately}} sexually dimorphic with males usually being slightly larger, much heavier, and having larger canines than females. The largest {{difference between the}} opossum and non-marsupial mammals is the bifurcated penis of the male and bifurcated vagina of the female (the source of the term [...] "didelphimorph," [...] from the Greek [...] "didelphys," [...] meaning double-wombed). Opossum spermatozoa exhibit sperm-pairing, forming conjugate pairs in the <b>epididymis.</b> This may ensure that flagella movement can be accurately coordinated for maximal motility. Conjugate pairs dissociate into separate spermatozoa before fertilization.|$|E
2500|$|The testes {{are covered}} by a tough {{membranous}} shell called the tunica albuginea. Within the testes are very fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. The tubules are lined {{with a layer of}} cells (germ cells) that develop from puberty through old age into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes). The developing sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the <b>epididymis</b> where newly created sperm cells mature (see spermatogenesis). [...] The sperm move into the vas deferens, and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the urethral orifice through muscular contractions.|$|E
2500|$|The CFTR gene {{codes for}} an ABC transporter-class ion channel protein that conducts {{chloride}} [...] and thiocyanate ions across epithelial cell membranes. Mutations of the CFTR gene affecting chloride ion channel function lead to dysregulation of epithelial fluid transport in the lung, pancreas and other organs, resulting in cystic fibrosis. Complications include thickened mucus {{in the lungs}} with frequent respiratory infections, and pancreatic insufficiency giving rise to malnutrition and diabetes. These conditions lead to chronic disability and reduced life expectancy. [...] In male patients, the progressive obstruction and destruction of the developing vas deferens (spermatic cord) and <b>epididymis</b> appear to result from abnormal intraluminal secretions, causing congenital absence of the vas deferens and male infertility.|$|E
2500|$|Mice {{have eight}} major adipose depots, four {{of which are}} within the {{abdominal}} cavity. The paired gonadal depots {{are attached to the}} uterus and ovaries in females and the <b>epididymis</b> and testes in males; the paired retroperitoneal depots are found along the dorsal wall of the abdomen, surrounding the kidney, and, when massive, extend into the pelvis. [...] The mesenteric depot forms a glue-like web that supports the intestines and the omental depot (which originates near the stomach and spleen) and- when massive- extends into the ventral abdomen. [...] Both the mesenteric and omental depots incorporate much lymphoid tissue as lymph nodes and milky spots, respectively. [...] The two superficial depots are the paired inguinal depots, which are found anterior to the upper segment of the hind limbs (underneath the skin) and the subscapular depots, paired medial mixtures of brown adipose tissue adjacent to regions of white adipose tissue, which are found under the skin between the dorsal crests of the scapulae. [...] The layer of brown adipose tissue in this depot is often covered by a [...] "frosting" [...] of white adipose tissue; sometimes these two types of fat (brown and white) are hard to distinguish. [...] The inguinal depots enclose the inguinal group of lymph nodes. [...] Minor depots include the pericardial, which surrounds the heart, and the paired popliteal depots, between the major muscles behind the knees, each containing one large lymph node. [...] Of all the depots in the mouse, the gonadal depots are the largest and the most easily dissected, comprising about 30% of dissectible fat.|$|E

60|$|Section 19. The {{student should}} now compare the figures on Sheet 17. In the male, tubular {{connections}} are established between the testes {{and the middle}} part of the primitive kidney (mesonephros). These connections are the vasa efferentia (v.e.), and the mesonephros is now equivalent to the <b>epididymis</b> of the rabbit. The Wolffian duct is the urogenital duct of the adult, and the Mullerian duct is entirely absorbed, or remains, more or less, in exceptional cases.|$|E
60|$|Figure 3. A {{generalized}} {{diagram of}} the uro-genital organs.-- All references in text. Ms., the mesonephros, is the <b>epididymis</b> in the male, and is reduced in the female; Ms.d., its duct, is the vas deferens in the male, and persists only as the urinary receptacle in the female. Mt. and Mt.d., the metanephros and metanephric duct, become the functional kidney and ureter in both sexes. G. is the gonad (reproductive gland), and M.L. the animal's middle line (median plane). -Ps.-, [Pr.,] the pronephros, is never developed in the Dog-fish; P.d., its supposed duct, is the oviduct of the female, and is suppressed in the male.|$|E
60|$|Section 140. In {{the male}} we find, in the {{position}} of the female uterus, a uterus masculinus (u.m.). The essential sexual organ is the testis (T.), a compact mass of coiling tubuli, which opens by a number of ducts, the vasa efferentia, into a looser and softer <b>epididymis</b> (ep.), which sends the sexual product onward through a vas deferens (v.d.), to open {{at the base of the}} uterus masculinus. The urinary bladder and ureters correspond with those of the female, and the common urogenital duct (= vestibule), the urethra, is prolonged into an erectile penis (P.) surrounded by a fold of skin, the prepuce. A prostate gland (pr.), contributes to the male sexual fluid. The character of the essential male element, the spermatozoon, the general nature of the reproductive process, will be conveniently deferred until the chapters upon development are reached.|$|E
60|$|Section 16. The uro-genital {{organs of}} the frog, and {{especially}} those of the male, correspond with embryonic stages of the rabbit. In this sex the testes (T., Sheet 13) lie in the body cavity, and are white bodies usually dappled with black pigment. Vasa efferentia (v.e.) run to the internal border of the anterior part of the kidney, which answers, therefore, to the rabbit's <b>epididymis.</b> The hinder part of the kidney is the predominant renal organ. There is a common uro-genital duct, into which a seminal vesicle, which is especially large in early spring, opens. This is the permanent condition of the frog. In the rabbit, for urogenital duct, we have ureter and vas deferens; the testes and that anterior part of the primitive kidney, the <b>epididymis,</b> shift back into the scrotal sacs, and the ureters shift round the rectum and establish a direct connection with the bladder, carrying the genital ducts looped over them. The oviducts of the female do not fuse distally to form a median vagina {{as they do in}} the rabbit. In front of the genital organ in both sexes is a corpus adiposum (c.ad.), which acts as a fat store, and is peculiar to the frogs and toads. The distal end of the oviduct of the female is in the breeding season (early March) enormously distended with ova, and the ovaries become then the mere vestiges of their former selves. The distal end of the oviduct is, therefore, not unfrequently styled the uterus. There is no penis in the male, fertilisation of the ova occurring as they are squeezed out of the female by the embracing fore limbs of the male. The male has a pad, black in winter, shown in Figure 1, which is closely pressed against the ventral surface of the female in copulation, and which serves as a ready means of distinguishing the sex.|$|E
60|$|Section 18. The uro-genital {{organs of}} the female dog-fish (Figure 1, Sheet 17) consist of an {{unpaired}} ovary (ov.), paired oviducts (o.d.), enlarged at one point to form an oviducal gland (o.d.g.), kidneys (k.), with ureters (ur.) uniting to form a urinary sinus (u.s.) opening into the cloaca by a median urinary papilla separate from the oviducal openings. The eggs contain much yolk, and, {{like those of the}} fowl, are very large; like the fowl, too, one of the ovaries is suppressed, and it is the right ovary that alone remains. The two oviducts meet in front of the liver ventral to the oesophagus, and have there a common opening by which the ova are received after being shed into the body cavity. The eggs receive an oblong horny case in the oviduct; in the figure such a case is figured as distending the duct at e. The testes of the male (T. in Figure 2) are partially confluent in the middle line. They communicate through vasa efferentia (v.e.) with the modified anterior part of the kidney, the <b>epididymis</b> (ep.), from which the vas deferens (v.) runs to the median uro-genital sinus (u.g.s.), into which the ureters (ur.) also open. The silvery peritoneum (lining of the body cavity) covers over the reddish kidneys, and hides them in dissection.|$|E
60|$|Section 19. Figure 3, Sheet 17, is a {{generalized}} {{diagram of the}} uro-genital organs in the vertebrata; M.L. is the middle line of the body, G. is the genital organ, Pr. is the pronephros, or fore kidney, a structure which is never developed in the dog-fish, but which has functional importance in the tadpole and cod, and appears as a transitory rudiment in the chick. A duct, which is often spoken of as the pronephric duct (p.d.), and which we have figured under that name, is always developed. Anteriorly it opens into the body cavity. It is also called the Mullerian duct, and in {{the great majority of}} vertebrata it becomes the oviduct, uniting with its fellow, {{in the case of the}} dog-fish, ventral to the oesophagus. In the male it usually disappears; the uterus masculinus of the rabbit is still very generally regarded as a vestige of it. Kolliker has shown, however, that this interpretation is improbable. Ms. is the mesonephros, some or all of which becomes the <b>epididymis</b> in the male of types possessing that organ, and is connected with G. by the vasa efferentia. Mt., the metanephros, is, in -actual fact- [the frog], indistinguishably continuous with Ms., and is the functional kidney, its duct (metanephric duct) being either undifferentiated from the mesonephric (as is the case with the frog) or largely split off from it, as in the dog-fish, to form the ureter.|$|E

50|$|ADAM7 {{expression}} is localized in mammalian <b>epididymis</b> cells. Expression of ADAM7 {{is higher in}} the head (Caput) of the <b>epididymis</b> and decreases in cells towards the distal <b>epididymis.</b> ADAM7 is also present in mature sperm cell membranes of mice. Thus, ADAM7 is synthesized in the <b>epididymis</b> and transferred to the maturing sperm cell membrane. mRNA transcripts are highly expressed in testes leydig cells as well.|$|E
50|$|ADAM7 is {{synthesized}} in <b>epididymis</b> {{cells and}} transferred to the membrane of immature sperm cells as they traverse the <b>epididymis</b> during ejaculation. Epithelial cells of the <b>epididymis</b> incorporate ADAM7 into their membrane normally like other integral membrane protein. Portions of the membrane are secreted as exosome vesicles. Secretion in this manner is an apocrine secretion in which apical blebs containing {{a portion of the}} <b>epididymis</b> cell are released from the cell. The apical blebs then encounter the immature sperm cell membrane within the convoluted tubules of the <b>epididymis.</b> The apical bleb and immature sperm cell membrane then fuse, ultimately incorporating ADAM7 into the sperm cell membrane.|$|E

50|$|The {{appendix}} of the <b>epididymis</b> (or pedunculated hydatid) {{is a small}} stalked appendage (sometimes duplicated) on {{the head}} of the <b>epididymis.</b> It is usually regarded as a detached efferent duct.|$|E
50|$|Spermatozoa {{formed in}} the testis enter the caput <b>epididymis,</b> {{progress}} to the corpus, and finally reach the cauda region, where they are stored. Sperm entering the caput <b>epididymis</b> are incomplete—they lack the ability to swim forward (motility) and to fertilize an egg. It stores the sperm for 2-3 months. During their transit in the <b>epididymis,</b> sperm undergo maturation processes necessary for them to acquire these functions. Final maturation is completed in the female reproductive tract (capacitation). The <b>epididymis</b> secretes some proteins that blocks the receptors on the plasma membrane of sperm head which renders sperm infertile inside the male tract (decapacitation).|$|E
