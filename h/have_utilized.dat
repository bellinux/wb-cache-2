5|$|Throughout history, humans <b>have</b> <b>utilized</b> fish {{as a food}} source. Historically and today, most {{fish protein}} has come by means of {{catching}} wild fish. However, aquaculture, or fish farming, which has been practiced since about 3,500 BCE. in China, is becoming increasingly important in many nations. Overall, about one-sixth of the world's protein {{is estimated to be}} provided by fish. That proportion is considerably elevated in some developing nations and regions heavily dependent on the sea. In a similar manner, fish have been tied to trade.|$|E
5|$|Government {{agencies}} {{in both the}} USA and Canada <b>have</b> <b>utilized</b> a native species of parasitoid wasp, Cerceris fumipennis, {{as a means of}} detecting areas to which emerald ash borer has spread. The females of these wasps hunt other jewel beetles and emerald ash borer if it is present. The wasps stun the beetles and carry them back to their burrows in the ground where they are stored until the wasps’ eggs hatch and the wasp larvae feed on the beetles. Volunteers catch the wasps as they return to their burrows carrying the beetles to determine whether emerald ash borer is present. This methodology is known as biological surveillance, as opposed to biological control, because it does not appear that the wasps have a significant negative impact on emerald ash borer populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{ten years}} after the eastern {{extension}} of Route 37 was canceled, RIDOT began planning studies for a western extension of the freeway. The expressway was included in a proposal to extend I-84 eastward from Hartford, Connecticut to Providence; more northern alignments for the freeway had been rejected due to concerns of potential damage to the Scituate Reservoir. The southern routing of I-84, which would <b>have</b> <b>utilized</b> Route 37 and terminated in Warwick, largely bypassed the reservoir's watershed. In 1982, however, I-84 was officially canceled by RIDOT after studies indicated that the southern alignment was not a feasible alternative.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the König-class battleships would be powered by {{two sets of}} turbines on the outer shafts, while the center shaft would <b>have</b> <b>utilized</b> a MAN 6-cylinder 2-stroke diesel engine producing 12,000shp at 150rpm. Development of the diesel was protracted, however, and it was later decided that the diesel would be installed only in Grosser Kurfürst and Markgraf. Ultimately, the diesel was never installed {{in any of the}} König-class battleships. They were instead equipped with three sets of Parsons (König and Kronprinz), AEG-Vulcan (Grosser Kurfürst), or Bergmann (Markgraf) turbines driving 3.8m-wide three-bladed screws. Steam was supplied by three oil-fired and 12 coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft boilers operating at up to 16atmospheres of pressure.|$|E
5|$|On 2 January an {{emergency}} meeting {{was held at}} the Independence Palace in Saigon between President Thiệu, the Joint General Staff, and General Dong. At the meeting, Dong presented a plan for the relief of Phước Long that would <b>have</b> <b>utilized</b> either an infantry division or the Airborne Division. The plan was turned down for three reasons: first, there were simply no reserve forces of sufficient size available anywhere in the country for the task; second, with all overland routes in enemy hands, all movements and logistics would have to depend entirely on airlift, a capability that no longer existed; and third, despite advantageous defensive positions, the forces at Phước Long could not hold off two communist divisions long enough for any relief effort to succeed. The decision was then reached. Phước Long City and province would be surrendered to North Vietnamese forces as a matter of expediency, since it was considered to be strategically less important than Tây Ninh, Pleiku, or Huế – economically, politically, and demographically.|$|E
