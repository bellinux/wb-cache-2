40|$|GF- 145 {{contains}} the active ingredients isoxaben (610 g ai/kg) and <b>florasulam</b> (40 g ai/kg) and is formulated as a Wettable Granule (WG). The active ingredients {{are found in}} commercial products such as Primus™ 2 (<b>florasulam),</b> Starane XL™ (fluroxypyr + <b>florasulam),</b> Ariane C™ (fluroxypyr + <b>florasulam</b> + clopyralid) or Flexidor™ (isoxaben). While <b>florasulam</b> has been widely used in cereal crops in recent years, isoxaben offers a new mode of action (MOA) for use in German cereal herbicides even when considering that Flexidor™ has had regulatory approval in 1988 to 1991. The MOA of isoxaben is inhibition of cellulose synthesis (HRAC class L), while <b>florasulam</b> inhibits Acetolactate Synthase (ALS) and is {{a representative of the}} HRAC class B. It is known that <b>florasulam</b> works through uptake by green leaves. Isoxaben is a herbicide with soil activity and with a very low activity when foliar applied, except on some species in the cruciferae family. GF- 145 is intended to be applied in the autumn in cereals (wheat, barley, rye, triticale) for the control of ALS resistant volunteer oil seed rape and annual dicotyledonous weeds including Matricaria spp., Stellaria media, Papaver rhoeas, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Myosotis arvensis, Lamium spp., Galium aparine, Veronica spp. and others when applied at early post-emergence from BBCH 10 to 13 of the crop. The use rate in winter cereals is 95 g product/ha (58 g ai/ha isoxaben plus 3. 75 g ai/ha <b>florasulam).</b> Field trials conducted in previous years confirmed excellent selectivity in all cereal crops and efficacy trials initiated in autumn 2012 show that GF- 145 provides excellent and superior control to ALS resistant oil seed rape that was better than straight <b>florasulam</b> and other ALS active ingredients. GF- 145 adds a new MOA to the cereal herbicide portfolio and controls volunteer oil seed rape, cruciferous weeds and broad-leaved weeds and is more robust than <b>florasulam</b> based products that do not contain isoxaben...|$|E
40|$|POLAR* (GF- 2463 =Dow 24630 H) {{contains}} the active ingredients <b>florasulam</b> and clopyralid both well known substances found in commercial {{products such as}} Primus* 3 (<b>florasulam),</b> Starane XL* (<b>florasulam,</b> fluroxypyr), Ariane C* (<b>florasulam,</b> fluroxypyr, clopyralid) or Lontrel* (clopyralid). POLAR* has a broad dicotyledonous weed spectrum and controls Galium aparine, Matricaria spp., Centaurea cyanus, Stellaria media, cruciferous weeds (Brassica spp. and others), Polygonum spp., Solanum nigrum and other weeds when applied post-emergence in spring. Increasingly important weeds in cereal production such as C. cyanus as well as G. aparine and Matricaria spp. at late growth stages can be controlled very efficiently at BBCH 13 to 32 in winter cereals and at BBCH 13 to 30 in spring cereals. POLAR* is formulated as a Suspension Concentrate (SC) with a target dose rate of 200 ml/ha (60 g ai/ha clopyralid + 5 g ai/ha <b>florasulam)</b> in winter and spring cereals. It combines two modes of action: Auxin-like (clopyralid) and acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors (<b>florasulam)</b> and can be safely applied in spring (soft and hard) and winter wheat, spring and winter barley, spring oats, winter rye, winter triticale and spelt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Field {{experiments}} {{carried out}} in the 2005 – 2007 time period were aimed at assessing the use of competitive potential against weeds of spring cereals cultivated in mixtures, for the purpose of reducing the herbicide application selected for the research. In the experiments, a mixture of the active substances, <b>florasulam</b> + 2, 4 D (Mustang 306 SE), was applied at a recommended dose (0. 5 l/ha) and then at a reduced dose (0. 3 l/ha). The research objects were the spring wheat cultivar Bryza, spring barley cultivar Antek, and oat cultivar Cwał. The cereals were grown in two-species mixtures, and in pure sowing. The effect of a decreased herbicide dose was com-pared to the effect of the recommended dose, and the control. The research included two-time analysis of crop weed infestation (weed species composition, number, and fresh weight of weeds), determination of the number of productive culms, number of grains per ear (panicle), the thousand grain weight, and grain yield of spring cereals. The obtained results confirmed that spring cereals cultivated in mixtures had a higher competitive potential against weeds in comparison with individual species which were pure sowed. The use of the reduced herbicide dose proved to be effective in weed control and ensured a significant increase in grain yields of spring cereals. The applied herbicide doses did not affect grain number per ear and the thousand grain weight.

40|$|Arylex™ active {{is a new}} auxinic {{herbicide}} for postemergence {{control of}} a range of important broadleaf weeds in cereals. It has been discovered and developed by Dow AgroSciences globally as a first member of the new ‘arylpicolinate‘ structural class. Arylex applied together with safener brings excellent crop safety and due to the rapid degradation in soil and plant tissue it does not limit the following crop choice. In Europe the first two herbicides containing this active are Zypar™ and Pixxaro™ EC. Zypar is a premix of Arylex and <b>florasulam,</b> delivering at the 1 L/ha maximum use rate 6 g ae/ha of Arylex and 5 g/ha of <b>florasulam.</b> It can be applied to all cereals, apart from oats, in autumn and spring. Spring application is allowed from BBCH 13 till BBCH 45, however the best performance is reached up to BBCH 32. Zypar’s spectrum of controlled weeds is very wide. Pixxaro EC is a combination of Arylex and fluroxypyr and at 0. 5 l/ha dose rate delivers 6 g ae/ha of Arylex and 140 g ae/ha of fluroxypyr. It can be applied in all cereals, apart from oats, in spring from BBCH 13 till BBCH 45, while the best performance is observed between BBCH 30 and 45. Pixxaro EC shows excellent efficacy against key weeds, especially Galium aparine and at all growth stages. This herbicide brings a novel non-ALS solution and will be a key component of anti-resistance strategies for broadleaf weeds in cereals...|$|E

The main electrospray interface (ESI) parameters (nebulizer pressure, dry gas flow rate, dry gas temperature and composition of the sheath liquid) are optimized using a central composite design. To increase the sensitivity of the CE-MS method, an off-line sample preconcentration procedure based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) is combined with an on-line stacking procedure (i. e. normal stacking mode, NSM). Samples could be injected up to 100 seconds, providing limits of detection (LODs) down to 74 μg/L, i. e., in the low ppb level, with relative standard deviation values (RSD,...|$|E
40|$|The first ALS {{resistant}} Matricaria chamomilla (MATCH) biotype {{was found}} in 2006 in Schleswig Holstein in Witzwort (SCHLEICH-SAIDFAR et al., 2011). Since 2006 ALS resistant Matricaria chamomilla and Matricaria inodora (MATIN) were found at other locations near the North Sea coastline in Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony (ULBER et al., 2012). As there were more and more cases of reduced efficacy of sulfonylureas on mayweed, Dow AgroSciences decided in 2012 and 2013 to test MATCH and MATIN samples in Germany. In 2012 seed samples collected by Dow AgroSciences were planted in greenhouse environment and treated with tribenuron or <b>florasulam.</b> As a second step plants were checked for mutations of the ALS gene at positions Pro 197 and Thr 574 via Pyrosequencing. In Europe there is no known case of metabolic ALS-resistance (ULBER et al., 2012). It was found that mayweed plants showed a mutation at position Pro 197 only. In 2013 leaf samples were taken only and investigated for mutations of ALS position Pro 197 and Thr 574...|$|E
40|$|Mixed {{population}} of different biotypes of C. arvense {{can be found}} in the cereal fields in Eastern Europe. Three biotypes were identified taxonomically: var. arvense; var. horridum, and var. vestitum. Out of the three identified biotypes, only var. arvense showed more sensitivity to chlorsulfuron, while the other two biotypes were less sensitive. There was no difference in the germination behaviour of the biotypes, thus all varieties can be present on the field at the same time. The less sensitive biotypes have a thicker cuticle and less stoma on the leaves than the more sensitive one. There is no significant difference between sensitive and resistant biotypes in absorption and translocation of the 14 C chlorsulfuron and <b>florasulam.</b> Sensitivity of the ALS-enzyme was significantly reduced in the resistant biotypes, although the enzyme still functions. Since that cereal fields in Eastern Europe are infested with C. arvense biotypes with different susceptibilities to chlorsulfuron, it is important to consider resistance management when selecting herbicides. Selection pressure for ALS resistance can be reduced by including other herbicides with an alternative mode of action; as tank mixes, premixes, or separate applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the diversity of}} mechanisms conferring resistance to herbicides inhibiting acetolactate synthase (ALS) in corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas L.) and the processes underlying the selection for resistance. Six mutant ALS alleles, Arg 197, His 197, Leu 197, Ser 197, Thr 197 and Leu 574 were identified in five Italian populations. Different alleles were found in a same population or a same plant. Comparison of individual plant phenotype (herbicide sensitivity) and genotype (amino-acid substitution(s) at codon 197) showed that all mutant ALS alleles conferred dominant resistance to the field rate of the sulfonylurea tribenuron and moderate or no resistance to the field rate of the triazolopyrimidine <b>florasulam.</b> Depending on the allele, dominant or partially dominant resistance to the field rate of the imidazolinone imazamox was observed. Putative non-target-site resistance mechanisms were also likely present in the populations investigated. The derived Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence assays targeting ALS codons crucial for herbicide sensitivity developed in this work will facilitate the detection of resistance due to mutant ALS alleles. Nucleotide variation around codon 197 indicated that mutant ALS alleles evolved by multiple, independent appearances. Resistance to ALS inhibitors in P. rhoeas clearly evolved by redundant evolution {{of a set of}} mutant ALS alleles and likely of non-target-site mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if the presence of two ALS inhibiting herbicide residues in three Saskatchewan soils would result in an additive, synergistic, or antagonistic interaction. This was determined through field trials where herbicides were applied sequentially over the course of two years and through dose-response modelling. The herbicides examined in these experiments were imazamethabenz, flucarbazone-sodium, sulfosulfuron, and <b>florasulam,</b> each in combination with imazamox/imazethapyr. The phytotoxicity and persistence of the herbicides in soil was assessed using an Oriental mustard root inhibition bioassay. The determination of herbicide interaction was made through the comparison of the experimentally observed values to theoretically expected values derived from a mathematical equation. The dose response curves created by placing incremental concentrations of these herbicides in soil were compared using the I 50 parameter, which is the concentration resulting in a 50 % reduction in root length. It appeared that soil organic matter followed by soil pH had the greatest effect in reducing herbicide residue phytotoxicity in the tested soils. Based on the bioassay analysis of sequentially applied ALS inhibiting herbicides, it is proposed that the phytotoxic effect of herbicide residues in soil result in additive injury effects rather than synergistic or antagonistic interactions...|$|E
40|$|Fifty {{corn poppy}} (Papaver rhoeas L.) populations from winter wheat fields of {{northern}} Greece (Districts of Thessaloniki, Kilkis and Serres) were evaluated in pot experiments for possible development {{of resistance to}} tribenuron and multiple resistance to the herbicides 2, 4 -D and bromoxynil. In addition, pot rate response experiments were also conducted to study the resistance ratio of corn poppy populations to tribenuron and their possible cross-resistance ratio to the ALS-inhibiting herbicides pyrithiobac, imazamox, and <b>florasulam.</b> The results of the tribenuron resistance experiments indicated that the application of this herbicide at four {{times higher than the}} recommended rate reduced growth of 28 out of 50 populations by 0 - 28 % (were characterised as resistant populations, R), while the application of the recommended rate of the same herbicide (tribenuron) reduced the growth {{of the rest of the}} populations (22) by 76 - 100 % (were characterised as susceptible populations, S). All populations were controlled by the recommended rate of the herbicides 2, 4 - D and bromoxynil, suggesting lack of multiple resistance. The results of the rate response experiments indicated that the resistance level varied among the 28 R populations. More specifically, the tribenuron rate needed for 50 % reduction of the R plant’s fresh weight (GR 50) ranged from 41 to > 720 g ha- 1, while the respective rate for the S populations ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 8 g ha- 1. The pyrithiobac, imazamox and <b>florasulam</b> GR 50 values for the susceptible population were 0. 9, 1. 4 and 1 g ha- 1 respectively, while their respective range of GR 50 for the seven resistant populations was 20 to > 960, 53 to 427, and 46 to 139 g ha- 1. The resistance level of the tested corn poppy populations, calculated as the ratio (R/S) of the estimated GR 50 value of each herbicide for each R population divided by the respective GR 50 value of the susceptible population ‘Th- 01 F’ originating from the University farm, ranged for tribenuron form 137 to > 2400, while the respective range of R/S values for pyrithiobac, imazamox and <b>florasulam</b> were 13 - > 107, 3, 8 - > 30, 5 and 4, 6 - > 13, 9. Two similar field experiments were also conducted to study the effect of the resistance trait and the geographical origin on the growth rate of eight R and eight S corn poppy populations (collected from field margins, non cultivated areas or road borders adjacent to the fields of the R populations) originating from wheat cultivating areas of the districts of Thessaloniki, Kilkis, and Serres. The plants of each population were planted in equally spacing hills (honeycomb design) and in distance that allowed the plant growth without competition. Growth rate was evaluated by recording the fresh weight of each population at 81, 89, 99, 114 and 128 days after planting. Furthermore, at the end of the cultivating season the number of capsules and the seed produced were also recorded. The obtained data revealed that the resistance trait had no significant effect on the fresh weight accumulation, seed production and capsule number. Additionally, the calculated asymptotic maximum fresh weight (AFWmax) from the regression equations indicated similar values for both S and R populations. On the contrary, the calculated mean growth rate (MGR) and the absolute growth rate (AGRmax) were affected by the resistance trait (differences between R and S populations) and by the population origin. More specifically, the R populations originating from the districts of Thessaloniki and Serres had MGR 1. 3 to 4. 3 and AGRmax 1. 5 to 7. 2 times lower than the respective S populations. The R populations from the district of Kilkis had slightly lower, equal, or higher MGR values and equal or higher AGRmax values than the respective S populations. A scatter plot graph with the MGR or the AGRmax on the vertical axis and the resistance ratio (R/S) on the horizontal axis revealed that R populations with high tribenuron resistance ratio values (R/S > 2400) had low MGR and AFWmax values. The R populations with tribenuron resistance ratio (R/S) ranging from 1437 to 2227 had high MGR and AFWmax values. ...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{reduction}} and amino acid content in plants of Papaver rhoeas L. and Stellaria media L. were investigated to evaluate response {{of these species}} to herbicide stress under various temperature (25 / 16 and 8 / 2 o C) and relative humidity (50 and 75 %) regimes. Weeds were treated with tribenuron methyl (15 g × ha - 1), a mixture of 2. 4 -D with <b>florasulam</b> (180 + 3. 75 g × ha - 1), and a mixture of 2. 4 -D with dicamba (1252. 5 + 97. 5 g × ha - 1). The fresh weight of weeds {{and the content of}} free branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine) in plant tissue were recorded. Tribenuron methyl was the herbicide that most limited biomass productivity, regardless of weed species and climate conditions. S. media was more sensitive to herbicides than P. rhoeas. Weed response to herbicides was dependent on temperature, but not on relative humidity. Tribenuron methyl applied to both weed species under various temperature regimes caused significant amino acid deficiency. The reduction in amino acid content in plants of P. rhoeas was greater at warm temperature compared to the cold regime due to stronger reaction to tribenuron methyl applied under these conditions. In most of cases, the mixture of 2. 4 -D + dicamba induced overproduction of amino acids...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} Ambrosia artemisiifolia by {{chemical}} and mechanical means was studied {{in a single}} year EU Project which was conducted in 2009. Results of pot and field trials from Germany are presented. <b>Florasulam,</b> Mesotrione and Mecoprop-P applied before BBCH 14 of Ambrosia artemisiifolia were effective control agents. Only the none-selective herbicide Glyphosat provided a high control when applied at later BBCH stages. Overall mean efficacy rates between 79 % and 100 % were achieved. Both physical control measures, cutting and hoeing, did not result in satisfying control results. The effect of physical weed control was tested on gravel, in grassland and in maize. Even a repeated mechanical control did not increase the efficacy which was assessed in terms of dry matter reduction. None of the physical control measures was able to stop the growth of A. artemisiifolia plants and their seed production. Ambrosia is not very competitive as trials in spring barley demonstrated. At decreasing crop densities and competition higher dose rates of Mecoprop-P were needed to achieve the same control level. Under crop-free conditions the efficacy of the highest tested dosage (1200 g ha- 1 Mecoprop-P) was 84 %. However, at a crop density of 300 plants/m² the herbicide application could not significantly reduce the biomass of A. artemisiifolia. The results highlight the importance of preventative measures of good agricultural practice as e. g. crop rotation and dense competitive crop stands. In the long run, these measures are crucial for a long-term successful control of A. artemisiifolia in agricultural fields...|$|E
40|$|In Brandenburg and Saxony {{numerous}} {{locations of}} Ambrosia artemisiifolia of low density have been reported. Furthermore there are, {{especially in the}} state Brandenburg, agricultural areas with a high density of A. artemisiifolia. Field trials in different agricultural crops and in non-crop areas were conducted in 2007 - 2009 to control A. artemisiifolia in its natural population. Leaf- and soil active herbicides were tested according to current agricultural practice. It was recorded, that germination of A. artemisiifolia occurred in 2 or 3 distinct periods. The herbicide treatments in maize were carried out at 1 - 6 leaf stage and between heights of 1 – 15 cm of A. artemisiifolia. The herbicides Calaris (mesotrione + terbuthylazin), Clio Star (topramezone + dicamba), Laudis (tembotrione), Clio (topramezone), Effigo (picloram + clopyralid), Callisto (mesotrione) and Arrat (dicamba + tritosulfuron) achieved an efficacy of up to 100 %. MaisTer Flüssig (foramsulfuron + iodosulfuron) achieved an efficacy of 50 %. Cato (rimsulfuron) was not effective against A. artemisiifolia. The herbicides Ariane C (clopyralid + fluroxypyr + <b>florasulam)</b> und Amario (clopyralid + fluroxypyr + MCPA) achieved an efficacy of 100 % in cereals. Banvel M (MCPA + dicamba) and Simplex (fluroxypyr + aminopyralid) controlled A. artemisiifolia well in grassland. Non-selective active substances like glyphosate and glufosinate are appropriate to control A. artemisiifolia in non-crop areas. The herbicide treatments in cereals and non-crop areas were carried out at 1 - 32 leaf stage between heights of 1 - 25 cm of A. artemisiifolia. Organic farming shows a reduction of A. artemisiifolia taking adequate agricultural measures. However further spread of A. artemisiifolia cannot be prevented in organic farming...|$|E
40|$|Saskatchewan is {{the largest}} {{producer}} of oat (Avena sativa L.) in Canada, producing 54 % of Canadian oats. Weeds such as kochia (Kochia scoparia L.) and wild oat (Avena fatua L.) are problematic in oat and require improved chemical and cultural control practices. The objectives of this thesis were two-fold: 1) to determine the tolerance of oat to pre- and post-emergence herbicides and their efficacy for controlling kochia (field study), and 2) to determine the relative effect of seed size and seed treatment on oat competitive ability (greenhouse and phytotron studies). In the field study, fluthiacet-methyl, flumioxazin, <b>florasulam</b> + bromoxynil, acifluorfen, and topramezone were applied POST, while tembotrione and sulfentrazone were applied PRE, to evaluate kochia control and oat tolerance. Pyrasulfotole+ bromoxynil, flumioxazin, tembotrione, and fluthiacet-methyl provided excellent kochia control (> 88 % biomass reductions). Oat tolerance to pyrasulfotole+ bromoxynil and fluthiacet-methyl was commercially acceptable. In the greenhouse and phytotron studies, two seed sizes (large and small), four seed treatments (pyraclostrobin, pyraclostrobin + thiamethoxam, thiamethoxam, control) and two competitive environments (weed-free and weedy) were evaluated. Under cool growing conditions, seed treatments {{lead to an increase}} in shoot production up to 15 and 18 %, respectively, for both large and small seeds. Oat plants derived from large seeds produced 23 and 24 % more root and shoot biomass, respectively, compared to plants established from small seeds at early developmental stages. The seed size advantage persisted until physiological maturity as plants established from large seeds produced 38 % more shoot biomass and 12 % more panicles than oat plants derived from small seeds. Regardless of seed size, oat plants produced 78 % less shoot biomass and 32 % fewer panicles when wild oat competition was present compared with no pots having no wild oat competition. Results presented in this thesis show that pyrasulfotole+ bromoxynil and fluthiacet-methyl are potential herbicides for control of kochia in oat, as they provided excellent control and acceptable crop tolerance. In addition to chemical control, oat producers should consider the use of seed treatments and large seed to improve early season oat vigour and competitive ability...|$|E
40|$|The term ‘emerging contaminants’ is {{generally}} {{used to refer}} to compounds previously not considered or known to be significant to groundwater (in terms of distribution and/or concentration) which are now being more widely detected. As analytical techniques improve, previously undetected organic micropollutants are being observed in the aqueous environment. Many emerging contaminants remain unregulated, but the number of regulated contaminants will continue to grow slowly over the next several decades. There is a wide variety of sources and pathways for these compounds to enter the environment and these include agriculture and urban areas. Some of these contaminants can have human or ecological health effects and {{there is a need for}} better understanding of their fate in environmental systems. This report provides a short review of the types of organic micropollutants which can be found in the aqueous environment. These include nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial additives and by-products, personal care products and fragrances, water treatment by-products, flame/fire retardants and surfactants, as well as caffeine and nicotine metabolites and hormones. Many of the compounds are relatively small polar molecules which are not effectively removed by conventional drinking water treatment using activated carbon. Pesticides and some industrial compounds are presently covered by the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Regulations and the Drinking Water Directive. Additional parameters, such as bisphenol A and nonyl-phenol are anticipated to be covered by revisions to the Drinking Water Directive. Others are currently unregulated. In order to assess the hazards presented by such compounds, information on usage, persistence, leachability and a robust sensitive analytical method is required. The UK metaldehyde problem was not originally discovered due to lack of an analytical method and was exacerbated by recalcitrance in water treatment. For many pesticides these requirements are fulfilled and an assessment of risk of leaching to groundwater can be made. However, for pesticide metabolites this information can be sparse and for compounds such as pharmaceuticals it can be lacking. A simple hazard assessment for currently approved pesticides was made from information on UK usage, persistence, sorption to soil carbon and published leaching indices. The following compounds were assessed as having the greatest potential for leaching to water: 2, 4 -D, amidosulfuron, bentazone, clopyralid, dicamba, <b>florasulam,</b> fosthiazate, imazaquin, iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, maleic hydrazide, MCPA, MCPP-P, metribuzin, metsulfuronmethyl, quinmerac, oxamyl, and triclopyr with a further 46 also having potential. Of these, 19 had an octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) less than that of metaldehyde and therefore are likely to be incompletely removed by water treatment. A simple assessment for pesticide metabolites, based only on organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) and persistence data, in this study gave results which agreed in principle with other studies. The different approaches indicate that the metabolites of chlorothalonil, cyanazine, diflufenican, flufenacet, iodosulfuron-methyl, metaldehyde, metazachlor and metsulfuron-methyl are likely to pose the greatest risk to drinking water. In many cases these metabolites are derived from parents which have a lesser risk. Other organic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, cannot as yet be assessed in the same way due to a lack of persistence data since the majority of persistence studies have been directed at water treatment. A range of organic micropollutants from urban settings have been detected in ground and surface water. Commonly detected compounds include: bisphenol A, carbamazepine, galaxolide, ibuprofen, iopamidol, phthalates, phenyl ethoxylates, and sulfamethoxazole. Case studies show that a small number of contaminants may be used to characterise the contaminant loading and also be used to assess the migration pathways in urban areas. Data interpreted by BGS from the Environment Agency’s monitoring programme for organic pollutants indicates that the 30 most frequently detected compounds comprise both established and emerging compounds and include a number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum compounds, triazine herbicides, chlorinated solvents, degradation products and THMs, caffeine, DEET and industrial compounds such as bisphenol A and tributyl phosphate. Specific determinands include a range of currently licensed and phased out pesticides with a few metabolites, pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine and triclosan, caffeine, nicotine and food additives and alkyl phosphates. These data exhibit hot spots which may indicate possible research areas. Future research should focus on a compound identified in the literature and detected by Environment Agency monitoring. Possible topics could be a study of migration through the unsaturated zone. In many cases the mechanism for migration of emerging contaminants from the surface to groundwater is very unclear...|$|E
