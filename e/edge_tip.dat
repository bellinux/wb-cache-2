40|$|International audienceA wavelet-based {{conditional}} analysis of unsteady flow and sound signals highlights {{the role of}} intermittent perturbations both in the sound generation and the unsteady field of an aerofoil tip leakage flow experiment. It is shown how the most probable flow perturbations generated at the pressure side tip edge are convected through the gap and swept downstream along the suction side past the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>tip</b> corner, where they radiate sound. The nascent sound sources are identified and localized in the clearance between 40 % and 60 % of the chord. It is {{also found that the}} time dependence of the averaged intermittent structures scales with the inverse of the square root of the mean velocity and a physical interpretation based on a simple potential vortex model is proposed. The data are retrieved from an experiment that has been carried out at low Mach number (Ma < 0. 3) in an anechoic test facility. A single motionless instrumented NACA 5510 aerofoil was mounted into the potential core of an open rectangular jet between two plates with an adjustable clearance. The tip leakage flow was ensured by the 5 % camber and a 15 ° angle of attack. A large database obtained by a variety of measurement techniques is thus available for the present analysis. More specifically, the conditional approach is applied to joint far field, wall pressure and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The wall pressure probes are located along the suction side tip edge and on the tip inside the gap, whereas the PIV plane is parallel to the mid-gap plane. Additional joint wall pressure and single hot-wire anemometry (HWA) measurements are also analysed with a hot-wire probe located near the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>tip</b> corner.

40|$|The various source {{mechanisms}} which generate broadband noise on a {{range of}} rotors are reviewed. Analyses of these mechanisms are presented and compared to existing experimental data. The sources considered are load fluctuations due to inflow turbulence, due to turbulent blade boundary layers passing the trailing edge, and due to tip vortex formation turbulence. Vortex shedding noise due to laminar boundary layers and blunt trailing edges is not considered in detail as it can be avoided in most cases. Present analyses are adequate to predict the spectra {{from a wide variety of}} experiments on fans, helicopter rotors, and wind turbines to within about 5 to 10 dB. Better knowledge of the inflow turbulence improves the accuracy of the predictions. Inflow turbulence noise depends strongly on ambient conditions and dominates at low frequencies. Trailing <b>edge</b> and <b>tip</b> vortex noise are important at higher frequencies if inflow turbulence is weak.

40|$|Single crystal {{superalloy}} {{turbine blades}} used in high pressure turbomachinery {{are subject to}} conditions of high temperature, triaxial steady and alternating stresses, fretting stresses in the blade attachment and damper contact locations, and exposure to high-pressure hydrogen. The blades are also subjected to extreme variations in temperature during start-up and shutdown transients. The most prevalent HCF failure modes observed in these blades during operation include crystallographic crack initiation/propagation on octahedral planes, and noncrystallographic initiation with crystallographic growth. Numerous cases of crack initiation and crack propagation at the blade leading <b>edge</b> <b>tip,</b> blade attachment regions, and damper contact locations have been documented. Understanding crack initiation/propagation under mixed-mode loading conditions is critical for establishing a systematic procedure for evaluating HCF life of single crystal turbine blades.

The subsurface stress results are required for evaluating contact fatigue life at damper contacts and dovetail attachment regions in single crystal nickel-base superalloy turbine blades. An analytical procedure is, presented, for evaluating the subsurface stresses in the elastic half-space, using a complex potential method outlined by Lekhnitskii.

40|$|A turbine was {{investigated}} by various methods of calculating its efficiency. The project {{was based on}} an existing impulse turbine, a one-stage turbine set in an organic Rankine cycle with the working fluid being R 245 fa. Various methods of loss calculation were explored in the search for a method sufficiently accurate to make valid assumptions regarding the turbine performance, while simple enough to be time efficient for use in industrial research and development.   The calculations were primarily made in an isentropic manner, only taking into account losses due to the residual velocity present in the exit flow. Later, an incidence loss was incorporated in the isentropic calculations, resulting in additional losses at off-design conditions. Leaving the isentropic calculations, the work by Tournier, “Axial flow, multi-stage turbine and compressor models” was used. The work presents a method of calculating turbine losses separated into four components: profile, trailing <b>edge,</b> <b>tip</b> clearance and secondary losses. The losses applicable to the case were implemented into the model. Since the flow conditions of the present turbine are extreme, the results were not expected to coincide with the results of Tournier. In order to remedy this problem, the results were compared to results obtained through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of the turbine. The equations purposed by Tournier were correlated in order to better match the present case. Despite that the equations by Tournier were correlated in order to adjust to the current conditions, the results of the losses calculated through the equations did not obtain results comparable to the ones of the available CFD simulations.

Comparison with IGV surface unsteady pressure experimental data indicates good agreement at the IGV trailing edge across the span for both spacing configurations; therefore, validating the modeling {{of the high}} speed, highly loaded transonic compressor. The strongest effect on the tip clearance flow physics was caused by decreasing the axial spacing. The 12 % axial spacing, baseline configuration {{had a significant effect}} on the cross location of the leading <b>edge</b> <b>tip</b> vortex and the rotor bow shock (i. e. the lambda shaped interaction region). In addition, the double leakage moved downstream of the bow shock due to the IGV wake for the close spacing. At 26 % axial spacing, the IGV wake influence was not significant. The back pressure influence was important. The high loading at the near stall condition prevented any significant IGV wake interaction effect on the tip clearance flow. For the chocked flow condition, the bow shock structure change (going from a normal shock to an oblique shock) reduces the bow shock strength. The IGV wake caused the tip vortex to intensify, this is mainly caused by a decrease in the bow shock strength. Vortex breakdown occurs due to deceleration after passing a strong shock, which for the choked case does not happen until the vortex reaches the passage shock...|$|E
40|$|New {{installations}} of unregulated {{power to}} the electrical grid have led to more fluctuations in the grid frequency. Hydropower plants with large reservoirs can provide services to balance the frequency by increasing or reducing production in accordance to what is needed. However, such balancing services are putting stress on the turbines by exposing them to dynamic loads. In the recent years, several high head Francis turbines have {{been taken out of}} operation due to cracks in the runner. It is thought to be because the turbines are not designed with sufficient measures to handle all the types of dynamic loads appearing during variations in operation. Analysis of stresses caused by fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is therefore of increasing interest in the hydropower industry. In this thesis, pressure and strain measurements have been performed on the Francis test rig in the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU. The results were further used as validation of a FSI analysis conducted on the same turbine model in the software program ANSYS. The rotational speed of the runner was decreased by 60 rpm over a time period of 2 seconds to illustrate how an estimated change in grid frequency impact stresses in the turbine. The results from the FSI simulation showed high stresses both on the leading and trailing edge of the runner blades, where the maximum stress was found on the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>tip</b> towards the shroud. A decrease in runner speed resulted in a decrease in material stresses. At the end time, the maximum equivalent stress has a magnitude of 5 MPa, which is way below the yielding limit for the material. Validation of the CFD simulation showed sufficient correlation between the measured and simulated pressures. However, it was difficult to achieve a comparison of strain results with the strain gage, and the FSI results should therefore be further validated before they can be used as background for more research...|$|E
