40|$|We conduct TinyTim {{modeling}} of NICMOS camera 2 PSFs to assess {{limits to the}} accuracy of PSF subtraction imposed by color dependence, OTA <b>focus</b> <b>breathing,</b> and cold mask wiggling. The results suggest that effects of both cold mask wiggling and <b>focus</b> <b>breathing</b> can be described as a noise in a PSF-subtracted image, well above 20 % of the PSF signal in narrow band filters, with a spatial scale of a few pixels. The main effect of the PSF color dependence is adding a systemic component to the PSF subtracted image. The effect is quite large if the color of the PSF used for subtraction {{is very different from the}} image PSF color. It is pronounced in blue, wide filters, like F 110 W, while in filters like F 187 W or redder/narrower it is essentially negligible. 1...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2008 ACPSEMTransmission {{dosimetry}} has {{the potential}} for identifying dosimetry errors during radiotherapy treatments by detecting changes in effective beam path between the planned and delivered treatment geometry. In the current study, the Pinnacle treatment planning system was used to model transmitted dose in a “virtual” EPID to investigate the possibility of using transmission dosimetry for detecting patient breathing and setup errors in breast conformal radiotherapy treatments. An opposing tangential beams treatment plan was used as a proof-of-principle study for deliberately introducing shifts in the position of the beams and virtual EPID relative to the CT data, to simulate shallow and deep breathing excursions of 2 mm and 11 mm, respectively. In addition, breathing was combined with setup errors of 0 mm and 2. 5 mm in a given direction for each beam. Due to spatial limitations in the original CT data, the CT data was modified to include an additional volume of air surrounding the patient to allow for the virtual EPID to be modelled at sufficient distances from the beam <b>focus.</b> <b>Breathing</b> excursions of both 2 mm and 11 mm could be detected in the transmitted dose planes below the patient. Breathing combined with a 2. 5 mm set up errors in the superior-inferior direction further accentuated the distribution of the dose errors in the superior-inferior directions. The predicted changes in transmitted dose due to the simulated delivery errors shows promise for using transmitted dosimetry in the clinic. P. D. Reich and E. Beza...|$|E
40|$|The program 7608 {{monitored}} on a biweekly basis NICMOS camera foci from June 9, 1997, through February 18, 1998. Each of the biweekly observations included 17 {{measurements of}} focus position (focus sweeps), individually {{for each of}} the three cameras. The measurements for camera 1 and camera 3 foci covered one or two HST orbital periods. Comparison of these measurements with the predictions of the three OTA <b>focus</b> <b>breathing</b> models has shown the following. (1). Focus variations seen in NICMOS focus sweeps correlate well with the OTA focus thermal breathing as predicted by breathing models (“ 4 – temperature”, “full–temperature”, and “attitude ” models). Thus they can be attributed mostly to the HST orbital temperature variation. (2). The amount of breathing (breathing amplitude) has been found to be on average larger in the first orbit after a telescope slew to a new target. This is explained as being due to additional thermal perturbations caused by the change in the HST attitude as the telescope repoints to a new target. (3). In the first orbit, the amount of focus change predicted by the 4 -temperature model is about the same as that seen in the focus sweeps data (breathing scale factor ~ 1). However the full–temperature model predicts a two times smaller breathing amplitude (breathing scale factor ~ 1. 7). This suggests that the light shield temperatures are more responsive to the attitude change than temperatures from the other temperature sensors. The results of this study may help to better understand the HST thermal cycles and to improve the models describing the impact of those on both the OTA and NICMOS focus. 1...|$|E

My {{hope is that the}} study will inform an improved year-long study for possible curriculum development. My working hypothesis was if the more a student uses mindfulness practices, (e. g., <b>focused</b> <b>breathing,</b> biofeedback, and visualization) the more their confidence would rise in the measures of academic activities, (e. g., class work, homework, and tests) and self management, (e. g., preparation, efficacy, and time management).

5000|$|Mindfulness {{meditation}} {{involves the}} process of developing the skill of bringing one’s attention to whatever is happening in the present moment. There are several meditation exercises designed to develop mindfulness meditation. One method is to sit on a straight-backed chair or sit cross-legged on the floor or a cushion, close one’s eyes and bring attention to either the sensations of breathing in the proximity of one’s nostrils or to the movements of the abdomen when breathing in and out. In this meditation practice, one does not try to control one’s breathing, but attempts to simply be aware of one’s natural breathing process/rhythm. When engaged in this practice, the mind will often run off to other thoughts and associations, and if this happens, one passively notices that the mind has wandered, and in an accepting, non-judgmental way, returns to <b>focusing</b> on <b>breathing.</b>|$|R

40|$|The authors {{describe}} a new methodologically improved behavioral treatment for panic patients using respiratory biofeedback from a handheld capnometry device. The treatment rationale {{is based on}} the assumption that sustained hypocapnia resulting from hyperventilation is a key mechanism in the production and maintenance of panic. The brief 4 -week biofeedback therapy is aimed at voluntarily increasing self-monitored end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2) and reducing respiratory rate and instability through breathing exercises in patients' environment. Preliminary results from 4 patients indicate that the therapy was successful in reducing panic symptoms and other psychological characteristics associated with panic disorder. Physiological data obtained from home training, 24 -hour ambulatory monitoring pretherapy and posttherapy, and laboratory assessment at follow-up indicate that patients started out with low resting PCO 2 levels, increased those levels during therapy, and maintained those levels at posttherapy and/or follow-up.

50|$|The {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in infants with Robin sequence <b>focus</b> upon <b>breathing</b> and feeding, and optimizing growth and nutrition despite the predisposition for breathing difficulties. If {{there is evidence}} of airway obstruction (snorty breathing, apnea, difficulty taking a breath, or drops in oxygen), then the infant should be placed in the sidelying or prone position, which helps bring the tongue base forward in many children. One study of 60 infants with PRS found that 63% of infants responded to prone positioning (Smith and Senders, 2006, Int J Pediatr Oto). 53% of the infants in this study required some form of feeding assistance, either nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube feedings (feeding directly into the stomach). In a separate study of 115 children with the clinical diagnosis of PRS managed at 2 different hospitals in Boston (Evans et al., 2006, In J Pediatr Oto), respiratory distress was managed successfully in 56% without an operation (either by prone positioning, short term intubation, or placement of a nasopharyngeal airway). In this study, gastrostomy tube feeding were placed in 42% of these infants due to feeding difficulties.|$|R
