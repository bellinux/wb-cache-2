5|$|New Line {{believed}} Freddy vs. Jason {{needed a}} fresh start, and choose a new actor for Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing <b>Hodder</b> {{was the best}} choice for the role. <b>Hodder</b> did receive the script for Freddy vs. Jason, and had a meeting with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. According to <b>Hodder,</b> New Line failed to provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that <b>Hodder</b> had used in the previous films. Yu and development executive Jeff Katz recognized the outcry among fans over the replacement of <b>Hodder</b> as Jason, but stood by their choice in recasting.|$|E

5|$|St Mary's Hall, on an {{adjoining}} site to Stonyhurst, was {{built as a}} Jesuit seminary in 1828 (extended in the 1850s) and functioned until 1926, when the seminarians moved to Heythrop Hall.

5|$|The Year of the Sex Olympics {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} production when the 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers and Listeners Association obtained a copy of the script and attempted to block the production. Her objections were overruled by Hugh Greene. Location filming for the outdoor scenes set on the island that appears in The Live Life Show took place on the Isle of Man between 8 and 10 May 1968. A mishap occurred during the shoot when Tony Vogel slipped and broke his wrist. Filming continued at Ealing Film Studios between 13 and 15 May, covering the elements that would be played into the screens on the set during studio recording such as the Sportsex, Artsex and Foodshow programmes as well as the audience reaction shots. The scene where Kin <b>Hodder</b> falls to his death was also shot at Ealing. Following rehearsals, the production moved to BBC Television Centre between 12 and 14 June. Industrial action by BBC electricians interrupted the production, {{and by the end of}} the recording session the final ten minutes of the play remained untaped, leading to a remount on 23 June to complete the outstanding scenes.|$|E
