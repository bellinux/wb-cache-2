25|$|Scene 3: Ricky Roma {{delivers}} a monologue to James Lingk. Roma does not {{bring up the}} real estate he wants to sell to Lingk until the very end. Instead, Roma preys upon Lingk's insecurities, and his sense that he <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> anything adventurous with his life.|$|E
25|$|In {{this new}} world, the brutal, but simple-minded and, in fact, defenseless “Foma” {{tries to find}} new {{solutions}} for himself and do something that he <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> before - to win {{the heart of a}} woman and save a child. Schoolchildren are not afraid of “Foma”, as the P. E. Teacher is teaching them, and they are teaching him in turn. “Foma”’s path is thorny, he constantly makes mistakes, and ruins his own positive results having been achieved with great difficulty, and yet, slowly and painfully, he changes to become better.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the film}} is of course fictional and Hertzfeldt <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> {{advertising}} work, he received many offers to do television commercials after Billy's Balloon drew international attention. In appearances Hertzfeldt has often told the humorous story of how he was tempted to produce the worst possible cartoons he {{could come up with}} for the companies, make off with their money, and see if they would actually make it to air. Eventually this became the germ for Rejecteds theme of a collection of cartoons so bad they were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator's breakdown and ultimately the cartoons' metaphysical crisis.|$|E
60|$|Up to {{this time}} he had been loyalty itself, where his {{obligations}} lay--treachery was new to him; he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> an ignoble thing--baseness was new to him; he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> an unkind thing--that also was new to him.|$|R
5000|$|Grohl {{has been}} vocal in {{his views on}} drug misuse, {{contributing}} to a 2009 anti-drug video for the BBC. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> cocaine, ever in my life. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> heroin, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> speed," [...] {{he said in a}} 2008 interview, adding that he stopped smoking cannabis and taking LSD at the age of 20. In the BBC video, he said, [...] "I've seen people die. It ain't easy being young, but that stuff doesn't make it any easier".|$|R

500|$|While Sam and Bruno are {{concerned}} about the loyalty of a powerful California union official (Sandoval), Toby and Josh are preparing for a meeting with the congressional opposition to re-negotiate the estate tax—or the [...] "death tax" [...] as the Republicans have labeled it—but are then surprised by a last-minute cancellation. It soon becomes clear that the Republicans are planning to repeal the estate tax altogether, and might have the votes to do so. An attempt to win over the black caucus, led by Congressman Mark Richardson (Barry), fails. At a loss over what to do, an initiative comes from unexpected quarters. The previously over-cautious political strategist, Doug Wegland, suggests the president responds by doing something he <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> before: veto the bill.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers were {{impressed}} with the way Lessing tackled the subject of sexual politics in the book. Paul Gray remarked in a review in Time magazine, that contrary to appearances, The Marriages is not a feminist parable, but added that while Lessing often wrote about gender conflict, she <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> it [...] "with more sweetness, compassion and wisdom" [...] as she has in this novel. Leonard commended Lessing for considering boths sides of the gender divide, for being both critical and forgiving of Ben Ata and Al•Ith. Leonard said that never before has Lessing written [...] "a gentler book", adding that her 1973 novel, Summer Before the Dark comes a close second. A reviewer in Kirkus Reviews also complemented Lessing on her handling of sexual conflict. While the review was critical of Lessing's prose style, and called her descriptions of the Zone Four war economy [...] "a silly cartoon sketch", it said that [...] "there is a... generosity about this work not quite like anything she has done".|$|E
500|$|According to Swift, [...] "Back to December" [...] is {{an apology}} to a past lover {{in the form}} of a song, {{something}} that she <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> before. She continued, [...] "I've never felt the need to apologize in a song before. But in the last two years I've experienced a lot, [...] a lot of different kinds of learning lessons. And sometimes you learn a lesson too late and at that point you need to apologize because you were careless." [...] Critics have speculated that the song is Swift's apology to her ex-boyfriend, The Twilight Saga actor Taylor Lautner, due, in part, to the lyrics [...] "your tan skin, your sweet smile", as well as the hidden lyrics in the booklet, which spelled out [...] "TAY." [...] Lautner confirmed these rumors while promoting the TV series Scream Queens in 2016. [...] "Back to December" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Speak Now on October 12, 2010 as a part of the exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store leading up to the album's release. [...] On November 15, 2010, the song was released as the second single from Speak Now.|$|E

500|$|Ged, who in {{the story}} goes by his common name of Sparrowhawk, only enters the novel midway through {{when he comes to}} the tombs to steal the ring of Erreth-Akbe. Where he was an {{adolescent}} in A Wizard of Earthsea, he is depicted as a mature individual in the second Earthsea volume, one who gradually transforms Tenar's view of the world. In The Tombs of Atuan he plays the role of the wise helper to the protagonist, a type of companionship common to Le Guin's novels. After Tenar chooses to talk to him rather than have him killed, he tells her about the rest of Earthsea that she is ignorant of, and so helps her see a path out of her difficulties that she could not. The scars that Ged bears from his encounter with the shadow in A Wizard of Earthsea make Tenar realize that he has confronted death in a way that she <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done.</b> Literature scholar Elizabeth Cummins argues that while Ged does not actually save Tenar, he [...] "functions as the midwife in her rebirth". Ged is the figure of the [...] "other" [...] in this novel; in contrast to the other inhabitants of the Tombs, he is male, dark-skinned, and a wizard. Ged's difference in the story is symbolized by light on many occasions, such as when his staff allows Tenar to see the undertomb for the first time: she is shocked then to find it to be beautiful, rather than just dark. Ged is responsible for giving Tenar a wider perspective and showing her a more compassionate and joyful world than her previous experience allowed her to imagine.|$|E
2500|$|Barbour {{has faced}} {{considerable}} [...] "in-state criticism for {{his approach to}} racial issues". Mississippi state Representative Willie Perkins has [...] "compared Barbour to the southern Democrats who preceded him", saying: [...] "As far as I'm concerned, he <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> anything as a governor or a citizen to distinguish himself from the old Democrats who fought tooth and nail to preserve segregation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Carib Territory {{is located}} in the {{northeast}} of Dominica, on the Atlantic (windward) coast. [...] It comprises [...] in Saint David Parish, within boundaries first established by colonial authorities in 1903, and reaffirmed in Articles 41 and 42 of the Carib Reserve Act in 1978. [...] The Dominican government may grant additional lands to the Territory, though it <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|E

2500|$|Harris {{traveled}} {{to accept an}} invitation to the White House by President Theodore Roosevelt. [...] Two years earlier, Roosevelt had said, [...] "Presidents may come and presidents may go, but Uncle Remus stays put.

2500|$|The {{reviewer}} in the London Review in 1865 {{denounced the}} characters of Wegg and Venus, [...] "who appear to us in all the highest degree unnatural—the one being a mere phantasm, {{and the other a}} nonentity." [...] However he applauded the creation of Bella Wilfer: [...] "Probably the greatest favourite in the book will be—or rather is already—Bella Wilfer. She is evidently a pet of the author's, and she will long remain the darling of half the households of England and America." [...] E.S. Dallas, in his 1865 review, concurred that [...] "Mr Dickens <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> anything in the portraiture of women so pretty and so perfect" [...] as Bella.|$|E
2500|$|According to some viewpoints, Resolution 2758 {{solved the}} issue of [...] "China's {{representation}}" [...] in the United Nations — but it left {{the issue of}} Taiwan's representation unresolved in a practical sense. The ROC government continues to hold control over Taiwan and other islands. While the PRC claims sovereignty over all of [...] "China" [...] and claims that Taiwan is part of China, it does not exercise sovereignty over Taiwan, and <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> so. President Ma Ying-jeou said, [...] "The Republic of China is a sovereign country, and mainland China {{is part of our}} territory according to the Constitution. Therefore, our relations with the mainland are not international relations. It is a special relationship".|$|E

2500|$|While on the {{run from}} hungry gators, Tiana strikes a deal with Naveen, {{demanding}} that once he marries Charlotte, he will use the money he gets from her to help Tiana buy the restaurant. Things change, however, on their journey to end the spell. They both meet a jazz-playing alligator named Louis and a Cajun firefly named Ray, who help them reach the voodoo priestess Mama Odie. Tiana and Naveen help each other escape from frog hunters and Tiana teaches Naveen to help her cook. As Ray sings an ode to his true love [...] "Evangeline", Naveen shows Tiana how to dance, something that she <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> before because she was afraid to. Both frogs find themselves falling in love with one another, but are unsure how to say it.|$|E
