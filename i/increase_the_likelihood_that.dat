25|$|In general, wines {{with a low}} pH (such as Pinot Noir and Sangiovese) have {{a greater}} {{capability}} of aging. With red wines, {{a high level of}} flavor compounds, such as phenolics (most notably tannins), will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> a wine will be able to age. Wines with high levels of phenols include Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo and Syrah. The white wines with the longest aging potential tend to be those with a high amount of extract and acidity. The acidity in white wines, acting as a preservative, has a role similar to that of tannins in red wines. The process of making white wines, which includes little to no skin contact, means that white wines have a significantly lower amount of phenolic compounds, though barrel fermentation and oak aging can impart some phenols. Similarly, the minimal skin contact with rosé wine limits their aging potential.|$|E

500|$|After TBI, {{abnormalities}} {{exist in}} the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals used by brain cells {{to communicate with each}} other; these abnormalities {{may play a role in}} the development of PTE. [...] TBI may lead to the excessive release of glutamate and other excitatory neurotransmitters (those that stimulate brain cells and <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> they will fire). This excessive glutamate release can lead to excitotoxicity, damage to brain cells through overactivation of the biochemical receptors that bind and respond to excitatory neurotransmitters. Overactivation of [...] glutamate receptors damages neurons; for example it leads to the formation of free radicals. [...] Excitotoxicity is a possible factor in the development of PTE; [...] it may lead to the formation of a chronic epileptogenic focus. An epileptic focus is the part of the brain from which epileptic discharges originate.|$|E

2500|$|Addiction is a brain {{disorder}} characterized by [...] engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences. Despite {{the involvement of}} a number of psychosocial factors, a biological process– one which is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus– is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction. The two properties that characterize all addictive stimuli are that they are reinforcing (i.e., they <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> a person will seek repeated exposure to them) and intrinsically rewarding (i.e., they are perceived as being inherently positive, desirable, and pleasurable).|$|E

2500|$|Beyond {{the basic}} {{guidelines}} listed above, food pairings can dive even further into matching {{several layers of}} texture and flavors. The term [...] "bridge ingredients" [...] refers to ingredients and flavors that have certain affinities in wine pairing (such as slow-cooked onions with creamy wines, etc.). It can also refer to using particular herbs and spices perceived in the wine (such as rosemary in some Cabernet Sauvignon) and adding them to the dish as an ingredient.

Armour reported a loss rate of 5.4% {{in a review of}} 1,000 cases of selective reduction.

2500|$|Law of Symmetry—The law of {{symmetry}} {{states that}} the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts.

[...] Similarities between symmetrical objects <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object.

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between emotion and memory is complex, but generally, emotion tends to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> an {{event will be}} remembered later {{and that it will}} be remembered vividly. Flashbulb memory is one example of this. An example of this would be an experience such as a close family member dying or the Christmas that you got the exact toy you wanted as a kid. The experience holds so much emotional significance that it is encoded as an extremely vivid, almost picture-perfect memory. However, whether the vividness of the flashbulb memory is due to a virtual [...] "flash" [...] that occurs because of the emotional experience has been hotly contested. Flashbulb memories may occur because of our propensity to rehearse and retell those highly emotional events, which strengthens the memory ...|$|E
2500|$|The great {{reed warbler}} (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) {{is one of the}} few bird species that is {{polygynous}} and has a harem. Males provide resources to their harem, such as nest protection and varying levels of parental care. Females in the harem are able to breed at the same time, indicating that harem size and the number of male offspring are related. The most important factor when determining male fitness is the order in which he arrives to the territory. Males who arrive earlier <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> they will obtain good nesting sites, improving their odds for attracting more females. Additionally, a greater song repertoire is correlated with an increase in harem size and increased male fitness because females prefer to mate with males that have a more extensive song repertoire. [...] It is also possible that broad song repertoires are a supplementary cue for a good mate, in conjunction with male territory size and quality. A wide-ranging song repertoire develops with age, and older males are more likely to dominate better territories, giving a plausible reason as to why females prefer older males. Although highly debated, female choice in the {{great reed warbler}} may be explained by the good genes theory. False paternity and decreased offspring survival are two factors which might contribute to a decrease in male fitness.|$|E
2500|$|According to the biographer of Gobe Matenge, {{a former}} Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, {{he was one}} of several civil {{servants}} – including the future vice president Peter Mmusi – that compelled the Motswana government to adopt [...] "Fatshe leno la rona" [...] as the anthem of the independent nation. [...] In order to ascertain the opinion of the general public on the matter, the government transmitted all of the contending hymns over Radio Botswana. [...] However, Matenge's group was able to obtain recordings of these songs for themselves and air them in front of quasi-town hall gatherings held in major settlements like Lobatse, Molepolole, and Mafikeng, in addition to the capital Gaborone. [...] They strategically played [...] "Fatshe leno la rona" [...] as the last song – which in theory would <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>that</b> the audience would remember the tune – while having their organisers add words of praise for it in an attempt to sway the crowd's opinion in favour of that hymn. [...] At the end of the exercise, they would circulate a boilerplate form letter articulating the author's viewpoint of [...] "Fatshe leno la rona" [...] being their favourite candidate for national anthem. [...] This was done because of the low levels of literacy in Botswana at the time. [...] Of the multitude of letters sent to the Department of Information and Broadcasting, {{the vast majority of them}} expressed an inclination towards the aforementioned song.|$|E
