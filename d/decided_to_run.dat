5|$|In September 1923, Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died, {{leaving the}} party without a candidate. Alben Barkley, who Cantrill had {{defeated}} for the nomination, {{refused to be}} the Democratic candidate, perhaps because he had already <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for the U.S. Senate in 1926. The Democratic Central Committee chose Fields {{as a replacement for}} Cantrill.|$|E
5|$|In the 1913 session, Coolidge enjoyed renowned {{success in}} arduously {{navigating}} to passage the Western Trolley Act which connected Northampton {{with a dozen}} similar industrial communities in western Massachusetts. Coolidge intended to retire after his second term as was the custom, but when the President of the State Senate, Levi H. Greenwood, considered running for Lieutenant Governor, Coolidge <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> again for the Senate {{in the hopes of}} being elected as its presiding officer. Although Greenwood later <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for reelection to the Senate, he was defeated primarily due to his opposition to women's suffrage; Coolidge was in favor of the women's vote, won his own re-election and with Crane's help, assumed the presidency of a closely divided Senate. After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech entitled Have Faith in Massachusetts, which summarized his philosophy of government.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} Athens, Revithi {{encountered}} a male runner along the road. He gave her money and advised her {{to run the}} marathon to become famous, and, consequently, earn money or more easily find a job.

She championed a visiting teacher program for children with emotional problems and began art education programs in the schools for black students. Hogg declined to run for a second term.|$|E
5|$|In the 1906 redistribution, McCay's {{electorate}} of Corinella was abolished and {{its territory}} {{divided between the}} electorates of Laanecoorie and Corio.

He {{served as a}} teacher, school administrator and South San Francisco city councilman from 1956 to 1962.

5|$|Sometime between 1888 and 1890, McKinley <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for president, {{but to have}} a {{realistic}} chance of attaining that goal, he needed to regain office. Foraker's ambition then was the Senate—he planned to challenge Sherman in the legislative election {{to be held in}} January 1892—and he agreed to nominate McKinley for governor at the state convention in Columbus. McKinley was elected, and Sherman narrowly turned back Foraker's challenge with considerable help from Hanna.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell had <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory {{along with the}} President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he {{was one of only}} a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E

Driehaus survived his own challenge from Scott Gehring with a 2:1 victory margin in the 2006 election for his state house seat.|$|E

He later moved to the Mugello Circuit where he tried out brake testing, car set-ups, tyre evaluation, endurance runs for the car's engines and continued trying out new car components.

Levy-Pounds stated that she hoped to increase youth engagement with the NAACP during her term with the organization. She has been critical of racial disparities in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul region, citing them as some of the nation's worst.|$|E

The museum borrowed an 1836 coach from the Pennsylvania Railroad to display on the track behind the newly rebuilt tender, and the locomotive's 100th birthday was officially celebrated on November 12, 1931. The locomotive's semi-operation was broadcast over the CBS radio network with Stanley Bell narrating the ceremonies for the radio audience.|$|E
5|$|When Nobin {{returned}} to the village, he learned about the affair from village gossip. Nobin was publicly humiliated following {{the discovery of the}} affair.

However, the mahant did not allow the couple to escape; his goons blocked their way. Overcome with anger and jealousy, Nobin slit his wife's throat with a fish knife, decapitating her, on 27 May 1873. Full of remorse, Nobin surrendered to the local police station and confessed his crime.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong {{was born}} in what would soon become the {{province}} of Ontario in 1867. After briefly teaching school, he entered the business industry, as a druggist.
