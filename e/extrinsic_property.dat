25|$|In a {{different}} gravitational field, for example, {{on the surface}} of the Moon, an object can have a significantly different weight than on Earth. The gravity {{on the surface of}} the Moon is only about one-sixth as strong as {{on the surface of the}} Earth. A one-kilogram mass is still a one-kilogram mass (as mass is an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property</b> of the object) but the downward force due to gravity, and therefore its weight, is only one-sixth of what the object would have on Earth. So a man of mass 180 pounds weighs only about 30 pounds-force when visiting the Moon.|$|E
50|$|A {{property}} {{that is not}} essential or inherent is called an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property.</b> For example, density is an intrinsic property of any physical object, whereas weight is an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property</b> that varies depending {{on the strength of}} the gravitational field in which the respective object is placed.|$|E
5000|$|Premise P1 is an {{intuitive}} premise; generally we distinguish between properties and relations. An intrinsic property {{is just a}} property that something has independently of anything else; an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property</b> is had only in relation to something. An example of an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property</b> is [...] "fatherhood": something is a father only if that something is a male and has a child.

50|$|Specific {{properties}} of a substance {{are derived from}} other intrinsic and extrinsic properties (or intensive and extensive properties) of that substance. For example, the density of steel (a specific and intrinsic property) {{can be derived from}} measurements of the mass of a steel bar (an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property)</b> divided by the volume of the bar (another <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property).</b> Similarly, the specific gravity of a liquid is derived from the density of the liquid divided by the density of water (two intrinsic properties).|$|E

50|$|The basic {{operating}} principles of a pseudo spin valve are {{identical to that}} of an ordinary spin valve, but instead of changing the magnetic coercivity of the different ferromagnetic layers by pinning one with an antiferromagnetic layer, the two layers are made of different ferromagnets with different coercivities e.g., NiFe and Co.

50|$|An {{intrinsic}} property is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context. An extrinsic (or relational) property is a property {{that depends on}} a thing's relationship with other things.

5000|$|Intuitively, however, it is {{only person}} B, and not person A, who has changed: B has grown by 10 cm, but A's height has stayed the same. This problem with Cambridge changes is usually thought {{to call for a}} {{distinction}} between intrinsic and extrinsic, or natural and non-natural, properties. Given such a distinction, it is possible to define [...] "real" [...] change by requiring that the respective predicates express intrinsic properties, like being 175 cm tall, rather than an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property,</b> like being taller than B.|$|E

40|$|An {{intrinsic}} property is roughly a property something has in virtue {{of how it}} is, as opposed to how it is related to other things. More carefully, the property of being F is intrinsic iff, necessarily, for any x that is F, x is F in virtue of how it is, as opposed to how it is related to wholly distinct things or how wholly distinct things are. An <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property,</b> on the other hand, is any property that is not intrinsic. An example of an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property</b> is the property of being an uncle. The property of being an uncle is extrinsic since, necessarily, any uncle is an uncle at least partly in virtue of how he is related to people wholly distinct from him. Examples of intrinsic properties are more controversial. It is widely held, however, that both the property of being cubical and the property of being made of tin are examples of intrinsic properties...|$|E
40|$|Attributes of {{an object}} contain its {{fundamental}} properties. Attribute data is {{the main source of}} clustering information. Although relationship data is an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property</b> of objects and is at least as important as attribute data, most clustering methods process only one type of characteristic data. However, analyzing attribute and relationship data together in applications such as market segmentation, social network segmentation, and image segmentation can lead to better and more meaningful clustering. In this study, we describe a new algorithm that combines attribute and relationship data for joint clustering analysis. An experimental evaluation demonstrates the usefulness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm when applied to image segmentation...|$|E
40|$|A formal context {{associates}} {{to objects}} a description that combines automatically extracted properties (intrinsic) and manually assigned ones (<b>extrinsic).</b> The <b>extrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> are expressed by users according to intentions {{that are often}} subjective and changing, and determine the classification and retrieval of objects. So, we find it important to assist users in this task through the automatic suggestion of <b>extrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> to be assigned and even the discovery of rules to automate these assignements. The principle is {{to learn from the}} description of existing objects the extrinsic description of a new object. Because of the changing nature of users' intentions, the assistance given in the incremental building of a logical context must be interactive.

30|$|For some decades, texture {{classification}} [1 – 16] {{has been}} a fundamental challenge in image processing. On the one hand, texture descriptors have to capture all intrinsic image properties. These are properties that contain distinctive information (for discrimination) and do {{not depend on the}} image acquisition conditions. On the other hand, <b>extrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> (i.e., properties that vary with different acquisition conditions) should not be captured, in order to maintain invariance to specific properties.|$|R

40|$|MasterMechanical bone {{properties}} which {{characterized by}} bone strength, brittleness, work to failure are important parameters to diagnosis and investigate the osteoporosis, because Bone fragility depends on mechanical bone properties {{and it is}} distinguished <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property</b> which depends on bone mass and bone morphology and intrinsic property which depends on bone matrix property. <b>Extrinsic</b> <b>property</b> is characterized by stiffness and yield force from the biomechanical test and intrinsic property is characterized by young’s modulus and hardness from the nanoindentaion. These properties cannot directly compare because of incoincidence of measurement parameters. Furthermore the inherent difference due to different measurement length scale between extrinsic and intrinsic bone properties has been poorly understood. In this study we simulated both extrinsic and intrinsic bone property for directly comparison. The intrinsic tensile properties were simulated from nanoindentation curve to directly comparison with extrinsic properties. To quantify the effects of microarchitecture and microporosity on intrinsic properties, synchrotron x-ray micro-CT-based multiscale micro-FE system which included microarchitecture and microporosity was successfully developed. We revealed that intrinsic yield strength is one-third times of nanoindentation hardness as same as non-work hardening material case. And higher stiffness and yield force of intrinsic properties than extrinsic properties were measured by 93 % and 43 % respectively. We quantified {{that the effects of}} microarchitecture and porosity on intrinsic properties explained 82 % portion of the discrepancy of stiffness. And it is fully explained the discrepancy of yield force. These finding demonstrated that microarchitecture and microporosity are main factors of the difference between extrinsic and intrinsic bone properties...|$|E

In this paper, 96 % of alumina ceramics with different additives were fabricated by gel-casting, the microstructures of the ceramics were investigated and the sintering mechanism was discussed. The results showed that only spherical grains were obtained when only liquid-forming additives of silica (SiO 2) and calcium oxide (CaO) were introduced. Alternatively, only CaF 2 was introduced to the specimen, the grains grew abnormally. When three kinds of additives, i. e., SiO 2, CaO and CaF 2, with appropriate amount were introduced, elongated grains could be achieved which matched our target microstructure and density...|$|E
40|$|The atomic-scale and {{mesoscopic}} physics of magnetic nanostructures is reviewed. Emphasis {{is on the}} description of magnetic phenomena and properties by analytical models, as contrasted to numerical approaches. Nanostructuring affects the magnetic properties on different length scales, from a few interatomic distances for intrinsic properties such as magnetization and anisotropy to more than 10 nm for <b>extrinsic</b> <b>properties,</b> such as coercivity. The consideration includes static and dynamic mechanisms, as well as nanoscale finite-temperature effects. Some explicitly discussed examples are Curie- temperature changes due to nanostructuring, the effect of narrow and constricted walls, the potential use of magnetic nanodots for finite-temperature quantum computing, and exchange-coupled hard-soft nanocomposites. The temperature dependence of <b>extrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> reflects the atomic-scale static or ‘intrinsic’ temperature dependence of the free-energy barriers and thermally activated dynamic or ‘extrinsic’ jumps over metastable free-energy barriers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{so-called}} ‘threshold concepts’ have been defined {{in a way}} that makes it impossible, even in principle, to empirically isolate them. It continues by proposing an alternative theoretical framework, and argues: (1) that concepts are not reducible to abilities; (2) that acquisition of a given concept can be necessary, but not sufficient, for the possession of an ability; and (3) that being ‘threshold’ is an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property,</b> such that what is threshold for one person is not for another. It closes by outlining two resultant problems for related empirical research. First, how is it possible to test for concepts, rather than abilities? Second, how can we tell if there is more than one possible conceptual route to the same ability...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates and {{formally}} {{compares the}} expressive power of dimensional (i. e., spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal) query languages, where the dimensional extensions are supported {{in terms of}} ADTs (abstract data types). There are basically two approaches {{to the design of}} dimensional ADT extended query languages. One approach, by definition, adds semantics by interpreting an ADT attribute value associated with a database fact as an intrinsic (i. e., builtin) relationship with an underlying space. The other approach treats ADT attribute values as conventional attributes, where the dimension semantics (and space) associated with a database fact is an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property</b> and controlled fully by the user. The comparison framework is based on the relational algebra (RA) and a single ADT extension to RA. Two comparison criteria of semantic equivalence also are defined.

40|$|A {{question}} is raised on whether some implied regularity or structure, {{as found in}} soccer team ranking by the Union of European Football As-sociations (UEFA), is due to implicit game result value or score compe-tition conditions. The analysis is based on considerations about complex systems, i. e. searching whether power or other simple law fits are appro-priate to describe some internal dynamics. It is observed that the ranking is specifically organized: a major class made of a few teams emerges after each game season. Other classes which apparently have regular sizes sub-sequently occur. Thus, the notion of Sheppard primacy index is envisaged to describe the findings. Additional primacy indices are discussed for en-hancing the features. These measures {{can be used to}} sort out peer classes in more general terms. A very simplified toy model containing ingredients of the UEFA ranking rules suggests that such peer classes are an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>property</b> of the ranking, as obtained in many nonlinear systems under boundary condition constraints. ∗Associate researcher 1 a...|$|E

40|$|The {{distinction}} between intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> is an elusive distinction that has resisted precise formulation.

It will be shown that accounts of intrinsicality that appeal to combinatorial and duplication principles do not yield satisfactory results, {{even when they are}} supplemented with a notion of 'naturalness'. We need to appeal to 'in virtue of' claims rather than to 'naturalness' in order (i) to allow for cases whereby a property is possessed both intrinsically and extrinsically, (ii) to adequately classify modal properties when these are given a counterpart-theoretic analysis, and (iii) to retain the idea that the set of intrinsic properties and the set of pure <b>extrinsic</b> <b>properties</b> are closed under Boolean operations. Moreover, the paper will argue in favour of treating the intrinsically/extrinsically distinction as more basic than the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction and explaining the latter in terms of the former...|$|R
