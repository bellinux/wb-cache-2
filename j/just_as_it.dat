Ludovico Maria Sinistrari, a Catholic priest who wrote about methods of {{exorcism}} in the late 17th century, includes cubeb as an ingredient in an incense to ward off incubus. Even today, his formula for the incense is quoted by neopagan authors, some of whom also claim that cubeb can be used in love sachets and spells.|$|E

5|$|A north–south freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing through traffic {{to bypass the}} city of Detroit. This plan {{was included in the}} 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. The Yellow Book contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north–south freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave exited western Africa on August13, {{which developed}} into Tropical Storm Baker {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles on August18. It moved northwestward and later turned to the west, attaining hurricane status on August21. The next day, the hurricane attained Category 2 intensity <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> crossed over Antigua, where heavy damage was reported. More than 100homes were damaged or destroyed, which left thousands homeless. Afterward, the hurricane began to weaken, and later on August22 its winds decreased to tropical storm status. The cyclone then struck Montserrat as a strong tropical storm. The next day it struck southwestern Puerto Rico, and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical depression, passing over the Dominican Republic. Baker turned more to the west, re-attaining tropical storm status before striking eastern Cuba on August24. In Cuba, 37 people died, and the property losses reached several million dollars.|$|E
5|$|As social centres castles were {{important}} places for display. Builders {{took the opportunity}} to draw on symbolism, through the use of motifs, to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst the elite. Later structures of the Romantic Revival would draw on elements of castle architecture such as battlements for the same purpose. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features. The right to crenellate, when granted by a monarch– though it was not always necessary– was important not <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> allowed a lord to defend his property but because crenellations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite. Licences to crenellate were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who was the one responsible for granting permission.|$|E
5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} {{went on to}} suggest that the system would have to be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% of the time in order to be worthwhile. They considered attacks against the RV while the missile was in the midcourse, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order to meet in the middle, and they could not imagine a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals, the Kerala Blasters {{were set}} {{to take on the}} regular season winners, Chennaiyin. The first leg took place at home for the Kerala Blasters, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi, on 13 December 2014. The match could not have been any better for the Kerala Blasters as goals from Ishfaq Ahmed, Iain Hume, and Sushanth Mathew gave the Kerala Blasters a 3–0 {{advantage}} heading to Chennai. The second leg took place three days later at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai. Despite heading into the game leading 3–0 on aggregate, the Blasters managed to concede three goals to Chennaiyin in the second leg and thus bring the game into extra-time. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> looked like the game was going to be settled in a penalty shoot-out, the Blasters managed to steal the tie when Stephen Pearson scored in the 117th minute and thus help the Kerala Blasters win 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E

DeShazo's success during the season helped him become the No. 4 all-time passing leader in Virginia Tech history, finishing his career with 5,720 passing yards. DeShazo's favorite passing target was wide receiver Antonio Freeman, who finished the season having caught 38 passes for 586 yards and five touchdowns. The Gator Bowl was Freeman's final collegiate game, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was DeShazo's. Freeman finished his career as the No. 1 receiver in Virginia Tech history in terms of yardage (bowl games were not counted in statistics until 2003) with 2,207 receiving yards. Freeman also was the team's leading punt returner, having returned 39 kicks for 467 yards and a touchdown, and received second-team All-Big East honors.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} Common Sense {{was published}} in January 1776, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined {{to act as a}} conciliator. Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. Common Sense introduced no new ideas and probably had little direct effect on Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss. Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|Jaquio tells Ryu {{his master}} plan of using Ashtar as a pawn, used to awaken the true evil. He {{plans to use}} the Dark Sword of Chaos to use Irene's life force to open the Gate of Darkness and call up all the demons, while Ryu awakens them from their sleep. Jaquio then {{challenges}} Ryu to a showdown in which Ryu defeats him. Before Ryu and Irene can destroy the evil altar though, Jaquio's blood awakens the Dark Sword, which opens up the Gate of Darkness, shocks Irene and Ryu with its energy. The Demon Jashin arrives through the Gate of Darkness and reanimates the corpse of Jaquio. He then turns into a demonic wall, which Ryu, after borrowing strength from his Dragon Sword, defeats. Jashin is once again sealed away, the Dark Sword then breaks apart, the Gate of Darkness closes and disappears, and Ryu flees with Irene out of the temple <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> collapses. He then begins to mourn for Irene, who is presumed to be dead, when the power of the Dragon Sword revives her. Irene tells Ryu that she felt like she had been dreaming for a long time. Ryu tells her that the incident is over, and the game ends as the two watch the sun set.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's {{opponent}} {{in the general election}} was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor. The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates. The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level. This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw it as an opportunity to roll back prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated. The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists' support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it. The Republican Party {{was in the midst of}} a period of instability, splitting along progressive and conservative lines. Their internal problems proved to be the deciding factor in the election, giving Marshall a narrow victory: he received 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson's 48 percent. He was the first Democratic governor in two decades. Democrats also came to power in the Indiana House of Representatives by a small margin, though Republicans retained control of the Indiana Senate.|$|E
