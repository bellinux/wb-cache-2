25|$|There is {{interest}} in blackbody-like materials for camouflage and radar-absorbent materials for radar invisibility. They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a <b>hot</b> <b>material</b> with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or {{in a vacuum}} where convective heating is unavailable. They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light {{that comes from the}} wrong sources.|$|E
25|$|Hotspots are {{volcanic}} areas {{believed to}} be formed by mantle plumes, which are hypothesized to be columns of <b>hot</b> <b>material</b> rising from the core-mantle boundary in a fixed space that causes large-volume melting. Because tectonic plates move across them, each volcano becomes dormant and is eventually re-formed as the plate advances over the postulated plume. The Hawaiian Islands {{are said to have}} been formed in such a manner; so has the Snake River Plain, with the Yellowstone Caldera being the part of the North American plate above the hot spot. This theory, however, has been doubted.|$|E
25|$|The {{mass was}} found to be homogeneous, {{primarily}} composed of molten fuel and cladding. The elemental constitution was about 70wt.% uranium, 13.75wt.% zirconium, 13wt.% oxygen, with the balance being stainless steel and Inconel incorporated into the melt; the loose debris showed somewhat lower content of uranium (about 65wt.%) and higher content of structural metals. The decay heat of corium at 224 minutes after scram was estimated to be 0.13W/g, falling to 0.096W/g at scram+600 minutes. Noble gases, caesium and iodine were absent, signifying their volatilization from the <b>hot</b> <b>material.</b> The samples were fully oxidized, signifying the presence of sufficient amounts of steam to oxidize all available zirconium.|$|E

25|$|In the {{standard}} model of AGN, cold material close to a black hole forms an accretion disc. Dissipative processes in the accretion disc transport matter inwards and angular momentum outwards, while causing the accretion disc to heat up. The expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband; in addition, a corona of <b>hot</b> <b>material</b> forms above the accretion disc and can inverse-Compton scatter photons up to X-ray energies. The radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular emission lines. A large fraction of the AGN's radiation may be obscured by interstellar gas and dust close to the accretion disc, but (in a steady-state situation) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband, most likely the infrared.|$|E
25|$|With {{no strong}} central nuclear energy source, the {{interior}} of a brown dwarf is in a rapid boiling, or convective state. When combined with the rapid rotation that most brown dwarfs exhibit, convection sets up conditions {{for the development of a}} strong, tangled magnetic field near the surface. The flare observed by Chandra from LP 944-20 could have its origin in the turbulent magnetized <b>hot</b> <b>material</b> beneath the brown dwarf's surface. A sub-surface flare could conduct heat to the atmosphere, allowing electric currents to flow and produce an X-ray flare, like a stroke of lightning. The absence of X-rays from LP 944-20 during the non-flaring period is also a significant result. It sets the lowest observational limit on steady X-ray power produced by a brown dwarf, and shows that coronas cease to exist as the surface temperature of a brown dwarf cools below about 2800K and becomes electrically neutral.|$|E

500|$|The entire western {{portion of}} North America was being {{deformed}} from the Laramide orogeny starting around 70 million years ago. Gradually during millions of years, crustal rocks were folded and fractured and the seas driven away. This same bending and breaking of rocks relieved {{pressure on the}} <b>hot</b> <b>material</b> beneath the Earth's crust and permitted magma to rise toward the surface. Volcanoes burst into activity starting 30 million years ago from Washington southward along the Cascades and in the area now occupied by the Sierra Nevada.

2500|$|Although {{the violent}} {{phase of the}} 1883 {{eruption}} was over by late afternoon of 27 August, after light returned by the 29 August, reports continued for months that Krakatoa was still in eruption. One of the earliest duties of Verbeek's committee {{was to determine if}} this was true and also verify reports of other volcanoes erupting on Java and Sumatra. In general, these were found to be false, and Verbeek discounted any claims of Krakatoa still erupting after mid-October as due to steaming of <b>hot</b> <b>material,</b> landslides due to heavy monsoon rains that season, and [...] "hallucinations due to electrical activity" [...] seen from a distance.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the {{temperature}} {{difference between the}} Earth's surface and outer core {{and the ability of}} the crystalline rocks at high pressure and temperature to undergo slow, creeping, viscous-like deformation over millions of years, there is a convective material circulation in the mantle. <b>Hot</b> <b>material</b> upwells, while cooler (and heavier) material sinks downward. Downward motion of material occurs at convergent plate boundaries called subduction zones. Locations on the surface that lie over plumes are predicted to have high elevation (because of the buoyancy of the hotter, less-dense plume beneath) and to exhibit hot spot volcanism. The volcanism often attributed to deep mantle plumes is alternatively explained by passive extension of the crust, permitting magma to leak to the surface (the [...] "Plate" [...] hypothesis).|$|E

[...] The ultimate cause of the volcanism is still up for debate, but the most widely accepted idea is that the mantle plume or upwelling (similar to that associated with present-day Hawaii) initiated the widespread and voluminous basaltic volcanism about 17million years ago. As <b>hot</b> mantle plume <b>materials</b> rise and reach lower pressures, the <b>hot</b> <b>materials</b> melt and interact with the materials in the upper mantle, creating magma.
