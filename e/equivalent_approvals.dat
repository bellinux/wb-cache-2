40|$|We present new {{results in}} the areas of {{cryptography}} and voting systems. 1. Pattern matching encryption: We present new, general definitions for queryable encryption schemes – encryption schemes that allow evaluation of private queries on encrypted data without performing full decryption. We construct an efficient queryable encryption scheme supporting pattern matching queries, based on suffix trees. Storage and communication complexity are comparable to those for (unencrypted) suffix trees. The construction is based only on symmetric-key primitives, so it is practical. 2. Strategic equivalence of range voting and approval voting: We study strategic voting in the context of range voting in a formal model. We show that under general conditions, as the number of voters becomes large, strategic range voting becomes <b>equivalent</b> to <b>approval</b> voting. We propose beta distributions as a ne...|$|R
50|$|Aside from {{experience}} gained through working, formal educational opportunities {{are required to}} be provided by intern training providers, along {{with a range of}} wellbeing and advocacy infrastructure specifically tailored to interns. Accreditation of intern training programs and positions is conducted by each state's postgraduate medical council or <b>equivalent,</b> under the <b>approval</b> and authority of the Medical Board of Australia. The majority of postgraduate medical education councils are part of the state health department, though structural models vary widely. A minority are independent of the state health department. Accreditation frameworks have been nationalised since the successful adoption in 2009 of the Prevocational Medical Accreditation Framework. This important milestone, along with the Australian Curriculum Framework for Junior Doctors, represented a significant watershed moment in nationally consistent intern education and accreditation. Since then, the Medical Board of Australia have appointed the Australian Medical Council to review and further nationalise intern training and training.|$|R

His project was designed to test whether a simple dietary modification, the addition of ground grapefruit rind, would improve postprandial glucose values.

Certificates of Conformity, as specified in Annex IX of EU Directive 92/53, will be required for an automobile to enter into service. For component approvals, an endorsement that is issued under the relevant regulations by the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) is recognised as <b>equivalent</b> to an <b>approval</b> granted under comparable EU legislation. In March 1992, the EU Council formally adopted the few remaining pieces of component-related legislation {{that are necessary to}} make the whole-vehicle type approval a reality for passenger cars. In June 1992, EU member state officials approved the adoption of EU legislation creating a single system for the certification of passenger cars, in turn defining the safety, and other technical, requirements. Legislation established an EU type approval system to replace the national schemes of the twelve member states. In 1996, the EU type approval system became mandatory.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 45 new {{chemical}} entities {{had been approved}} in 1997 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in the United States. Drug sponsors apply to the FDA for approval by submitting a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA contains information accumulated by the sponsor company through its research on the proposed new drug. NDAs consist {{of a variety of}} sections including chemistry, manufacturing, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of a drug. Before drug approval, each section of an NDA is reviewed and analyzed by experts at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), a division of the FDA. If a new drug is approved, the FDA is required by federal regulation to make available to the public the information evaluated by the FDA during the drug approval process and a summary of the safety and effectiveness data. This summary is known as the Summary Basis of <b>Approval</b> <b>Equivalent</b> (SBA). An SBA is an amalgamation of the information from the sponsor’s NDA and the CDER reviewer’s analysis and summary of this information. The SBA for a specific drug may be requested from the FDA through a Freedom of Information Act Request to FOI Services (an agency of the U. S. Federal Government). Recently, a few SBAs have appeared on CDER’s web site. The sections included in an SBA are similar to those in an NDA (Fig. 1). Some of the more informative sections in an SB standpoint include: The...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with mixed dyslipidemia,single-drug therapy often fails to lower triglycerides (TG) and raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) to opti-mal levels {{set by the}} National Choles-terol Education Program (NCEP) guide-lines. 1 Statin and fibrate combination therapy can be effective in lowering TG and raising HDL-C. The risk for rhabdomyolysis with com-bination therapy is reportedly greater than that for statin or fibrate therapy alone, particularly when statins are com-bined with gemfibrozil. 2 - 4 Concern for a potentiation of adverse effects, such as rhabdomyolysis, in the clinical setting of concomitant therapy exists. 5 - 7 However, the NCEP Adult Treatment Panel III rec-ognizes use of statin-fibrate combina-tions in high-risk {{patients with}} mixed dyslipidemias. 1 Given the growing focus on aggres-sive lipid management in both high-risk patient groups (eg, diabetes) and the gen-eral population, clinicians will likely rely increasingly on combination therapy to achieve low-density lipoprotein choles-terol, TG, and HDL-C goals. 8 Until re-cently, little was known about the safety profiles of combination therapies. Fenofibric acid, the active metabolite of fenofibrate, was the first fibrate approved (December 2008) by the Food and Drug Administration for combination use with a statin to reduce TG and increase HDL-C in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk <b>equivalent.</b> 9 This <b>approval</b> was based largely on the demonstrated efficacy and safety of fenofibric acid in com-bination with statins in the largest series to date of clinical trials of fibrate-statin combinations {{for the treatment of}} mixed dyslipidemia. 10 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis: Early DD can {{be treated}} {{in a variety of}} ways, {{including}} Intralesional steroid injections and radiotherapy, but there are no objective ways of assessing disease regression. The current literature relies on clinical examination of palmar nodule consistency. An objective non-invasive measure of tissue pliability that can be used as an outcome measure to effectively compare clinical interventions is required. Method: Tonometry has been used clinically to evaluate tissue hardness of cutaneous scars and lymphoedema. The resistance of tissues to compression is measured using a durometer, a hand-held mechanical gauge which is rested against the patient’s skin. Patients with Dupuytren’s disease and healthy volunteers were recruited prospectively to a clinical trial to determine whether tonometry can be used to distinguish between the hardness of palmar nodules in patients with Dupuytren’s disease and palmar skin of healthy volunteers at an <b>equivalent</b> site. Ethical <b>approval</b> was obtained and all recruited patients gave informed written consent. Tissue hardness was measured using a durometer and scored from 0 - 100 with 100 being the hardest reading possible. Two independent assessors measured all patients using an agreed standardised protocol to minimise inter-observer variability. Each assessor was blinded to the score recorded by the other. Three measurements were taken and the mean score recorded. Results: Thirty seven participants were recruited to the study: 25 patients with Dupuytren’s disease and 12 healthy volunteers. The healthy volunteers were matched for gender and age to patients with Dupuytren’s disease. The ages of the healthy volunteer (mean ± SEM, 61. 4 ± 3. 1 years) and the patients with Dupuytren’s disease (64. 5 ± 2. 1) were similar, as was the ratio of male to female patients in both groups (3 : 1).

Conclusion: •	The hardness of palmar nodules in patients with Dupuytren’s Disease can be measured by a rapid, simple, and inexpensive tonometry test •	Further research is needed to evaluate the use of tonometry as an objective outcome measure for patients with early Dupuytren’s diseas...|$|R
