500|$|Considering the character's role in {{the wider}} context of the show as a whole, {{it was decided that}} Whitney would be {{involved}} in a sexual relationship with Bianca's partner Tony King. BBC News described the plot as an ongoing [...] "predatory paedophile storyline", noting that {{this was the first time}} this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera. The storyline was conceived when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed a documentary about homelessness, featuring a mother and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go. Ashdown questioned what might happen if a paedophile were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap. BBC Head of Drama John Yorke explained that the idea when presented [...] "drew a sharp <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b> Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> so they're always the kind of stories you look for." ...|$|E

[...] Final approval for the storyline was sought from BBC Head of Fiction Jane Tranter on 2 June 2008. Tranter explained that: [...] "I thought it was a fantastically good idea. The big moments in EastEnders, those iconic pieces of television history, tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle, and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise {{in the context of a}} family sitting room. [...] Soaps are meant to hold up a mirror to our lives, and sometimes that mirror will show ugly bits, difficult bits, taboo bits. But if a soap doesn't hold up that mirror, then actually, what is it? It will have no depth." ...|$|E

5000|$|Many of Byrne's mannerisms, {{such as the}} {{physical}} spasms, unfocused eye movements, and sharp <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> were inspired by his choreographer Toni Basil, after showing him footage of epilepsy sufferers and also viewing footage of various tribal religious rituals from around the world, incorporating some of their movements as well, {{in keeping with the}} [...] "unconscious religious lyrics." ...|$|R

500|$|Lady Bracknell's line, [...] "A handbag?", {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most {{malleable}} in English drama, lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled. Edith Evans, both on stage and in the 1952 film, delivered the line loudly in a mixture of horror, incredulity and condescension. Stockard Channing, in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in 2010, hushed the line, in a critic's words, [...] "with a barely audible 'A handbag?', rapidly swallowed up with a sharp <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b> An understated take, to be sure, but with such a well-known play, packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with a life of their own, it's the little things that make a difference." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody" [...] {{starts with}} a heavily {{synthesized}} and spoken introduction with Madonna taking a loud <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b> Madonna displayed her bubblegum pop voice in the song, which was doubletracked. The song is written in the key of A minor with the melody of the song beginning in G and rising to the second scale degree on the syllable 'bo' of 'everybody', thus highlighting the chorus which follows in the chord progression of G–A–B–A. [...] "Everybody" [...] incorporated R infused beats. Sire Records marketed the soulful nature of the dance song for the black audience and Madonna was promoted as an African-American artist, thereby fitting the record into a radio playlist where the song might chart. In New York, the song was played on 92 KTU which had an African-American audience. For {{the cover of the}} single, Sire Records portrayed a hip-hop collage of downtown New York, rather than a portrait shot of Madonna, further perpetuating the notion that Madonna was African-American.|$|E
500|$|The next track [...] "I Know It" [...] has a gentler {{swing to}} it and {{features}} music from piano, a saxophone, synth phrases while having an offbeat chord change. [...] "Holiday" [...] consists of a four-bar sequence, featuring instrumentation from guitars, electronic drums and handclaps from the Oberheim DMX, cowbell played by Madonna and a synthesized string arrangement. A side-by-side repetitive progression is achieved by making use of the chorus. Towards {{the end of the}} song, a change in the arrangement happens, where a piano break is heard. Lyrically, the song expresses the universal sentiment that everybody needs a holiday. In [...] "Think of Me", Madonna warns her erring lover that he should pay her attention or else she would leave. The song consists of beats from the Linn drum machine and a saxophone interlude. [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] is a medium paced track, with synth bass, a guitar line, sounds of a brass and Madonna singing in a shrill voice, about the attraction between herself and a boy. The last song on the album is [...] "Everybody", which starts with a heavily synthesized and spoken introduction, with Madonna taking a loud <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b> She displayed her bubblegum-pop like voice in the song, which was also doubletracked.|$|E

25|$|The {{automatic}} rhythmical {{breathing in}} and out, can be interrupted by coughing, sneezing (forms of very forceful exhalation), by {{the expression of}} a wide range of emotions (laughing, sighing, crying out in pain, exasperated <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath)</b> and by such voluntary acts as speech, singing, whistling and the playing of wind instruments. All of these actions rely on the muscles described above, and their effects on the movement of air in and out of the lungs.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Hyde shrank {{back with}} a hissing <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breath.</b> But his fear was only momentary; and {{though he did not}} look the lawyer in the face, he {{answered}} coolly enough: [...] "That is my name. What do you want?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Bianca's {{most notable}} initial storyline upon her return was a {{paedophilia}} plot revolving around Bianca's partner Tony King (Chris Coghill), and her 15 year old step daughter, Whitney. According to the Daily Mail, the storyline {{has been dubbed}} as the [...] "most controversial story-line on the show ever". The idea for the storyline was conceptualised by writer Simon Ashdown and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to EastEnders. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by {{an image of a}} woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering [...] "What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a paedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family". They pitched the idea to John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, who said that [...] "It drew a sharp <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b> Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> so they're always the kind of stories you look for." [...] However, paedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk. Diederick Santer commented, [...] "We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show." [...] It has been noted in the media that paedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although EastEnders had broached it in 2001 with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her abusive uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.|$|E

6000|$|... "What is it? What’s the matter?" [...] demanded Malcolm. [...] "Why, it’s Mr. Hirst." [...] He {{shook him}} roughly and then held some spirit to his lips. Hirst drank it greedily {{and with a}} sharp <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> his <b>breath</b> gripped him by the arm.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Trelawny {{leaned over}} and touched the linen robe. He lifted a fold at the neck, and I knew from the quick <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> his <b>breath</b> that {{something}} had surprised him. He lifted yet a little more; and then he, too, stood back and pointed, saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you there? May I come in? Answer me! I am {{lonely and}} in fear!" [...] For answer I emerged from my dim corner so swiftly {{that she was}} startled. I could hear from the quivering <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> her <b>breath</b> that she was striving--happily with success--to {{suppress}} a shriek.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} American, with an <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> and they {{remained}} for a moment, one {{gazing at the}} tree and the other at the table.|$|E
60|$|Tufts of sage grew {{close at}} its base. He {{advanced}} among them. The {{surface of the}} rock was uneven--and low down a crack showed. At that instant a slow, sobbing, gasping <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> electrified Neale.|$|E
60|$|The first sure {{effect of}} my {{announcement}} {{came in a}} quick exclamation from Wright, a sibilant <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> that {{did not seem to}} denote surprise so much as certainty. Wright might have emitted a curse with less force.|$|E
60|$|As {{she came}} to the gate {{at the lower end of}} the lane a man who was leaning over it started, with a quick <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> his <b>breath,</b> which, in any other man than Romney Penhallow, or for any other woman than Lucinda Penhallow, would have been an exclamation of surprise.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hatchard {{opened his}} mouth, but speech failed him. He {{got up and}} left the room without a word, and, making his way to the scullery, turned on the tap and held his head beneath it. A sharp <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breath</b> {{announced}} that a tributary stream was looking for the bump down the neck of his shirt.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her {{steadily}} till he grasped the full import. His face flushed, and with a quick <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> the <b>breath</b> he straightened up and threw back his head. He made a sweeping gesture as though to include the island. [...] "Then you, and I, the tent, the boats, cabins, trees, everything, and La Bijou! Pouf! and all are gone, to the devil!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane, the hell--of it," [...] he replied, {{with deep}} <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] "is you can't ride away. Mebbe realizin' it {{accounts}} for my grabbin' you--that way, {{as much as the}} crazy boy's rapture your words gave me. I don't understand myself.... But the hell of this game is--you can't ride away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Half-an-hour ago, eh?" [...] said Sir Terence, {{and from}} Colquhoun Grant {{there was a}} sharp and audible <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> {{expressive}} either of understanding, or surprise, or both. The adjutant looked at Tremayne again. [...] "As my questions seem only to entangle you further," [...] he said, [...] "I think you had better do as I suggest without more protests: report yourself under arrest to Colonel Fletcher in the morning, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Steele--wait!" [...] called Miss Sampson as {{he stepped}} out. He uttered a little sound like a hiss or a gasp or an <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> I did not know what; and then the incomprehensible fellow {{bestowed}} a kick upon me that I thought about broke my leg. But I understood and gamely endured the pain. Then {{we were looking at}} Diane Sampson. She was white and wonderful. She stepped out of the door, close to Steele. She did not see me; she cared nothing for my presence. All the world would not have mattered to her then.|$|E
60|$|The young squire {{was leaning}} forward, {{gazing at the}} {{stirring}} and martial scene, {{when he heard a}} short, quick gasp at his shoulder, and there was the Lady Maude, with her hand to her heart, leaning up against the wall, slender and fair, like a half-plucked lily. Her face was turned away from him, but he could see, by the sharp <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> her <b>breath,</b> that she was weeping bitterly.|$|R
5000|$|Slydini became {{largely unknown}} to the public but a legend {{to those in the}} magic profession. He was {{constantly}} featured in the magic magazines and publications. The Linking Ring, a publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, highlighted him in their 1951 February issue. Talk show host Dick Cavett wrote about his first meeting with Slydini in a New York Times column, [...] "Doug Henning said to me, ‘Tony’s doing a special demonstration for some magicians tomorrow night at Vesuvio restaurant. Come.’ Tomorrow night finally came. For the magicians, sitting for nearly two hours at that table, sudden gasps and <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> abounded. It was like seeing a man walk up a wall. Nothing prepared you for it. Right at the start, a solid, heavy silver dollar, held before my eyes, vanished into thinnest air. And by no method I knew of. Certainly no sleeves. The two hours flew too quickly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Dr. Watson, that's not you, is it? You are {{the last}} man that I should have {{expected}} to see out on the moor {{at this time of}} night. But, dear me, what's this? Somebody hurt? Not--don't tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!" [...] He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> his <b>breath</b> and the cigar fell from his fingers.|$|R
60|$|The {{door had}} opened. They {{could see a}} figure dimly {{outlined}} in the semi-darkness. Footsteps passed down into the vault, and there came a sound as if the unknown had cannoned into a chair, followed by a sharp <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> expressive of pain. A scraping sound, and a flash of light, {{and part of the}} vault was lit by a candle. O'Hara {{caught a glimpse of the}} unknown's face as he rose from lighting the candle, but it was not enough to enable him to recognise him. The candle was standing on a chair, and the light it gave was too feeble to reach the face of any one not on a level with it.|$|E
60|$|He glanced curiously at Sparrer, {{wondering}} what responsive chords might be {{struck in the}} soul of this waif of the great city, {{but it was too}} dark to see his features clearly, and he could only dimly surmise something of the younger lad's feeling from Sparrer's quick <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> as the dark, heavy coaches of the train rumbled off into the night, leaving them standing between two walls of white. Overhead a myriad of stars burned like jewels. Never had they seemed so near, so brilliant, so alive. The snow thrown high {{on either side of the}} tracks, for there was a siding at this point, was above their heads. The stillness was almost oppressive now that the train was beyond hearing.|$|E
6000|$|With a quick <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath</b> {{he tried}} {{to get a grip on}} himself. He thought of the battles he had fought with bullies older and bigger than himself, and had won because he had kept his head in the heat of contest and had coolly taken {{advantage}} of every opening. But that was different. Then he was in action and it was easier to keep cool. Then, too, if he missed one blow there was a chance for another. It was this sitting still with the knowledge that there would be but one chance, and that this must be taken at just the right moment or be lost forever that upset him so. Then curiously enough the motto of the Boy Scouts flashed into his head--"Be prepared." [...] It was like a tonic to his shaking nerves. Was not a Scout supposed to be prepared for all emergencies, and what was this but a form of emergency? ...|$|E
