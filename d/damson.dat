500|$|The Good Huswifes Jewell gives {{recipes for}} making fruit tarts using fruits {{as varied as}} apple, peach, cherry, <b>damson,</b> pear, and mulberry. For {{stuffing}} for meat and poultry, or as Dawson says [...] "to farse all things", he recommends using the herbs thyme, hyssop, and parsley, mixed with egg yolk, white bread, raisins or barberries, and spices including cloves, mace, cinnamon and ginger, {{all in the same}} dish. A sauce for pork was made with white wine, broth, nutmeg, and the herbs rosemary, bay, thyme, and marjoram.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is a body}} of anecdotal {{evidence}} that <b>damsons</b> {{were used in the}} British dye and cloth manufacturing industries in the 18th and 19th centuries, with examples occurring in every major damson-growing area (Buckinghamshire, Cheshire, Westmorland, Shropshire and Worcestershire). Stories that <b>damsons</b> were used to dye khaki army uniforms are particularly common. However, a 2005 report for conservancy body English Nature could find no documentary evidence within the dyeing industry that <b>damsons</b> were ever a source of dye, noting that use of natural dyes declined rapidly after the 1850s, and concluded that [...] "there seems no evidence that <b>damsons</b> were used extensively or techniques using them developed". The main recorded use of <b>damsons</b> in the industrial era was in commercial jam-making, and orchards were widespread until the Second World War, after which changing tastes, the effect of wartime sugar rationing, and the relatively high cost of British-grown fruit caused a steep decline.|$|R
5000|$|To confuse matters, the White Bullace was in {{the past}} sold in London markets under the name of [...] "white damson". Bullaces can usually be {{distinguished}} from <b>damsons</b> by their spherical shape, relatively smooth stones, and poorer flavour, and generally ripen up to a month later in the year than <b>damsons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{nearly all}} <b>damsons,</b> bullaces may be either [...] "white" [...] (i.e. yellow or green) or [...] "black" [...] (i.e. blue or purple) in colour, and ripen {{up to six}} weeks later in the year. Though smaller than most <b>damsons,</b> bullaces are {{much larger than the}} closely related sloe. Their flavour is usually rather acidic until fully ripe.|$|R
500|$|Fruit was readily {{combined}} with meat, fish and eggs. The recipe for Tart de brymlent, a fish pie from the recipe collection Forme of Cury, includes {{a mix of}} figs, raisins, apples and pears with fish (salmon, codling or haddock) and pitted <b>damson</b> plums under the top crust. It was considered important {{to make sure that}} the dish agreed with contemporary standards of medicine and dietetics. This meant that food had to be [...] "tempered" [...] according to its nature by an appropriate combination of preparation and mixing certain ingredients, condiments and spices; fish was seen as being cold and moist, and best cooked in a way that heated and dried it, such as frying or oven baking, and seasoned with hot and dry spices; beef was dry and hot and should therefore be boiled; pork was hot and moist and should therefore always be roasted. In some recipe collections, alternative ingredients were assigned with more consideration to the humoral nature than what a modern cook would consider to be similarity in taste. In a recipe for quince pie, cabbage is said to work equally well, and in another turnips could be replaced by pears.|$|E
2500|$|The {{different}} kinds of Obstler {{are similar to the}} varieties of Rakija found in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. [...] Slivovitz is a popular schnapps made from <b>Damson</b> plums found throughout the region.|$|E
2500|$|Birmingham & Solihull R.F.C., {{known as}} [...] "the Bees", a {{professional}} rugby union team which competes in National League 3. The club played at Sharmans Cross Road until August 2010, and following a brief spell at Solihull Moors' <b>Damson</b> Park ground the club now play at Portway.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Damsons</b> do take a {{long time}} to bear fruit, as the ancient rhyme has it:- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That evening, while I set on {{the counter}} with a peach and two <b>damsons</b> in my mouth, I asked Uncle Emsley how Miss Willella was.|$|R
6000|$|In the Mount Hope kitchen Miss Salome was at {{that moment}} deep in {{discussion}} with her [...] "help" [...] over the weighty question of how the <b>damsons</b> were to be preserved. Miss Salome wanted them boiled; Clemantiny Bosworth, the help, insisted that they ought to be baked. Clemantiny was always very positive. She had [...] "bossed" [...] Miss Salome for years, and both knew that in the end the <b>damsons</b> would be baked, but the argument had to be carried out for dignity's sake.|$|R
2500|$|The largest {{football}} {{club in the}} town is Solihull Moors, who play at <b>Damson</b> Park, [...] from the town centre. The club was established in 2007 following the merger of Solihull Borough and Moor Green and currently play in the National League after being promoted from the National League North {{at the end of}} the 2015-16 season.|$|E
2500|$|Local {{specialties}} {{include the}} quiche, the potée, the Lorrain pâté, and also suckling pig. Different recipes, such as jam, tart, charcuterie and fruit brandy, {{are made from}} the Mirabelle and <b>Damson</b> plums. Also, Metz is the cradle of some pastries like the Metz cheese pie and the Metz Balls (...) , a ganache-stuffed biscuit coated with marzipan, caramel, and dark chocolate. Local beverages include Moselle wine and Amos beer.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{at the top}} of View Road there were woods {{stretching}} almost to the river, with wild cobnuts, and chestnuts too. There were wild <b>damsons</b> in the area, and apple trees were planted and mature by the 1950s.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you don't}} want <b>damsons</b> sweet, do you?" [...] {{retorted}} Clemantiny scornfully. [...] "That's {{the beauty of}} damsons--their tartness. And they keep ever so much better baked, Salome--you know they do. My grandmother always baked hers, and they would keep for three years." ...|$|R

25|$|Sloe gin is {{traditionally}} {{described as a}} liqueur made by infusing sloes (the fruit of the blackthorn) in gin, although modern versions are almost always compounded from neutral spirits and flavourings.

6000|$|Mr Brandon made no {{immediate}} answer. He gave Mrs Null some <b>damson</b> preserves, {{and he took}} some himself, and then he helped himself to a great hot roll, from a plate that Letty had just brought in, and carefully opening it he buttered it on the inside, and covered one-half of it with the <b>damson</b> preserves. This he began slowly to eat, drinking at times from the foaming glass of buttermilk {{at the side of}} his plate, from which the coffee-cup had been removed. When he had finished the half roll he again spoke. [...] "I think, my dear young lady, that your aunt is desirous of having your marriage set aside." ...|$|E
6000|$|While her {{powers were}} growing she {{necessarily}} passed through many phases. She became deeply religious, and wrote poetry, pious and sweet, fair of its kind. Music was a passion with her; in a characteristic letter written {{at the age}} of twenty to a friend she tries but fails to describe her experience on hearing the 'Messiah' of Birmingham: 'With a stupid, drowsy sensation, produced by standing sentinel over <b>damson</b> cheese and a warm stove, I cannot do better than ask you to read, if accessible, Wordsworth's short poem on the [...] "Power of Sound."' There you have a concise history of George Eliot's life at this period, divided as it was between music, literature, and <b>damson</b> cheese.|$|E

50|$|The {{area was}} {{formerly}} agricultural. In the early 19th century, Michael Keens developed two commercially important varieties of strawberry, Keens' Imperial and Keens' Seedling, on Worton Lane. In the 1890s, George Tebbutt was growing prize-winning <b>damsons</b> and lilies at Mogden House. The 18th-century house survives in Bankside Close.|$|R
50|$|Prunus domestica (sometimes informally {{referred}} to as Prunus × domestica) is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. A deciduous tree, it includes many varieties of the fruit trees known as plums in English, though not all plums belong to this species. The greengages and <b>damsons</b> also belong to subspecies of P. domestica.|$|R
6000|$|Grace {{sank down}} on the oak chest which stood on the landing, and put {{her hands to her}} now flushed face and head. Could she order Suke <b>Damson</b> down-stairs and out of the house? Her husband might be brought in at any moment, and what would happen? But could she order this {{genuinely}} grieved woman away? ...|$|E
60|$|Retreating {{into the}} gloom of the broad landing she saw rise up the stairs a woman whom at first she did not recognize, till her voice {{revealed}} her to be Suke <b>Damson,</b> in great fright and sorrow. A streak {{of light from the}} partially closed door of Grace's room fell upon her face as she came forward, and it was drawn and pale.|$|E
6000|$|Gillian {{instantly}} {{took the}} hint. [...] "Was it Damian de Lacy you asked after?--Alas I poor young gentleman! no offices or lands for him-- {{more likely to}} have a gallows-cast, poor lad--and all for nought, as I am a true dame. Damian!--no, no, it is not Damian, or <b>damson</b> neither--but Randal Lacy, that must rule the roast, and have all the old man's lands, and livings, and lordships." ...|$|E
60|$|We tramped down {{to dinner}} with only the {{clinging}} warmth of the sunshine for a coat. In this still, enfolding weather a quiet companionship is very grateful. Autumn creeps through everything. The little <b>damsons</b> in the pudding taste of September, and are fragrant with memory. The voices of those at table are softer and more reminiscent than at haytime.|$|R
60|$|Miss Salome {{knew that}} when Clemantiny dragged her {{grandmother}} into the question, {{it was time to}} surrender. Beyond that, dignity degenerated into stubbornness. It would be useless to say that {{she did not want to}} keep her <b>damsons</b> for three years, and that she was content to eat them up and trust to Providence for the next year's supply.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the produce}} {{supplied}} {{to the restaurant}} is grown on Rogan's nearby twelve acre farm. The farm grows a variety of vegetables, herbs, edible flowers and rears meat including cows, chickens and pigs. The farm also has a young orchard which will grow a variety of fruit including apples, <b>damsons</b> and pears. Some of the food is also foraged by the restaurant's full-time forager.|$|R
