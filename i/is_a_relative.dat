5|$|Additionally, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> {{absence of}} objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot {{apparently}} {{be explained by}} the present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E

5|$|The common council {{consists}} of 10 members, six {{of whom are}} elected from single-member districts. The other four, including its president, are elected at-large. The council has eight standing committees for issues including transportation, education, finance and public safety. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> balance between the Democratic and Republican parties, a change from the predominantly single-party politics of the 20thcentury. Throughout the 1950s, Democrats ran the city council and mayoralty.|$|E

Evidence among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa shows an absolute decrease in risk of 1.8% which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> decrease of between 38percent and 66percent over twoyears, and in this population studies rate it cost effective. Whether it is of benefit in developed countries is undetermined.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the Enhydra lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris. The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> newcomer to a marine existence. In some respects, though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.|$|E
5|$|The Stranges {{become a}} popular couple in London. Lady Pole and Strange's wife, Arabella, become friends and during one of her visits Arabella meets the gentleman with thistle-down hair, whom she assumes <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative.</b> The Cabinet ministers find Strange {{easier to deal with}} than Norrell, and they send him to assist the Duke of Wellington on his Peninsular Campaign. For over a year, Strange helps the army: he creates roads, moves towns, and makes dead men speak. After he returns, he fails to cure George III's madness, {{although}} Strange manages to save the king from the gentleman with thistle-down hair, who is determined to make Stephen a king. Strange then helps defeat Napoleon at the horrific Battle of Waterloo.|$|E

5|$|With Vikram cast in {{the title}} role, Saran was searching for a {{newcomer}} to play the female lead role of a Marwari woman. Kiran Rathod {{is a native of}} Rajasthan, the place where the Marwaris originate from. She <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> of actress Raveena Tandon, whose manager brought Rathod the offer to act in Gemini. Saran was convinced after seeing a photograph of Rathod and cast her; Gemini thus became her debut Tamil film. Malayalam actors Kalabhavan Mani and Murali were approached to play significant roles.|$|E
5|$|According to the Coat of Arms Act, {{everyone}} {{can use the}} Polish flag, especially during national and cultural events, {{as long as it}} is done in a respectful manner. This liberty in the use of national colors <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. The use of both variants was restricted, but only flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 until 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year. After 1985, unauthorized use of any national symbols was an infraction. A possible explanation to such harsh measures was the fact that the officially-promoted holiday of May 1st was separated by only one day from the pre-war (and current) national holiday of Poland, the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. While hoisting a flag on May 1 was acceptable, no later than the following day it must have been hidden.|$|E
5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries where there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry {{in relation to a}} nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E

5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the crucial}} points {{is that there are}} several {{different}} sources for the Battle itself, including poems and songs in Old English, Old Norse, Old Welsh, Middle English, Latin, and Anglo-Norman, highlighting a wide potential of sources in order to glean information about the battle from all sides of the campaign. Furthermore, while these sources might be seen as biased due to national origin and underlying romantic and heroic narrative constructions of the battle for each side, some of the sources, such as the Chronicle work as points of reference to the more lyrical constructions presented in other popular narrative formats. Although there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>relative</b> lack of iron-clad primary sources that are completely unbiased, by taking into account all of these sources, historians and literary scholars can gain a fuller image of the military maneuvers and actions taken by the respective leaders of armies involved in this battle.|$|E
