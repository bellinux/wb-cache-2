5|$|Considered only a two-star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, Blount was {{not ranked}} among the best running back {{prospects}} {{in the nation in}} the Class of 2005. Barely recruited out of high school, he attended camp at Auburn University but was not offered an athletic scholarship. He nonetheless intended to go to Auburn but did not qualify academically, so he headed <b>for</b> <b>junior</b> college at East Mississippi Community College.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{dramatically}} {{expanded the}} college during his tenure, {{both in terms}} of headcount and academic diversity. Enrolment grew from 1,089students upon his arrival in 1961 to 5,503students on his departure in 1971. In 1959, there were two degrees and five programs available; in 1969–70 there were seven degrees and 45programs. There were 94graduate students in 1961; the first master's programs were offered in 1967, and by 1969 the number of graduate students had risen to 741. In 1969 alone, 80new faculty members were hired, a number larger than the total number of faculty members a decade earlier. Several new buildings were constructed, including nine dormitories and five academic buildings. Policy changes occurred as well: in 1966, the curfew <b>for</b> <b>junior</b> and senior women was abolished, and fraternities and sororities were allowed on campus. In 1970, Boyd was named the University System of Georgia's first vice chancellor for academic development, effective once his successor (Emory graduate Ward B. Pafford) was appointed in 1971.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, Psara {{had been}} {{withdrawn}} from active duty {{to serve as}} a training ship for engine room personnel. At the outbreak of World War I at the end of July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which was a source of tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October 1916; the heavy units of the Greek fleet were disarmed and placed in reserve {{for the remainder of the}} war. After the end of the war, Psara became a school for quartermasters and later a school <b>for</b> <b>junior</b> boys at Poros, until she was sold for scrap in 1932.|$|E

5|$|McNichol {{was born}} in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. His father, Danny, {{died when he was}} five, so McNichol and seven {{siblings}} were raised by their mother, Catherine. He attended St Joseph's School in Kilmarnock, and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper's shop when he left school. His shop work stopped him playing football on Saturdays, but he was able to play some midweek football <b>for</b> <b>Junior</b> club Hurlford United. When he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic, he became available on Saturdays as well. Hurlford paid him ten shillings a game, nearly as much as his apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the Fleet Air Arm as a mechanic, but was able to play friendly matches for Inverness-based club Clachnacuddin. Because of the number of professional players stationed around the country, such matches were played at a fairly high standard.|$|E
5|$|Still {{eligible}} <b>for</b> <b>junior,</b> Brulé {{made the}} Blue Jackets' roster for the 2006–07 season. A month into the campaign, he was assured by General Manager Doug MacLean {{that he would}} not be returned to the Giants as he had been the previous season. He was scratched several times under head coach Gerard Gallant, but after Gallant was replaced by Ken Hitchcock in late-November, he began receiving more playing time. Playing mostly on the fourth line in his rookie season, he averaged 10minutes of ice time per game. He went on to tally 19points (9goals and 10assists) over 78games in his first full NHL season.|$|E

5|$|The IAAF ratifies {{track and}} field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first {{published}} a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes {{were made in the}} late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if fully automatic electronic timing was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in {{track and field}}, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records <b>for</b> <b>junior</b> athletes under 20 years old.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new school year, Quinn is reinstated as head cheerleader. She begins dating new glee club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), and later accepts a promise ring from him. When Sue forces Quinn, Santana and Brittany to choose between cheerleading and the glee club, all three initially go with the Cheerios to retain their popularity, but are later convinced by Finn to defect to New Directions. Quinn cheats on Sam with Finn, and Sam dumps Quinn after she lies to him about her time with Finn. She and Finn reunite, and Quinn starts campaigning <b>for</b> <b>junior</b> prom king and queen elections. Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), Puck's new girlfriend and one of Quinn's rivals for prom queen, discovers that before transferring to McKinley High, Quinn was known by her first name, Lucy. She was overweight and unpopular, and after slimming down and having rhinoplasty, reinvented herself as Quinn, using her middle name. At prom, Finn is thrown out for fighting with Rachel's date Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff). Quinn is not named prom queen, and blames Rachel for her loss. She slaps her, but immediately regrets it and apologizes. Finn later breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel.|$|E

25|$|On December 4 of {{the same}} year, the designs of the court uniforms for civil {{officials}} were modified, but the designs <b>for</b> <b>junior</b> officials were not updated. Because the officials were responsible for providing their own court uniforms, the cost had been too much <b>for</b> <b>junior</b> officials. From this point on, junior civil officials wore standard white tie court dress. The difference in price was extreme: when the official Kikuchi Takeo ordered both a three-piece suit and his court uniform at the same shop, the suit cost 28 yen and the uniform 220 yen.|$|E
