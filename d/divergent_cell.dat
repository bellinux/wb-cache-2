30|$|We found {{evidence}} for highly <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> cycle regulation of FA pathway genes, with FANCA {{being the only}} gene upregulated[*]≥[*] 2 -fold in all four assayed conditions. Cell cycle upregulation {{is associated with the}} E 2 F/RB 1 network; inactivation of RB 1 due to mutation results in higher levels of specific FA genes. Importantly, our studies also indicate that RB 1 -mutated retinoblastoma are not characterized by a general upregulation of the canonical FA pathway, since the important core complex member FANCF turned out to be lower expressed associated with low DNA copy numbers; a finding with direct therapeutic implications. Surprisingly, two tools exploiting public data sets indicated coregulation of FANCA (acting in the upstream branch of the FA network) with BRCA 1 (acting downstream).|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} the role of Notch- 1 and its {{antagonist}} Numb in the activation of satellite cells during postnatal myogenesis. Activation of Notch- 1 promoted the proliferation of myogenic precursor cells expressing the premyoblast marker Pax 3. Attenuation of Notch signaling by increases in Numb expression led to the commitment of progenitor cells to the myoblast cell fate and the expression of myogenic regulatory factors, desmin, and Pax 7. In many intermediate progenitor cells, Numb was localized asymmetrically in actively dividing cells, suggesting an asymmetric cell division and <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> fates of daughter cells. The results indicate that satellite cell activation results in a heterogeneous population of precursor cells with respect to Notch- 1 activity and that the balance between Notch- 1 and Numb controls cellular homeostasis and cell fate determination...|$|E

The monocytes contained only one tenth the amount of myeloperoxidase, one half the amount of lysozyme, one half the amount of acid,hosphatase, and one half the amount of beta-glucuronidase found in granulocytes; the monocytes contained no alkaline phosphatase or neutral protease. The lymphocyte fraction contained only acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase in amounts one {{half as much as}} in the monocytes. Fluctuations in enzyme levels of monocytes and granulocytes were noted following infection. In vitro, the isolated monocytes transformed into macrophages.

40|$|Neuroblastoma {{and other}} {{pediatric}} tumors show {{a paucity of}} gene mutations, which has sparked an interest in their epigenetic regulation. Several tumor types include phenotypically <b>divergent</b> <b>cells,</b> resembling cells from different lineage development stages. It has been proposed that super-enhancer-associated transcription factor (TF) networks underlie lineage identity, but the role of these enhancers in intratumoral heterogeneity is unknown. Here we show that most neuroblastomas include two types of tumor <b>cells</b> with <b>divergent</b> gene expression profiles. Undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and committed adrenergic cells can interconvert and resemble cells from different lineage differentiation stages. ChIP-seq analysis of isogenic pairs of mesenchymal and adrenergic cells identified a distinct super-enhancer landscape and super-enhancer-associated TF network for each cell type. Expression of the mesenchymal TF PRRX 1 could reprogram the super-enhancer and mRNA landscapes of adrenergic cells toward a mesenchymal state. Mesenchymal cells were more chemoresistant in vitro and were enriched in post-therapy and relapse tumors. Two super-enhancer-associated TF networks, which probably mediate lineage control in normal development, thus dominate epigenetic control of neuroblastoma and shape intratumoral heterogeneit...|$|R
40|$|Developing T cells face {{a series}} of cell fate choices in the thymus and in the periphery. The role of the {{individual}} T cell receptor (TCR) in determining decisions of cell fate remains unresolved. The stochastic/selection model postulates that the initial fate of the cell is independent of TCR specificity, with survival dependent on additional TCR/coreceptor “rescue” signals. The “instructive” model holds that cell fate is initiated by {{the interaction of the}} TCR with a cognate peptide-MHC complex. T cells are then segregated on the basis of TCR specificity with the aid of critical coreceptors and signal modulators [Chan S, Correia-Neves M, Benoist C, Mathis (1998) Immunol Rev 165 : 195 – 207]. The former would predict a random representation of individual TCR across <b>divergent</b> T <b>cell</b> lineages whereas the latter would predict minimal overlap between <b>divergent</b> T <b>cell</b> subsets. To address this issue, we have used high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the TCR distribution among key T cell developmental and effector subsets from a single donor. We found numerous examples of individual subsets sharing identical TCR sequence, supporting a model of a stochastic process of cell fate determination coupled with dynamic patterns of clonal expansion of T cells bearing the same TCR sequence among both CD 4 + and CD 8 + populations...|$|R

30|$|The innate {{immune system}} acts as {{the first line of}} defense against pathogens, which is also {{essential}} for initiation of adaptive immunity. Innate immune responses are initiated by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize conserved molecular structures of pathogens called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The infection of virus triggers a series of signaling events leading to transcriptional induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. In recent years, the mechanisms of viral RNA recognition and RNA virus-triggered signaling pathways have been well studied. However, it remains unclear on how DNA virus infection is sensed by host cells and triggers the host antiviral defense. Although ten potential viral DNA sensors have been reported, none of them is validated as a generally used sensor for distinct DNA viruses in <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> types and animals. Here, we provide a summary and perspective on recent advances in innate immune responses to DNA viruses.|$|E

The divergent cellular processes observed in these more distant lineages are still largely unknown in the general scientific community. Despite the relative obscurity of these organisms, comparative studies of them across eukaryotic diversity have had profound implications for our understanding of fundamental cell biology in all species and have revealed the evolution and origins of previously observed cellular processes.

40|$|SummaryDuring {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) stress, homeostatic signaling through the unfolded protein response (UPR) augments ER protein-folding capacity. If homeostasis is not restored, the UPR triggers apoptosis. We {{found that the}} ER transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase) IRE 1 α is {{a key component of}} this apoptotic switch. ER stress induces IRE 1 α kinase autophosphorylation, activating the RNase to splice XBP 1 mRNA and produce the homeostatic transcription factor XBP 1 s. Under ER stress—or forced autophosphorylation—IRE 1 α's RNase also causes endonucleolytic decay of many ER-localized mRNAs, including those encoding chaperones, as early events culminating in apoptosis. Using chemical genetics, we show that kinase inhibitors bypass autophosphorylation to activate the RNase by an alternate mode that enforces XBP 1 splicing and averts mRNA decay and apoptosis. Alternate RNase activation by kinase-inhibited IRE 1 α can be reconstituted in vitro. We propose that <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> fates during ER stress hinge on a balance between IRE 1 α RNase outputs that can be tilted with kinase inhibitors to favor survival...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{have known}} for some time that the {{epidemiology}} of human stroke is sexually dimorphic until late in life, well beyond the years of reproductive senescence and menopause. Now, a new concept is emerging: the mechanisms and outcome of cerebral ischemic injury are influenced strongly by biological sex as well as the availability of sex steroids to the brain. The principal mammalian estrogen (17 β estradiol or E 2) is neuroprotective in many types of brain injury and has been the major focus of investigation over the past several decades. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that although hormones are a major contributor to sex-specific outcomes, they do not fully account for sex-specific responses to cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent studies in cell culture and animal models that suggest that genetic sex determines experimental stroke outcome and that <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> death pathways are activated after an ischemic insult. These sex differences need to be identified if we are to develop efficacious neuroprotective agents for use in stroke patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Fanconi anemia (FA/BRCA) {{signaling}} network controls multiple genome-housekeeping checkpoints, from interphase DNA repair to mitosis. The in vivo role of abnormal cell division in FA remains unknown. Here, we quantified {{the origins of}} genomic instability in FA patients and mice in vivo and ex vivo. We found that both mitotic errors and interphase DNA damage significantly contribute to genomic instability during FA-deficient hematopoiesis and in nonhematopoietic human and murine FA primary cells. Super-resolution microscopy coupled with functional assays revealed that FANCA shuttles to the pericentriolar material to regulate spindle assembly at mitotic entry. Loss of FA signaling rendered cells hypersensitive to spindle chemotherapeutics and allowed escape from the chemotherapy-induced spindle assembly checkpoint. In support of these findings, direct comparison of DNA crosslinking and anti-mitotic chemotherapeutics in primary FANCA-/- cells revealed genomic instability originating through <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> cycle checkpoint aberrations. Our data indicate that FA/BRCA signaling functions as an in vivo gatekeeper of genomic integrity throughout interphase and mitosis, which may have implications for future targeted therapies in FA and FA-deficient cancers...|$|E

As all these cell types are ultimately derived from common hematopoietic precursors, they each become distinct from other cell types at developmental choice points that define a time course of branching lineage relationships.

ACSCs were isolated, quantified and cultured from healthy and OA joints.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} variations in channel morphology, near-bed velocity, shear stress, bedload transport rate, pebble tracer movement, and bedload and bed material size distribution were measured in seven different channel patterns in two gravel-bed rivers in the Scottish Highlands (the Dubhaig and Feshie) and a proglacial stream in Norway (the Lyngsdalselva). The {{results showed that}} there were discernible links between the channel processes and changes which were consistent for all river types. 169 shear stress estimates from velocity profiles with changing discharge showed that Keller's (1971) velocity-reversal hypothesis holds true in different channel patterns of gravel-bed rivers and can be extended to include subunits of the pool/riffle cycle. At discharges near bankfull there is {{a decrease in the}} flow strength and amount of bedload movement from the poolhead down to the pooltail (and then riffle). On a broader scale 72 Helley-Smith bedload samples and the movement of over 3700 pebble tracers showed that the entrainment of different size fractions from heterogeneous bed material is inefficient and is overpredicted by the traditional bedload transport equations. Empirical analyses showed that when the armour is mobile/broken large and small particles have almost equal mobility as first proposed by Parker et al. (1982) and Andrews (1983). However for the majority of flow conditions the armour is static and entrainment is selective {{to a greater or lesser}} degree depending on the availability of appropriate-sized sediment at the surface and from bank erosion. The magnitude and direction of flow strength and bedload transport helps to explain the location and mode of channel development as revealed by repeated levelling and mapping. The accelerating convergent/decelerating <b>divergent</b> <b>cells</b> of flow alter the channel morphology in predictable ways. The positions of these cells can change with increasing discharge as the channel becomes generally, rather than locally, competent to move coarse sediment.

40|$|The {{family of}} Rho GTPases are {{intracellular}} signal transducers that link cell surface signals to multiple intracellular responses. They are {{best known for}} their role in regulating actin dynamics required for cell migration, but in addition control cell-cell adhesion, polarization, vesicle trafficking, and the cell cycle. The roles of Rho GTPases in single mesenchymal cell migration are well established and rely on Cdc 42 - and Rac-dependent cell protrusion of a leading edge, coupled to Rho-dependent contractility required to move the cell body forward. In cells migrating collectively, cell-cell junctions are maintained, and migrating leader cells are mechanically coupled to, and coordinate, migration with follower cells. Recent evidence suggests that Rho GTPases provide multifunctional input to collective cell polarization, cell-cell interaction, and migration. Here, we discuss the role of Rho GTPases in initiating and maintaining front-rear, apical-basal cell polarization, mechanotransduction, and cell-cell junction stability between leader and follower cells, and how these roles are integrated in collective migration. Thereby, spatiotemporal fine-tuning of Rho GTPases within the same cell and among cells in the cell group are crucial in controlling potentially conflicting, <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion and cytoskeletal functions to achieve supracellular coordination and mechanocoupling...|$|E
40|$|Somatic {{mutations}} are an underappreciated {{source of}} genetic variation within multi-cellular organisms. The resulting genetic mosaicism should be particularly abundant in large clones of vegetatively propagating angiosperms. Little is known on the abundance and ecological correlates of genetic mosaicism in field populations, despite its potential evolutionary significance. Because sexual reproduction restores genetic homogeneity, we predicted that in facultatively clonally reproducing organisms, {{the prevalence of}} genetic mosaicism increases with increasing clonality. This was tested among 33 coastal locations colonized by the ecologically important marine angiosperm Zostera marina, ranging from Portugal to Finland. Genetic mosaics were detectable as complex microsatellite genotypes at two hypervariable loci that revealed additional mosaic alleles, suggesting the presence {{of one or more}} <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> lineages within the same ramet. The proportions of non-mosaic genotypes in a population sharply decreased below a clonal richness of 0. 2. Accordingly, more genetic mosaics were found at the southern and northern limit of the distribution of Z. marina in Europe where sexual reproduction is rare or absent. The genetic mosaics observed at neutral microsatellite markers suggest the possibility of within-clone variation at selectively relevant loci and supports the notion that members of clones are seldom genetically identical...|$|E
30|$|The encoded {{proteins}} of coregulated genes often {{participate in}} the same pathway. When we characterized the expression of genes of the FA/BRCA-pathway, we found evidence for highly <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> type and stimulus-dependent regulation of mRNA levels for the FA pathway, which only can become apparent by in parallel comparisons as done in this study. Especially, the genes encoding for proteins which build up the core complex show strikingly different levels of cell cycle regulation. When comparing the individual subcomplexes from the core complex, one member of a subcomplex {{turned out to be}} stronger cell cycle regulated than the other member(s), e.g. FANCA versus FANCG (Figure  1 b). Interestingly, the more strongly cell cycle regulated gene of each subcomplex contains Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS)-encoding sequences, while the other partner(s) lacks a positive motif score (Haitjema et al. 2013). It could be hypothesized that the FA genes/proteins of the core complex bearing NLSs constitute the driving forces for nuclear complex assembly. Overall, in our assays, FANCA turned out to be most affected by proliferative stimuli. In line with this, FANCA induction had also been observed employing two other cell-cycle approaches (Whitfield et al. 2002; Hoskins et al. 2008). Together, this provides evidence for strong cell cycle regulation of especially FANCA.|$|E

Herein, we show that partial knockdown of nucleoporin p 62 (NUP 62) by small-interfering RNA confers cisplatin resistance to cultured high-grade ovarian carcinoma cells. Treatment with NUP 62 small-interfering RNA and cisplatin leaves resistant cells in a state of dormancy; some dormant cells can be induced to proliferate by transient induction of NUP 62 expression from an ectopic expression construct. In addition to suggesting functional links between nuclear pore complex architecture and cancer cell survival, the culture system provides a novel experimental window into the dynamics of tumor cell drug resistance and dormancy...|$|R

Furthermore, CD 24 can be used to delineate epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in mouse pluripotent culture.

Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major DNA damaging agent that can be produced by both natural and man-made sources. A common source of radiation exposure is through its use in medical diagnostics or treatments such as for cancer radiotherapy where relatively high doses are received by patients. To understand the detailed DNA repair gene transcription response to high dose IR, gene expression exon array studies have been performed and the response to radiation in two <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> types, lymphoblastoid cell lines and primary fibroblasts, has been examined.

Three-dimensional tissues demonstrated stromal cells with morphologic features of mature fibroblasts, type IV collagen deposition in the basement membrane, and a stratified epithelium that expressed cytokeratin 12.

The enhancer recruited distinct inducible tissue-specific enhanceosome-like complexes and directed nucleosomes to different positions in these cell types. In undifferentiated T cells, the enhancer was activated by inducible binding of two NFAT/AP- 1 complexes which disrupted two specifically positioned nucleosomes (N 1 and N 2). In myeloid cells, the enhancer was remodeled by GATA factors which constitutively displaced an upstream nucleosome (N 0) and cooperated with inducible AP- 1 elements to activate transcription. In mast cells, which express both GATA- 2 and NFAT, these two pathways combined to activate the enhancer and generate high-level gene expression. At least 5 kb of the GM-CSF locus was organized as an array of nucleosomes with fixed positions, but the enhancer adopted different nucleosome positions in T cells and mast cells. Furthermore, nucleosomes located between the enhancer and promoter were mobilized upon activation in an enhancer-dependent manner.

40|$|Cellular {{proteins}} that regulate apoptotic cell death can modulate {{the outcome of}} Sindbis virus (SV) encephalitis in mice. Both endogenous and overexpressed BCL- 2 and BAX proteins protect newborn mice from fatal SV infection by blocking apoptosis in infected neurons. To {{determine the effects of}} these cellular factors on the course of infection in older animals, a more neurovirulent SV vector (dsNSV) was constructed from a viral strain that causes both prominent spinal cord infection with hind-limb paralysis and death in weanling mice. This vector has allowed assessment of the effects of BCL- 2 and BAX on both mortality and paralysis in these hosts. Similar to newborn hosts, weanling mice infected with dsNSV encoding BCL- 2 or BAX survived better than animals infected with control viruses. This finding indicates that BCL- 2 and BAX both protect neurons that mediate host survival. Neither cellular factor, however, could suppress the development of hind-limb paralysis or prevent the degeneration of motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord. Infection of BAX knockout mice with dsNSV demonstrated that endogenous BAX also enhances the survival of animals but has no effect on paralysis. These findings for the spinal cord are consistent with earlier data showing that dying lumbar motor neurons do not exhibit an apoptotic morphology.

40|$|Allergic asthma, a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and leading cause of hospitalizations, is an inflammatory disease orchestrated by T helper cells and characterized by the lung migration of eosinophils, which are important asthma effector cells. Lung migration of inflammatory cells requires, among other events, the chemokine receptor transduction of lung-produced inflammatory chemokines. Despite the widespread prevalence of this disease, the molecular mechanisms regulating chemokine production and receptor regulation in asthma are poorly understood. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that β-arrestin− 2 positively regulates the development of allergic airway disease in a mouse model, partly through positive regulation of T-lymphocyte chemotaxis to the lung. However, β-arrestin− 2 is expressed in many cell types, including other hematopoietic cells and lung structural cells, which are involved in the development and manifestation of allergic airway disease. To determine the cell types required for β-arrestin– 2 –dependent allergic inflammation, we generated bone marrow chimera mice. Using the ovalbumin murine model of allergic airway disease, we show that eosinophilic and lymphocytic inflammation is restored in chimeric mice, with expression of β-arrestin− 2 exclusively on hematopoietic-derived cell types. In contrast, airway hyperresponsiveness is dependent on the expression of β-arrestin− 2 in structural cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of β-arrestin− 2 in at least two <b>divergent</b> <b>cell</b> types contributes to the pathogenesis of allergic airway disease...|$|E

In mast cells, which express both GATA- 2 and NFAT, these two pathways combined to activate the enhancer and generate high-level gene expression. At least 5 kb of the GM-CSF locus was organized as an array of nucleosomes with fixed positions, but the enhancer adopted different nucleosome positions in T cells and mast cells. Furthermore, nucleosomes located between the enhancer and promoter were mobilized upon activation in an enhancer-dependent manner. These studies reveal that distinct tissue-specific mechanisms can be used either alternately or in combination to activate the same enhancer. Andrew G. Bert, Brett V. Johnson, Euan W.

40|$|We analyze a solar {{active region}} {{observed}} by the Hinode CaII H line using the time-distance helioseismology technique, and infer wave-speed perturbation structures and flow fields beneath the active region {{with a high}} spatial resolution. The general subsurface wave-speed structure {{is similar to the}} previous results obtained from SOHO/MDI observations. The general subsurface flow structure is also similar, and the downward flows beneath the sunspot and the mass circulations around the sunspot are clearly resolved. Below the sunspot, some organized <b>divergent</b> flow <b>cells</b> are observed, and these structures may indicate the existence of mesoscale convective motions. Near the light bridge inside the sunspot, hotter plasma is found beneath, and flows divergent from this area are observed. The Hinode data also allow us to investigate potential uncertainties caused by the use of phase-speed filter for short travel distances. Comparing the measurements with and without the phase-speed filtering, we find out that inside the sunspot, mean acoustic travel times are in basic agreement, but the values are underestimated by a factor of 20 - 40 % inside the sunspot umbra for measurements with the filtering. The initial acoustic tomography results from Hinode show a great potential of using high-resolution observations for probing the internal structure and dynamics of sunspots.

40|$|The chromophobe renal cell {{carcinoma}} is a distinct type of renal cancer presumably derived from the intercalated cell of the collecting duct system and exhibiting a better prognosis than other types of renal {{cell carcinoma}}. Chromophobe carcinomas can be separated from other types of {{renal cell carcinoma}} by their characteristic cytomorphology, ultrastructural appearance, cytoskeletal architecture, and cytogenetic aberrations. As no permanent cell line of the chromophobe tumor type has previously been described, we {{are the first to}} report on the successful establishment and characterization of two <b>divergent</b> permanent <b>cell</b> lines, ie, chrompho-A and chrompho-B, derived from the same chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. With immunocytochemistry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and Western blot, chrompho-A and chrompho-B exclusively exhibited cytokeratins (Nos. 7, 8, 18, and 19) but not vimentin. Ultrastructural studies revealed numerous cytoplasmic microvesicles as well as coated vesicles that are known to be characteristic features of the intercalated cell. Chrompho-B cells exhibited a shorter mean population doubling time (tD = 43 hours) than chrompho-A cells (tD = 51 hours). Both cell lines failed to produce tumors in nude mice with the subrenal capsule assay. Cytogenetic analyses revealed hyperdiploid chromosome numbers in both cell lines with telomeric associations as well as numeric aberrations known from chromophobe renal cell carcinomas in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Protein-protein {{interactions}} define {{many important}} molecular and cellular processes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic biology. In trying to delineate the contact between two proteins, the yeast two-hybrid assay {{has emerged as}} a powerful technique. Complementing the yeast two-hybrid assay are in vitro techniques (e. g. GST-fusion-protein chromatography) that can also yield information on protein-protein associations. However, unambiguous functional significance to these interactions is best supported through a finding of colocalization of two proteins inside cells. In instances where two proteins interact in vitro but have <b>divergent</b> localizations within <b>cells</b> one needs to reconsider the biological importance of the former finding. Here, we present evidence for different subcellular locations of HTLV-I Tax and the Int- 6 protein. We suggest a reexploration of the functional significance between Tax and Int- 6 in cellular transformation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
