50|$|LNBs {{without a}} <b>feedhorn</b> {{built-in}} are usually {{provided with a}} (C120) flange around the input waveguide mouth which is bolted to a matching flange around {{the output of the}} <b>feedhorn</b> or polarizer unit.|$|E
5000|$|The Duo LNB is {{designed}} to be fitted with the <b>feedhorn</b> for Astra 23.5°E mounted on the dish's feedarm, and the 19.2°E <b>feedhorn</b> sticking out to the left - as viewed {{standing in front of the}} dish, with the satellites behind you. The Astra 23.5°E <b>feedhorn</b> is identified with a [...] "23.5" [...] marking on the casing. The dish is then aligned on the 23.5°E satellite position, using a signal strength meter, in the normal way.|$|E
5000|$|The 3-D {{functionality}} {{was possible}} {{through the use}} of a [...] "vertically stacked beam" [...] radiating <b>feedhorn</b> into the parabolic reflector. The received radar return was detected in a single or adjacent <b>feedhorn</b> which the radar receiver calculated a relative position in elevation.|$|E
40|$|Corrugated <b>feedhorns</b> radiate a near perfect Gaussian {{beam and}} are often used as feeds for {{receiver}} systems at millimetre and, increasingly, sub millimetre wavelengths. Perceived constructional difficulties of such feedhoms have tended to limit their use to frequencies below I THz. We demonstrate that corrugated <b>feedhorns</b> can be constructed that will allow operation at frequencies well in excess of 2. 5 TI-Iz and that the resulting antenna patterns are of excellent quality...|$|R
50|$|By {{setting the}} correct tilt angle and {{aligning}} the whole dish in azimuth and elevation, the two <b>feedhorns</b> of the LNB are optimally aligned for both orbital positions.|$|R

40|$|Proposed {{method of}} obtaining {{approximately}} desired radiation or reception pattern from antenna that includes reflector based on concept of superposition of electromagnetic fields generated by multiple <b>feedhorns</b> or feed antenna elements arrayed at various positions near reflector and excited at electronically adjustable magnitudes and phases. In intended application, reflector nominally paraboloidal, feed elements N <b>feedhorns</b> in hexagonal array, and method used to compensate for deviations of real reflector surface from nominal paraboloidal shape. Method and concept also applicable to electronic beam steering and electronic antenna compensation in other situations...|$|R
50|$|The Duo LNB is rotated in {{the feed}} clamp {{to a certain}} tilt angle to provide both the correct 'skew' angle for the <b>feedhorns</b> to align with the {{incoming}} signals, and the necessary height difference between the <b>feedhorns</b> to accommodate the different elevations of the two satellite positions. The correct skew angle and height difference depend on {{the position of the}} receive site on Earth's surface, and in most locations the tilt angle from the LNB is a compromise between their ideal settings. However, within Europe the single tilt angle adjustment provides sufficient accuracy for both settings for reliable reception.|$|R
50|$|In fact, {{it can be}} {{difficult}} to physically fit two separate LNBs onto a dish at the correct separation for Astra 23.5°E and Astra 19.2°E because their bulk may prevent the <b>feedhorns</b> sitting close enough together.|$|R
50|$|For the {{waveguide}} {{image that}} is shown, a horizontally polarized RF signal {{arrives at the}} two feed horns to produce a left/right delta signal. The arriving energy from the RF wavefront is launched into both waveguide feedhorns. The RF signal from both feedhorns travels up the waveguide where the signals from {{the left and right}} <b>feedhorn</b> are combined. The combiner performs a mathematical subtraction on the electrical signals arriving from the feedhorns. That subtraction produces the delta signal. A similar <b>feedhorn</b> configuration is used to produce the up/down delta signal (not shown). The waveguide assembly can be used by itself. For a high gain antenna, the <b>feedhorn</b> assembly is located facing the reflecting surface at or near the focal point.|$|E
50|$|The {{parabolic}} {{shape of}} a dish reflects the signal to the dish’s focal point. Mounted on brackets at the dish's focal point is a device called a <b>feedhorn.</b> This <b>feedhorn</b> is essentially the front-end of a waveguide that gathers the signals {{at or near the}} focal point and 'conducts' them to a low-noise block downconverter or LNB. The LNB converts the signals from electromagnetic or radio waves to electrical signals and shifts the signals from the downlinked C-band and/or Ku-band to the L-band range. Direct broadcast satellite dishes use an LNBF, which integrates the <b>feedhorn</b> with the LNB. (A new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna, which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the University of Waterloo in 2004.|$|E

40|$|Advanced ACTPol (AdvACT) is an {{upgraded}} {{camera for}} the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) that will measure {{the cosmic microwave}} background in temperature and polarization over a wide range of angular scales and five frequency bands from 28 - 230 GHz. AdvACT will employ four arrays of feedhorn-coupled, polarization- sensitive multichroic detectors. To accommodate the higher pixel packing densities necessary to achieve Ad- vACTs sensitivity goals, we have developed and optimized wideband spline-profiled <b>feedhorns</b> for the AdvACT multichroic arrays that maximize coupling efficiency while carefully controlling polarization systematics. We present the design, fabrication, and testing of wideband spline-profiled <b>feedhorns</b> for the multichroic arrays of AdvACT...|$|R
50|$|It is a {{monoblock}} LNB, which comprises two <b>feedhorns</b> with {{a single}} body of electronics containing the LNB stages along with switching circuitry to select which received signal is passed to the output(s). The Duo LNB uses linear polarisation.|$|R
50|$|A {{monoblock}} (or monobloc) LNB is {{a single}} unit comprising two LNBs and a DiSEqC switch, designed to receive signals from two satellites spaced close together and to feed the selected signal to the receiver. The <b>feedhorns</b> of the two LNBs are at a fixed distance apart for reception of satellites of a particular orbital separation (often 6°). Although the same functionality can be achieved with separate LNBs and a switch, a monoblock LNB, constructed in one unit, is more convenient to install and enables the two <b>feedhorns</b> to be closer together than individually cased LNBs (typically 60mm diameter). The distance between the <b>feedhorns</b> depends on the orbital separation of the satellites to be received, the diameter and focal length of the dish used, and {{the position of the}} reception site relative to the satellites. So monoblock LNBs are usually a compromise solution designed to operate with standard dishes in a particular region. For example, in parts of Europe, monoblocks designed to receive the Hot Bird and Astra 19.2°E satellites are popular because they enable reception of both satellites on a single dish without requiring an expensive, slow and noisy motorised dish. A similar advantage is provided by the duo LNB for simultaneous reception of signals from both the Astra 23.5°E and Astra 19.2°E positions.|$|R
50|$|The <b>feedhorn</b> also selects the {{polarization}} {{of the waves}} to be received, which helps to attenuate unwanted signals from adjacent channels and transponders, and from other communications satellites at nearby orbital positions. This can be either horizontal or vertical if {{the polarization}} is linear, or clockwise or counterclockwise (also called left- and right-handed) if it is circular. Certain devices can also allow a <b>feedhorn</b> to accept both linear and circular, though these cause a slight insertion loss to all incoming signals.|$|E
5000|$|The Astra type LNBF that {{includes}} a <b>feedhorn</b> and polarizer {{is the most common}} variety, and this is fitted to a dish using a bracket that clamps a collar around the waveguide neck of the LNB between the <b>feedhorn</b> and the electronics package. The diameter of the LNB neck and collar is usually 40mm although other sizes are also produced. In the UK, the [...] "minidish" [...] sold for use with Sky Digital and Freesat uses an LNBF with an integrated clip-in mount.|$|E

5000|$|The {{required}} {{separation of}} the monoblock's <b>feedhorns</b> depends on the angular {{separation of the}} satellites to be received, {{the position of the}} receive site on the Earth's surface and the focal length of the dish. Fortunately, monoblock LNBs can be standardised for sites across Europe provided that a [...] "standard" [...] offset dish with a focal length/diameter (f/D) ratio of 0.6 is used.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the launch}} of the first DTH {{broadcast}} satellite in Europe (Astra 1A) by SES in 1988, antenna design was simplified for the anticipated mass-market. In particular, the <b>feedhorn</b> (which gathers the signal and directs it to the LNB) and the polarizer (which selects between differently polarized signals) were combined with the LNB itself into a single unit, called an LNB-feed or LNB-feedhorn (LNBF), or even an [...] "Astra type" [...] LNB. The prevalence of these combined units has meant that today the term LNB is commonly used to refer to all antenna units that provide the block-downconversion function, with or without a <b>feedhorn.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{monoblock}} LNB {{provides a}} convenient alternative to fixing and aligning two LNBs to a dish independently. The two <b>feedhorns</b> are positioned at the correct spacing for reception {{from the two}} satellites required and the DiSEqC switching system is used to select between the signals from the two satellites with commands from the connected receiver. In other respects, the monoblock LNB acts as a normal LNB to the connected receiver.|$|R

The maximum instantaneous bandwidth in either band was 128 MHz per IF, {{limited by the}} correlator, although the <b>feedhorns</b> and dual linear Ortho Mode Transducers (OMTs) themselves were capable of receiving the full 550 MHz and 300 MHz, respectively.

25|$|The telescope's primary {{reflecting}} mirrors are {{a pair of}} Gregorian 1.4m × 1.6m dishes (facing opposite directions), {{that focus}} the signal onto a pair of 0.9m × 1.0m secondary reflecting mirrors. They are shaped for optimal performance: a carbon fibre shell upon a Korex core, thinly-coated with aluminium and silicon oxide. The secondary reflectors transmit the signals to the corrugated <b>feedhorns</b> that sit on a focal plane array box beneath the primary reflectors.|$|R

50|$|Note {{that with}} large dishes, {{it would be}} {{possible}} for the <b>feedhorn</b> to be damaged, which is prevented by the parabolic dishes being done in a flat (non-glossy) finish that does not focus light or heat effectively. Non-parabolic dishes cannot focus in this manner.|$|E

The current modules are concentrated toward the center to minimize grating lobes. This configuration allows it to support the very-long-range target discrimination and tracking that GMD's midcourse segment requires.

40|$|We {{describe}} 280 GHz bolometric detector arrays that instrument the balloon-borne polarimeter spider. A primary science goal of spider is {{to measure}} the large-scale B-mode polarization of {{the cosmic microwave background}} (cmb) in search of the cosmic-inflation, gravitational-wave signature. 280 GHz channels aid this science goal by constraining the level of B-mode contamination from galactic dust emission. We present the focal plane unit design, which consists of a 16 x 16 array of conical, corrugated <b>feedhorns</b> coupled to a monolithic detector array fabricated on a 150 mm diameter silicon wafer. Detector arrays are capable of polarimetric sensing via waveguide probe-coupling to a multiplexed array of transition-edge-sensor (TES) bolometers. The spider receiver has three focal plane units at 280 GHz, which in total contains 765 spatial pixels and 1, 530 polarization sensitive bolometers. By fabrication and measurement of single <b>feedhorns,</b> we demonstrate 14. 7 ° FHWM Gaussian-shaped beams with < 1 % ellipticity in a 30 % fractional bandwidth centered at 280 GHz. We present electromagnetic simulations of the detection circuit, which show 94 % band-averaged, single-polarization coupling efficiency, 3 % reflection and 3 % radiative loss. Lastly, we demonstrate a low thermal conductance bolometer, which is well-described by a simple TES model and exhibits an electrical noise equivalent power (NEP) = 2. 6 x 10 ^(- 17) W/√Hz, consistent with the phonon noise prediction...|$|R
