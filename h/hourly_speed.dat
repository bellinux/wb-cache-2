40|$|Several {{scholars}} have defined {{the urgent need}} for more research to identify the precise relationship between speed and crash involvement more fully. In this paper, we present the first results of an exploratory study carried out in the Brabant Southeast police region in the Netherlands. <b>Hourly</b> <b>speed</b> measurement data over a period of two years were collected from loop detectors on the municipal and provincial road network and were related to crashes. Different aspects of traffic intensity, speed and their impact on crashes were studied, including absolute speed, speed variation and the proportion of excessive speeders, both for vehicles under and over 5. 2 meters long. The study also discusses a number of methodological aspects associated with this kind of analysis. The results show that although absolute speed plays a more important role on roads where speed limits are low, it is the variation in speed that correlates more with crashes when speed limits are higher. Given the limited study area, the results of this work cannot be generalized without risk. However, they offer interesting insights that deserve further investigation in a nationwide cross-sectional study. Brijs, Wets, Krimpenfort, Offermans 1 1...|$|E

In this study, a simple method to generate <b>hourly</b> wind <b>speed</b> data from daily wind statistics (daily average and maximum wind speeds together or daily average wind speed only) was established. A typical windy location with 3285 days (9 years) measured <b>hourly</b> wind <b>speed</b> data were used to validate the downscaling method.

40|$|Running Stabilized Emissions from vehicle {{exhausts}} {{are estimated}} by combining travel activity quantified as vehicle miles of travel (VMT) or vehicle hours of travel (VHT) with emissions factors which are adjusted for speeds on facility links. These speeds {{which are used}} for adjusting emissions factors are averaged for fixed periods (typically for one hour intervals) and across the lanes of multi-lane links. In real world traffic conditions, however, average speeds are variable for higher time resolutions and across lanes. Incorporating the variability in average speeds during calculation will result in different magnitudes of estimated running stabilized emissions for a given {{period of time and}} a facility link. Lane volume and occupancy measurements from 1376 single loop detector stations on 830 freeway links in Los Angeles were used to estimate flow rates, <b>hourly</b> average link <b>speeds,</b> 15 -minute average link <b>speeds</b> and <b>hourly</b> average lane <b>speeds.</b> Then, these flow rates and average speeds were used to estimate hourly link CO, CO 2, NOx, PMx and TOG emissions and hourly gridded emissions based on different average speed resolutions for the summer of 1997. This study statistically examines the hourly differences in running stabilized emissions when 15 -minute link and <b>hourly</b> lane average <b>speeds</b> are used in contrast to <b>hourly</b> link average <b>speeds</b> for running stabilized emissions estimation. Moreover, effects of speed variability on regional air quality are evaluated by examining the differences in estimated gridded ozone (O 3) and fine particulate matter (PM 25) concentrations based on different gridded emissions inventories (estimated using hourly link, 15 -minute link and <b>hourly</b> lane average <b>speeds).</b> The results show that the magnitudes of estimated hourly link running stabilized emissions are different especially when <b>hourly</b> lane average <b>speeds</b> are used in contrast to the <b>hourly</b> link average <b>speeds.</b> Estimated O 3 and PM 25 concentrations also differ, however, the differences in these estimated secondary pollutant concentrations show different patterns when compared to the differences in estimated emissions...|$|R

In general, both species emerged from the substratum during dusk and remained on the substratum until dawn or just before dawn when they buried again.

40|$|Many {{studies suggest}} that migratory birds are {{expected}} to travel more quickly during spring, when they are {{en route to the}} breeding grounds, in order to ensure a high-quality territory. Using data recorded by means of Global Positioning System satellite tags, we analysed at three temporal scales (hourly, daily and overall journey) seasonal differences in migratory performance of the booted eagle (Aquila pennata), a soaring raptor migrating between Europe and tropical Africa, taking into account environmental conditions such as wind, thermal uplift and day length. Unexpectedly, booted eagles showed higher travel rates (<b>hourly</b> <b>speed,</b> daily distance, overall migration speed and overall straightness) during autumn, even controlling for abiotic factors, probably thanks to higher hourly speeds, more straight routes and less non-travelling days during autumn. Tailwinds were the main environmental factor affecting daily distance. During spring, booted eagles migrated more quickly when flying over the Sahara desert. Our results raise new questions about which ecological and behavioural reasons promote such unexpected faster speeds in autumn and not during spring and how events occurring in very different regions can affect migratory performance, interacting with landscape characteristics, weather conditions and flight behaviour.

40|$|Several past {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to quantify the impact of winter weather conditions on highway mobility in terms of traffic volume, speed, and capacity. While consistent in their general findings, these studies have shown considerably different results in terms of effect size and contributing factors. More importantly, most of these studies have not attempted to model the effects of winter maintenance operations on mobility or isolate these effects from those due to snowstorm characteristics, rendering their results and the proposed methods of limited use for estimating the benefits of maintenance activities. This research attempts to address this gap through a statistical analysis of a data set that is unique in terms of spatial and temporal coverage and data completeness. The data set includes both event based and hourly observations of road weather and surface conditions, maintenance operations, traffic volume and speed, {{as well as several}} other measures, from 21 highway sections across the province of Ontario. Event based information is available for six winter seasons (2000 to 2006) at 19 of the sites. For this event based data a matched pair technique was employed to determine the changes in traffic volumes and speeds under matched conditions with and without snow events. A regression analysis was subsequently performed to relate the changes in traffic volume and speed over an event to changes in various contributing factors such as highway type, snow event characteristics and road surface conditions. A case study was conducted to illustrate the application of the developed models for quantifying the mobility impact of road surface condition and the mobility benefit of winter maintenance operations. Complete hourly records were available for all 21 sites for three winter seasons. This was used to perform the evaluation on an hourly basis. A matching technique is employed to assign hour-by-hour median speeds observed under typical weather and road surface conditions to each hour of a snowstorm event. A regression analysis is subsequently performed to relate changes from average <b>hourly</b> <b>speed</b> to various contributing factors such as highway type, weather conditions and maintenance operations. Effects of maintenance operations are represented by an intermediate variable called road surface condition index (RSI). A case study is conducted to illustrate the application of the developed models for quantifying the mobility impact of winter snowstorms and the mobility benefit of maintenance operations. The models developed in these analyses confirmed the relationships between weather variables and traffic volume and speed described in the literature. In addition a strong association between road surface condition and traffic volumes and speed was identified...|$|E
40|$|Given that soaring birds travel faster with {{supportive}} winds or in good {{thermal soaring}} conditions, we expect weather conditions en route of migration to explain commonly observed regional and seasonal {{patterns in the}} performance of soaring migrants. We used GPS-loggers to track 13 honey buzzards and four Montagu's harriers for two to six migrations each. We determined how tailwinds, crosswinds, boundary layer height (a proxy for thermal convection) and precipitation affected <b>hourly</b> <b>speeds,</b> daily distances and daily mean speeds with linear regression models. Honey buzzards mostly travel by soaring while Montagu's harriers supplement soaring with flapping. Therefore, we expect that performance of harriers will be less affected by weather than for buzzards. Weather conditions explained between 30 and 50 % of variation in migration performance of both species. Tailwind had the largest effect on <b>hourly</b> <b>speeds,</b> daily mean speeds and daily travel distances. Honey buzzards travelled significantly faster and farther, and Montagu's harriers non-significantly faster, under better convective conditions. Honey buzzards travelled at slower speeds and shorter distances in crosswinds, whereas harriers maintained high speeds in crosswinds. Weather conditions varied between regions and seasons, and this variation accounted for nearly all regional and seasonal variation in flight performance. Hourly performance was higher than predicted at times when we suspect birds had switched to intermittent or continuous flapping flight, for example during sea-crossings. The daily travel distance of Montagu's harriers was determined to a significant extent by their daily travel time, which differed between regions, possibly also due to weather conditions. We conclude with the implications of our work for studies on migration phenology and we suggest an important role for high-resolution telemetry in understanding migratory behavior across entire migratory journeys...|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} {{satellite tracking}} data {{to reveal the}} daily travel schedules of Hobbies Falco subbuteo migrating between northern Europe and southern Africa. By comparing movements during short-time intervals of 1 - 8 h {{at different times of}} the day between the three different regions Europe, Sahara Desert and tropical Africa, we found significant higher <b>hourly</b> <b>speeds</b> in the Sahara compared to the other two regions. The migration started {{early in the morning and}} continued throughout the day, resulting in daily travel time exceeding that of typical thermal soaring migrants. Due to fast <b>hourly</b> <b>speeds</b> in combination with the long travel days during Sahara crossings, the Hobbies exceeded daily travel distances recorded for soaring migrants. In Europe and tropical Africa, the speed was highly variable during the day, and lower flight speeds, especially during afternoons, suggest a fly-and-forage strategy, Our predictions about regular occurrence of nocturnal flight especially across geographical barriers as the desert were not fulfilled. In the Sahara, the Hobbies restricted their movement to diurnal migration. Nevertheless, 10 % of the flight segments in tropical Africa were partly or completely during night hours and Hobbies often started their daily flight before or at sunrise. We attribute the special characteristics of the daily travel schedules of Hobbies primarily to their use of a fly-and-forage strategy, possibly in combination with preparedness for exploiting thermals during the daily thermal time window. Further studies are needed to understand why Hobbies do not increase daily travelling hours to include regular nocturnal flight in the Sahara Desert. We suggest that the daily travel schedules of the Hobby, which were distinctly different from those of other diurnal migrants like large raptors (which mainly exploit thermal soaring migration) or pipits, wagtails, finches and pigeons (which mainly travel during the morning hours) may be typical for bird species that primarily use a fly-and-forage migration strategy...|$|R

More precisely, the neural network is trained to produce the lower and upper bounds of the prediction intervals of wind speed. The objectives driving {{the search for the}} optimal values of the neural network weights are the coverage of the prediction intervals (to be maximized) and the width (to be minimized). A real application is shown with reference to <b>hourly</b> wind <b>speed,</b> temperature, relative humidity and pressure data in the region of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Correlation analysis shows that the wind speed has weak dependence on the above mentioned meteorological parameters; hence, only <b>hourly</b> historical wind <b>speed</b> is used as input to a neural network model trained to provide in output the one-hour-ahead prediction of wind speed.

The effect of using wind data of different temporal resolutions in RWEQ discrete and continuous versions was assessed. Wind erosion was measured during 82 high-wind events occurring between 2005 and 2008. Simulated and measured erosion values were compared. For wind erosion simulation during discrete periods, the model was loaded with wind speeds averaged in 5 minutes and 1 hour- intervals. For continuous simulation, a weather file for RWEQ/ 97 was developed and Weibull factors were calculated using both hourly and daily wind speeds. When the discrete version of RWEQ was used with <b>hourly</b> wind <b>speeds</b> instead of five-minute averages, the total simulated soil loss was reduced by 44 %. The model efficiency was not significantly affected by wind speed data resolution. RWEQ continuous version, loaded with monthly Weibull parameters using <b>hourly</b> wind <b>speeds,</b> calculated zero erosion. Monthly Weibull distribution scale factors calculated using daily wind speeds were reduced by 32 % on average with respect to hourly data. Increasing the Weibull scale parameter by up to 50 % slightly improved the monthly simulated erosion rates. Using low resolution wind speed data reduces the model outputs.
