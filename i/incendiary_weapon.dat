Byzantine use of incendiary mixtures was also used in pressurized nozzles or siphōns to project the liquid onto the enemy.|$|E

The arrows {{were most likely}} an <b>incendiary</b> <b>weapon,</b> but its function may also have resembled that of an early rocket. At the Jin siege of Qizhou (...) in 1221, the Jurchens fought the Song with gunpowder bombs and arrows. The Jin tiehuopao ( [...] , [...] "iron huopao"), which had cast iron casings, are the first known bombs that could explode. The bomb needed {{to be capable of}} detonating in order to penetrate the iron casing. The Song army had a large supply of incendiary bombs, but there are no reports of them having a weapon similar to the Jin's detonating bombs. A participant in the siege recounted in the Xinsi Qi Qi Lu (辛巳泣蘄錄) that the Song army at Qizhou had an arsenal of 3000 huopao (...) , 7000 incendiary gunpowder arrows for crossbows and 10000 for bows, as well as 20000 pidapao (...) , probably leather bags filled with gunpowder.|$|E
500|$|Malina recounted that Parsons was {{inspired}} to use asphalt by the ancient <b>incendiary</b> <b>weapon</b> Greek fire; in a 1982 talk for the International Association of Astronomical Artists Captain Boushey stated that Parsons experienced an epiphany after watching workers using molten asphalt to fix tiles onto a roof. Known as GALCIT-53, this fuel proved to be significantly more stable than the Group's earlier concoctions, fulfilling Parsons' aim of creating a restricted-burn rocket fuel inside a castable container, and providing a thrust 427% more powerful than that of GALCIT-27. This set a precedent which according to his biographer John Carter [...] "changed the future of rocket technology": the thermoplastic asphalt casting was durable in all climates, allowing for mass production and indefinite storage and transforming solid-fuel agents into a safe and viable form of rocket propulsion. Plasticized variants of Parsons' solid-fuel design invented by JPL's Charles Bartley were later used by NASA in Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters and by the Strategic Air Command in Polaris, Poseidon and Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles.|$|E
