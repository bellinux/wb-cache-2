25|$|The {{missing link}} was the {{demonstration}} that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is actually contained in synaptic vesicles. About ten years later, {{the application of}} subcellular fractionation techniques to brain tissue permitted the isolation first of nerve endings (synaptosomes), and subsequently of synaptic vesicles from mammalian brain. Two competing laboratories were involved in this work, that of Victor P. Whittaker at the Institute of Animal Physiology, Agricultural Research Council, Babraham, Cambridge, UK and that of Eduardo de Robertis at the Instituto de Anatomía General y Embriología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Whittaker's work demonstrating acetylcholine in vesicle fractions from <b>guinea-pig</b> brain {{was first published in}} abstract form in 1960 and then in more detail in 1963 and 1964, and the paper of the de Robertis group demonstrating an enrichment of bound acetylcholine in synaptic vesicle fractions from rat brain appeared in 1963. Both groups released synaptic vesicles from isolated synaptosomes by osmotic shock. The content of acetylcholine in a vesicle was originally estimated to be 1000–2000 molecules. Subsequent work identified the vesicular localization of other neurotransmitters, such as amino acids, catecholamines, serotonin, and ATP. Later, synaptic vesicles could also be isolated from other tissues such as the superior cervical ganglion, or the octopus brain. The isolation of highly purified fractions of cholinergic synaptic vesicles from the ray Torpedo electric organ was an important step forward in the study of vesicle biochemistry and function.|$|E
500|$|The first {{observations}} of intracellular structures that probably represented mitochondria {{were published in}} the 1840s. Richard Altmann, in 1890, established them as cell organelles and called them [...] "bioblasts". The term [...] "mitochondria" [...] was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. Leonor Michaelis discovered that Janus green {{can be used as a}} supravital stain for mitochondria in 1900. In 1904, Friedrich Meves, made the first recorded observation of mitochondria in plants in cells of the white waterlily, Nymphaea alba and in 1908, along with Claudius Regaud, suggested that they contain proteins and lipids. Benjamin F. Kingsbury, in 1912, first related them with cell respiration, but almost exclusively based on morphological observations. In 1913, particles from extracts of <b>guinea-pig</b> liver were linked to respiration by Otto Heinrich Warburg, which he called [...] "grana". Warburg and Heinrich Otto Wieland, who had also postulated a similar particle mechanism, disagreed on the chemical nature of the respiration. It was not until 1925, when David Keilin discovered cytochromes, that the respiratory chain was described.|$|E

On the other hand, when <b>guinea-pigs</b> are immunized with either 1 -ε-DNP-tetra-L-lysine or 1 -ε-DNP-nona-L-lysine without the use of mycobacterial adjuvant, anti-DNP antibody is produced only by <b>guinea-pigs</b> receiving the nona-L-lysine and only by those animals possessing the PLL gene...|$|R
2500|$|... ″Our modern {{knowledge}} of the biosynthetic pathway for the catecholamines begins in 1939, {{with the publication of}} a paper by Peter Holtz and his colleagues: they described the presence in the <b>guinea-pig</b> kidneys of an enzyme that they called dopa decarboxylase, because it catalysed the formation of dopamine and carbon dioxide from the amino acid L-dopa.″ The German-British biochemist Hermann Blaschko (1900–1993), who in 1933 had left Germany because he was Jewish, wrote this in 1987 in Oxford, looking back on “a half-century of research on catecholamine biosynthesis”. The paper by Peter Holtz (1902–1970) and his coworkers originated from the Institute of Pharmacology in Rostock. Already in that same year 1939 both Blaschko, then in Cambridge, and Holtz in Rostock predicted the entire sequence tyrosine → l-DOPA → oxytyramine = dopamine → noradrenaline → adrenaline. Edith Bülbring, who also had fled National Socialist racism in 1933, demonstrated methylation of noradrenaline to adrenaline in adrenal tissue in Oxford in 1949, and Julius Axelrod detected phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in Bethesda, Maryland in 1962. The two remaining enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase, were also characterized around 1960.|$|E

40|$|Short-term {{toxicity}} {{studies have been}} carried out in rats and <b>guinea-pigs</b> fed diets containing triphenyltin acetate (TPTA), triphenyltin hydroxide (TPTH) or triethyltin hydroxide (TETH) for 90 days at levels ranging from 0 to 50 ppm. The lowest dietary levels found to retard growth in rats and <b>guinea-pigs</b> respectively are as follows: 5 and 10 ppm for TETH; 25 and 5 ppm for TPTA; 50 and 20 ppm for TPTH. An increase in mortality was found in the following groups: rats on 10 ppm or more of TETH; <b>guinea-pigs</b> on 20 and 50 ppm TPTA and on 50 ppm TPTH. In rats and <b>guinea-pigs</b> given TETH, paralysis and pronation of the hindlegs developed. These toxic signs were not found in the TPTA- and TPTH-treated animals. This observation was correlated with the finding that only the TETH-treated animals developed interstitial oedema of the central nervous system. The water content of the brain and spinal cord was increased in rats and <b>guinea-pigs</b> at respective minimum levels of 5 and 10 ppm of TETH and in <b>guinea-pigs</b> on 20 ppm TPTA. In female rats given 50 ppm TPTA or TPTH the water content of the spinal cord was only increased. The changes in organ weights which could be related to the administration of the organotin compounds were confined to an increase of brain weight in rats and <b>guinea-pigs</b> given TETH, and in <b>guinea-pigs</b> given 5 ppm or more of TPTA and a decrease of thymus and/or spleen weights in rats and <b>guinea-pigs</b> receiving TETH. <b>Guinea-pigs</b> given 5 – 20 ppm TPTA or 2 · 5 – 20 ppm TPTH displayed lymphopenia accompanied in a number of animals by histological changes in the lymphopoietic system, viz. atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen was found. This possibly induced a decrease of general resistance, so that a mycotic infection developed in the animals. Hitherto, damage to the central nervous system was considered to be the most sensitive criterion for assessing the toxicity of organotin compounds, but the present work shows that the effect on lymphopoiesis is a more sensitive index of toxic action for triphenyltin compounds...|$|R

Inhibition of the CS-enhanced cough response by XEN-D 0501 further implicated a role for TRPV 1.
