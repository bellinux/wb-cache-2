5|$|The silver Tetradrachm of Augustus from Antioch. Depicting Ancient Rome’s celebrated first emperor, who reigned from 27 B.C. to A.D. 14, this coin was hand {{struck in}} the great provincial city of Antioch – honored on the reverse. These coins of Biblical times were hand struck close {{to the time when}} Jesus was {{believed}} to have been born. And they were among the most prominent coins used to pay the hated temple tax, about which Jesus speaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> accounts of Matthew, Mark and Luke. Weighing about 15 grams and containing over 75% silver, these large attractive pieces are similar to the coinage circulated by Seleucid emperors in Syria before being conquered by Rome in 64 B.C.|$|E

25|$|Theoria {{enabled the}} Fathers to {{perceive}} depths of meaning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> writings that escape a purely scientific or empirical approach to interpretation.

25|$|Matthias Henze {{suggests}} that Nebuchadnezzar's madness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> Book of Daniel {{draws on the}} Epic of Gilgamesh. He claims that the author uses elements from the description of Enkidu to paint a sarcastic and mocking portrait of the king of Babylon.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> account, Joshua {{assigned}} Asher {{western and}} coastal Galilee, a region with comparatively low temperature, and much rainfall, making it {{some of the}} most fertile land in Canaan, with rich pasture, wooded hills, and orchards; as such Asher was particularly prosperous, and known for its olive oil.|$|E

25|$|In Christian theology, Hell is {{the place}} or state into which by God's {{definitive}} judgment unrepentant sinners pass either immediately after death (particular judgment) or in the general judgment. Its character is inferred from teaching <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> texts, some of which, interpreted literally, {{have given rise to}} the popular idea of hell.|$|E
50|$|Moses the alchemist {{is often}} conflated with <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> Moses. <b>The</b> opening passage {{of his work}} is an altered version of the Book of Exodus 31: 2-5. <b>In</b> antiquity, <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> Moses was {{believed}} to be the founder of the arts and sciences including philosophy and medicine.

25|$|While it is {{possible}} that the Trisagion has origins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> 'thrice holy' of Isaiah 6:3 (the Sanctus: Holy, holy, holy, Lord of Sabaoth. Heaven and earth are full of your glory', etc.), they are today separate prayers. The latter is used at a different point in the Liturgy (in the Divine Liturgy, during the anaphora).|$|E
25|$|The Israelites {{cultivated}} both {{wheat and}} barley.

25|$|Scholars {{who accept}} the {{principle}} of coregencies note that abundant evidence for their use is found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> material itself.

50|$|Exagōgē is a five-act drama {{written in}} iambic trimeter, retelling of <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> story of <b>The</b> Exodus from Egypt. Moses {{is the main}} {{character}} of the play, and parts of <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> story have been altered to suit the narrative's needs. These changes probably point to Ezekiel's intention to stage the play, since certain scenes that are impossible to stage were converted into monologue. This drama is unique <b>in</b> blending <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> story with <b>the</b> Hellenistic tragic drama.|$|R
50|$|In 1943 {{church leaders}} {{established}} {{a committee to}} give defenses to critics of the church, including offshoot groups. This was named the Defense Literature Committee in 1952, and reorganized as <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> Study and Research Group in 1956. <b>In</b> 1969 <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> Research Committee was formed from a merger between the Defense Literature Committee and <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> Study and Research Committee, which had previously worked independently. This committee did not have authority to represent the church on theological matters.|$|R

25|$|The {{first modern}} period of {{immigration}} {{to receive a}} number in common speech was the Third Aliya, which in the World WarI period {{was referred to as}} the successor to the First and Second Aliyot from Babylonia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> period.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> account, {{following}} {{the completion of}} the conquest of Canaan by the Israelite Joshua allocated the land among the twelve tribes. Kenneth Kitchen, a well-known conservative biblical scholar, dates this event to slightly after 1200 BCE. However, the consensus view of modern scholars is that the conquest of Joshua as described in the Book of Joshua never occurred.|$|E
25|$|Dates were eaten {{fresh or}} dried, but were used mostly boiled into thick, {{long-lasting}} syrup called “date honey” (dvash temarim) {{for use as}} a sweetener. This syrup was prepared by soaking the dates in water for some time until they disintegrated and then boiling the resulting liquid down into thick syrup. The honey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Biblical</b> reference of “a land flowing with milk and honey” is date honey.|$|E

50|$|Numerous scholars, {{whether they}} agree or {{disagree}} with the book's basic premise of gender equality, consider All We're Meant to Be to have been a major catalyst <b>in</b> launching <b>the</b> <b>biblical</b> feminist movement.

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> three <b>biblical</b> texts {{there are}} {{numerous}} complex noun phrases with very involved case relations. It is unknown whether this is characteristic of speaker usage or an invention of the missionary Bridges.|$|R
