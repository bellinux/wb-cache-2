40|$|Kinematical, {{electromechanical}} energy accumulator is {{a facility}} that converts supplied electrical energy to the kinetic one, stored in the rotating inertial system. Electric driving motors can operate both as a propulsion units, providing torque to the rotor shaft, and as generators {{in the course of}} braking. The prototype is designed to operate in a vacuum; the energy accumulator is located in a sealed pressurized vessel connected to the apparatus, which can generate vacuum pressure down to 1 Pa. The accumulator is destined for storage energy of 7. 2 MJ at a speed of up to 20, 000 1 / min. The energy accumulator is equipped with inert weight in the form of metal disc, connected to a composite band. In the course of operation, the rotor assembly is suspended in non-contact manner in housing assembly while the main body is fastened to the inner ring of the pressure vessel. The rotor consists of a shaft on which are mounted: a metal disc together with a band made of carbon fibre, inset into inert weight using epoxy resin; four disc rotors of two electric motors; two disks which are magnetic armature for electromagnetic bearings operating along the shaft axis; bushings of both <b>sleeve</b> bearings; <b>fixing</b> <b>sleeves,</b> washers and lock nuts to fix particular elements on the shaft. During normal operation the rotor is positioned in the radial direction through two electromagnetic bearings, top and bottom, located at both ends of shaft and operating in the differential arrangement, and in the axial direction- by a system of two eight-pol...|$|R

The core is <b>fixed</b> to the <b>sleeve</b> at two attachment sites so that cells seeded within the core produce mechanical {{tension between the}} attachment sites. This tension aligns the cells and the fibres of the core and provides an improved substrate for tissue regeneration. Growth guides may be surgically implanted into an individual. ...|$|R

5000|$|The girls go to Cassidy's {{house to}} get ready for the Spring dance. Megan makes Jess and herself a dress. Jess's mother sends them beauty {{products}} that the cast of her TV show use. They all come downstairs in their outfits. Cassidy is wearing her sister's old white dress decorated with rosebuds. Megan's dress an ice blue sheath and Jess's is a frothy pink dress. Emma is wearing a long yellow dress which used to be Nicole Patterson's. She becomes upset since her dress is too formal for the dance. Megan improvises by <b>fixing</b> the <b>sleeves</b> and changing the length. This makes Emma happy again and everyone compliments Megan's talent at designing. At the dance, Zach Norton calls Jess [...] "Beauty" [...] (because of the play) and asks her to dance. This makes Emma jealous and she runs out of the gym, crying. Megan and Cassidy cheer her up and Jess tells Emma that she doesn't like Zach, but admits that she's liked Emma's brother Darcy ever since kindergarten. Cassidy tells Emma that Zach only likes Jess as a friend and that he is comfortable around her which is why he asked her to dance. They all go back to the gym. Cassidy dances with Zach, Jess with Ethan, Megan with Darcy, and Emma with Third.The girls don't end up with the partner they each hoped for, but have a good time anyway.|$|R

The threaded spindle {{is connected to}} a transport component (2) connectable to a bone segment separated from one fracture end and arranged between two bone parts. The transport component is movable along the longitudinal axis in the sleeve (1) by rotation of the rotatable socket (9). The fixture of the bone segment separated from one fracture end is by a bone screw (E) fitted in a longitudinal guide in the sleeve. The threaded spindle and a threaded socket (3) accommodated and <b>fixed</b> in the <b>sleeve</b> have different threads and are exchangeable. A tooth component (5) which has interengaging teeth (4 a, 4 b) engages on both sides on the sleeve and on a driver (6).

40|$|We {{focus on}} the central spindle which {{supports}} the rotating magnetic platters which hold all of the data. The spindle must operate with great precision and stability at high rotational speeds. Design practice has converged on oil-lubricated hydrodynamic journal bearings as the most common choice for spindles. That is, a layer of viscous oil separates a rotating shaft (the bearing) from the <b>fixed</b> outer <b>sleeve</b> (the journal). In hard drives, {{it is very important}} for the shaft to be centered within the sleeve. Plain journal bearings (i. e. both surfaces are circular cylinders) are unstable to perturbations that push the shaft off-center. It was found that this stability problem can be overcome by cutting diagonal grooves into the journal in a pattern called a herring-bone. Another consequence of this design is that very high pressures are generated by the grooves as they drive the oil {{to the middle of the}} bearing, away from the top/bottom ends of the spindle. This pumping action generally works to oppose leakage out of the bearing. We examine how choices for the groove pattern can influence the key properties of the bearing. The focus is to understand the effect of the groove geometry on the pumping action. In particular the undesirable behavior caused by the low pressures created near the top/bottom ends of the bearing which, under many conditions, may result in the pressure becoming negative, relative to atmospheric pressure. Negative pressure can result in cavitation or, when it occurs near an air-oil interface, can cause air to be ingested and hence create bubbles. Any bubbles in the oil can corrupt the lubricating layer in the bearing and, as they are created and collapse, can cause significant undesirable vibrations. The negative pressures have therefore been identified as one of the key problems in design of hard disk drive bearings. We will use numerical computations and some analysis to show that by modifying the groove geometry we can reduce the negative pressure while retaining good stability characteristics...|$|R
