However, their widespread use is limited due to cost issues and relative design inflexibility. A novel low-cost <b>intelligent</b> <b>power</b> <b>module</b> (IPM) series has been developed for appliance applications, which addresses these factors. Characteristics of the new <b>intelligent</b> <b>power</b> <b>module</b> enable lower overall power losses compared to current competing technology.

40|$|AbstractThe {{accuracy}} of the servo system {{is dependent on the}} speed or band width of the closed loop control system. To achieve the high speed closed loop operation, hardware oriented control is preferred and it is achieved by means of an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Chip). The servo system is used to drive a two axis robotic arm moving in a plane where two PMSM motor with servo control provides the required motion. Robotic applications require quick and accurate changes in driving torque so that the required motion behaviour is attained. Quick change in operating flux is required for fast and accurate servo control. Conventional scalar control drives cannot achieve quick response time and hence vector control is employed. The IRMCK 201 ASIC used in the application has the Vector Control algorithm hard wired into it for complete servo control of a single PMSM. It takes the position and current feed back by using shaft encoder, hall sensor and IR 2175 Current sensing IC. It can set up communication with a host controller through either high speed serial, SPI or Parallel protocols. The inverter unit is implemented using an <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Module</b> (IPM) and it is driven by the Space Vector Modulation signals from IRMCK 201.

40|$|The goal of {{the master}} thesis is to design, {{dimension}} and construct a power boost system for the drive trains in electric vehicles, utilizing supercapacitor technology. In order to build the system a supercapacitor bank and a converter has been constructed. The system {{has been designed to}} be used in the new Think electric vehicle, and each part of the converter has been dimensioned according to information provided by Think Technology. The master thesis is limited to the design and construction of the power boost system, and the implementation, interfacing and control of power sharing have not been dealt with. The supercapacitor bank and the converter are built based on analytical computations and simulations. The supercapacitor bank can store up to 100 Wh and is built from 90 series connected cells rated 1500 F each. The bidirectional DC 9 ̆ 6 DC converter is based on a standard <b>intelligent</b> <b>power</b> <b>module</b> with three legs in a bridge configuration and three inductors. An interleaved switching sequence is selected for the operation of the legs and each IGBT is capable of switching 150 A at 600 V. The thermal management of this module is solved with the use of a heat sink with fans for forced air flow. The inductors are made from amorphous alloys and copper foil, achieving an inductance of 0. 25 mH and a maximum current rating of 100 A. Voltage smoothing capacitors and measuring devices have also been implemented in the converter design. The results presented are held to be accurate, all though measurements gathered are affected to a certain degree by noise in the system.

Further work based on this master thesis should include more extensive testing on the system, and perform an optimization of the supercapacitor bank and the inductors.

40|$|In many {{industrial}} plants materials {{have to be}} transported between several processing stations, {{where they have to}} be processed {{with a high level of}} accuracy and precision. In the last years, linear electrical drives, especially the long-stator linear motors are used for these types of applications for both processing and transportation tasks. They have higher dynamics and processing precision and lower maintenance costs compared to conventional systems, which require additional mechanical gears. The linear drive system must be modular and highly scalable in order to cover a wide range of applications. For this reason, the track of the plant is made of several stator segments. The excitation part of the motor is represented by permanent magnets (passive vehicles). Each stator segment has a dedicated inverter (Power Processing Unit) and processor (Information Processing Unit). Cheap IPMs (<b>Intelligent</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Modules)</b> are nowadays a good solution for implementing the inverter. A DSP was used as processor. The DSP and the IPM are the main components of the designed servo-controller, which together with a stator segment represents a module of the system. The DSP controls the inverter and is also used for the communication with the DSPs of the adjacent modules. By connecting the ground potential of all servo-controllers to the negative DC-link rail (ca. - 280 V), a significant reduction in the implementation costs of the servo-controller was achieved. When a vehicle crosses from one stator segment to the adjacent one, the control tasks migrate physically in that respective adjacent DSP. Data exchange is therefore required within each cycle of the current control loop (100 µs) between the adjacent modules. For an arbitrary scalable modular system, there will be also an arbitrary high communication demand. This demand can only be solved by a direct (Point-to-Point) connection between the adjacent DSPs. This connection was realised by means of the cost-effective RS 485 data transmission protocol. A central control unit is responsible then for the cyclical (1 - 10 ms) generation of new position reference values for the vehicles, according to a predefined schedule. The monitoring (assessment of internal variables of the distributed servo-controllers) of the entire system is realised also in real-time. Off-line download and upload actions of firmware or general data is also possible. For these tasks, the communication between the central unit (PC) and the distributed servocontrollers was realised by means of the Ethernet-based fieldbus EtherCAT. Inside the processing stations of the system, the positioning accuracy and precision as well as the dynamic have to be very good. For this reason, inside those stations, position sensors must be used. Outside those stations, for material transportation only, an EMF-based sensorless control was implemented. This will further reduce the overall system costs. A small section of such modular and highly scalable system was realised as an experimental set-up in the context of this work, in order to test the functionality and the reliability of the proposed system...|$|R
