5|$|Using fossil evidence, {{there are}} three main {{theories}} for the origin of modern amphibians. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> evolved from lepospondyls, most likely the lysorophians. A third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolved from dissorophoids.|$|E

5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological {{and physiological}} changes. An advantage of inducible, as opposed to constitutive defenses, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are only produced when needed, and are therefore potentially less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E
5|$|Interesting, perhaps, {{in the use}} {{of weapons}} in these recent “revolutionary” works <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are, {{generally}} speaking, not reenactments of traditional folk dances.

5|$|One {{proposed}} {{explanation for}} the existence of count-classifiers <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. An alternative account <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than an abstract function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation, or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient. In this way, count-classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.|$|E

Another <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not receive their share of plunder. Yet another <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> inadequately supplied with the necessities they needed to properly function. The soldiers were also unhappy about their long periods of inactivity, and wanted either to be sent into battle or back to Rome. <b>They</b> also felt <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not received proper credit for their part in the campaign to expel the Carthaginians from Hispania. A major issue too <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had <b>been</b> in service far beyond the term normally required of Roman soldiers.|$|R

5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may {{have shown that the}} necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|E
5|$|A popular {{hypothesis}} {{about the}} origins of the lemuriform clade <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> evolved from European adapiforms known as adapids. In some adapids, the crests of the lower incisors and canines align to form functional cropping unit, and the American paleontologist Philip D. Gingerich has suggested this foreshadowed the development of the lemuriform toothcomb. However, no lemuriform toothcomb has been found in the fossil record of the Eocene, and the European adapid lower jaws from that time did not resemble the derived state seen in lemuriforms.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} concept <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> formed {{closer to}} the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after {{the removal of the}} gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current most widely accepted explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.|$|E

5|$|An {{indication}} of the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{appear to have been}} preferentially recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies. In the auxilia palatina infantry regiments, the proportion of barbarians in the ranks appears to have numbered anywhere between a third and a half of effectives (compared to a quarter in the army as a whole). From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E
