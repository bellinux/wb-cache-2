40|$|The current {{phenomenon}} {{indicates that}} {{the use of the term}} of art experienced a shift in meaning, which is arbitrary. Art is only seen as an expression of free expression, without care about the meaning contained in the work of art. However, it is not evident among Moslem artists in expressing their work in figurative calligraphy painting. Although in Islam, painting especially in paint the creature living (figure) got a bad response, but the Moslem artists were able to present works that are not only beautiful but also the messages. The research questions in this thesis are: (1). what is the ethical moral message of figurative calligraphy painting? (2). what is the ethical and aesthetical message of figurative calligraphy painting? (3). is there a relationship between ethical and aesthetical messages in figurative calligraphy painting? And the aims of this research are to knowing and understanding about: (1). the ethical moral messages from figurative calligraphy painting. (2). the aesthetic messages from figurative calligraphy painting. (3). proving the existence of the relationship between ethics and aesthetics messages in figurative calligraphy painting. In this research used the kind of library research with the analysis technic of ethic and aesthetic interpretative qualitative that is using the symbolic interaction approach. The result of this research is: (1). the artist displayed the works always hold on the Islamic ethic. Their works is good and the important thing is the message of the painting will be received, because its works contained the goodness, it was caused in accordance with the ethics of painting based on the principles of Islamic art and Shari’at of Islam (Al-Qur’an and Hadith (2). the ethical messages are: Posts contain praying illustrated in the form of ‘abid in praying. It contains the meaning that <b>human</b> <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> creature and always does wrong. Therefore, humans need forgiveness from Allah. Posts of ‘Ali Ibn Abi Thalib was illustrated in the form of lion. It describes and contains the meaning of braveness and heroism of Ali in defense of Allah religion. The post of “basmalah” in the form of ‘anqa’ bird has the message about rahmān and Rahīm of Allah. And the other post of “basmalah” in the form of tughra has the meaning about a wise. Pieces verses of Qur’an about Prophet Suleiman as., in the form of guava fruit that has the meaning the best gift is following Islamic religion. Shahadat was illustrated in the form of ‘abid in tahiyat. It contains the expression meaning of totally submission to Allah SWT. The aesthetical message in every figurative calligraphy painting is a manifestation of the beauty that exists in the universe. That message is one of the manifestations of the One who is Most Beautiful, Allah SWT. And that is manifestation of reflection al-Jalāl wa al-Jamāl Allāh (3). The relation between ethical and aesthetical message in figurative calligraphy painting can be seen in figurative expression in calligraphy painting, which is incorporated in the dimensions of tawḥid. Figurative calligraphy painting is described the Majesty, Power and Oneness of Allah SWT., the art was created is the manifestation of tawḥid...|$|E

50|$|Gameplay {{revolves}} around harvesting needed materials to build, defend oneself against enemies, and ultimately achieving {{one of the}} game's endings. Depending on the character chosen, {{the game is played}} differently. Most characters begin with a weak attack, and no weaponry, yielding them quite vulnerable to the various enemies. The Alien begins with a powerful attack and evolves more abilities over time, though it cannot use weapons, so an Alien player tends to be more aggressive, taking advantage of the more difficult endings which would take longer for other characters to achieve. In contrast, the <b>Human</b> <b>is</b> <b>weaker,</b> and a <b>Human</b> player will take time to build up a heavy arsenal of weaponry and armor before attempting action.|$|R

40|$|Background: Prefrontal {{behavior}} and activity in <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> heritable. Studies in animals demonstrate {{an interaction between}} dopamine D 2 receptors and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on prefrontal behavior but evidence in <b>humans</b> <b>is</b> <b>weak.</b> Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic variation regulating dopamine D 2 and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling impact prefrontal cortex activity and related cognition. To test this hypothesis in humans, we explored the interaction between functional genetic variants in the D 2 receptor gene (DRD 2, rs 1076560) and in the nicotinic receptor a 5 gene (CHRNA 5, rs 16969968) on both dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mediated {{behavior and}} physiology during working memory and on prefrontal gray matter volume. Methods: A large sample of healthy subjects was compared for genotypic differences for DRD 2 rs 1076560 (G. T) and CHNRA 5 rs 16969968 (G. A) on prefrontal phenotypes, including cognitive performance at the N-Back task, prefrontal physiology with BOLD fMRI during performance of the 2 -Back working memory task, and prefrontal morphometry with structural MRI. Results: We found that DRD 2 rs 1076560 and CHNRA 5 rs 16969968 interact to modulate cognitive function, prefrontal physiology during working memory, and prefrontal gray matter volume. More specifically, CHRNA 5 -AA/DRD 2 -GT subjects had greater behavioral performance, more efficient prefrontal cortex activity at 2 Back working memory task, and greate...|$|R

In a large, interdisciplinary study of the eastern Bering Sea ecosystem involving disciplines from physical oceanography to anthropology, one of the research teams examined commercial fisheries and another looked at subsistence harvests by Alaska Natives. Commercial fisheries and subsistence harvests are extensive, demonstrating strong connections between the ecosystem and the humans who use it. At the same time, however, both research teams concluded that the influence of ecosystem conditions on the outcomes of <b>human</b> activities <b>was</b> <b>weaker</b> than anticipated. Likely explanations of this apparently loose coupling include the ability of fishers and hunters to adjust to variable conditions, and the role of social systems and management in moderating the direct effects of changes in the ecosystem.

In this study, we show that during LCMV infection, CD 27 signaling on CD 4 + T cells enhances the secretion of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These inflammatory cytokines lead to the destruction of splenic architecture and immunodeficiency with reduced and delayed virus-specific nAb responses. Consequently, infection with the otherwise persistent LCMV strain Docile was eliminated after CD 27 signaling was blocked. Our data provide a novel mechanism by which LCMV avoids nAb responses and suggest that blocking the CD 27 -CD 70 interaction may be an attractive strategy to prevent chronic viral infection...|$|R

The pathogenic mechanisms involved in these lesions are not understood. Homogenates of Actinomyces viscosus (AVIS) induce an acute inflammatory response with a predominance of PMNs within 6 h after injection into the footpads of nonimmunized mice. These homogenates, when tested in vitro, contain potent chemotactic activity for human PMNs. In vitro chemotactic activity for <b>human</b> monocytes <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> but statistically significant (P less than 0. 025). Doses of AVIS, which alone have little chemotactic activity, cause the generation of PMN chemotactic activity in fresh, but not complement-inactivated, serum. The injection of AVIS into the footpads of immunized mice induces an acute inflammatory response followed within 48 h by a mononuclear cell infiltrate, suggesting that factors affecting monocyte accumulation are generated by the immune host in response to challenge with the bacterial antigens. These findings indicate that the pathogenicity of the Actinomyces may result in part from (i) their direct chemotactic effect on PMNs, (ii) their cytotaxigenic effects on serum, and (iii) their ability to stimulate host immune cells to produce and release mediators of inflammation...|$|R
