40|$|Infiltration of leukocytes into {{tissue is}} a common feature of many {{physiological}} and pathological conditions. Histopathologically, the diversity of leukocytes that infiltrate a tissue associated with a pathophysiologic response cannot be appreciated and/or examined unless highly selective <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection</b> methods are utilized. Specific populations of infiltrating leukocytes into squamous tissues harboring pre-malignant and/or malignant keratinocytes have recently been demonstrated to play a functionally {{significant role in the}} pathogenesis of squamous carcinomas. To evaluate immune cell types and quantify changes in their relative presence and localization during multi-stage neoplastic progression, we performed flow cytometry and histochemical detection using lineage-selective markers. Herein, we provide detailed methodology facilitating these analyses...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a direct screening immunoblot assay {{for the detection}} of Shiga-like toxin (SLT) -producing organisms in stool samples. The assay takes advantage of the phage-mediated nature of SLT production in Escherichia coli and the phage-inducing effects of mitomycin. The addition of mitomycin significantly enhanced the amount of toxin available for <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection.</b> By using the mitomycin-enhanced immunoblot assay, SLT-producing E. coli could be distinguished from non-toxin-producing E. coli and normal stool flora in ratios of 1 : 1, 000 to 1 : 5, 000. The immunoblot assay was examined in a field setting and compared with direct DNA probing for SLT-I and SLT-II. The assay was able to detect SLT-producing E. coli {{with a high level of}} sensitivity and specificity. Specificity was markedly improved by using a monoclonal antibody which cross-reacts with both SLT-I and SLT-II B subunits in place of the polyclonal antitoxin sera. We conclude that the mitomycin-enhanced immunoblot colony assay is a rapid and reliable alternative to DNA probing {{for the detection of}} phage-mediated SLT-producing organisms in stool samples, especially when the production and use of nucleic acid probes are not feasible. In addition, it permits isolation of positive colonies for further study and confirmation...|$|E
40|$|Major basic protein (MBP) {{released}} from activated eosinophils may influence airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) by either direct effects on airway myocytes or by an indirect effect. In this study, human bronchi, freshly isolated human eosinophils, or MBP purified from human eosinophil granules were incubated for studying eosinophil infiltration and MBP localization. Eosinophils immediately adhered to intact human airway {{as well as}} to cultured human airway myocytes and epithelium. Following incubation 18 – 24 h, eosinophils migrated into the airway media, including the smooth muscle layer, but had no specific recruitment to airway neurons. Eosinophils released significant amounts of MBP within the airway media, including areas comprising the smooth muscle layer. Most deposits of MBP were focally discrete and restricted by <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection</b> to a maximum volume of ∼ 300 [*]μm 3 about the eosinophil. Native MBP applied exogenously was immediately deposited {{on the surface of the}} airway, but required at least 1 [*]h to become detected within the media of the airway wall. Tissue MBP infiltration and deposition increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that eosinophil-derived cationic proteins may alter airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in vivo by an effect that is not limited to the bronchial epithelium...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis is a {{specific}} granulomatous infectious disease and {{a major cause of}} death in developing countries. Primary gingival tuberculosis is extremely rare and forgotten entity. Oral lesions usually appear as secondary to primary tuberculosis infection elsewhere. The lesion may take the form of nodules, ulcers, or elevated fissures. We report a case of primary tuberculosis of gingiva, manifesting as gingival enlargement with ulceration and discharge. Diagnosis was based on histopathologic examination, complete blood count, chest X-ray, and <b>immunologic</b> investigations with <b>detection</b> of antibodies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. With the recent increase in the incidence of tuberculosis, this case report also emphasizes the need for clinicians to be aware of this possibility, consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of gingival enlargement, and thus, {{play a role in the}} early detection of this disease...|$|R
40|$|Background aims. Diabetes type I is an {{autoimmune}} disease {{characterized by the}} destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing (beta-) cells and resulting in external insulin dependence for life. Islet transplantation represents a potential treatment for diabetes but there is currently a shortage of suitable organs donors. To augment the supply of donors, different strategies are required to provide a potential source of beta-cells. These sources include embryonic and adult stem cells as well as differentiated cell types. The main goal {{of this study was}} to induce the transdifferentiation (or conversion of one type cell to another) of human hepatoma cells (HepG 2 cells) to insulin-expressing cells based on the exposure of HepG 2 cells to an extract of rat insulinoma cells (R 1 N). Methods. HepG 2 cells were first transiently permeabilized with Streptolysin O and then exposed to a cell extract obtained from RIN cells. Following transient exposure to the RIN extract, the HepG 2 cells were cultured for 3 weeks. Results. Acquisition of the insulin-producing cell phenotype was determined on the basis of (i) morphologic and (ii) ultrastructural observations, (iii) <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection</b> and (iv) reverse transcription (RT) -polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Conclusions. This study supports the use of cell extract as a feasible method for achieve transdifferentiation of hepatic cells to insulin-producing cells...|$|E
40|$|A {{panel of}} 11 human cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR) antibodies {{were tested in}} ovine nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial brushings. Two of these, G 449 (polyclonal) and MATG 1104 (monoclonal), recognized hCFTR but did not cross react with endogenous sheep CFTR. This specificity allows <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection</b> of hCFTR expressed in gene transfer studies in sheep {{against the background of}} endogenous ovine CFTR, thus enhancing the value of the sheep as a model animal in which to study CFTR gene transfer. Studies on mixed populations of human and sheep nasal epithelial cells showed that detection of hCFTR by these two antibodies was possible even at the lowest proportion of human cells (1 : 100). The hCFTR gene was delivered in vivo by local instillation using polyethylenimine-mediated gene transfer to the ventral surface of the ovine trachea and hCFTR mRNA and protein levels scored in a blinded fashion. Despite abundant hCFTR mRNA expression, the number of cells expressing hCFTR protein detectable by G 449 was low (� 0. 006 – 0. 05 %). Immunohistochemistry for hCFTR in animals treated by whole-lung aerosol demonstrated positive cells in sections of tracheal epithelium and in distal conducting airways. The strategic use of hCFTR-specific antibodies supports the utility of the normal sheep as a model for hCFTR gene transfer studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In V. cholerae, the biogenesis of capsule {{polysaccharide}} {{is poorly}} understood. The elucidation of capsule structure and biogenesis {{is critical to}} understanding the evolution of surface polysaccharide and the internal relationship between the capsule and LPS in this species. V. cholerae serogroup O 31 NRT 36 S, a human pathogen that produces a heat-stable enterotoxin (NAG-ST), is encapsulated. Here, we report the covalent structure and studies of the biogenesis of the capsule in V. cholerae NRT 36 S. Results The structure of the capsular (CPS) polysaccharide was determined by high resolution NMR spectroscopy and {{shown to be a}} complex structure with four residues in the repeating subunit. The gene cluster of capsule biogenesis was identified by transposon mutagenesis combined with whole genome sequencing data (GenBank accession DQ 915177). The capsule gene cluster shared the same genetic locus as that of the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biogenesis gene cluster. Other than V. cholerae O 139, this is the first V. cholerae CPS for which a structure has been fully elucidated and the genetic locus responsible for biosynthesis identified. Conclusion The co-location of CPS and LPS biosynthesis genes was unexpected, and would provide a mechanism for simultaneous emergence of new O and K antigens in a single strain. This, in turn, may be a key element for V. cholerae to evolve new strains that can escape <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection</b> by host populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|For novel {{insights}} into the pathogenicity of Candida albicans, studies on molecular interactions of central virulence factors are crucial. Since methods {{for the analysis of}} direct molecular interactions of proteins in vivo are scarce, we expanded the genetic code of C. albicans with the synthetic photo-cross-linking amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF). Interacting molecules in close proximity of this unnatural amino acid can be covalently linked by UV-induced photo-cross-link, which makes unknown interacting molecules available for downstream identification. Therefore, we applied an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and a suppressor tRNA pair (EcTyrtRNACUA) derived from Escherichia coli, which was previously reported to be orthogonal in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We further optimized the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for AzF (AzF-RS) and EcTyrtRNACUA for C. albicans and identified one AzF-RS with highest charging efficiency. Accordingly, incorporation of AzF into selected model proteins such as Tsa 1 p or Tup 1 p could be considerably enhanced. <b>Immunologic</b> <b>detection</b> of C-terminally tagged Tsa 1 p and Tup 1 p upon UV irradiation in a strain background containing suppressor tRNA and optimized AzF-RS revealed not only the mutant monomeric forms of these proteins but also higher-molecularweight complexes, strictly depending on the specific position of incorporated AzF and UV excitation. By Western blotting and tandem mass spectrometry, we could identify these higher-molecular-weight complexes as homodimers consisting of one mutant monomer and a differently tagged, wild-type version of Tsa 1 p or Tup 1 p, respectively, demonstrating that expanding the genetic code of C. albicans with the unnatural photo-cross-linker amino acid AzF and applying it for in vivo binary protein interaction analyses is feasible...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveIntervertebral disc (IVD) {{degeneration}} {{is associated}} with a malfunction of the nucleus pulposus (NP). Alginate culturing provides a favorable microenvironment for the phenotypic maintenance of chondrocyte-like NP cells. However, NP cells are recently evidenced to present heterogeneous populations, including progenitors, fibroblastic cells and primitive NP cells. The aim {{of this study is to}} profile the phenotypic changes of distinct human NP cells populations and describe the dynamic expression of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs) in extended alginate encapsulation. MethodNon-degenerated (ND-NPC) and degenerated (D-NPC) NP cells were expanded in monolayers, and subject to 28 -day culture in alginate after serial passaging. CS-GAG compositional expression in monolayer-/alginate-cultured NP cells was evaluated by carbohydrate electrophoresis. Cellular phenotypic changes were assessed by <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection</b> and gene expression analysis. ResultsRelative to D-NPC, ND-NPC displayed remarkably higher expression levels of chondroitin- 4 -sulfate GAGs over the 28 -day culture. Compared with monolayer culture, ND-NPC showed increased NP marker expression of KRT 18, KRT 19, and CDH 2, as well as chondrocyte markers SOX 9 and MIA in alginate culture. In contrast, expression of fibroblastic marker COL 1 A 1, COL 3 A 1, and FN 1 were reduced. Interestingly, ND-NPC showed a loss of Tie 2 + but gain in KRT 19 +/CD 24 + population during alginate culture. In contrast, D-NPC showed more consistent expression levels of NP surface markers during culture. ConclusionWe demonstrate for the first time that extended alginate culture selectively enriches the committed NP cells and favors chondroitin- 4 -sulfate proteoglycan production. These findings suggest its validity as a model to investigate IVD cell function...|$|E
40|$|Kaposi's sarcoma {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) is {{a typical}} DNA virus {{that is associated with}} a number of proliferative diseases including Kaposi's sarcoma. the KSHV open reading frame (ORF) 4 encodes a complement regulatory protein (Kaposi complement control protein, KCP) that binds complement components and inhibits the complement-mediated lysis of cells infected by the virus, thus providing a strategy for evasion of the host complement system. Based on primary sequence analysis and comparison with other functionally and structurally similar proteins, oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) three regions of the predicted ORF 4 from human herpes virus- 8 (HHV- 8) DNA isolated from a primary effusion lymphoma cell line. the PCR products were inserted by ligation into the expression vector pPIC 9 to generate three recombinant plasmids for heterologous expression in the yeast, Pichia pastoris, to produce separately the four N-terminal sushi domains (KCP-S, small), KCP protein lacking the putative transmembrane-binding domain (KCP-M, medium), and the full-length protein (KCP-F, full). Expression of the viral proteins was confirmed by SDSPAGE, <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection,</b> and Western blot analyses using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a selected peptide region that is common to all three recombinant KCPs. KCP-S directly from expression media could inhibit complement-mediated lysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes by approximately 60 % in a hemolysis assay. This result confirms previous reports that recombinant KCP is twice as efficient in inhibiting the classic pathway-mediated lysis of erythrocytes than is the vaccinia virus complement control protein, which also contains four sushi domains.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveInfrapatellar fat pad of {{patients}} with osteoarthritis (OA) contains multipotent and highly clonogenic adipose-derived stem cells that can be isolated by low invasive methods. Moreover, nuclear and cytoplasmic cellular extracts have been showed {{to be effective in}} induction of cell differentiation and reprogramming. The aim {{of this study was to}} induce chondrogenic differentiation of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from infrapatellar fat pad (IFPSCs) {{of patients}} with OA using cellular extracts-based transdifferentiation method. DesignIFPSCs and chondrocytes were isolated and characterized by flow cytometry. IFPSCs were permeabilized with Streptolysin O and then exposed to a cell extract obtained from chondrocytes. Then, IFPSCs were cultured for 2  weeks and chondrogenesis was evaluated by morphologic and ultrastructural observations, <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection,</b> gene expression analysis and growth on 3 -D poly (dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds. ResultsAfter isolation, both chondrocytes and IFPSCs displayed similar expression of MSCs surface makers. Collagen II was highly expressed in chondrocytes and showed a basal expression in IFPSCs. Cells exposed to chondrocyte extracts acquired a characteristic morphological and ultrastructural chondrocyte phenotype that was confirmed by the increased proteoglycan formation and enhanced collagen II immunostaining. Moreover, chondrocyte extracts induced an increase in mRNA expression of chondrogenic genes such as Sox 9, L-Sox 5, Sox 6 and Col 2 a 1. Interestingly, chondrocytes, IFPSCs and transdifferentiated IFPSCs were able to grow, expand and produce extracellular matrix (ECM) on 3 D PLGA scaffolds. ConclusionsWe demonstrate for the first time that extracts obtained from chondrocytes of osteoarthritic knees promote chondrogenic differentiation of autologous IFPSCs. Moreover, combination of transdifferentiated IFPSCs with biodegradable PLGA 3 D scaffolds can serve as an efficient system for the maintenance and maturation of cartilage tissue. These findings suggest its usefulness to repair articular surface in OA...|$|E
40|$|Foodborne {{illnesses}} pose {{a significant}} health concern and economic impact worldwide. In this study, we aimed at developing alternate and improved methods for Shiga toxigenic E. coli (STEC) and Listeria species detection. In Listeria monocytogenes, an auxiliary secretory system, SecA 2, {{plays an important}} role in translocating virulence and housekeeping proteins to cell surface to aid bacteria to maintain saprophytic and intracellular life styles. Here we investigated if pyruvate kinase (PyK), present in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic Listeria, is translocated by SecA 2 system and determined its potential application in <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection</b> of these bacteria. Additionally, cell surface localization and enzymatic activity of PyK were examined. Enzyme immunoassay with anti-PyK antibody, MAb EM- 7 H 10, indicated the presence of PyK in all Listeria species except L. roquortiae. Immunofluorescence assay confirmed surface localization. Analysis of L. monocytogenes ΔsecA 2 mutant revealed the absence of PyK in cell wall and the supernatant fractions along with reduced levels in the intracellular fraction indicating that PyK translocation to cell surface is SecA 2 -dependent. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed reduced levels of PyK transcript in the ΔsecA 2 mutant indicating SecA 2 -dependent regulation of pyk. Furthermore, PyK expression was found to be 10 -fold higher in L. monocytogenes cultured in Brain-Heart Infusion Broth (BHI), Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and buffered Listeria enrichment broth (BLEB) than in University of Vermont medium (UVM) or Fraser Broth (FB). In summary, PyK is determined to be a SecA 2 -dependent surface displayed glycolytic enzyme present in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic Listeria, which could serve as a strong immunologic target for Listeria species detection. Shiga toxigenic E. coli (STEC) has been implicated in several foodborne outbreaks exhibiting severe hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and fatalities. Here, we focus on a novel approach for STEC detection. Translocated Intimin Receptor (TIR) binds exclusively with intimin, a STEC adhesion protein which mediates intimate attachment of the bacteria to the host cell. This receptor-ligand system is unique to STEC and can be used for its detection on biosensor platforms. Collectively, data provide strong evidence for the use of anti-PyK antibody and TIR and for specific detection of Listeria species and STEC, respectively. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to examine}} the role of the Nalp 3 -inflammasome in pneumococcal pneumonia. Different methods including the in vivo model of the pneumococcal pneumonia and the ex vivo model of the isolated perfused and ventilated mouse lung (IPML) were used to approach this aim. The results of this study showed that a deficiency in Nalp 3 -receptor causes an increase in mortality in early phase of pneumonia at 72 hours after infection with pneumococci. Furthermore the experiments that followed demonstrated an increased capillary leak in Nalp 3 -deficient mice in pneumonia. This damage of the epi- and endothelial barrier of the lung is possibly {{one of the reasons for}} the increased mortality. Moreover a higher pulmonary level of bacteria was detected in Nalp 3 -deficient mice compared to wildtyp mice, pointing at a less efficient defence towards pneumococci. However Nalp 3 -deficiency did not reduce the inflammatory immune cell response. Furthermore an activation of Nalp 3 by the exotoxin of pneumococci, Pneumolysin, was demonstrated. In the IPML the lungs of Nalp 3 -deficient mice showed an enhanced capillary leak compared to wildtyp mice after intratracheal application of Pneumolysin. In addition the intravascular application of caspase- 1 -inhibitor in the IPML in wildtyp mice reduced the capillary leak after intratracheal application of Pneumolysin significantly. From further experiments the findings demonstrated that the capability to cause capillary leak after intratracheal application of Pneumolysin does not depend on TLR 4. Additional experiments found evidence that the polymorphism of Pneumolysin affects the detection and reaction of the immunesystem towards pneumococci. Accordingly after infection with non-haemolytic Pneumolysin producing serotyp 1 pneumococci mice showed neither signs of systemic infection nor were any bacteria detected in the lungs. Moreover non-haemolytic Pneumolysin did not cause any capillary leak in the IPML after intratracheal application. This dissertation could find evidence for the essential role of the Nalp 3 -receptor in the <b>immunologic</b> <b>detection</b> of haemolytic Pneumolysin-producing Streptococcus pneumoniae. Furthermore there were clear signs that the detection of Streptococcus pneumonia with non-haemolytic Pneumolysin by the immune system is less efficient, so that a different answer of the Nalp 3 -inflammasome to a certain Pneumolysin version contributes to the diverging virulence of the different serotypes of pneumococci. Future studies are necessary to find more evidence for this hypothesis. The results of this dissertation could contribute to new germ-adapted pharmacological therapies to lower lethality of pneumococci pneumonia in the post-antibiotic-era...|$|E
