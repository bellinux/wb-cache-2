5|$|Canada was {{transferred}} to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917–18, she was fitted with better rangefinders and range dials, and two of the aft 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> were added atop the superfiring turrets fore and aft. Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|Hannover {{was brought}} back to active service in the Reichsmarine, the post-war Germany navy. She served with the fleet for ten years, from 1921 to 1931, before she was again decommissioned. The navy planned to convert the ship into a {{radio-controlled}} target ship <b>for</b> <b>aircraft,</b> but this was never carried out. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap between 1944 and 1946 in Bremerhaven. Her bell is preserved at the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Hannover {{was struck}} from the navy list in 1936 and {{destined for the}} scrapyard. There were ideas to rebuild her as a target ship {{especially}} <b>for</b> <b>aircraft,</b> although this never occurred. Schlesien was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936. The following year, Schlesien toured South America, including a stop in Argentina in December. By 1939, both ships had been replaced in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.|$|E

The system also allows interoperability towards the maritime radio. The network also allows for transmission of data at a speed of 12-13 kbit/s.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Gift was the {{donation}} of aircraft from British surplus stocks after the First World War to the Dominions: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Empire of India. On 29 May 1919, the British Cabinet {{agreed to give}} 100 aircraft {{to each of these}} countries plus replacements <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> donated by these countries to Britain during the war. These aircraft formed the core of newly established air forces in several of the countries.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} the Admiralty Islands to the Allies was enormous. Their capture saved more lives than they cost by obviating the need to capture Truk, Kavieng, Rabaul, and Hansa Bay and thereby {{speeding}} up the Allied advance by several months. As an airbase, the Admiralties' value was great, <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> based there ranged over Truk, Wewak, and beyond. As a naval base, their value was greater still, as they combined a fleet anchorage with major facilities.|$|E
5|$|To reduce {{rolling and}} {{increase}} stability <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> operations, a gyrostabilizer {{produced by the}} American Sperry Gyroscope Company was installed. The installation initially proved unreliable as the Japanese technicians were badly trained by Sperry, but eventually the system proved its worth as the technicians gained experience.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{apart from}} member dues, Civil Air Patrol {{receives}} funding from donations and grants from individuals, foundations and corporations; from grants and payments from state governments for patrolling and other tasks {{as agreed by}} memorandums of understanding; and from federal funding for reimbursement of fuel, oil and maintenance plus capital expenses <b>for</b> <b>aircraft,</b> vehicles and communications equipment.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is also {{a hazard}} <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> making steep turns near the ground. It is a {{particular}} problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident.|$|E
5|$|A.V. Roe Canada Limited {{had been}} set up as a {{subsidiary}} of the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1945, initially handling repair and maintenance work <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> at Malton, Ontario Airport, today known as Toronto Pearson International Airport. The next year the company began the design of Canada's first jet fighter for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Avro CF-100 Canuck all-weather interceptor. The Canuck underwent a lengthy and troubled prototype stage before entering service seven years later in 1953. Nevertheless, it went on {{to become one of the}} most enduring aircraft of its class, serving in a variety of roles until 1981.|$|E
40|$|General {{aviation}} rapidly becomes blossom {{with the}} growing economy. However, the complex flying environment and the flexibility <b>for</b> general <b>aircrafts</b> cause more difficulty to ensure the flying safety and efficiency. Hence {{it is vital to}} plan path <b>for</b> <b>aircrafts</b> to keep them away from threat and reduce fuel consumption. In this paper, we propose a path planning method based on an improved Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to generate ideal paths <b>for</b> <b>aircraft(s)</b> in a 2 -D space to avoid conflict, prohibited flying zones and risk areas. In our method, the adaptive adjustment strategy for crossover and mutation is introduced to accelerate the computation speed and improve the solutions quality. Empirical studies under different scenarios with multiple aircrafts demonstrate that our algorithm can improve solution quality effectively and efficiently...|$|R
