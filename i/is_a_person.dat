5|$|In {{the game}} of baseball, the {{official}} scorer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices.

This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.|$|E

5|$|Link {{locates the}} Triforce on Skyloft and {{uses it to}} destroy Demise. With Demise dead, Zelda is freed, but Ghirahim arrives and kidnaps Zelda: though Demise is dead in the present, Ghirahim intends to use Zelda as a {{sacrifice}} to resurrect him in the past. Link pursues Ghirahim into the past and fights through his army. He then defeats Ghirahim, who {{turns out to be}} the spirit of Demise's sword, but is unable to prevent Zelda's soul from being used to reincarnate Demise's humanoid form. Groose guards Zelda's body while Link challenges Demise to single combat: Link triumphs, absorbing Demise's essence into the sword, but not before Demise curses Link and Zelda's descendants to be haunted by his reincarnated rage. To complete the sword's seal, Link drives it into a pedestal in the Sealed Temple, with Fi accepting eternal slumber as a result. Groose, Link and the revived Zelda return to their time while Impa remains behind and destroys the Time Gate, as she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> of that time period and must watch over the Master Sword. In the present, the old woman greets them one last time before she dies and vanishes, revealing that she was Impa. The game ends with Zelda deciding to remain on the Surface to watch over the Triforce: she and Link together establish the kingdom of Hyrule.|$|E
