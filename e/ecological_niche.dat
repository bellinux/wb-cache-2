40|$|Constrained {{ordination}} methods aims {{at finding}} an environmental gradient along which the species abundances are maximally separated. The species response functions, which describe the expected abundance {{as a function}} of the environmental score, are according to the <b>ecological</b> fundamental <b>niche</b> theory only meaningful if they are bell-shaped. Many classical model-based ordination methods, however, use quadratic regression models without imposing the bell-shape and thus allowing for meaningless U-shaped response functions. The analysis output (e. g. a biplot) may therefore be potentially misleading and the conclusions are prone to errors. In this paper we present a log-likelihood ratio criterion with a penalisation term to enforce more bell-shaped response shapes. We report the results of a simulation study and apply our method to metagenomics data from microbial ecology...|$|R

A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, <b>ecological</b> <b>niche</b> and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{debate between}} niche-based and neutral {{community}} theories {{centers around the}} question of which forces shape predominantly <b>ecological</b> communities. <b>Niche</b> theory attributes a central role to niche differences between species, which generate {{a difference between the}} strength of intra- and interspecific interactions. Neutral theory attributes a central role to migration processes and demographic stochasticity. One possibility to bridge these two theories is to combine them in a common mathematical framework. Here we propose a mathematical model that integrates the two perspectives. From a niche-based perspective, our model can be interpreted as a Lotka-Volterra model with symmetric interactions in which we introduce immigration and demographic stochasticity. From a neutral perspective, it can be interpreted as Hubbell's local community model in which we introduce a difference between intra- and interspecific interactions. We investigate the stationary species abundance distribution and other community properties as functions of the interaction coefficient, the immigration rate and the strength of demographic stochasticity...|$|R
40|$|The {{closely related}} {{bacterial}} species Bacillus cereus and Bacillus weihenstephanensis are {{adapted to the}} mesophilic and the psychrotrophic temperature range, respectively. While B. cereus strains are associated with foodborne diseases, B. weihenstephanensis strains are so far not, although similar virulence genes are found in both species. Our investigations show that both species were virulent in the insect model, Galleria mellonella, following infection via oral and haemocoel routes. However, virulence of B. weihenstephanensis was much higher at 15 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. Furthermore, a temperature-dependent difference between the species was seen in a cell culture cytotoxicity assay. In summary, our results demonstrate {{for the first time}} virulence of B. weihenstephanensis strains in an in vivo model. In addition, we found that G. mellonella is a useful model for studies of the psychrotolerant species of the B. cereus group, suggesting that insects might be an <b>ecological</b> growth <b>niche</b> for several members of this bacterial group...|$|R
40|$|The Island Rule is the {{observed}} tendency for island isolated animals to either grow or shrink in size {{compared to their}} mainland counterparts. Though the phenomenon was initially observed to only occur {{in a handful of}} taxa (carnivores, artiodactyls, rodents, and lagomorphs), it was expanded to include 2 major trends: 1) Large animals from the mainland tend to shrink on islands, and 2) Small animals from the mainland tend to grow. The mechanisms attributed to those two trends generally involved factors that include resource availability, <b>ecological</b> release, <b>niche</b> expansion, predation, competition, and life history traits. Other theories were also proposed, but each had their own caveats that did not apply as a general rule. The study of the island rule, and island biogeography in general, allows a simplified view of dynamics that may possibly be reflected on mainlands. An example of this includes <b>ecological</b> release and <b>niche</b> expansion in the case of mammals following the Cretaceous/Tertiary extinction event. Following the collapse of dinosaurian prevalence, the relatively small mammals were given the opportunity to grow and speciate accordingly. However, upon further observation, the island rule in its generality did not encompass all fauna, and exceptions were found for the insular trend. Bergmann’s rule of latitudinal differentiation for body sizes, as well as general climate change, have been found to potentially influence body size shifts as well. As a result, some have chosen to strip the Island Rule of its status as a virtual law, and instead explain the trend as being a phenomenon greatly affected by both biotic and abiotic components to determine insular body size. Regardless of the specific definition, it is maintained that a strong understanding of island processes may lend a better understanding of mainland developmental ecology and evolution...|$|R

40|$|By over-focusing on precise definitions, ecology has {{produced}} a confused idea of the niche concept. This, our second paper, develops a practical philosophy for the niche that approaches the concept at the correct level of abstraction. We deconstruct the niche into effect and response components and then reconstruct those parts into a general, visual schematic of the niche and ecology. Using this schematic we examine the relationship of particular niche ideas to ecology, and {{examine the relationship between}} <b>niche</b> and <b>ecological</b> sub-disciplines, particularly species distribution modelling (SDM). This general description clarifies the duality of the niche concept, as both a facet of species and a facet of environments. Unclear use of these dual concepts can confuse the scientific approach, and our ideas about uncertainty and error. By misclassifying models as concepts, ecology has confused the niche. Our practical philosophy uses the current wealth of <b>ecological</b> and <b>niche</b> ideas as a panoramic view of a general niche concept. We argue that stitching the niche produces a concept that underpins straightforward ecological thinking...|$|R
40|$|<b>Niche</b> {{differentiation}} and <b>ecological</b> filtering are primary ecological {{processes that}} shape community assembly, but their relative importance remains poorly understood. Analyses of the distributions of functional traits can {{provide insight into}} the community structure generated by these processes. We predicted the trait distributions expected under the <b>ecological</b> processes of <b>niche</b> differentiation and environmental filtering, then tested these predictions with a dataset of 4672 trees located in nine 1 -ha plots of tropical rain forest in French Guiana. Five traits related to leaf function (foliar N concentration, chlorophyll content, toughness, tissue density and specific leaf area), and three traits related to stem function (trunk sapwood density, branch sapwood density, and trunk bark thickness), as well as laminar surface area, were measured on every individual tree. There was far more evidence for environmental filtering than for niche differentiation in these forests. Furthermore, we contrasted results from species-mean and individual-level trait values. Analyses that took within-species trait variation into account were far more sensitive indicators of <b>niche</b> differentiation and <b>ecological</b> filtering. Species-mean analyses, by contrast, may underestimate the effects of ecological processes on community assembly. Environmental filtering appeared somewhat more intense on leaf traits than on stem traits, whereas niche differentiation affected neither strongly. By accounting for within-species trait variation, we were able to more properly consider the ecological interactions among individual trees and between individual trees and their environment. In so doing, our results suggest that the <b>ecological</b> processes of <b>niche</b> differentiation and environmental filtering may be more pervasive than previously believed...|$|R
40|$|Species {{distribution}} modeling {{has been}} widely used in studying habitat relationships and for conservation purposes. However, neglecting ecological knowledge about species, e. g. their seasonal movements, and ignoring the proper environmental factors that can explain key elements for species survival (shelter, food and water) increase model uncertainty. This study exemplifies how these ecological gaps in species distribution modeling can be addressed by modeling {{the distribution of the}} emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) in Australia. Emus cover a large area during the austral winter. However, their habitat shrinks during the summer months. We show evidence of emu summer habitat shrinkage due to higher fire frequency, and low water and food availability in northern regions. Our findings indicate that emus prefer areas with higher vegetation productivity and low fire recurrence, while their distribution is linked to an optimal intermediate (~ 0. 12 m 3 m(- 3)) soil moisture range. We propose that the application of three geospatial data products derived from satellite remote sensing, namely fire frequency, ecosystem productivity, and soil water content, provides an effective representation of emu general habitat requirements, and substantially improves species distribution modeling and representation of the species' <b>ecological</b> habitat <b>niche</b> across Australia...|$|R
5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular <b>ecological</b> <b>niche,</b> or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E

They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different <b>ecological</b> <b>niche</b> from their parents, and only attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E
30|$|NCT {{stresses}} that organisms frequently modify the environments of other organisms that share the environments with them. An organism has as {{an ability to}} alter its environment by processes such as migration, dispersal and habitat selection. In short, an organism chooses an environment, modifies it and creates it, or destroys a habitat and resources for other living creatures; these modifications may then become evolutionarily significant (Sterelny 2001 : 333; Odling-Smee et al. 2003). This approach addresses the significance of development in which the evolutionary process depends {{not only on the}} processes of natural selection and genetic inheritance, but also on the process of <b>ecological</b> inheritance through <b>niche</b> construction (Lewontin 1983;Sterelny 2001 : 333; Laland and Sterelny 2006; Laland et al. 2008 : 550).|$|R
40|$|Understanding what {{maintains}} {{species diversity}} {{in a community}} is a central challenge in commu-nity ecology. However, consistent answers to this very question are not yet available. This dilemma has led some ecologists to call community ecology “a mess” and to rethink whether it is appropriate for community ecology to move only unidirectionally from patterns to processes. A new and promising theoretical frame-work is proposed. According to this new framework, there are four basic processes possible in a community: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. The relative importance of these four processes varies among communities. All current theories can be readily incorporated into this framework, because they individually consider {{a subset of the}} four processes. In this study we give a brief introduction to this process-based theo-retical framework and use it to analyze the processes underlying existing community theories relating to niche, local and regional interactions, and <b>ecological</b> drift. <b>Niche</b> theory only considers balancing selection, whereas theories of local and regional interactions emphasize the role of speciation and dispersal, besides se-lection. Theories incorporating ecological drift focus on drift, dispersal and speciation but discount selection. We are confident that this new framework provides new insights that will help to integrate existing commu-nity theories...|$|R
40|$|The {{genotypic}} {{structure of}} parasite populations {{is an important}} determinant of ecological and evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions with consequences for pest management and disease control. Genotypic structure is especially interesting where multiple hosts co-exist and share parasites. We here analyze the natural genotypic distribution of Crithidia bombi, a trypanosomatid parasite of bumblebees (Bombus spp.), in two ecologically different habitats over a time period of three years. Using an algorithm to reconstruct genotypes in cases of multiple infections, and combining these with directly identified genotypes from single infections, we find a striking diversity of infection for both data sets, with almost all multilocus genotypes being unique, and are inferring that around half of the total infections are resulting from multiple strains. Our analyses further suggest a mixture of clonality and sexuality in natural populations of this parasite species. Finally, we ask whether parasite genotypes are associated with host species (the phylogenetic hypothesis) or whether <b>ecological</b> factors (<b>niche</b> overlap in flower choice) shape the distribution of parasite genotypes (the ecological hypothesis). Redundancy analysis demonstrates that in the region with relatively high parasite prevalence, both host species identity and niche overlap are equally important factors shaping the distribution of parasite strains, whereas in the region with lower parasite prevalence, niche overlap more strongly contributes to the distribution observed. Overall, our study underlines th...|$|R

The teratorns held sway over the <b>ecological</b> <b>niche</b> of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E

The bigger, but less common, Deinosuchus that lived in Texas and Montana might have been more specialized hunters, capturing and eating large dinosaurs.

However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat {{is likely to have}} prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative.|$|E
40|$|The {{island of}} Mo’orea in French Polynesia {{functions}} as a model system to study the biological and <b>ecological</b> concept of <b>niche</b> differentiation, whereby two or more species are forced into different habitats {{so as to avoid}} competition with each other. In the waters surrounding this island, two species of sea urchin within the genus Echinometra live in distinctly different habitats. Previous studies document Echinometra sp.

This study investigated three short-term factors (available space, nutrient supply, and predation) that might be influencing this spatial distribution. None of these factors appear to be causing the separation of E. sp. A and E. mathaei. In fact, they all support the distributional findings of this study that showed non-mutually exclusive distribution data on the two reef types...|$|R
40|$|Background: One major {{challenge}} in understanding how biodiversity is organized is finding out whether communities of competing species are shaped exclusively by species-level differences in <b>ecological</b> traits (<b>niche</b> theory), exclusively by random processes (neutral theory of biodiversity), or by both processes simultaneously. Communities of species competing for a pulsed resource are a suitable system for testing these theories: due to marked fluctuations in resource availability, the theories yield very different {{predictions about the}} timing of resource use and the synchronization of the population dynamics between the competing species. Accordingly, we explored mechanisms that might promote the local coexistence of phytophagous insects (four sister species of the genus Curculio) competing for oak acorns, a pulsed resource. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed the time partitioning of the exploitation of oak acorns by the four weevil species in two independent communities, and we assessed the level of synchronization in their population dynamics. In accordance with the niche theory, overall these species exhibited marked time partitioning of resource use, both within a given year and between different years owing to different dormancy strategies between species, as well as distinct demographic patterns. Two of the four weevil species, however, consistently exploited the resource during the same period of the year, exhibited a similar dormancy pattern, and did not show any significant difference in their population dynamics. Conclusions/Significance: The marked time partitioning of the resource use appears as a keystone of the coexistence o...|$|R
40|$|Patterns {{found in}} mixed {{communities}} including grass, shrubs and trees function as natural water-harvesting systems in arid and semi-arid regions throughout the world. Furthermore, self-organizing vegetation patterns may be indicators of environmental shifts in climate {{and land use}} change scenarios. Therefore, net facilitation, leading to resource concentration within vegetation patches, should be imitated and preserved. This study analyses the <b>ecological</b> feedback between <b>niche</b> adaptation of similar band-forming species, and {{the environment in which}} species thrive. A minimal model for two coexisting species and the soil moisture balance was formulated to improve our understanding of the effects of species differentiation on the dynamics of plants and resources on single pattern and landscape scales. The model outcomes suggest that pattern-forming-species communities arise as a result of niche differentiation (driven e. g. by evolutionary changes), whereas similar adaptation strategies to cope with harsh conditions may lead to impoverishment of environmental resources and loss of vegetation cover and diversity...|$|R

In contrast, saprobic fungi like Coprinopsis cinerea and Galerina marginata, which break down organic matter to obtain nutrients, have a more complete complement of cell wall-degrading enzymes. Although few ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been tested in this way, the authors suggest that the absence of plant cell wall-degrading ability may correlate with the ectomycorrhizal <b>ecological</b> <b>niche.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large size, {{elephants}} {{have a huge}} impact on their environments and are considered keystone species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At Mount Elgon, elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This <b>ecological</b> <b>niche</b> cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the tapir. Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. Elephants can {{have a negative impact on}} ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.|$|E
5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the <b>ecological</b> <b>niche.</b> A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to determine whether}} or not livestock are becoming more susceptible to epidemics of salmonella infections by the analysis of published data on the annual number of reported infections in various animals.

This study analysed these reports by the calculation of diversity indices which are not subject to some of these potential biases. The relationship between the <b>ecological</b> concept of <b>niche</b> width and the diversity of species or types occupying that niche is discussed. The diversity of salmonella types reported in fowl has shown a highly significant decline over the 13 -year period 1976 - 88. It is suggested that this declining diversity may be related to the declining niche width of the biotope available to this pathogen. Although speculative, this reduction in niche width could be related to a declining genetic diversity in the host animals or to an increasing intensification of animal husbandry...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEcological Niche Models (ENMs) are {{increasingly}} used by ecologists to project species potential future distribution. However, {{the application of}} such models may be challenging, and some caveats have already been identified. While studies have generally shown that projections may {{be sensitive to the}} ENM applied or the emission scenario, to name just a few, the sensitivity of ENM-based scenarios to General Circulation Models (GCMs) has been often underappreciated. Here, using a multi-GCM and multi-emission scenario approach, we evaluated the variability in projected distributions under future climate conditions. We modeled the <b>ecological</b> realized <b>niche</b> (sensu Hutchinson) and predicted the baseline distribution of species with contrasting spatial patterns and representative of two major functional groups of European trees: the dwarf birch and the sweet chestnut. Their future distributions were then projected onto future climatic conditions derived from seven GCMs and four emissions scenarios using the new Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR 5 report. Uncertainties arising from GCMs and those resulting from emissions scenarios were quantified and compared. Our study reveals that scenarios of future species distribution exhibit broad differences, depending not only on emissions scenarios but also on GCMs. We found that the between-GCM variability was greater than the between-RCP variability for the next decades and both types of variability reached a similar level {{at the end of this}} century. Our result highlights that a combined multi-GCM and multi-RCP approach is needed to better consider potential trajectories and uncertainties in future species distributions. In all cases, between-GCM variability increases with the level of warming, and if nothing is done to alleviate global warming, future species spatial distribution may become more and more difficult to anticipate. When future species spatial distributions are examined, we propose to use a large number of GCMs and RCPs to better anticipate potential trajectories and quantify uncertainties...|$|R
