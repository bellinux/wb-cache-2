Maria overhears the pair's conversation and chips in saying that she feels that Maddy <b>is</b> <b>perfect.</b> Michael knows Maria is right but Ric thinks he might have made a mistake and he explains to Maddy that he is withdrawing her interview offer.

5|$|The laws {{of physics}} apply the abstractions of {{mathematics}} to the real world, often {{as if it were}} perfect. For example, a crystal <b>is</b> <b>perfect</b> when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects. Visible patterns in nature are governed by physical laws; for example, meanders can be explained using fluid dynamics.|$|E

25|$|The binary {{icosahedral}} group <b>is</b> <b>perfect,</b> {{meaning that}} it is equal to its commutator subgroup. In fact, 2I is the unique perfect group of order 120. It follows that 2I is not solvable.|$|E
25|$|More generally, a quasisimple group (a perfect central {{extension}} {{of a simple}} group) which is a non-trivial extension (i.e., not a simple group itself) <b>is</b> <b>perfect</b> but not simple; this includes all the insoluble non-simple finite special linear groups SL(n,q) as extensions of the projective special linear group PSL(n,q) (SL(2,5) is an {{extension of}} PSL(2,5), which is isomorphic to A5). Similarly, the special linear group over the real and complex numbers <b>is</b> <b>perfect,</b> but the general linear group GL is never perfect (except when trivial or over F2, where it equals the special linear group), as the determinant gives a non-trivial abelianization and indeed the commutator subgroup is SL.|$|E

25|$|Any {{quotient}} of {{a perfect}} group <b>is</b> <b>perfect.</b> A non-trivial finite perfect group which is not simple must then be an extension {{of at least one}} smaller simple non-abelian group.

5000|$|In mathematics, a P-multimagic cube is a magic cube {{that remains}} magic {{even if all}} its numbers are {{replaced}} by their k-th power for 1 ≤ k ≤ P. Thus, a magic cube is bimagic when it is 2-multimagic, and trimagic when it is 3-multimagic, tetramagic when it is 4-multimagic. [...] A P-multimagic cube {{is said to be}} semi-perfect if the k-th power cubes <b>are</b> <b>perfect</b> for 1 ≤ k < P, and the P-th power cube is semiperfect.

25|$|Every {{comparability}} graph <b>is</b> <b>perfect.</b> The {{perfection of}} comparability graphs is Mirsky's theorem, and {{the perfection of}} their complements is Dilworth's theorem; these facts, together with the perfect graph theorem {{can be used to}} prove Dilworth's theorem from Mirsky's theorem or vice versa. More specifically, comparability graphs are perfectly orderable graphs, a subclass of perfect graphs: a greedy coloring algorithm for a topological ordering of a transitive orientation of the graph will optimally color them.|$|E
