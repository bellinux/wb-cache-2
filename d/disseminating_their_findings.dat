40|$|The scientist-practitioner {{model in}} {{clinical}} psychology is critically examined {{and illustrated by}} reference to applied research using archival data as well as survey, single-case and group design methodology. A definition of the scientist-practitioner as one who consumes and utilises research findings, and who may also undertake research is espoused and defended. It is argued that the scientist-practitioner model is an appropriate one for clinical training since, in providing practitioners with a scientific mentality, it allows for psychology's unique contribution. The realisation of the scientist-practitioner ideal, however, is dependent on psychologists embracing {{a wide range of}} alternative research methods, on post-graduate employment settings that support and internalise the model, and on a recognition by researchers that they have a responsibility for <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> <b>findings</b> through effective communication channels...|$|E
40|$|Context The Lincolnshire Mud and Stud is one {{of several}} vernacular earth {{building}} techniques on the British Isles. For a long time it was probably the least known and the least praised one. Unlike more acknowledged English traditions, such as Cob or Wattle and Daub, this one was not treated as a separate important part of English heritage. 30 years ago something changed dramatically. A small group of enthusiasts - architects, historians and practitioners – who called themselves EMESS (East Midlands Earth Structure Society) rediscovered this technique and dedicated their work to learning about its uniqueness and <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> <b>findings.</b> They started collecting data, getting involved in renovation and new builds, and most of all spread the knowledge of this technique among local residents. Research: main objectives, Today, 3 decades on, research led by Universities of Lincoln and Sheffield involving interviews with inhabitants of those historic buildings brings insight into the long-lasting and transforming impact on the perception of Lincolnshire architecture resulting from EMESS activity. This gives a valuable and useful lesson on how a relatively small grass roots organisation can change the perception and effectively change the role of vernacular architecture...|$|E

40|$|Access to {{the most}} {{up-to-date}} evidence is an important cornerstone for veterinarians attempting to practice in an evidence-based manner; therefore, {{an understanding of what}} and how information is accessed is vital. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify what resources the UK veterinary profession access and regard as most useful. Based on questionnaires received from veterinarians, the Veterinary Times was nominated as most often read journal or magazine by respondents (n= 3572, 79 per cent). In Practice (n= 3224, 82 per cent) and the Veterinary Record (n= 165, 34 per cent) were seen as most useful by clinicians, and non-clinicians, respectively. Google was the most often nominated electronic resource by all respondents (n= 3076, 71 per cent), with Google (n= 459, 23 per cent) and PubMed (n= 60, 17 per cent) seen as most useful by clinicians and non-clinicians, respectively. The abstract and conclusion sections were the most read parts of scientific manuscripts nominated by all respondents. When looking for assistance with difficult cases, colleagues were the common information choice for clinicians. Different sections of the veterinary profession access information, and deem resources useful, in different ways. Access to good quality evidence is important for the practice of evidence-based veterinary medicine, and therefore, researchers should think about <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> <b>findings</b> in a targeted way for optimal use by the profession...|$|E
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Disability and Rehabilitation on 26 th June 2013, available online: [URL] The {{purpose of this article}} is to develop an evidence-based resource for knowing and communicating the complexities involved for both males and females in implementing and sustaining a physically active lifestyle shortly after spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods: Synthesizing a set of qualitative and quantitative studies with over 500 spinal cord injured people, the article represents research utilizing the genre of ethnographic creative non-fiction. This genre of representation holds enormous potential for researchers in terms of <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> <b>findings</b> to diverse audiences beyond the academy, and having real impact. Results: The ethnographic creative non-fictions show together for the first time the barriers, determinants, benefits, trajectories, emotions, fears, preferred methods and messengers for delivering important physical activity information to men and women with a SCI. Conclusion: The article contributes to knowledge by showing the embodied complexities involved when in rehabilitation for both males and females in implementing and sustaining a physically active lifestyle shortly after SCI. It also makes a contribution to practice by providing researchers, health care professionals and disability user-groups with a theory and evidence based resource to assist in informing, teaching and enabling people living with SCI to initiate and maintain a physically active lifestyle.

40|$|PURPOSE: This project {{describes}} a graduate-level service learning course whereby the instructor divided students into small evaluation teams and assigned the teams {{one of two}} distinct models by which to evaluate the same non-profit organization. The goal {{of the study was}} to examine how the pedagogy of the class improved student learning. SUBJECTS: 19 students and 21 Stakeholders. METHODS: The teams were assigned either goal-free evaluation or success case method; and they conducted their respective evaluations independently and simultaneously. Each team was responsible for <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> <b>findings</b> to the program via a written report in addition to an oral presentation. At the conclusion of the course, the students were administered an attitude survey regarding their service learning experience; and upon reading the evaluation reports, the program’s stakeholders were surveyed regarding the perceived utility of each of the evaluations. MATERIALS: Students completed a 20 item semantic differential regarding their feelings of the service learning aspect of the course. Stakeholders completed a 25 -item semantic differential regarding their feelings regarding the student’s evaluation reports. RESULTS: Students reported that they felt the class was very anxiety-provoking as well as disorganized. An open-ended survey question expressed these resulted from having to attend the evaluations outside of class time. Results from stakeholders reported feelings regarding the evaluation reports were dependent on the quality of writing, not the method of evaluation used. CONCLUSIONS: If the project was to be repeated, steps should be taken to reduce anxiety resulting from the out-of class aspect of the project...|$|E

40|$|Implicit in the Constitution of the North American Society for Sport Management is an {{emphasis}} on social justice. As such, many scholars in the field have explored these issues, focusing on how race and/or gender impact access and opportunity to both participate in sport and manage its related institutions. For example, Acosta & Carpenter (2000) have examined gender, and more specifically {{the role of women}} within sport organizations and their rates of sport participation. Lapchick (2007), the Director for the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, and colleagues also have conducted research on gender and race, <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> <b>findings</b> in Racial and Gender Report Cards, which highlight the gross discrepancies in both the hiring practices of professional and collegiate sport organizations and the demographic composition of athletic teams. In addition, others in the field of sport management have explored whether there are discrepancies in treatment at the workplace that individuals might experience {{on the basis of race}} and gender (e. g. Sagas & Cunningham, 2004). However, while the research related to social justice has been pronounced, few researchers within sport management explicitly have acknowledged that both access and treatment are two dimensions of social justice. Sartore (2006) is one of these exceptions; she specifically referenced the work of Greenhaus, Parasuraman, & Wormley (1990), and more specifically their distinction between access and treatment discrimination.

30|$|We {{also found}} the calculation-related episodes were {{significantly}} related to team performance. Calculations were important for the team assignment since students were asked to compare costs, savings, and payback period of the old and proposed new systems. In addition, students needed to conduct an environmental analysis to compare carbon dioxide emissions of different systems. As a pedagogical implication, this finding underlines the importance of calculations in engineering. The calculations are at the core of all engineering disciplines, and the fundamental engineering equations and related calculations can facilitate students’ understanding. Therefore, engineering students need continuous instruction on how to apply the knowledge of mathematics and science into engineering problems. In addition, students need opportunities and feedback on how to analyze and interpret data, as well as how to communicate and <b>disseminate</b> <b>their</b> <b>findings</b> based on these calculations.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. In {{public health}} and {{clinical}} settings insufficient dissemination of evidence-based practices limits the reach of new discoveries to broad populations. This study aimed to describe characteristics of the dissemination process by researchers across three countries (Brazil, United Kingdom, and United States), explore how designing for dissemination practices has been used, and analyze factors associated with dissemination. Methods. A similar online survey was used to query researchers across the three countries; data were pooled to draw cross-country conclusions. Findings. This study identified {{similarities and differences between}} countries. Importance of dissemination to nonresearcher audiences was widely recognized as important; however, traditional academic venues were the main dissemination method. Several factors were associated with self-rated dissemination effort in the pooled sample, but these predictive factors (e. g., support and resources for dissemination) had low prevalence. Less than one-third of researchers rated their level of effort for dissemination as excellent. Respondents reported limited support and resources {{to make it easier for}} researchers who might want to <b>disseminate</b> <b>their</b> <b>findings.</b> Conclusion.
