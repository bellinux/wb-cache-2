He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification and, the next morning, discarded their remains. Remains were found at Eden Canyon a week after the murders, and more were found near Highway 1 in March. When questioned in a later interview as to why he removed his victim's head before having sex with the body, he explained: [...] "The head trip fantasies were a bit like a trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That's the person. I remember being told as a <b>kid,</b> <b>you</b> cut off the head and the body dies.

2500|$|Marvel {{encouraged}} Daley and Goldstein {{to express}} {{their own sense of}} humor in the script, with Daley saying, [...] "When you’re seeing the world {{through the eyes of a}} fun, funny <b>kid,</b> <b>you</b> can really embrace that voice, and not give him the cookie-cutter one-liners that you’re so accustomed to hearing from Peter Parker." [...] Inspired by their experiences working on sit-coms, the writers also looked to create [...] "a network of strong characters" [...] to surround Parker with in the film. In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a coming-of-age story to see the growth of Parker, citing Say Anything..., Almost Famous, and Can't Buy Me Love as some of his favorite films in that genre. It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations. Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and [...] "came to a new realization about why he was so popular originally: He gave a different perspective on this world that they were building. He was introduced in the ‘60s, when they had already built a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person’s perspective on it. And that ties in really nicely with what I get to do with this movie, which is" [...] introduce him to the MCU. Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were Ultimate Spider-Man and Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane. In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the <b>kid.</b> <b>You</b> feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
