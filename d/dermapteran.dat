40|$|Abstract An {{inventory}} of invertebrates associated with {{different types of}} mulches in central Ohio revealed that significantly more organisms occurred in mulched plots than in bare soil plots. Mulch often harbored {{more than twice as}} many organisms as bare soil. Furthermore, these invertebrates were more prevalent in the mulch itself than in the underlying soil. The compass side of the structure and the type of groundcover appeared to have little effect on the numbers of invertebrates in plots (groundcover and underlying soil). Collembola and acarines were present in more than half of the plots, often in very high numbers. Diplopods were the most plentiful macroarthropod, occurring in almost half (48. 9 %) of the plots. Other regularly encountered invertebrates included isopods, coleopterans, nematodes, chilopods, and earthworms. Isopterans, psocids, aranids, formicids, symphylans, diplurans, and <b>dermapterans</b> were occasionally encountered. Some organisms were more prevalent in a particular type of mulch, i. e., isopods in leaf litter; acarines and diplopods in hardwood mulch; pseudoscorpions, diplopods, and acarines in pine bark micro-nuggets; and symphylans in grass. Inorganic mulches tended to hold less moisture and harbored fewer invertebrates than organic mulches. Diplopods, earthworms, isopods, collembola, acarines, dipteran larvae, pseudoscorpions, psocids, aranids, and isopterans were found in significantly higher numbers at a mulch depth of 11 to 13 cm. Most invertebrates were present in significantly lower numbers at a mulch depth of 1 cm. Isopterans experienced a significant decrease in numbers at a soil temperature of 22 °C, which was an ideal temperature for dipteran larvae, diplurans, pseudoscorpions, and symphylans. There was a dramatic drop in numbers of all invertebrates except psocids when the surface temperature reached 34 °C. Key Words Arthropods, nematodes, termites, soil temperature, soil moistur...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe chapter {{describes}} {{the relationships between}} phenotypic plasticity through the development and intra- and inter-specific radiation specifically in regard to <b>dermapteran</b> parental behavior. Mainly adults, and specifically, dynamics of their reproductive cycle are concerned. The great majority of studies on behavioral ontogeny concern “higher” animals mainly mammals, where mother-infant relationships imply a type of social bond (psychosocial level) that is not found in insects (biosocial level). This chapter is also guided by the question of behavioral transformations linked with speciation, in particular Darwinian behavioral adaptations arising from the conventional Darwinian mechanism of selection upon genetic variation. It also {{describes the}} development of <b>dermapteran</b> parental behavior, then examines this process {{within the context of}} intra- and inter-specific adaptive radiation, and lastly, it discusses the theoretical implications of this epigenetic approach...|$|E

30|$|Faunal work in corn fields at Mansoura Governorate, {{carried out}} by Ragab (1988), showed most of the {{beneficial}} species mentioned above, {{in addition to the}} <b>dermapteran,</b> Diaperasticus erythrocephalus (Olivier) (Forficulidae), as first recorded species predaceous upon aphids, egg masses, and young larvae of corn borers. This forficulid was studied by Tawfik et al. (1995), and their observations revealed its predaceous and phytophagous feeding habits. On the other hand, Lutfallah and Kares (1988 – 89) reported the braconid Bracon brevicornis (Wesm.) as a larval parasitoid of O. nubilalis and C. agamemnon, in addition to most of the predators mentioned above. B. brevicornis was also recorded, as an efficient parasitoid, on the hibernated larvae of corn borers in dry corn stalks during winter (Abd El-Gawad 2000).|$|E
40|$|International audienceParent-young {{relations}} {{are far from}} being unvarying and simple, even within a group as homogeneous and modest in number (1000 actual species) as Dermaptera. Care of the eggs by a female and the contacts she maintains with her larvae are neither established nor developed in an automatic way, but are amenable to important regulations in which behaviour itself is implied. The presence of larvae also has an important effect on the later development of the female’s behaviour. Relationships can be established between known inter and intra-specific differences and between. - the ovarian organization and activity of each species or population, {{on the one hand}} and - the living conditions adopted by each species or population (Labidura riparia, Anechura bipunctata, Forficula auricularia) on the other.

30|$|Many predatory species {{exist in}} cotton fields where they play an {{important}} role against most of the pests attacking this crop (El-Heneidy et al. 1996, 1997). This group of predators consists of the <b>dermapteran,</b> Labidura riparia Pallas; the hemipterans, Onocephalus pilicornis H.S. (Reduviidae), Orius albidipennis Reut., and O. laevigatus Fieb. (Anthocoridae); and the neuropterans, Chrysoperla carnea (Steph), (Chrysopidae) and Helicomiitus festivus Ramb. (Ascalapidae); the coleopterans, Calosoma chlorostictcum De Geer (Carabidae), Chilomenes vicina Muls, Coccinella undecimpunctata L., C. septempunctata L., Scynmus interruptus Goeze and Scymnus syriacus Mars. (Coccinellidae), and Paederus alfierii Kock. (Staphylinidae); the dipterans, Phenobremia aphidivora Rubs (Cecidomyiidae), Paragus aegyptius Macq., and Sphaerophoria flavicauda Zett. (Syrphidae); and lastly, the phytoseiid mite Amblyseius gossipi El-Badry. Among these agents, the most common are L. riparia against larvae and pupae of lepidopterous pests; the anthocorids against egg masses of S. littoralis; the chrysopids against aphids, whitefly, and mites; and Am. gossipi against eggs and larvae of the whitefly. Based on 28 S rDNA, Gamila et al. (2016), molecularly, identified five coccinellid species from field crops at Giza region, i.e., Coccinella undecimpunctata, C. septempunctata, Cydonia vicina isis, C. vicina nilotica, and Hippodamia variegata.|$|E
40|$|The insect order Dermaptera, {{belonging}} to Polyneoptera, includes ∼ 2, 000 extant species, but no <b>dermapteran</b> mitochondrial genome has been sequenced. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of the free-living earwig, Challia fletcheri, compared its genomic features to other available mitochondrial sequences from polyneopterous insects. In addition, the Dermaptera, {{together with the}} other known polyneopteran mitochondrial genome sequences (protein coding, ribosomal RNA, and transfer RNA genes), were employed to understand the phylogeny of Polyneoptera, {{one of the least}} resolved insect phylogenies, with emphasis on the placement of Dermaptera. The complete mitochondrial genome of C. fletcheri presents the following several unusual features: the longest size in insects is 20, 456 bp; it harbors the largest tandem repeat units (TRU) among insects; it displays T- and G-skewness on the major strand and A- and C-skewness on the minor strand, which is a reversal of the general pattern found in most insect mitochondrial genomes, and it possesses a unique gene arrangement characterized by a series of gene translocations and/or inversions. The reversal pattern of skewness is explained in terms of inversion of replication origin. All phylogenetic analyses consistently placed Dermaptera as the sister to Plecoptera, leaving them as the most basal lineage of Polyneoptera or sister to Ephemeroptera, and placed Odonata consistently as the most basal lineage of the Pterygota...|$|E
40|$|Here, {{we present}} a study {{regarding}} the phylogenetic positions of two enigmatic earwig lineages whose unique phenotypic traits evolved in connection with ectoparasitic relationships with mammals. Extant earwigs (Dermaptera) have traditionally been divided into three suborders: the Hemimerina, Arixeniina, and Forficulina. While the Forficulina are typical, well-known, free-living earwigs, the Hemimerina and Arixeniina are unusual epizoic groups living on molossid bats (Arixeniina) or murid rodents (Hemimerina). The monophyly of both epizoic lineages is well established, but {{their relationship to the}} remainder of the Dermaptera is controversial because of their extremely modified morphology with paedomorphic features. We present phylogenetic analyses that include molecular data (18 S and 28 S ribosomal DNA and histone- 3) for both Arixeniina and Hemimerina for the first time. This data set enabled us to apply a rigorous cladistics approach and to test competing hypotheses that were previously scattered in the literature. Our results demonstrate that Arixeniidae and Hemimeridae belong in the <b>dermapteran</b> suborder Neodermaptera, infraorder Epidermaptera, and superfamily Forficuloidea. The results support the sister group relationships of Arixeniidae+Chelisochidae and Hemimeridae+Forficulidae. This study demonstrates the potential for rapid and substantial macroevolutionary changes at the morphological level as related to adaptive evolution, in this case linked to the utilization of a novel trophic niche based on an epizoic life strategy. Our results also indicate that the evolutionary consequences of the transition to an ectoparazitic mode of living, which is extremely rar...|$|E
40|$|The {{external}} and internal head morphology including the musculature of the common earwig Forficula auricularia is described in detail. We specified and corrected previous descriptions and provided a detailed documentation. The head of Forficula is characterized by prognathism, generalized mandibles with a mesal cutting edge distally of the mola and its drop-shaped appearance. We added the following new apomorphies for Dermaptera to the various previously reported ones: (I) coronal and frontal cleavage lines with corresponding strong internal strengthening ridges; (II) {{the division of the}} praementum into a basal and a distal sclerite; (III) the presence of a bumpulus {{at the tip of the}} paraglossa; (IV) the presence of large distal palpilla on the terminal maxillary and labial palpomeres and (V) the origin of M. tentoriohypopharyngealis on the submentum. Another potential apomorphy are the lateral lobes on the distal hypopharynx which are most likely not homologous to the superlingua of apterygote insect. Other characters such as the prominent ball-and-socket joint between scapus and pedicellus or the unique antennal heart are poorly studied within Dermaptera and therefore cannot be phylogenetically polarized. In contrast to the various ordinarial apomorphies, the <b>dermapteran</b> head exhibits only one potential synapomorphy with other polyneopteran orders: the absence of the linguactual tendon and the associated muscle that is shared with Plecoptera and/or Zoraptera. Our results show that additional studies of the presumingly basal splits of Dermaptera are required to understand the head evolution of the group...|$|E
40|$|Characterizing trophic {{networks}} {{is fundamental}} to many questions in ecology, but this typically requires painstaking efforts, especially to identify the diet of small generalist predators. Several attempts have been devoted to develop suitable molecular tools to determine predatory trophic interactions through gut content analysis, and the challenge has been to achieve simultaneously high taxonomic breadth and resolution. General and practical methods are still needed, preferably independent of PCR amplification of barcodes, to recover {{a broader range of}} interactions. Here we applied shotgun-sequencing of the DNA from arthropod predator gut contents, extracted from four common coccinellid and <b>dermapteran</b> predators co-occurring in an agroecosystem in Brazil. By matching unassembled reads against six DNA reference databases obtained from public databases and newly assembled mitogenomes, and filtering for high overlap length and identity, we identified prey and other foreign DNA in the predator guts. Good taxonomic breadth and resolution was achieved (93 % of prey identified to species or genus), but with low recovery of matching reads. Two to nine trophic interactions were found for these predators, some of which were only inferred by the presence of parasitoids and components of the microbiome known to be associated with aphid prey. Intraguild predation was also found, including among closely related ladybird species. Uncertainty arises from the lack of comprehensive reference databases and reliance on low numbers of matching reads accentuating the risk of false positives. We discuss caveats and some future prospects that could improve the use of direct DNA shotgun-sequencing to characterize arthropod trophic networks...|$|E
40|$|Few informations {{regarding}} the biology and ecology of <b>dermapteran</b> predators has been reported. For possibile use of Euborellia annulipes (Lucas) (Anisolabididae) in biological control programs against the {{cotton boll weevil}} Anthonomus grandis Boheman (Curculionidae) {{it is essential to}} know the effects of temperature on the reproductive attributes of adult females of this predator. Our objective was to evaluate the reproductive potentiality of females of E. annulipes under laboratory conditions using an artificial diet, at 25 and 30 oC. Fecundity began to decline at the 84 th d at 25 oC and 74 th d at 30 oC of adult age and ended with the death of the females at both temperatures. Females of E. annulipes oviposited an average of 206. 2 and 306. 0 eggs, and had a mean longevity of 198. 4 and 149. 1 d at 25 and 30 oC, respectively. The relationship between age-specific fecundity and age was described by a model composed of a linear function for the increase in fecundity at early ages combined with a exponential function for the subsequent decreaee in egg laying at older ages. This relationship was described by f(x) = αx exp(-βx). In the model f(x) is the daily age-specific fecundity rate (eggs/female/day), x is the age in days (age class), and α and β are constants. Age class 1 (0 to 20 days as adults). The model was fitted to the data by non–linear least square technique (SAS Institute Inc. 2000), weighted by the number of females contributing to the means giving the curves in Fig. 4. The parameters α (± s. e.) and β (± e. s.) respectively were estimated to be at 25 oC (1. 599 ± 0. 256 and 0. 356 ± 0. 033) and at 30 oC (3. 226 ± 0. 581 and 0. 415 ± 0. 044). The model described 78. 8 % and 74. 8 % of the variation at 25 and 30 o C, respectively. The pattern in age-specific fecundity was the same at all two temperatures...|$|E
