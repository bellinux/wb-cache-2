5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the people in the embassy were captured, three managed to escape—two by climbing out of a ground-floor window and the third by climbing across a first-floor parapet to the Ethiopian Embassy next door. A fourth person, Gholam-Ali Afrouz—the chargé d'affaires and thus most senior Iranian official present—briefly escaped by jumping out of a first-floor window, but was injured in the process and quickly captured. Afrouz and the 25 other <b>hostages</b> <b>were</b> all taken to a room on the second floor. The majority of the <b>hostages</b> <b>were</b> embassy staff—predominantly Iranian nationals, but several British employees were also captured. The other <b>hostages</b> <b>were</b> all visitors, with the exception of Lock, the British police officer tasked with guarding the embassy. Afrouz had been appointed to the position less than a year before, his predecessor having been dismissed after the revolution. Abbas Fallahi, who had been a butler before the revolution, was appointed the doorman by Afrouz. One of the British members of staff was Ron Morris, from Battersea, who had worked for the embassy in various positions since 1947.|$|E

The MRTA revolutionaries who had taken the <b>hostages</b> <b>were</b> equipped with body armor, but it was defeated by the Peruvian special forces' P90s. In 2011, P90s were used by Muammar Gaddafi's military forces in the 2011 Libyan civil war, {{and some of these}} examples were captured and used in the war by Libyan rebel forces.|$|E

Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment.

5|$|Hoffman {{gave the}} Mohave {{a choice between}} war and peace, and he demanded that they agree to never again harm white {{settlers}} along the wagon trail. He also declared that, as punishment, the Mohave were required to surrender as hostages a member of each clan and three warriors who had taken part in the attack. Hoffman demanded that the chief who had ordered {{the attack on the}} settlers offer himself up as a hostage. According to Chooksa homar, the chief who had ordered the attack was Homoseh quahote, who was reluctant to give himself up. Cairook offered himself in his place, along with eight others, including Tokwatha, Irataba's son Tekse thume, and Irataba's nephews Qolho qorau, and Aspamekelyeho. Other <b>hostages</b> <b>were</b> named Itsere-'itse, Ilyhanapau, and Tinyam-isalye. They were transported in the river steamer General Jessup to Fort Yuma.
