40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis paper {{describes}} the University of Michigan’s nine-year experience {{in developing and}} using a full-text search engine designed to facilitate information retrieval (IR) from narrative documents stored in <b>electronic</b> health <b>records</b> (EHRs). The system, called the <b>Electronic</b> Medical <b>Record</b> <b>Search</b> Engine (EMERSE), functions similar to Google but is equipped with special functionalities for handling challenges unique to retrieving information from medical text. Materials and methodsKey features that distinguish EMERSE from general-purpose search engines are discussed, {{with an emphasis on}} functions crucial to (1) improving medical IR performance and (2) assuring search quality and results consistency regardless of users’ medical background, stage of training, or level of technical expertise. ResultsSince its initial deployment, EMERSE has been enthusiastically embraced by clinicians, administrators, and clinical and translational researchers. To date, the system has been used in supporting more than 750 research projects yielding 80 peer-reviewed publications. In several evaluation studies, EMERSE demonstrated very high levels of sensitivity and specificity in addition to greatly improved chart review efficiency. DiscussionIncreased availability of electronic data in healthcare does not automatically warrant increased availability of information. The success of EMERSE at our institution illustrates that free-text EHR search engines can be a valuable tool to help practitioners and researchers retrieve information from EHRs more effectively and efficiently, enabling critical tasks such as patient case synthesis and research data abstraction.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Seasonal Influenza (“the flu”) is a {{respiratory}} illness caused by influenza viruses. Yearly influenza vaccination {{is considered to}} be protective against illness and/or severity of illness and is recommended by CDC for all individuals> 6 months of age. However, the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in older individuals has come under question. Objectives: To describe the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients admitted to an academic tertiary care Veterans Administration hospital with influenza during the 2013 - 2014 influenza season and determine the impact, if any, of prior influenza vaccination upon patient outcomes. Methods: Medical <b>electronic</b> <b>records</b> were <b>searched</b> for all patients admitted to the Little Rock Veterans Administration Hospital with proven influenza during the 2013 - 2014 influenza season. Cohorts of vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients were then compared to determine the impact of prior influenza vaccination upon respiratory-failure and mortality. Results: Seventy patients met selection criteria. Mean age was 66 years. Sixty-four (91 %) patients had at least one underlying co-morbid condition; these conditions included COPD, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and cancer. 60 / 70 (85 %) tested positive for Influenza A, and 43 tested positive for H 1 N 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes {{of a telephone}} counseling intervention promoting colorectal cancer (CRC) screening when patients are referred for counseling by primary care providers (PCPs). Study Design: Interventional cohort study with no formal control group. METHODS: PCPs in 3 practices were prompted to address CRC screening in patient encounters and, if appropriate, to recommend referral for telephone counseling. A telephone counselor called referred patients, made an appointment for a counseling call, and mailed an educational booklet to patients. Counseling included education about CRC and screening tests, motivational interviewing, barrier counseling, and facilitated referral for colonoscopy or mailing of a fecal occult blood testing kit. About 7 months following counseling, <b>electronic</b> <b>records</b> were <b>searched</b> for evidence of colonoscopy. RESULTS: PCPs addressed CRC screening with 1945 patients, {{most of whom were}} up-to-date with CRC testing, recommended counseling referral to 362, and of these 180 (49. 7 %) accepted the referral. A total of 140 (77. 8 %) of referred patients were contacted and 67 (37. 2 %) received counseling. After counseling 93. 9 % were planning on CRC screening compared with 54. 6 % {{at the beginning of the}} call. Of those planning a colonoscopy, 53. 2 % received one within 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Referring patients for telephone counseling to promote CRC screening may be feasible and acceptable to PCPs and to some patients, and may increase CRC screening. Further evaluation of the intervention may be warranted to compare the rate of screening associated with the intervention to rates related to usual care and to other interventions...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} on the safety and efficacy of spironolactone {{in the treatment of}} women with acne. Thus, for many dermatologists spironolactone remains an alternative rather than a mainstay treatment for female patients with acne. Methods: An <b>electronic</b> medical <b>records</b> <b>search</b> tool was used to select data from a group of women who received spironolactone to treat acne and were evaluated with the comprehensive acne severity scale (CASS) before treatment and at all follow-up visits. Data points were collected for CASS scores at each follow-up visit, concurrent and previous treatments, and side effects. These data points were used to draw conclusions about the safety and efficacy of spironolactone in this patient population. Results: There were 110 patients that met all eligibility requirements. Of these, 94 patients saw an improvement in their CASS score and 61 patients completely cleared their score to 0. There were 16 patients who did not improve and six who relapsed after initial improvement. The women saw an average improvement in their acne by 73. 1 % for the face, 75. 9 % for the chest, and 77. 6 % for the back. Fifty-one women experienced side effects, but only six found them bothersome enough to stop taking spironolactone. Conclusion: A majority of women in this study saw a dramatic improvement in their acne while treated with spironolactone. There were low rates of relapse or discontinuation of the medication. To further promote the use of spironolactone as a first-line systemic treatment for women with acne, there must be more prospective controlled trials...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the clinical efficacy of once-weekly exenatide on glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes when added to basal-bolus insulin therapy. Methods For this retrospective study, patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 18 years and older, receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, using a continuous glucose monitoring device or regularly measuring blood glucose levels and receiving 2 mg of exenatide once weekly for at least 3 months were included. Demographic information, glycated hemoglobin (A 1 C), body weight, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, total daily insulin dose, basal and bolus insulin doses, 28 -day continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion glucose average and incidence of hypoglycemia were collected at baseline and 3 months after beginning therapy with once-weekly exenatide. Results An <b>electronic</b> medical <b>record</b> <b>search</b> identified 11 patients with type 1 diabetes who met the inclusion criteria. Comparing baseline and 3 months after initiation of once-weekly exenatide revealed reductions of 0. 6 % in A 1 C (p= 0. 013), 3. 7 % in body weight (p= 0. 008), 1. 7 kg/m 2 in body mass index (p= 0. 003), 13 % in total daily insulin dose (p= 0. 011) and 9. 3 units in bolus insulin dose (p= 0. 015).

40|$|Aim To analyze use and {{distribution}} of resources by otolaryngology (ENT) hospital wards in Romania between 2003 and 2008, in order to plan the improvement of patient {{access to health care}} services and health care services’ financial performance. Methods Clinical <b>electronic</b> <b>records</b> were <b>searched</b> for all patients discharged from all public hospitals funded on a per-case basis by the government between January 2003 and September 2008. Adult and pediatric ENT wards, as well as ENT wards from different counties, were compared. Results The number of ENT hospital beds and the number of specialists decreased from 2003 to 2004, the number of specialists declined, and specialists were distributed unevenly among the hospitals and counties. The total number of ENT wards was over 100 for almost the entire study period, but there were only about 15 pediatric ENT wards in all 42 counties. ENT wards recorded more cases and hospitalization days than oral-maxillofacial surgery and neurosurgery wards, but fewer cases than general surgery or obstetrics wards. ENT wards had the lowest mortality rates. Until the second half of 2007, adult ENT wards had a lower surgical index, higher complexity of cases, and longer average length of stay than pediatric ENT wards (P < 0. 001, t-test). After 2007, pediatric ENT wards treated more complex cases (P = 0. 004, t -test) that were less surgical in nature; this result was due to the shift from the Health Care Finance Administration classification diagnostic-related group (DRG) system to the Australian Refined DGR system, as well as to improper use of codes. ENT wards in different counties differed in the number of cases, average length of stay, and case mix index. Conclusion Statistics and case mix clinical data may be a good starting point for informing hospital management to assess ENT service coverage, but they should be supplemented with data on hospitalization costs...|$|R
40|$|Background By 2025, it is {{estimated}} that approximately 1. 8 million Australian adults (approximately 8. 4 % of the adult population) will have diabetes, with the majority having type 2 diabetes. Weight management via improved physical activity and diet is the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes management. However, the majority of weight loss trials in diabetes have evaluated short-term, intensive clinic-based interventions that, while producing short-term outcomes, have failed to address issues of maintenance and broad population reach. Telephone-delivered interventions have the potential to address these gaps. Methods/Design Using a two-arm randomised controlled design, this study will evaluate an 18 -month, telephone-delivered, behavioural weight loss intervention focussing on physical activity, diet and behavioural therapy, versus usual care, with follow-up at 24 months. Three-hundred adult participants, aged 20 - 75 years, with type 2 diabetes, will be recruited from 10 general practices via <b>electronic</b> medical <b>records</b> <b>search.</b> The Social-Cognitive Theory driven intervention involves a six-month intensive phase (4 weekly calls and 11 fortnightly calls) and a 12 -month maintenance phase (one call per month). Primary outcomes, assessed at 6, 18 and 24 months, are: weight loss, physical activity, and glycaemic control (HbA 1 c), with weight loss and physical activity also measured at 12 months. Incremental cost-effectiveness will also be examined. Study recruitment began in February 2009, with final data collection expected by February 2013. Discussion This is the first study to evaluate the telephone as the primary method of delivering a behavioural weight loss intervention in type 2 diabetes. The evaluation of maintenance outcomes (6 months following the end of intervention), the use of accelerometers to objectively measure physical activity, and the inclusion of a cost-effectiveness analysis will advance the science of broad reach approaches to weight control and health behaviour change, and will build the evidence base needed to advocate for the translation of this work into population health practice...|$|R
40|$|Central line {{associated}} bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are {{a frequent}} source of health complication for patients of all ages, including for {{patients in the}} pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and Pediatric Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (PCTU). Many hospitals, including the University of Michigan Health System, currently use the International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system when coding for CLABSI. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the accuracy of coding for CLABSI infections with ICD- 9 CM codes in PICU and PCTU patients. A retrospective chart review was conducted for 75 PICU and PCTU patients with 90 events of hospital acquired central line infections at the University of Michigan Health System (from 2007 - 2011). The different variables examined in the chart review included the type of central line the patient had, the duration of the stay of the line, the type of organism infecting the patient, and the treatment the patient received. A review was conducted to assess if patients had received the proper ICD- 9 CM code for their hospital acquired infection. In addition, each patient chart was <b>searched</b> using <b>Electronic</b> Medical <b>Record</b> <b>Search</b> Engine to determine if any phrases that commonly referred to hospital acquired CLABSIs were present in their charts. Our review found that in most CLABSI cases the hospital’s administrative data diagnosis using ICD- 9 CM coding systems did not code for the CLABSI. Our results indicate a low sensitivity of 32 % in the PICU and an even lower sensitivity of 12 % in the PCTU. Using these results, we can conclude that the ICD- 9 CM coding system cannot be used for accurately defining hospital acquired CLABSIs in administrative data. With the new use of the ICD- 10 CM coding system, further research is needed to assess the effects of the ICD- 10 CM coding system on the accuracy of administrative data...|$|R
