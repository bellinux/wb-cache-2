30|$|In this section, we lay {{out some}} key facts on youth {{unemployment}} in Greece {{and place them}} in context. We do this from both a time-series and cross-sectional perspective. Specifically, we use aggregate data from Eurostat publications and micro-data from the 2005 - 2012 European Labour Force Survey to examine trends in unemployment, both in Greece itself and also in comparison with a selection of other European states. For these comparisons, we have selected Spain and Portugal as Southern European countries that, like Greece, have experienced serious monetary disturbances as well as labour market dislocation. Although it is not in Southern Europe, we include the Republic of Ireland for the same reasons. Though having a stable macroeconomic framework in recent years, Sweden has experienced persistently high levels of youth unemployment, especially relative to adult rates, and has also been included. Finally, we add the three largest countries in Europe - Germany, the UK and France - to give a perspective on unemployment trends in the European Union as a whole. These countries also span a variety of experiences during the recession, including wide variations in labour market performance. A referee has pointed out to us that, these eight countries span quite different school-to-work transition patterns: a) France, Greece, Spain, Portugal are the Mediterranean rim; b) Sweden represents the Scandinavian model; c) UK and Ireland represent the Anglo-Saxon model; and <b>d)</b> <b>Germany</b> {{is an example of the}} Central European or Bismarckian model.|$|E
40|$|Background Damage of the {{blood-brain barrier}} and {{invasion}} of immunocompetent cells {{into the central}} nervous system represent key events in the immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride reduces progression of disability and clinical exacerbations in patients with multiple sclerosis. Its precise mode of action is unclear. Objective To investigate the effects of mitoxantrone on the migratory capacity of immunocompetent cells ex vivo and in vitro. Design Case-control study. Setting Department of Neurology, Heinrich Heine University, <b>D,</b> <b>Germany.</b> Participants Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 11 patients with multiple sclerosis before and after intravenous mitoxantrone treatment; PBMCs from 5 healthy control donors were treated with mitoxantrone in vitro. Main Outcome Measures The migratory capacity was studied in an in vitro Boyden chamber assay; cells and their rates of migration were analyzed by light microscopy and flow cytometry. To determine the specificity of our findings, PBMCs were treated with perfosfamide in vitro. Results Mitoxantrone decreased the migratory capacity of CD 14 + monocytes and (to a lesser degree) of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes. These observations were confirmed when control PBMCs were treated with an equivalent dose of mitoxantrone in vitro. Similar effects were seen when PBMCs were preincubated with perfosfamide. The inhibitory effects of mitoxantrone on the migratory capacity of PBMCs were mediated by reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity, as demonstrated by zymography, polymerase chain reaction, and inhibitory studies.

All the samples in buffer were ground by hands, using a plastic pestle. For every sample, a fresh pestle was used to avoid any possible cross contamination of the individual sample. After vortexing for 3 [*]h on a vortex shaker (Spinix; Tarson Products Ltd., India), centrifugation for 1 [*]min (at 10, 000 [*]rpm in microcentrifuge) (Eppendorf AG 5415 <b>D,</b> <b>Germany)</b> and appropriate dilution of supernatants, ELISA was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol. The absorbance of each well solution was recorded at 450 [*]nm by using micro filter plate reader (Thermo Electron Corporation, China). The optical density (OD) value of each calibrator and corresponding concentrations of Cry 1 Ac and Cry 2 Ab (standards provided in the kit) were used to prepare the standard curve. The proteins’ concentration of each sample was determined by finding its OD value and the corresponding concentration level in the linear curve, using regression analysis. The results from standard curve were multiplied by the dilution factor incurred during extraction. To determine the dilution factor, the volume in milliliter of extraction solution was divided by weight of samples in grams. For leaf samples, protein {{concentrations in}} μg g− 1 fresh weight were calculated by multiplying these results by (1 : 10 or 1 : 50) dilutions made for Cry 1 Ac and Cry 2 Ab, respectively.|$|E

30|$|Whereas {{the average}} {{unemployment}} rate in the EU- 27 for the economically active population (25 – 64) is roughly 15 % for individuals with low education (ISCED 5 level 0 – 2), it is much lower (5 %) for high-skilled individuals (ISCED level 5 – 6). This relationship is even stronger for Germany: The unemployment rate for individuals aged 25 to 64 with low education is 14 % and therefore seven times larger compared to highly educated individuals (2 %). Hence, low-educated people in Germany face a much higher risk of joblessness than in other European countries. In 2009, 26 % of the German population aged 25 to 34 had attained a tertiary education level. This share is below the OECD average (37 %) and had only slightly increased since 2002 (OECD, 2011 <b>d).</b> Although <b>Germany</b> has on average a high participation rate in education of individuals aged 15 to 24, it still has to catch up concerning the educational outcomes of pupils – {{when compared to other}} economically strong countries.

The administration of intravenous soy bean oil (SO) {{has been associated with}} the development of liver disease, while the administration of intravenous fish oil (FO) has been associated with the resolution of liver disease. The biochemical mechanism of this differential effect is unclear. This study compares SO and FO lipid emulsions in a murine model of hepatic steatosis, one of the first hits in PN-associated liver disease. We established a murine model of hepatic steatosis in which liver injury is induced by orally feeding mice a PN solution. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were randomized to receive PN alone (a high carbohydrate diet (HCD)), PN plus intravenous FO (Omegaven®; Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg VDH, Germany), PN plus intravenous SO (Intralipid®; Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg v. <b>d.</b> H., <b>Germany,</b> for Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL), or a chow diet. After 19 days, liver tissue was harvested from all animals and subjected to metabolomic profiling. The administration of an oral HCD without lipid induced profound hepatic steatosis. SO was associated with macro- and microvesicular hepatic steatosis, while FO largely prevented the development of steatosis. 321 detectable compounds were identified in the metabolomic analysis. HCD induced de novo fatty acid synthesis and oxidative stress. Both FO and SO relieved some of the metabolic shift towards de novo lipogenesis, but FO offered additional advantages in terms of lipid peroxidation and the generation of inflammatory precursors.

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1982 the Division of Hydrotechnics at the Swedish University of Agricu 1 tural Sciences bought an {{irrigation}} boom from F:a Deier 1 <b>ing,</b> West <b>Germany.</b> The boom, which is a prototype, is 45 m wide and equipped with 17 def 1 ector nozzles. Each nozzle is fitted with a pressure regulator so that the fall in pressure along the boom does not inf 1 uence the flow from the nozzles. The pressure requirement is low; 0. 4 - 0. 5 MPa (40 - 50 m water column) is sufficient as inlet pressure to an irrigator if a boom is used instead of a spray-gun. The water distribution of the boom was determined during a number of days in August, 1982. The distribution of water was uniform, but not as uniform as given by a good spray-gun under ideal conditions (no wind, correct spacing, correct working pressure). On the other hand, neither the spreading pattern of the boom nor the spacing {{are influenced by the}} wind. During the measurements the wind was so strong {{that it would have been}} impossible to irrigate with a spray-gun. In practice the boom spreads water more evenly than a spray-gun. The boom gives a very high mean intensity (ca 100 mm/h) but a German investigation reports that the water is delivered in the form of relatively small drops (d< 1. 6 mm). This implies that the supply will be gentle in comparison with the recurring downpours of the spray-gun. Thus, boom irrigation should be well suited for sensitive crops and soils with weak structure. When the nozzles on the boom were tested on a number of different soils the results were better than expected; surface water formation was negligible or non-existent and only in one case was puddling considerable. The proportion of very small drops is much lower in water from the nozzles on the boom than in water from a spray-gun. Consequently, as the boom spreads the water close to the soil the risk of aerosol formation will be much less than with a spray-gun. This is important when partially cleaned sewage water is used for irrigation. Measurements were also made of the water distribution pattern for individual nozzles and it was calculated that the optimal nozzle spacing was 3. 0 m, which is in good agreement with the 2. 8 m reported for the boom. The nozzles give double overlapping and droplet trajectories with large angles of impact. Because of this, the spreading pattern of the boom is relatively insensitive to variations in the distance to soil surface/crop. As regards labour considerations, the boom is much more complicated than the spray-gun. On account of its working width usually being smaller, the boom requires more frequent moves. With the design of the prototype, each move will, in addition, take longer to accomplish and includes a couple of heavy tasks, provided that it cannot be moved in extended form. By making a number of simple modifications both time and labour can be saved when moving the boom, but it is probably impossible to completely achieve the same flexibility as of the spray-gun. From the energy viewpoint, the boom is clearly superior to the spray-gun. mainly on account of lower working pressure but often also due to more uniform spreading and thus lower water requirement. The saving in energy may sometimes be sufficient to pay for both the boom and extra labour required by the boom. In most cases, however, other advantages of using the boom for irrigation should be considered in assessing whether there is justification in selecting the boom in favour of the spray-gun...|$|R
40|$|Why {{do people}} emigrate?« — {{is one of}} the basic {{questions}} in any mobility study or migration survey; taken usually as a possibility to grip the motives of emigration — staying abroad — and coming back of migrants in contemporary world, this question epitomizes motivation studies in todays migration research. Obtained responses are mainly coded within the push-pull matrix, and within the decision model as well. The output obtained this way could be interpreted both on the level of individuum and on the system level. The present interpretation of »motives« of Yugoslav (Slovene) migrants in West Germany is founded on the research model, based of stratification, decision making and push-pull variables. The research was carried out in Germany (autumn 1974, number of respondents: 954). The basic assumptions of the model are: a) the structure of the individual motives of emigration — staying — returning, could not be the explanatory mean for the migration situation of the whole (Yugoslav) system; b) in order to have the motivation structure explained, individual motives have to be mapped into the decision making matrix both on individual and the system level; c) it is absolutely necessary to test all findings from the migrant population on the population not influenced by migration situation. The present state of the research doesn’t allow to make any conclusion on the basis of assumptions B) and C); nevertheless, the first one is partly tested. The results showed: a) better income and salaries are not as frequent motives for emigration from Slovenia to W. Germany as one could expect; with income being on the third place among the total scope of reasons for emigration, we could argue that Slovene migration is not mainly material-incentives oriented; b) the stratification indicators of emigration were factorized. This enabled us to obtain the basic regulators of the status of migrants before emigrating, we obtained being peasant or not; participating or not in the self management and political organizations; aspirations and possibilities for consumption; and general status of Darents of respondents. c) corresponding regulators for the status of migrants in Germany were obtained as well. They are: consumption level, position within the working hierarchy, conditions of living and life stvle, and total number of year migrant worker spend in <b>Germany.</b> <b>d)</b> correlation coefficients showed: no association between: the level of education and kind of motive for emigration; between motives for emigration and conditions of living (apartment) in Slovenia; between the level of development of the emigrating area and the motives for migration.

Against this background, the acetylene inhibition technique (AIT) applied in laboratory soil and groundwater denitrification assays {{is by far}} the most effective approach. However,this method has been largely criticized, as it is susceptible to underestimate denitrification rates and adds anadditional carbon source to the substrates to be investigated. Here we provide evidence that the AIT is not necessarily an inappropriate approach to measure denitrification,that its reliability depends on the drivers governing the process, and that the 15 N site preference of N 2 O (SP) may serve as a tool to assess this reliability. Two laboratory batch experiments were conducted, where sandyaquifer material and a peat soil were incubated as slurries. We established (i) a standard anaerobic treatment byadding KNO 3 (10 mg N L- 1), (ii) an oxygen treatment by adding KNO 3 and O 2 (5 mg L- 1), and (iii) a glucosetreatment by adding KNO 3 supplemented with glucose (200 mg C L- 1). Both experiments were run under 10 %(v/v) acetylene atmosphere and as 15 N tracer treatments using labeled K 15 NO 3 (60 atom % 15 N). In the case of the standard anaerobic treatments, we found a very good agreement of denitrification potentialobtained by the AIT and 15 N tracer methods. SP of N 2 O of the AIT samples from this treatment ranged between- 4. 8 and 2. 6 h which is indicative for N 2 O production during bacterial denitrification but not for N 2 O reductionto N 2. In contrast, we observed substantial underestimation of denitrification by AIT for the glucose treatmentscompared to the 15 N method, i. e. denitrification was underestimated by 36 % (sandy aquifer material) and 47 %(peat soil). SP of N 2 O of the AIT samples from this treatment ranged between 4. 5 and 9. 6 h which suggestsoccurrence of bacterial N 2 O reduction. In the case of the oxygen treatments, we observed a very good agreementof denitrification potential obtained by the AIT and 15 N tracer methods for the aquifer material, but a significantunderestimation of 20 % in the AIT samples of the peat soil. The 15 N site preference of N 2 O again mirrored thisand ranged between - 1. 2 and - 3. 5 h(aquifer material) and 5. 5 and 11. 0 (peat soil), respectively. We conclude that the AIT can act as a reliable method in laboratory soil and groundwater bacterial denitrificationassays, but our results suggest that this relies on substrate types and incubation conditions. Additional measurementsof SP have potential to assess AIT efficacy and can help to reduce parallel time-consuming and expensive 15 N tracer experiments...|$|R
