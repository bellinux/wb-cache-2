50|$|Ketazolam {{breaks down}} in the blood to {{diazepam}} which breaks down to <b>demoxepam</b> which breaks down to desmethyldiazepam.|$|E
50|$|<b>Demoxepam</b> {{is a drug}} {{which is}} a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. It is a metabolite of chlordiazepoxide and has anticonvulsant properties and presumably other characteristic benzodiazepine properties.|$|E
50|$|The lactam moiety in benzodiazepams {{is active}} towards nucleophiles and {{numerous}} analogues {{have been made}} by exploiting this fact.For example, heating <b>demoxepam</b> with N-cyclopropylmethylamine leads to amidine formation, the minor tranquilizer cyprazepam.|$|E
50|$|<b>Demoxepam</b> {{is also an}} {{intermediate}} in the synthesis of oxazepam; it is also used {{in one of the}} syntheses of medazepam. It can be considered directly analogous/synonoymous with the synthesis of chlordiazepoxide, with the exception that instead of methylamine, hydroxide ion is the choice of base; here acid is not used for the cyclodehydration step though.|$|E
40|$|The delay {{that occurs}} between {{specimen}} acquisition and analysis in clinical and forensic toxicology requires the establishment that no changes in drug concentration have occurred during this timed interval. In this research, severai groups of common drugs were examined for stability in serum, blood and tissues {{at room temperature}} and at 4 °C. Specifically, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, lidocaine, procainamide and nortriptyline were studied. Decreases {{were found in the}} following drugs: chlordiazepoxide, norchlordiazepoxide, <b>demoxepam,</b> and nitrazepam. No changes were found in the other drugs. More detailed work was performed on chlordiazepoxide (CDP). Two breakdown products, <b>demoxepam</b> and nordiazepam (ND) were identified and quantitated. A series of experiments at various pH 2 ̆ 7 s in the presence and absence of fluoride/oxalate (F-/C 2 O 2 =) were undertaken to examine chemical and microorganism effects on CDP breakdown in blood and buffer. At pH 5, the rate of CDP breakdown was the same in blood and buffer and no nordiazepam was formed in either medium. This was determined by comparing the slopes of ln(CDP) vs. time for each condition; the slopes were about -. 06 for each. All slopes are in (days) - 1. At pH 6. 5 and pH 8, in the absence of F-/C 2 O 2 =, CDP was less stable in blood than buffer (slopes of -. 13 and -. 27 versus -. 036 and -. 039) and ND was formed in the blood. At these pH 2 ̆ 7 s, F-/C 2 O 2 = stabilized CDP in blood such that it was more stable than buffer (slopes of -. 0047 and -. 0066 versus -. 038 and -. 036) ...|$|E
40|$|Leflunomide is a disease-modifying {{antirheumatic}} drug, {{which is}} bioactivated by fort-nation of A 77 1726. In this study a rapid and simple quantitative assay using a reversed phase HPLC-UV method is validated for detection of A 77 1726 in human serum. The HPLC-UV method uses a mobile phase consisting of methanol and a KH 2 PO 4 -buffer (45 mM, pH = 3) (50 : 50,v/v), at a flow rate of I mL/min. A 77 1726 is detected by UV-absorption at 295 nm with a retention time of 8. 9 min. <b>Demoxepam</b> {{is used as}} internal standard. Validation showed lower and upper limits of quantitation of 0. 5 and 100 mg/L, respectively. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 0. 5 - 100 mg/L (r(2) > 0. 999). Intra- and inter-day precision showed coefficients of variation within 15 % over the complete concentration range; accuracy was within 8 %. Commonly prescribed drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis like disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, analgesics and corticosteroids, and their main metabolites, are separated from A 77 1726 with a resolution > 2. Serum levels of A 77 1726 in 37 patients on leflunomide therapy were determined using this HPLC-UV method. Measured serum A 77 1726 serum concentrations in patient samples showed large variability {{with a range of}} 3 - 176 mg/L. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect on}} some clinical chemical as-says of adding chlordiazepoxide or its two metabolites, the lactam and the N-desmethylchlordiazepoxide, to serum or urine. We also {{examined the}} effect on urinary steroid values of administering the drug {{for as long as}} 20 days. The drug, in 10 -fold the expected concentra-tions in blood, or its metabohites, in 200 -fold the expect-ed Concentration in blood, had no significant effect on serum values for aspartate aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase activities, values for bihirubin, albumin, or total protein, or on the electrophoretic pattern for serum proteins. Although values for urinary 17 -hydroxycortico-steroids were slightly increased in addition experiments, we saw no effect of actual administration of the drug on values for either 17 -hydroxycorticosteroids or 17 -keto-steroids in urine. AdditIonal Keyphrases: <b>demoxepam</b> #{ 149 }N-desmethylch!ordi-azepoxide #{ 149 }Librium #{ 149 }“kit ” methods Drug interference with clinical chemical procedures has recently begun to receive wide attention. Among such drugs is chlordiazepoxide (1), which reportedly produces increased values for the apparent activity of aspartate ami-notransferase and alkaline phosphatase and for the concen-tration of bilirubin in serum (2). It is also reported to in-crease the apparent values for 1 7 -hydroxycorticosteroids and to lower those for 17 -ketosteroids, whether the drug has been taken by the subject or is added to the sample (3). Here, our purpose was to determine whether these re-sults could be confirmed and, if so, whether chlordiazepox-ide and (or) its metabolites interfere directly with the chemical analysis or whether these compounds cause physi...|$|E
