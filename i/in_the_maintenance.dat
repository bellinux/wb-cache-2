40|$|We {{consider}} the single machine scheduling problem with job-dependent machine deterioration. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> problem, {{we are given}} a single machine with an initial non-negative maintenance level, {{and a set of}} jobs each with a non-preemptive processing time and a machine deterioration. Such a machine deterioration quantifies <b>the</b> decrement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> machine <b>maintenance</b> level after processing the job. To avoid machine breakdown, one should guarantee a non-negative maintenance level at any time point; and whenever necessary, a maintenance activity must be allocated for restoring <b>the</b> machine <b>maintenance</b> level. <b>The</b> goal of the problem is to schedule the jobs and <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities such that the total completion time of jobs is minimized. There are two variants of <b>maintenance</b> activities: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> partial <b>maintenance</b> case each activity can be allocated to increase <b>the</b> machine <b>maintenance</b> level to any level not exceeding <b>the</b> maximum; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full <b>maintenance</b> case every activity must be allocated to increase <b>the</b> machine <b>maintenance</b> level to <b>the</b> maximum. <b>In</b> a recent work, <b>the</b> problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> full <b>maintenance</b> case has been proven NP-hard; several special cases of <b>the</b> problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> partial <b>maintenance</b> case were shown solvable in polynomial time, but the complexity of the general problem is left open. In this paper we first prove that <b>the</b> problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> partial <b>maintenance</b> case is NP-hard, thus settling the open problem; we then design a 2 -approximation algorithm...|$|R

5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act on any heritable phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this does not imply that natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
5|$|Components of the RNAi pathway {{are used}} in many eukaryotes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the {{organization}} and structure of their genomes. Modification of histones and associated induction of heterochromatin formation serves to downregulate genes pre-transcriptionally; this process {{is referred to as}} RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS), and is carried out by a complex of proteins called the RITS complex. In fission yeast this complex contains argonaute, a chromodomain protein Chp1, and a protein called Tas3 of unknown function. As a consequence, the induction and spread of heterochromatic regions requires the argonaute and RdRP proteins. Indeed, deletion of these genes in the fission yeast S. pombe disrupts histone methylation and centromere formation, causing slow or stalled anaphase during cell division. In some cases, similar processes associated with histone modification have been observed to transcriptionally upregulate genes.|$|E

The stud also organizes events at which to present the breed to the public, including the Normandy Horse Show. The Norman Cob is beginning to be exported to other countries, especially Belgium. In that country, some are bred pure, while others are crossed on the Ardennes to improve the latter's gaits. Approximately 15 horses are exported annually, traveling to Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy for leisure, logging and agricultural uses.|$|E
5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} {{is one of the}} world's most popular welding processes, {{accounting}} for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly dominant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored arc welding has expanded in the construction industry and gas {{metal arc welding}} has become more popular in industrial environments. However, because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability, the process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E
5|$|Complete {{independence}} from British rule was granted on 10 December 1963, with the ZNP/ZPPP coalition as the governing body. The government requested a defence agreement from the United Kingdom, {{asking for a}} battalion of British troops to be stationed on the island for internal security duties, but this was rejected as it was deemed inappropriate for British troops to be involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{of law and order}} so soon after independence. Much of the cabinet which was seeking closer ties with Egypt (ruled by the radical, anti-Western nationalist Nasser) did not want British troops in Zanzibar anyway. British intelligence reports predicted that a civil disturbance, accompanied by increasing communist activity, was likely in the near future and that the arrival of British troops might cause the situation to deteriorate further. However, many foreign nationals remained on the island, including 130 Britons who were direct employees of the Zanzibar government.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{is another}} {{important}} element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow {{two to three times}} faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E

5|$|Ted Serong {{was born}} in the suburb of Abbotsford in Melbourne on 11 November 1915, the first child of William and Mabel Serong. His father was of Portuguese {{heritage}} from the island of Madeira; the family had first settled in Australia in 1824. An apprentice blacksmith, William had served in the Citizens Military Force (CMF) and later the First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) in France during the First World War, before specializing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of weapons and engineering stores, and working for the Department of Defence as a quality control engineer. Serong's younger brother, Raymond, {{was born in}} 1917. William believed in physical fitness and discipline, and he taught both of his sons to box, as well as to scout, shoot rabbits, and live off the land. Between 1930 and 1932, during the Great Depression, the boys lived in the bush for extended periods, relying on their hunting skills to survive.|$|E
5|$|The Antigonid naval fleets docked at Corinth and Chalkis {{during the}} reign of Antigonus II also proved {{instrumental}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of Antigonid-imposed local regimes in various Greek cities. However, the Aetolian League proved to be a perennial problem for Antigonus II's ambitions in controlling central Greece, while the formation of the Achaean League in 251 BC pushed Macedonian forces out of much of the Peloponnese and at times incorporated Athens and Sparta. While the Seleucid Empire aligned with Antigonid Macedonia during the Syrian Wars against Ptolemaic Egypt, the latter used its powerful navy to disrupt Antigonus II's efforts in controlling mainland Greece. With the aid of the Ptolemaic navy, the Athenian statesman Chremonides led a revolt against Macedonian authority known as the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC). However, by 265 BC, Athens was surrounded and besieged by Antigonus II's forces, a Ptolemaic fleet was defeated in the Battle of Cos, and Athens finally surrenderd in 261 BC. After Macedonia formed an alliance with the Seleucid ruler Antiochus II, a peace settlement between Antigonus II and Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt was finally struck in 255 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of habitats {{is a necessary}} step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs, the animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may {{take the form of}} the setting up of national parks, forest reserves and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans with the objective of benefiting wildlife. The laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the {{protection of}} habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar concept has been incorporated into some Australian legislation.|$|E
