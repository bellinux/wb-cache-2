5|$|As {{initially}} conceived, MSR was a short-range {{system for}} tracking Sprint missiles before they {{appeared in the}} MAR's view, as well as offering a secondary target and <b>jammer</b> tracking role. In this initial concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just enough to create tracks to feed back to the MAR. In the anti-jamming role, each MAR and MSR would measure the angle to the <b>jammer.</b>|$|E

Bakharev is then dragged into an air duct and killed. Hansen learns that Kamsky and Bakharev were under orders to make the exocels as {{dangerous}} as possible, which they had succeeded in doing, but without any way to control the resulting creatures. Hansen finds and kills Anischenko, removing his eye and using it to deactivate the radio <b>jammer.</b> Once {{back in touch with}} Bennett, Hansen is told he must find Kamsky's laptop and transmit the exocel research. Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left in a lab, where she is infected by an exocel.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) play {{an important}} role in Cyber Physical Social Sensing (CPSS) systems. An eavesdropping attack is one of the most serious threats to WSNs since it is a prerequisite for other malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel anti-eavesdropping mechanism by introducing friendly <b>jammers</b> to wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In particular, we establish a theoretical framework to evaluate the eavesdropping risk of WSNs with friendly <b>jammers</b> and that of WSNs without <b>jammers.</b> Our theoretical model takes into account various channel conditions such as the path loss and Rayleigh fading, the placement schemes of <b>jammers</b> and the power controlling schemes of <b>jammers.</b> Extensive results show that using <b>jammers</b> in WSNs can effectively reduce the eavesdropping risk. Besides, our results also show that the appropriate placement of <b>jammers</b> and the proper assignment of emitting power of <b>jammers</b> can not only mitigate the eavesdropping risk but also may have no significant impairment to the legitimate communications...|$|R

5|$|In a {{move against}} the insurgency, the Cylons decide {{to have the}} NCP arrest 200 civilians {{they believe to be}} {{affiliated}} with the resistance. Headed by <b>Jammer</b> (Dominic Zamprogna), a former Galactica deckhand and resistance fighter, most of the arrests take place during the night. Those being arrested include Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch) and Cally Henderson Tyrol (Nicki Clyne). Learning of Cally's arrest, <b>Jammer</b> attempts to get her released by Boomer, but Boomer is unable to help. After another suicide bombing at a power station, the Cylons decide to have the prisoners executed, but require President Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) signature. When he refuses to sign, an Aaron Doral (Matthew Bennett) copy forces him to at gunpoint. Caprica-Six (Tricia Helfer) attempts to stop him, but Doral shoots her in the head. Baltar signs the document. Meanwhile, Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon) learns from Cavil (Dean Stockwell) that he only released her husband Saul (Michael Hogan) because the Cylons know he is leading the resistance. He informs Ellen that unless she tells the Cylons where the resistance leaders will be meeting next, he will imprison Saul once more. Reluctantly, Ellen discovers where the resistance plans to meet with members from the colonial fleet.|$|E

During the conflict Izana Kunagiri, Machina's older brother, is killed while on a mission for Class Zero. This event later creates a rift between Machina and Class Zero. Coordinated by Kurasame and Arecia Al-Rashia, Class Zero {{plays a key role in}} freeing Rubrum's territories and launching counterattacks in alliance with Concordia, while Lorica's capital is destroyed by a Militesi bomb. Andoria, Concordia's queen, then forces a ceasefire between the remaining nations. During peace talks in the Militesi capital, Class Zero is framed for Andoria's murder, resulting in Concordia's puppet government and Milites launching a united assault on Rubrum. During their flight, Machina storms off after clashing with Class Zero, and becomes a White Tiger l'Cie to protect Rem from his brother's fate before returning to them.

5|$|Because the Sprint was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during {{the initial stages of}} the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar <b>jammer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because these <b>jammers</b> {{focus on}} {{blocking}} light emitted from laser guns, and not radio waves from radar guns, US federal laws prohibiting {{the use of}} radar <b>jammers</b> {{do not apply to}} these devices. While the U.S. Federal Communications Commission regulates transmission of radio waves, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates light emissions. However, several states have passed laws that specifically prohibit the use of laser <b>jammers,</b> including: California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. The legality of laser <b>jammers</b> in Nebraska and Washington, D.C. is disputed.|$|R

30|$|With time-cooperative jamming, {{the number}} of <b>jammers</b> and their power can both {{influence}} the probabilities of CFAR detectors. The detection probabilities of the detectors both decrease as the number and power of <b>jammers</b> increase. When the target is just {{at the center of}} the cover corridor (the azimuth angle reaches 60 Â° in the example shown in this paper), the detection probability of the detector drops rapidly. For time-cooperative jamming, the length of the cover corridor can be increased by increasing {{the number of}} <b>jammers.</b> If the length of the cover corridor is fixed, in the interest of conserving resources, the number of <b>jammers</b> should be ceil(Î¸a/Î¸i 0.5).|$|R

Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites, as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor's role; for example, the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar. The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems, including a passive radar warning receiver, a metric radar <b>jammer</b> and communications jamming equipment. Streamlined fairings on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff/flares were also new additions. While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar, neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet.|$|E

40|$|AbstractâThe task of {{detecting}} and mitigating Cognitive Radios (CRs) operating as constant <b>jammers</b> in a Cognitive Radio network (CRN) {{can be very}} daunting. The CR constant <b>jammers</b> prey on the adaptable functionalities of CRN so as to cause serious denial {{of service to the}} users of the network. In addition, these <b>jammers</b> are capable of introducing value faults in pathological cases as a result of being able to manipulate transmitted data. In previous research, we have investigated the performance of CRNs operating in the presence of jamming attacks that are capable of introducing value faults. The results obtained show that CR constant <b>jammers</b> are very effective in their operations and they are capable of bringing down the entire CRN when their jamming rate is just about 30 %.
