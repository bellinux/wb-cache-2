40|$|In heavy <b>ion</b> <b>collision</b> {{simulations}} many hadron states and/or parton {{degrees of}} freedom are included {{in order to obtain}} the observables. Meson spectroscopy, for example, considers the 0 ^++ meson as a mixture of qq̅ and glue. This fact is usually not considered in heavy <b>ion</b> <b>collision</b> physics. In the present work we consider two extreme possibilities for the constitution of the 0 ^++ meson, either as a pure glueball or as qq̅-meson. The scattering amplitude and cross-sections with constituent interchange are determined for the two situations. The comparison showed that the glueball-glueball elastic scattering cross-section for a color singlet state is between one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding qq̅ state. The 2 ^++ glueball-glueball interaction is also evaluated with similar behavior.

40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of {{quark gluon plasma}} (QGP) formed {{at a very early}} stage just after the heavy <b>ion</b> <b>collision</b> is {{obtained}} by using a holographic dual model for the heavy <b>ion</b> <b>collision.</b> In this dual model colliding ions are described by the charged shock gravitational waves. Points on the phase diagram correspond to the QGP or hadronic matter with given temperatures and chemical potentials. The phase of QGP in dual terms is related to the case when the collision of shock waves leads to formation of trapped surface. Hadronic matter and other confined states correspond to the absence of trapped surface after collision. Multiplicity of the <b>ion</b> <b>collision</b> process is estimated in the dual language as area of the trapped surface. We show that a non-zero chemical potential reduces the multiplicity.
