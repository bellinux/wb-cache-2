40|$|The {{conformation}} energies for monohydrated associates M. H 20, where M {{stands for}} oxirane, aziridine, oxaziridine and cyclopropene, {{have been obtained}} by using an electrostatic method, tested in a preceding paper, which relies on SCF molecular potentials calculated exactly. Stable associates {{have been found in}} the <b>heterogroup</b> region as well as near the bent bonds (single or double). A discussion is made on the errors in calculating thermodynamic properties for such associates in gas phase by using a priori calculations. As a numerical example the free energy change in the association process is compared for two monohydrated associates of aziridine...|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} molecular simulation {{study of the}} coadsorption of CO 2 and CH 4 in porous carbons is reported. We address the effect of surface chemistry by considering a numerical model of disordered porous carbons which has been modified to include heterochemistry (with a chemical composition consistent {{with that of the}} experimental sample). We discuss how realistic the numerical sample is by comparing its pore size distribution (PSD), specific surface area, porous volume, and porosity with those for the experimental sample. We also discuss the different criteria used to estimate the latter properties from a geometrical analysis. We demonstrate the ability of the MP method to estimate PSD of porous carbons from nitrogen adsorption isotherms. Both the experimental and simulated coadsorption isotherms resemble those obtained for pure gases (type I in the IUPAC classification). On the other hand, only the porous carbon including the <b>heterogroups</b> allows simulating quantitatively the selectivity of the experimental adsorbent for different carbon dioxide/methane mixtures. This result shows that taking into account the heterochemistry present in porous carbons is crucial to represent correctly adsorption selectivities in such hydrophobic samples. We also show that the adsorbed solution theory describes quantitatively the simulated and experimental coadsorption isotherms without any parameter adjustment...|$|R
