2500|$|The {{argument}} of Law and the Unionists between 1912 and 1914 {{was based on}} three complaints. Firstly, Ulster would never accept forced Home Rule, and made up a quarter of Ireland; if the Liberals wanted to force this issue, military force {{would be the only}} way. Law thundered that [...] "Do you plan to hurl the full majesty and power of the law, supported on the bayonets of the British Army, against a million Ulstermen marching under the Union Flag and singing 'God Save The King'? Would the Army hold? Would the British people– would the Crown– stand for such a slaughter?". A second complaint was that the government had so far refused to submit it to a general election, as Law had been suggesting since 1910. Law warned that [...] "you will not carry this Bill without submitting it to the people of this country, and, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> attempt, you will succeed only in breaking our Parliamentary machine". The third complaint was that the Liberals had still not honoured the preamble of the Parliament Act 1911, which promised [...] "to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of a hereditary basis". The Unionist argument was that the Liberals were trying to make a massive constitutional change while the constitution was suspended.|$|E

5000|$|Common {{explains}} that [...] "Finding Forever really means {{to find a}} place in music where you can exist forever.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Polly, slowly, [...] "I {{just try}} to {{look on the bright}} side of things; that helps one amazingly. Why, you 've no idea how much {{goodness}} and sunshine you can get out of the most unpromising things, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> best of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> effort, and I am {{sure you}} will.

6000|$|... "That won't suit me, Porter. You'll {{have to do}} better. I'll {{give each}} of you just a week--one week, understand? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>make</b> <b>the</b> lessons up in that time I'll have to drop you to the next lower class." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Tis vexatious, truly," [...] said Katherine, [...] "that all my well-concerted schemes {{in behalf}} of this wayward pair should be {{frustrated}} by their own willful conduct!

5000|$|As far as Levine is concerned, {{that is the}} {{function}} of a producer. “To me,” he says, “It’s about framing the artist properly. I guess {{it goes back to}} my early days as an arranger.

6000|$|... 'Only {{listen to}} me for a moment,' {{interrupted}} Ralph, seriously alarmed by the violence of her emotions. 'I didn't know it would be so; it was impossible for me to foresee it.

"I do, though; and, what is more," [...] {{says the}} Marquess, {{in a terrible}} voice, [...] "if you do not {{instantly}} lay yourself flat on the ground, with your face towards it, and your hands crossed over your back, or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> slightest noise or cry, I will stick this poisoned dagger between your ribs, as sure as my name is Cartouche?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Anteek, I'm {{going to}} send you away, and will expect you to be quick and act like a man. Drive the sledge back to where we killed the walrus. Let the men pack the meat on it and away back to our igloes. It is not far. You will soon get there <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> dogs yelp. When you have arrived, and told your story, get a fresh team of dogs, and two men, and come back here with a little meat and some more bearskins--and do it all, boy, as fast as you can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{of course}} you mustn't say anything," [...] commented Veronica. [...] "Oh, no! If they do {{something}} silly and you just point it out to them, then {{there is always a}} reason for it that you wouldn't understand. Oh, yes! And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> just <b>the</b> slightest mistake, like what is natural to all of us, that is because you are wicked and unfeeling and don't want to be anything else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is worth}} more than that," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "I will give you half a dollar <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> all <b>the</b> {{arrangements}} and get me safe to Lucerne without my having any care or trouble. But then <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get into difficulty in any case, and have to appeal to me, you lose your whole pay. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> carry me through, I give you half a dollar. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't really carry me through, you have nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Dick {{heard of}} this, however, {{he shook his}} head. [...] "Don't go back yet," [...] he pleaded. [...] "See <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>make</b> out <b>the</b> Flyaway somewhere. She won't dare to sail very far without a light." ...|$|R
60|$|There are {{two kinds}} of dupe: one kind, the commonest, goes on believing in its deceiver, no matter what happens; the other, far rarer, has the sense to know it has been deceived <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> {{deception}} as clear as day to it. Mrs. Evelegh was, fortunately, of the rarer class. Next morning, Dr. Fortescue-Langley arrived, by appointment. As he walked up the path, I glanced at him from my window. It was the Count, not a doubt of it. On his way to gull his dupes in Switzerland, he had tried to throw in an incidental trifle of a diamond robbery.|$|E
60|$|What I {{want is for}} you to {{threaten}} the Virginia Central Railroad and canal in the manner your judgment tells you is best, holding yourself ready to advance, if the enemy draw off their forces. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> enemy hold a force equal to your own for the protection of those thoroughfares, it will accomplish nearly as much as their destruction. If you cannot do this, then {{the next best thing to}} do is to send here all the force you can. I deem a good cavalry force necessary for your offensive, as well as defensive operations. You need not therefore send here more than one division of cavalry.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is it to lead to?' he corrected, with a mimicry of Wilmet's tone. 'That depends. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> explosion, I {{shall have}} {{to rise to the}} occasion--keep the slip-knot ready and patent, and as soon as I get my head above water, have a wife and family on my back to keep me down, and hinder me from coming to your rescue. If not--why, it will take its chance, and we shall have a {{reasonable}} chance of trying whether we get tired of one another--the best thing that could happen to us, by the by--though she is such a saucy little darling, that were that picture of mine painted, I should be fool enough to marry her to-morrow.' ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I don't like {{unnecessary}} class distinctions. The Americans waste no time on them. They don't {{care who}} your father was. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> it to <b>the</b> top {{and it comes}} out that your father made moonshine in Tennessee they admire you even more.

6000|$|... "Yes, Baas, I {{have been}} drinking," [...] {{answered}} the dwarf humbly; [...] "it is well to drink before one dies, since {{we may not}} drink afterwards and I think that the hour of death is at hand.
