5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration,</b> ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E

The relative advantages of <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration,</b> vertical integration, diversification, franchises, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and organic growth were discussed. Other research indicated that a low market share strategy could still be very profitable. Schumacher (1973), Woo and Cooper (1982), Levenson (1984), and later Traverso (2002) showed how smaller niche players obtained very high returns.|$|E
30|$|Similarly the <b>horizontal</b> <b>integrations</b> can be {{motivated}} by a defensive strategy (1 b) which may consists of: (i) preventing being taken-over; (ii) preventing the target from being taken over by others; (iii) avoiding other merged entities in the industry from becoming too strong [19]. Referring to the logistics sector, that {{is the goal of}} the present paper, we can state that the competitive considerations play a crucial role within the horizontal strategies and a relevant role in the vertical ones (Table  2).|$|R

Cost efficiency is estimated by using panel data approaches to relax the assumptions for the hospital effects imposed in earlier studies. The paper shows that higher managed care penetration over time is associated with greater hospital efficiency, and higher market concentration is positively associated with efficiency when markets are highly competitive or highly concentrated...|$|R

25|$|In total, Whole Foods Market is {{composed}} of seventeen companies, each specializing in a different product. In the 1990s, while new stores were being opened, other natural food chain stores were being acquired for <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration.</b> This led to the Federal Trade Commission challenging the eventual merger with Wild Oats {{on the basis that}} it violated antitrust laws, essentially eliminating competition and inflating prices in the health foods market.|$|E
25|$|Delta IV CBCs are {{assembled}} at ULA's {{factory in}} Decatur, Alabama. They are then loaded onto the M/V Delta Mariner, a roll-on/roll-off cargo vessel, {{and shipped to}} either launch pad. There, they are offloaded and rolled into a <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Integration</b> Facility (HIF), where they are mated with the second stages, which were shipped separately to the pad on the Delta Mariner. Also, in the HIF, the three CBCs of Heavy variant are mated to each other.|$|E

It is a large building that allows the Delta IV CBCs and second stages to be mated and tested before they are moved to the pad. The horizontal rocket assembly of the Delta IV are similar to the ones with the assembly of Soyuz launch vehicles; they are also assembled horizontally, unlike the Space Shuttles, the past Saturn launch vehicles and the upcoming Space Launch System, where they are assembled and rolled out to the launch pad entirely vertically.|$|E
30|$|As {{concerns}} {{access to}} technologies, a firm looking {{to increase its}} scope of operations into new markets, characterised by advanced technologies, considers internal growth versus external growth through M&A. In this perspective, M&A in comparison to internal growth offers the advantage to the firm of providing a quick access to new technologies using proven know-how, rather than to set up ‘ex-novo’ new activities (greenfield) or do own R&D. As concerns the logistics industry, {{it is well known}} that the vast majority of logistics firms are small and medium sized enterprises (SME), which, by definition, tend to lag behind in implementation of information and communication technology (ICT) systems [20]. The study carried out by Cruijssen et al. [9] shows that ICT is mainly an issue for <b>horizontal</b> <b>integrations</b> of a medium intensity. Low intensity initiatives often do not require specific ICT investments and high intensity initiatives generate sufficient revenue to pay back the required ICT investments. Therefore, we can state that access to technologies is one of the main motives driving <b>horizontal</b> logistics <b>integrations,</b> but it can be also relevant in the other two strategies (Table  2).|$|R

This was not the case twenty years ago. The initial <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> and the vertical integration that arose in this industry resulted in numerous issues, including issues of environmental disparity, loss of work, pollution, animal rights, and overall general public health. The most remarkable example of swine CAFO monopoly is found in the United States, where in 2001, 50 producers had control over 70% of total pork production. In 2001, the biggest CAFO had just over 710,000 sows.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the vehicle}} is a Launch Table, with six Tail Service Masts (TSMs), two for each CBC.

The vehicle is mounted to the Launch Table by a Launch Mate Unit (LMU), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle by bolts that sever at launch. Behind the Launch Table is a Fixed Pad Erector (FPE), which uses two long-stroke hydraulic pistons to raise the vehicle to the vertical position after being rolled to the pad from the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Integration</b> Facility (HIF). Beneath the Launch Table is a flame duct, which deflects the rocket's exhaust away from the rocket or facilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{consolidation}} was {{a result}} of the Geddes Report, published in 1966, and the subsequent Shipbuilding Industry Act 1967 (sponsored by the Minister of Technology, then Anthony Wedgwood Benn) which recommended rationalisation and <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> of shipbuilding in the United Kingdom into large regional groups, aided with grants from the state Shipbuilding Industry Board, in order to achieve economies of scale and better compete in the market for increasingly large merchant vessels like VLCCs. The creation of these groupings included Scott Lithgow on the Lower Clyde, Swan Hunter on Tyneside and Robb Caledon on the east coast of Scotland. The government had a 48.4% minority holding in the consortium and provided a £5.5m interest-free government loan over the first three years. UCS had a combined order book at the time worth £87m.|$|E

25|$|Z-Link and Kaza both pride {{themselves}} on <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> of their in-house management, where the artists are given full control over all steps of the publication of their product – from creation, to editing, publishing and distribution. Z-Link goes even further, working to foster new talent until it can gain a truly public following: traditional calls for submission are supplemented by scouting of unpublished works on blogs, Facebook pages and other collective platforms used by fan communities online. Aspiring artists are encouraged {{to reach out to}} an audience, so that budding amateurs, who previously created for friends, can develop a wider fanbase and become published artists. Typically, new artists first publish short installments in Z-Link's monthly manga and gaming magazine, Laabstore, before being commissioned to produce a small print run (500–1,000 copies) of an independent volume. This structure permits Z-Link to reconfigure the traditional publishing channels and capitalize on its position between conventional publication and self-production. It provides the infrastructure for autonomous artists to achieve local print runs at a reasonable cost. Since their creation, Z-Link and Kaza have developed an enthusiastic and loyal following. Their catalogs, however, remain limited in number and difficult to procure, as the works are still distributed through a capillary network including a few bookstores in Algiers, Oran and Constantine.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article re-conceptualizes Climate Policy Integration (CPI) in {{the land}} use sector to {{highlight}} the need to assess the level of integration of mitigation and adaptation objectives and policies to minimize trade-offs and to exploit synergies. It suggests that effective CPI {{in the land}} use sector requires i) internal climate policy coherence between mitigation and adaptation objectives and policies; ii) external climate policy coherence between climate change and development objectives; iii) vertical policy integration to mainstream climate change into sectoral policies and; iv) <b>horizontal</b> policy <b>integration</b> by overarching governance structures for cross-sectoral coordination. This framework is used to examine CPI in the land use sector of Indonesia. The findings indicate that adaptation actors and policies are the main advocates of internal policy coherence. External policy coherence between mitigation and development planning is called for, but remains to be operationalized. Bureaucratic politics has in turn undermined vertical and <b>horizontal</b> policy <b>integration.</b> Under these circumstances {{it is unlikely that}} the Indonesian bureaucracy can deliver strong coordinated action addressing climate change in the land use sector, unless sectoral ministries internalize a strong mandate on internal and external climate policy coherence and find ways to coordinate policy action effectively...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to the ongoing discussion on <b>horizontal</b> vs. vertical <b>integration</b> as further development path in the financial security service industry, consisting of trading, clearing and settlement. Using a stylized model of the industry we investigate the incentives to vertically or horizontal integrate from the individual firm's point of view as well as its consequences on competition and welfare. Our analysis reveals that the incentives to vertically integrate crucially depend on industry and market characteristics such as the degree of differentiation and integration of trading platforms as well as the role liquidity effects play for traders. Furthermore, we show that market forces may suffer from a coordination problem resulting from historical conditions and ending in vertically integrated structures which are not {{in the interest of the}} firms.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} project {{seeks to}} understand {{when and how}} do national judges play an active and significant role in how international legal orders do or do not affect their polities. Specifically, I look at when and how British judges {{play a role in}} how European Union law through the European Court of Justice and European human rights law through the European Court of Human Rights affect the British polity. These international legal orders contain both vertical and horizontal aspects. Vertical aspects include the highest court and its judges defined by the treaty, which operates as the international, hierarchical authority on the treaty and is tasked with ensuring the compliance of the member states of the treaty. Horizontal aspects include member state courts and judges who interact with other member state courts and judges as equals voluntarily to share an understanding of the law. Britain is interesting because it may seem like a counterintuitive place to find such dynamics. Britain has a strong resistance to international authority, a deeply entrenched idea of Parliamentary Supremacy, and a dualist legal tradition where Parliament translates international law into domestic law prior to its use by the courts, which contributes to a lack of expectation of British judges engaging in international judicial activism, making Britain a hard case. In this context, we should expect that international law only matters to the extent that domestic actors are forced to incorporate it by a strong international legal order with vertical supremacy and unambiguous authority. To the contrary, my dissertation shows that British judges are quite active in many international legal orders in ways that do not merely reflect the degree of established vertical legal authority. Through dynamics that are quite autonomous from British politicians' difficult interactions with international authority, British judges play a very active role in managing and integrating international law into British politics. To see these dynamics and understand how international law has affected British politics, we must pay special attention to <b>horizontal</b> legal <b>integration.</b> <b>Horizontal</b> legal <b>integration</b> occurs when judges intentionally and selectively borrow legal concepts and precedents from other national or international jurisdictions...|$|R
