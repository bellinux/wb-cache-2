40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} the sociocultural learning of 40 second year students in a Bachelor of Arts in English-as-an-additional-language (EAL) program in Auckland, New Zealand. These learners participated in a teaching and learning intervention involving <b>journalized</b> community placement. The study illustrates how reflective journals can be used as a vibrant teaching, learning, and assessment tool, enabling students to make connections with the culture of their host country, to reflect on their experiences of language socialization, and to become aware of their own investments. Students from the four categories of EAL learner (immigrants, international students, study-abroad students, and refugees) participated in a real-world community/workplace writing reflective diaries recording their observations and interactions. Qualitative analysis using discourse positioning reveals students describing themselves in relation to themes of changing perceptions of English abilities, changing identities relative to the host culture, and participation as socialization. The article concludes that writing reflective journals helps learners to evaluate how far they have come as learners and citizens and to find spaces for the enhancement of human possibility (Norton, 2000). The practical pedagogical implication of the study is that combined with journaling, community placements contribute to a positive, future-focused 'pedagogy for authentic being' (Barnett, 2004) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background High {{throughput}} {{gene expression}} profiling (GEP) {{is becoming a}} routine technique in life science laboratories. With experimental designs that repeatedly span thousands of genes and hundreds of samples, relying on a dedicated database infrastructure {{is no longer an}} option. GEP technology is a fast moving target, with new approaches constantly broadening the field diversity. This technology heterogeneity, compounded by the informatics complexity of GEP databases, means that software developments have so far focused on mainstream techniques, leaving less typical yet established techniques such as Nylon microarrays at best partially supported. Results MAF (MicroArray Facility) is the laboratory database system we have developed for managing the design, production and hybridization of spotted microarrays. Although it can support the widely used glass microarrays and oligo-chips, MAF was designed with the specific idiosyncrasies of Nylon based microarrays in mind. Notably single channel radioactive probes, microarray stripping and reuse, vector control hybridizations and spike-in controls are all natively supported by the software suite. MicroArray Facility is MIAME supportive and dynamically provides feedback on missing annotations to help users estimate effective MIAME compliance. Genomic data such as clone identifiers and gene symbols are also directly annotated by MAF software using standard public resources. The MAGE-ML data format is implemented for full data export. <b>Journalized</b> database operations (audit tracking), data anonymization, material traceability and user/project level confidentiality policies are also managed by MAF. Conclusion MicroArray Facility is a complete data management system for microarray producers and end-users. Particular care has been devoted to adequately model Nylon based microarrays. The MAF system, developed and implemented in both private and academic environments, has proved a robust solution for shared facilities and industry service providers alike. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Anesthesia-related {{deaths are}} common in dogs, {{especially}} in the postoperative period, in compare to humans. This study aims to describe and elucidate the qualities of the postoperative care for dogs in Sweden. Method To investigate the postoperative care, a qualitative study was made by interviewing personnel in the animal health care sector. The primary information from the interviews was analyzed in a qualitative manor and a few distinguished qualities came forth. Results These qualities describe the postoperative care and include preventive activities, postoperative activities, monitoring and communication. A variation {{in regards to the}} results was seen between the interviewed. As for preventive activities some arrangements as prevention of hypothermia were carried out though not by all according to the interviewed. Postoperative activities were the quality that involved the most activities, though the information from the interviewed differed greatly. Warming, pain evaluation, nutrition, elimination, environment, protection of wound, resources, wellbeing of the patient and administration of oxygen were subjects that were included in the postoperative activities. Monitoring postoperatively was based on visual, manual and electric monitoring. Communication was considered important in the animal health care team and consisted of communication between animal health care personnel to animal owners, between people in the animal health care team, cooperation and to <b>journalize.</b> Conclusion The postoperative care as seen from the results from this study indicates a difference in execution between animal hospitals. Lack of resources, such as time and personnel, hinders development and a good performance. Many actions executed in the postoperative care are beneficial to the patient but the difference in routines and actions between animal hospitals and veterinary clinics are creating a situation where the quality of the postoperative care differs depending on the hospital. To enable a change of the current situation education of personnel could help develop good routines and actions. To build the foundation of care for the patients on scientifically proven information could also aid animal hospitals to create a better environment and postoperative care for the patients...|$|R
6000|$|... "Septimius Felton" [...] was the {{outgrowth}} of a project, formed by Hawthorne during his residence in England, {{of writing a}} romance, the scene of which should be laid in that country; but this project was afterwards abandoned, giving place to a new conception in which the visionary search for means to secure an earthly immortality was to form the principal interest. The new conception took shape in the uncompleted [...] "Dolliver Romance." [...] The two themes, of course, were distinct, but, by a curious process of thought, one grew directly out of the other: the whole history constitutes, in fact, a chapter {{in what may be}} called the genealogy of a romance. There remained, after [...] "Septimius Felton" [...] had been published, certain manuscripts connected with the scheme of an English story. One of these manuscripts was written {{in the form of a}} <b>journalized</b> narrative; the author merely noting the date of what he wrote, as he went along. The other was a more extended sketch of much greater bulk, and without date, but probably produced several years later. It was not originally intended by those who at the time had charge of Hawthorne's papers that either of these incomplete writings should be laid before the public; because they manifestly had not been left by him in a form which he would have considered as warranting such a course. But since the second and larger manuscript has been published under the title of [...] "Dr. Grimshawe's Secret," [...] it has been thought best to issue the present sketch, so that the two documents may be examined together. Their appearance places in the hands of readers the entire process of development leading to the [...] "Septimius" [...] and [...] "The Dolliver Romance."

6000|$|Among {{the other}} pursuits of Richard, {{he had a}} passion to keep a {{register}} of all passing events; and his diary, which {{was written in the}} manner of a journal, or log. book, embraced not only such circumstances as affected himself, but observations on the weather, and all the occurrences of the family, and frequently of the village. Since his appointment to the office of sheriff and his consequent absences from home, he had employed Benjamin to make memoranda on a slate, of whatever might be thought worth remembering, which, on his return, were regularly transferred to the journal with proper notations of the time, manner, and other little particulars. There was, to be sure, one material objection to the clerkship of Benjamin, which the ingenuity of no one but Richard could have overcome. The steward read nothing but his prayer-book, and that only in particular parts, and by the aid of a good deal of spelling, and some misnomers; but he could not form a single letter with a pen. This would have been an insuperable bar to <b>journalizing</b> with most men; but Richard invented a kind of hieroglyphical character, which was intended to note all the ordinary occurrences of a day, such as how the wind blew, whether the sun shone, or whether it rained, the hours, etc. and for the extraordinary, after giving certain elementary lectures on the subject, the sheriff was obliged to trust to the ingenuity of the major-domo. The reader will at once perceive, that it was to this chronicle that Benjamin pointed, instead of directly answering the sheriff’s interrogatory.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{dissertation}} at hand {{deals with}} aspects of quality perception of interactive audiovisual application systems of moderate complexity as e. g. {{defined in the}} MPEG- 4 standard. Because in these systems the available computing power is limited, it is decisive to know which factors influence the perceived quality. Only then can the available computing power be distributed in {{the most effective and}} efficient way for the simulation and display of audiovisual 3 D scenes. Whereas quality factors for the unimodal auditory and visual stimuli are well known and respective models of perception have been successfully devised based on this knowledge, this is not true for bimodal audiovisual perception. For the latter, it is only known that some kind of interdependency between auditory and visual perception does exist. The exact mechanisms of human audiovisual perception have not been described. It is assumed that interaction with an application or scene has a major influence upon the perceived overall quality. The goal of this work was to devise a system capable of performing subjective audiovisual assessments in the given context in a largely automated way. By applying the system, first evidence regarding audiovisual interdependency and influence of interaction upon perception should be collected. Therefore this work was composed of three fields of activities: the creation of a test bench based on the available but (regarding the audio functionality) somewhat restricted MPEG- 4 player, the preoccupation with methods and framework requirements that ensure comparability and reproducibility of audiovisual assessments and results, and the performance of a series of coordinated experiments including the analysis and interpretation of the collected data. An object-based modular audio rendering engine was co-designed and -implemented which allows to perform simple room-acoustic simulations based on the MPEG- 4 scene description paradigm in real-time. Apart from the MPEG- 4 player, the test bench consists of a haptic Input Device used by test subjects to enter their quality ratings and a logging tool that allows to <b>journalize</b> all relevant events during an assessment session. The collected data can be exported comfortably for further analysis using appropriate statistic tools. A thorough analysis of the well established test methods and recommendations for unimodal subjective assessments was performed to find out whether a transfer to the audiovisual bimodal case is easily possible. It became evident that - due to the limited knowledge about the underlying perceptual processes - a novel categorization of experiments according to their goals could be helpful to organize the research in the field. Furthermore, a number of influencing factors could be identified that exercise control over bimodal perception in the given context. By performing the perceptual experiments using the devised system, its functionality and ease of use was verified. Apart from that, some first indications for the role of interaction in perceived overall quality have been collected: interaction in the auditory modality reduces a human's ability of correctly rating the audio quality, whereas visually based (cross-modal) interaction does not necessarily generate this effect.

6000|$|Hotel Wheeler, June 22d.--We {{arrived at}} this hotel last evening from Paris, and find {{ourselves}} on {{the borders of}} the Petit Quay Notre Dame, with steamers and boats right under our windows, and all sorts of dock-business going on briskly. There are barrels, bales, and crates of goods; there are old iron cannon for posts; in short, all that belongs to the Wapping of a great seaport. [...] . The American partialities of the guests [of this hotel] are consulted by the decorations of the parlor, in which hang two lithographs and colored views of New York, from Brooklyn and from Weehawken. The fashion of the house is a sort of nondescript mixture of Frank, English, and American, and is not disagreeable to us after our weary experience of Continental life. The abundance of the food is very acceptable in comparison with the meagreness of French and Italian meals; and last evening we supped nobly on cold roast beef and ham, set generously before us, in the mass, instead of being doled out in slices few and thin. The waiter has a kindly sort of manner, and resembles the steward of a vessel rather than a landsman; and, in short, everything here has undergone a change, which might admit of very effective description. I may now as well give up all attempts at <b>journalizing.</b> So I shall say nothing of our journey across France from Geneva. [...] .

[...] Well then! that I am settled at Ratzeburg, with my motives and the {{particulars}} of my journey hither, will inform you. My first letter to him, with which doubtless he has edified your whole fireside, left me safely landed at Hamburg on the Elbe Stairs, at the Boom House. While standing on the stairs, I was amused by the contents of the passage-boat. which crosses the river once or twice a day from Hamburg to Haarburg. It was stowed close with all people of all nations, in all sorts of dresses; the men all with pipes in their mouths, and these pipes of all shapes and fancies--straight and wreathed, simple and complex, long and short, cane, clay, porcelain, wood, tin, silver, and ivory; most of them with silver chains and silver bole-covers. Pipes and boots are the first universal characteristic of the male Hamburgers that would strike the eye of a raw traveller. But I forget my promise of <b>journalizing</b> as much as possible.--Therefore, Septr. 19th Afternoon. My companion, who, you recollect, speaks the French language with unusual propriety, had formed a kind of confidential acquaintance with the emigrant, who appeared to be a man of sense, and whose manners were those of a perfect gentleman. He seemed about fifty or rather more. Whatever is unpleasant in French manners from excess in the degree, had been softened down by age or affliction; and all that is delightful in the kind, alacrity and delicacy in little attentions, etc., remained, and without bustle, gesticulation, or disproportionate eagerness. His demeanour exhibited the minute philanthropy of a polished Frenchman, tempered by the sobriety of the English character disunited from its reserve. There is something strangely attractive in the character of a gentleman when you apply the word emphatically, and yet in that sense of the term which it is more easy to feel than to define. It neither includes the possession of high moral excellence, nor of necessity even the ornamental graces of manner. I have now in my mind's eye a person whose life would scarcely stand scrutiny even in the court of honour, much less in that of conscience; and his manners, if nicely observed, would of the two excite an idea of awkwardness rather than of elegance: and yet every one who conversed with him felt and acknowledged the gentleman. The secret of the matter, I believe to be this--we feel the gentlemanly character present to us, whenever, under all the circumstances of social intercourse, the trivial not less than the important, through the whole detail of his manners and deportment, and with the ease of a habit, a person shows respect to others in such a way, as at the same time implies in his own feelings an habitual and assured anticipation of reciprocal respect from them to himself. In short, the gentlemanly character arises out of the feeling of Equality acting, as a Habit, yet flexible to the varieties of Rank, and modified without being disturbed or superseded by them. This description will perhaps explain to you the ground of one of your own remarks, as I was englishing to you the interesting dialogue concerning the causes of the corruption of eloquence. [...] "What perfect gentlemen these old Romans must have been! I was impressed, I remember, with the same feeling at the time I was reading a translation of Cicero's philosophical dialogues and of his epistolary correspondence: while in Pliny's Letters I seemed to have a different feeling--he gave me the notion of a very fine gentleman." [...] You uttered the words as if you had felt that the adjunct had injured the substance and the increased degree altered the kind. Pliny was the courtier of an absolute monarch--Cicero an aristocratic republican. For this reason the character of gentleman, in the sense to which I have confined it, is frequent in England, rare in France, and found, where it is found, in age or the latest period of manhood; while in Germany the character is almost unknown. But the proper antipode of a gentleman is to be sought for among the Anglo-American democrats.|$|E
