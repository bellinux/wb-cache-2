30|$|Poverty is {{computed}} at {{the household}} level: if the household <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> {{is below the}} poverty threshold (i.e. the 60  % of the national median <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income),</b> all the household members are poor. Coherently, also covariates are computed at the household level. In particular, we control for household-specific and main earner characteristics. The main earner is chosen because it is considered as the most representative of the household economic condition. However, the analyses are carried out at an individual level, for two main reasons. First, the PARP rate is computed as the share of individuals living in such a condition. Since {{we are interested in}} the analyses of the Europe 2020 indicator, as defined by Eurostat, we want to stay {{as close as possible to}} the original definition. Second, longitudinal weighs are provided at the individual level (i.e. they differ among the household members) because they correct for non-response at the individual level. Since all household members have the same characteristics, robust standard errors are provided.|$|E

Annoyance to noise and exposure to residential traffic were assessed by self-administered questionnaires. A total of 6. 3 % of the participants reported a high to very high exposure to residential traffic noise, 3. 7 % to neighbourhood noise and 2. 1 % to aircraft noise. An excessive exposure to residential traffic was reported by 21. 3 % of the participants.

A high annoyance to aircraft noise was only associated with a low <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and living in apartment blocks. Exposure to residential traffic was associated with all investigated indicators. At present in Germany environmental exposures are social unequally distributed and may lead to negative health consequences in social disadvantaged groups...|$|E

30|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the impact of the Great Recession on Ireland’s income distribution–both {{directly}} and via the way policy has responded 1. Annual micro-data on the Irish income distribution have been available since 1994 –but during most of this period the economy was growing strongly. During the recessions of the 1970 s and 1980 s, microdata on the income distribution was not available on an annual basis making it difficult to track the impact of recession and associated policy responses on the evolution of income distribution. Nolan (1999) examined the distribution of household income in Ireland in 1987, when Ireland was experiencing a recession, and 1994, when Ireland was emerging from recession. Between these years, he found that the bottom decile slightly increased its share of <b>equivalised</b> household <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> {{at the expense of the}} middle and top deciles. The Gini coefficient, however, was largely unaffected, remaining at 0.32 in both years. O’Neill and Sweetman (2001) came to a similar conclusion, irrespective of whether income or expenditure was used as a measure of resources.|$|R
30|$|The {{framework}} of Europe 2020, the European Union’s growth {{strategy for the}} decade, shows policymakers’ increasing interest in poverty issues: {{one of the five}} headline targets consists in reducing poverty or social exclusion, by lifting 20 million people out of poverty by 2020 (European Commission 2010). The definition of adequate policies, however, needs to rely not only on a measure of the level of poverty or social exclusion characterising a country but also on a clear knowledge of the underlying processes and trigger factors. For this reason, in the set of indicators used by the European Union (EU) to monitor social inclusion, the at risk of poverty (ARP) rate is complemented by the persistent at risk of poverty (PARP) rate that provides a more detailed picture of how consistently households experience poverty in time (Őzdemir and Ward 2010). According to Eurostat, the ARP is the share of people with an <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> below the ARP threshold, which is set at 60  % of the national median <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income.</b> The PARP is then defined as the share of individuals at risk of poverty during the current year and at least two out of the three previous ones (Eurostat 2012).|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the {{definition}} of income poverty is based on the <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> that is the sum of all household and household members’ income components, divided by the OECD equivalised household size. This definition relies on the assumption of income pooling, i.e. all household members have the same access to economic resources and the latter are used to achieve common household goals. Although such an assumption has been questioned (Donni and Chiappori 2011; Ponthieux 2013), it is still widely adopted in the study of poverty. Thus, poverty is defined at the household level, because all individuals belonging to the same household are expected to benefit from the same economic resources and they all are experiencing the same poverty status.|$|E
30|$|Before {{considering}} formal decomposition results, it {{is useful}} to examine how the pattern of changes in decile shares seen above is broken down in terms of the major income components. Table  5 shows the changes in shares of total <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> by decile, and the contributions of each of the main income sources to these changes. For most deciles, falls in income shares due to employee income and self-employment income are partly offset by increases in transfers. Higher taxes are paid by those in the upper half of the income distribution, especially those in the 9 th and 10 th deciles. The top decile is exceptional in that employee income contributes strongly to a sharp rise in the share of the decile in total income, offset by a reduction arising from lower self-employment income.|$|E

Annual movements {{into and out of}} poverty by children’s households in New Zealand over the 1997 / 98, 1998 / 99, and 1999 / 2000 periods are analysed. The annual Income Supplement to the Household Labour Force Survey allows tracking of dwellings and people in two consecutive June quarterly weeks, and thus allows observation of changes in <b>equivalised</b> household <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> over a June year.

40|$|We analyse how {{the size}} of the middle class has evolved in 26 European {{countries}} between 2004 and 2013. With data from the European Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), we define households with a median <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> household <b>income</b> between 75 % and 125 % to be middle class. We find that in 16 out of 26 countries the middle class decreases and identify an increase in income polarization in all these countries, with the exception of Greece. We examine whether changes regarding the middle class can be attributed to changing household structure, unemployment rates or redistributive policies. Our results suggest that redistributive policies are most influential for explaining the change across country groups, whereas the other factors do not seem to have an impact. However, there is a great variation between countries. Due to government transfers and taxes, middle class increased 17 percentage points in Iceland, while only by 5. 3 percentage points in Estonia. Exploring potential explanations for this gap, we define country groups with similar socio-economic policies and institutions. We observe that Social-Democratic countries and Central European economies have the biggest, while Baltic and Mediterranean countries show the smallest middle class. Analysing the impact of redistributive policies we find considerable differences between country groups and can show that liberal market economies do most, whereas Baltic countries do least for their middle class.

The lowest losses were in the 1 st to 3 rd deciles (between 3 and 5 per cent). A key factor in the lower losses for deciles 2 and 3 is that payment rates for pensioners were held constant, while there were explicit cuts in payment rates for those of working age, and deeper cuts in Child Benefit. With {{the exception of the}} lowest decile, Figure  4 shows that, in aggregate, Budgets 2008 to 2011 were progressively structured.

A secondary aim was to {{determine the}} price differential between commonly available gluten-free and gluten-containing food staples. Methods Exploratory study using an amalgamation of two commonly used food basket costing methods. Two food basket types were constructed for four common Australian family types. These were designated the Healthy Food Basket and modified (gluten-free) Healthy Food Basket. Baskets were priced at five locations and costs as a proportion of the <b>Equivalised</b> Household <b>Disposable</b> <b>Income</b> and average weekly earnings for welfare recipients were calculated. The price differential for four common bread and cereal staples were also calculated per 100 [*]g. Results The gluten-free healthy food basket was significantly more expensive compared to a gluten-containing healthy food basket for all family types. The gluten-free basket was considered unaffordable for three of the four common family types. Gluten-free staples are significantly more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. Conclusions Compliance to a gluten-free diet may be more difficult for some families due to the significant price discrepancy of gluten-free items.

The effects of the recession were magnified by a domestic banking crisis and the bursting of a domestic property bubble. Approximately 15  % of all employment positions held {{in the first quarter}} of 2008 had disappeared by mid- 2012, according to Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) data. Reductions in earnings together with falling asset prices and increased tax burden affected most households.

While the country’s progressive tax and transfer system has been credited with mitigating the worst of the distributional impact of the crisis, real equivalised disposable household income at the bottom decile fell by 22  % over that period (Savage et al. 2015). Changing labour market circumstances have been shown to account for most of the deteriorating economic situation of poorer households, see McGinnity et al. (2014), Mühlau (2014), and Savage et al.

The Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) {{is the source of the}} microdata on households from 2008 - 09 onwards. Previously, the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS) was the data source.

The five income measures are: original income: includes income from employment, private pensions, investment income and income from other non-government sources gross income: original income plus cash benefits disposable income: gross income minus direct taxes (income tax, employees' National Insurance contributions and local taxes) post-tax income: disposable income minus indirect taxes final income: post-tax income plus benefits in kind (from education, the National Health Service (NHS), travel and housing subsidies) Standard Measures: Households are ranked by <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> using the McClements equivalence scale (see methodology notes in the documentation for further details) ...|$|E

Though these policies may be successful in alleviating energy poverty, they can actually lower the incentive for investing in energy efficiency.

We both refer to their capability to remove specific barriers for energy efficiency investments in low-income households as well as their environmental, economic, and social impacts. These impacts are often discussed as “multiple benefits” of energy efficiency and include, beyond their contribution to the achievement of energy and climate targets, positive impacts on employment, GDP, competitiveness or energy security and beneficial social impacts as e. g. alleviation of energy poverty, better health and well being or an improved living comfort. We then give recommendations for future policy design in the EU Member States and the recast of important EU Directives (EED, EPBD, Eco-Design and Energy Labelling Directives), while considering special design elements for low-income households without neglecting rebound effects and other counter-productive effects...|$|E

40|$|According to {{the latest}} {{estimates}} over 16 per cent of the EU citizens are poor (based on monetary concept). Using Europe 2020 strategy indicator people at risk of poverty or social exclusion over 23 percent of EU citizens can be considered poor. Analyses of poverty may be based on several poverty concepts. The assessment of well-being for poverty analyses is usually based on two main conceptual approaches: the welfarist approach and the non-welfarist approach. Measurement of well-being using welfarist approach is based on proxies such as income, consumption or expenditures data, while the non-welfarist approach is based on proxies such as material deprivation. Furthermore distinction may be made between objective measures of poverty and subjective perception of the phenomenon by individuals alone. The goal {{of this paper is}} to analyse the spatial distribution of poverty across the EU regions. The following poverty concepts are considered: monetary poverty, relative material deprivation, and subjective perception of poverty. Analyses performed in the study are based on EU SILC 2005 - 2010 / 2011 microdata using standard spatial statistical tools. All countries do not publish the "region" variable, and hence poverty measures may not be estimated for all EU regions. In terms of monetary poverty, poverty line is set at 60 % of the national median <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> after social transfers. In our study two additional poverty lines are adopted to each region: EU-wide poverty line, and a region-specific poverty line.

40|$|Using data {{collected}} in the Survey of Income and Housing, this publication provides indicators of the level and distribution of after-tax (or disposable) household income, after adjusting for household size and composition. The estimates of disposable income in this publication are derived by deducting estimates of income tax liability, the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge from the gross income {{data collected}} in the Survey of Income and Housing. Gross income is defined as receipts available for, or intended to support, current consumption. While income is usually received by individuals, it is normally shared between partners in a couple relationship and with dependent children. To a lesser degree, there may be sharing {{with other members of}} the household. Even when there is no transfer of income between members of a household, nor provision of free or cheap accommodation, members are still likely to benefit from the economies of scale that arise from the sharing of dwellings. The income measures shown in this publication therefore relate to household income. Larger households normally require a greater level of income to maintain the same material standard of living as smaller households, and the needs of adults are normally greater than the needs of children. The income estimates are therefore adjusted by equivalence factors to standardise the income estimates with respect to household size and composition, while taking into account the economies of scale that arise from the sharing of dwellings. The <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> estimate for any household in this publication is expressed as the amount of disposable cash income that a single person household would require to maintain the same standard of living as the household in question, regardless of the size or composition of the latter. • Reports on this publication appeared in The Age and The Australia...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{adopts a}} {{longitudinal}} approach towards examining the income mobility {{of older people}} aged 50 and over in England and aged 45 and over in South Korea over the period between 2006 and 2012, using panel data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (KLoSA). This study of income mobility among older people points to pension income insecurity issues, which carry utmost significance when life expectancy and retirement duration are increasing. The comparative analysis brought insights into {{the ways in which}} different institutional settings may be responsible, and what policy reforms can be introduced to offset the adverse impact of income mobility on the wellbeing of older people. This research analysed the income mobility of older people using the unit of household <b>equivalised</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and aggregate summary measures. The research also investigated the factors that significantly influence income mobility in old age at the microscopic level using multivariate analysis. The findings from the analysis of absolute income mobility suggest that older people in England show much more income stability than their Korean counterparts. From the relative income mobility analysis, older people in both countries experienced a low rate of change in their position in the income distribution over the measured period. In both countries, there was income rigidity among the high-income and low-income classes. The examination on what lies behind income mobility and the comparison of the determinants of income mobility in the two countries revealed that income growth has very little impact on aggregate mobility in England, while it is crucial for the mobility levels in Korea. Finally, the findings on the factors affecting income mobility of older people revealed that demographic characteristics, employment status, health status, educational level, and income attributes (welfare) are significantly associated with income mobility. A notable difference is that changes in living arrangements and a higher share of state benefits are associated with positive (upward) income mobility in Korea, whereas these factors are associated with downward income mobility in England. The transition into widowhood is associated with downward income mobility in England but has no significant effect in Korea. The empirical results highlight the benefits of cross-national comparative study on the income dynamics of older people, and how different contexts, welfare systems, and labour market affect the income mobility in later life. In Korea, the focus should be on finding the ways to expand social welfare services and income security policies so that the welfare state can be more responsive to income risk in old age. In contrast, means-tested income support policy in England should be investigated further in order to help middle-income class vulnerability in economic risks...|$|E
