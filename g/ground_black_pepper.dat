Materials and Methods: A total of 288 commercial broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 1 - 9 groups with 4 replicates each. An experiment was conducted in broilers with different feed formulations; control feed, with no added fenugreek, garlic, and <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> powder; and 8 treatment groups receiving feed supplemented with different combinations of fenugreek, garlic, and <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> powder. The individual broilers’ body weight and feed consumption were recorded and calculate the body weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR).

40|$|Aims: Phytophthora capsici {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> and zoospores play {{an important}} role in the infection process. Fluorescent pseudomonads that produce biosurfactants with zoosporicidal activities were isolated from the <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> rhizosphere in Vietnam, and their genotypic diversity and potential to control Phy. capsici root rot was determined. Methods: Biosurfactant-producing pseudomonads were genotypically and biochemically characterized by BOX-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 16 S-rDNA sequencing, reverse-phase-high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-masss spectrometry analyses. Results: Biosurfactant-producing fluorescent pseudomonads make up c. 1. 3 % of the culturable Pseudomonas population in the rhizosphere of <b>black</b> <b>pepper.</b> Although BOX-PCR revealed substantial genotypic diversity, the isolates were shown to produce the same biosurfactants and were all identified as Pseudomonas putida. When applied to <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> stem cuttings, several of the biosurfactant-producing strains provided significant disease control. In absence of the disease, several of the bacterial strains promoted shoot and root growth of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> stem cuttings. Conclusions: Biosurfactant-producing pseudomonads indigenous to the rhizosphere of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> plants are genotypically diverse and provide a novel resource for the control of Phy. capsici root rot and growth promotion of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> stem cuttings.

50|$|This {{version of}} ventricina {{is made from}} pork meat with added pork fat, the latter amounting to {{approximately}} 50-60% by weight of the finished product. The meat and fat are finely ground together and various spices are then added to the mixture. Most often these include garlic, salt, <b>ground</b> <b>black</b> and white <b>pepper,</b> hot and bell peppers, orange peel, rosemary, bell pepper paste, and fennel seeds. Other spices are sometimes added according to {{the taste of the}} producer. Traditionally, this mixture would be encased in the bladder, stomach, or intestines of the pig. More recently, synthetic casings have been employed or the mixture is simply stored in glass containers. Ventricina is often hung to cure in a cool dark place for several months before it is eaten. Ventricina teramana (that from the area around Teramo in Abruzzo) is most often eaten when it is young and has been allowed to age only a few months. Many people spread this delicacy on an open slice of bread. If desired the bread slices can be placed on the grill or in the oven for a period of time, thereby making a kind of bruschetta.|$|R
