2500|$|Vedder is an atheist. He {{attended}} San Dieguito High School, {{now called}} San Dieguito Academy. Vedder donated proceeds from a 2006 Pearl Jam concert in San Diego toward {{the construction of}} a theater for the school in the name of his former drama teacher, Clayton E. Liggett. Liggett was Vedder's mentor in high school. Vedder wrote the song [...] "Long Road" [...] (from Merkin Ball) upon hearing of Liggett's death in 1995. Vedder was a friend of Alice in Chains's lead singer Layne Staley, and wrote the song [...] "4/20/02" [...] in the night that he found out about Staley's death on April 20, 2002. Vedder also paid tribute to Staley during a Pearl Jam show in Chicago on August 22, 2016, which would be Staley's 49th birthday; “It’s the birthday of a guy called Layne Staley tonight, and we’re thinking of <b>him</b> <b>tonight</b> too. 49 years old”, Vedder told the crowd before dedicating the song Man of the Hour to his late friend.|$|E

6000|$|... "But come, {{let us go}} on. Por Sing {{is expecting}} you. I told him that I knew that one from the {{garrison}} would come out to treat with <b>him</b> privately <b>tonight,</b> and he is expecting you, though {{he does not know}} who may come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Constable," [...] Mr. Bailey said, [...] "you {{had better}} not put {{this man in}} the village lockup. The place is of no great strength, and his comrades would as likely as not get <b>him</b> out, <b>tonight.</b> Put <b>him</b> in my dog cart. My groom shall drive you over to Hunston." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. If you won't take him, I {{shall have}} <b>him</b> shot, <b>tonight.</b> A horse could not {{possibly}} pick up food here, and would die of starvation without a master; {{and it would be}} still more cruel to give him to a native, for they are brutal horse masters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I got a {{note from}} Mr. Laurence, asking me {{to come over and}} play to <b>him</b> <b>tonight,</b> before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go," [...] added Beth, whose {{friendship}} with the old gentleman prospered finely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shure and I saw him," [...] Tim said. [...] "The cart come in just now, {{and there}} was he, perched up {{on the top of}} it like a dried monkey. You don't want <b>him</b> <b>tonight,</b> shure, yer honor." ...|$|E
6000|$|For we {{are very}} lucky, with a lamp before the door, [...] And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more; [...] And oh! before you hurry by with ladder and with light; [...] O Leerie, see a little child and nod to <b>him</b> <b>tonight!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fixed him," [...] was Carlson's unimaginative way of {{describing}} the affair. [...] "I fixed him," [...] he repeated, while a sombre light burnt in his eyes, and his huge, toil-distorted hands {{opened and closed}} eloquently. [...] "He made no noise. I hid <b>him,</b> and <b>tonight</b> I will go back and bury him deep." ...|$|R
50|$|Stolte appears outside Bellick's cell, telling <b>him</b> that <b>tonight,</b> some corrupt guards paid by Banks {{will open}} the cell doors, while Banks and his gang will attack him. Bellick asks Stolte for help, and Stolte replies that he is helping by warning him. He further {{explains}} that the night shift CO's are only there because Bellick assigned them there when he was captain of the guards, {{and that they will}} have no sympathy for him.|$|R
6000|$|... “No, {{we cannot}} do that; {{we had better}} tell <b>him</b> frankly <b>tonight</b> that we have moved the gold and buried it, lest the vessel should go to pieces in a storm, that we intend {{to give it up}} to any Spanish or Chilian ship that may come here; but that if it is a long time before we are rescued we shall then divide the gold between us, and that he will get a fair share of it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Hearken, Thor of the Thunder! [...] We are {{not here}} for a jest-- [...] For wager, warfare, or plunder, [...] Or to put your power to test. [...] This work is none of our wishing-- [...] We would stay at home if we might-- [...] But our master is wrecked out fishing, [...] We go to find <b>him</b> <b>tonight.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Toby, slowly, as if {{he feared}} he might provoke one of those terrible {{laughing}} spells again, [...] "I saw <b>him</b> <b>tonight,</b> an' he looked {{as if he}} knew what I was doin'; so I up an' told him, an' I didn't know but he'd told you, though he didn't look to me like a feller that would be mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you find}} {{anything}} of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and write <b>him</b> <b>tonight.</b> For me, I watch here {{in the room and}} in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers." ...|$|E
50|$|When {{the show}} became a success, Allen got a primetime Sunday comedy/variety show in June 1956, leading <b>him</b> to share <b>Tonight</b> hosting duties with Ernie Kovacs during the 1956-57 season. To give Allen {{time to work}} on his Sunday evening show, Kovacs hosted Tonight on Monday and Tuesday nights with his own {{announcer}} (Bill Wendell) and bandleader.|$|R
25|$|The {{company that}} hired <b>him</b> for <b>Tonight</b> for Sure {{brought him back}} to re-cut a German film titled Mit Eva fing die Sünde an {{directed}} by Fritz Umgelter. He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer's and director's credit for The Bellboy and the Playgirls, also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by Roger Corman and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, Nebo zovyot, which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled Battle Beyond the Sun, released in 1962. Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on Tower of London (1962), sound man for The Young Racers (1963) and associate producer of The Terror (1963).|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no joking matter, Malcolm, I {{can tell}} you," [...] Andrew said irritably; [...] "but of course I {{will see what}} I can do. And now I will put on my bonnet and come with you and have a chat with Ronald. It will not do to bring <b>him</b> here <b>tonight,</b> but we must arrange {{for him to come}} and see Janet before he sails. I shall not tell her {{anything}} about it till he is ready to start, for you know she is very particular, and I am afraid I shall have to say what is not quite true to get the order. I can sign it myself, but it must have the signature of the provost too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He has affairs here," [...] he said. [...] "He is {{also like}} us others--a man who loves his pleasure. You will find <b>him</b> <b>tonight</b> with a most charming companion--Mademoiselle Ixe of the Opera. Before {{the coming of}} Herr Freudenberg, I {{remember}} her well--the companion at times of many. To-day she is changed, triste {{when he is not}} here, faithful in a most un-Parisianlike manner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Bruce," [...] {{said the}} headmaster, {{coming into the}} room and laying down some books on the table, [...] "do you want to speak to me? Will you give your father my {{congratulations}} on his victory. I shall be writing to <b>him</b> <b>tonight.</b> I see from the paper that the polling was very even. Apparently one or two voters arrived at the last moment and turned the scale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] cried Josephine, {{pressing}} her hands across her shuddering eyes. Then, uncovering her white and set face, she said rapidly, [...] "Saddle my horse {{and your own}} at once. Then take your choice! Come with me and repeat all that you have said {{in the presence of}} that man, or leave this ranch forever. For if I live I shall go to <b>him</b> <b>tonight,</b> and tell the whole story." ...|$|E

5000|$|Soon {{after initial}} surgery at Sloan-Kettering in New York City {{to remove the}} tumor, he {{underwent}} a second procedure in April 1970 to remove his left lung and pectoral muscle. Bothered by chest pain afterward, he was re-admitted {{to the hospital in}} early June and doctors determined the cancer had spread to other organs, particularly his liver. He died in the early morning of June 16 at the age of 26. The month before Piccolo's death, Gale Sayers was accepting the George S. Halas Award for Most Courageous Player and told the crowd that they had selected the wrong person for the award. He said, [...] "I love Brian Piccolo, and I'd like all of you to love <b>him,</b> too. <b>Tonight,</b> when you hit your knees to pray, please ask God to love him, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And trust me, sir,' added Ralph, 'that I never {{supposed}} {{you would}} give <b>him</b> up <b>tonight.</b> Pride, obstinacy, reputation for fine feeling, were all against it. These must be brought down, sir, lowered, crushed, as they shall be soon. The protracted and wearing anxiety and {{expense of the}} law in its most oppressive form, its torture from hour to hour, its weary days and sleepless nights, with these I'll prove you, and break your haughty spirit, strong as you deem it now. And when you make this house a hell, and visit these trials upon yonder wretched object (as you will; I know you), and those who think you now a young-fledged hero, we'll go into old accounts between us two, and see who stands the debtor, and comes out best at last, even before the world.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can do that}} afterwards, Murad; {{the first}} thing is to fulfill your promise, and I charge you to take this sahib in safety down to Allahabad. You must push on at once, for they may be sending out from Cawnpore at {{daylight}} to search the bushes here to see if any have escaped. You must go on with <b>him</b> <b>tonight</b> as far as you can, and in the morning enter some village, buy native clothes, and disguise him, and then journey on to Allahabad." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{two o'clock}} in the morning before Bince disgustedly threw his cards upon the table and rose. There was a nasty {{expression}} on his face and in his mind a thing which he did not dare voice--the final crystallization of a suspicion that he had long harbored, that his companions had been for months deliberately fleecing <b>him.</b> <b>Tonight</b> he had lost five thousand dollars, nor was there a man at the table who did not hold his I. O. U's. for similar amounts.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{dear old}} {{governor}} is so awfully cautious. Wait, wait, wait, that's always his cry. I {{tell him that}} he ought to have been in the Government Heavy Ordnance Department. But I'll speak to <b>him</b> <b>tonight.</b> I'll talk him round. See if I don't. And you must speak to your own governor. Robert here will back you up. And here are the ports and the dates that we are due at each. Mind that you have a letter waiting for me at every one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be alarmed, General! Don't be alarmed!" [...] {{said the}} little fat {{factor in a}} {{soothing}} fashion, as one might speak to a frightened child. [...] "This is young Mr. Fothergill West, of Branksome, though what brings <b>him</b> up here <b>tonight</b> is more than I can understand. However, as you are to be neighbours, I can't do better than {{take the opportunity to}} introduce you to each other. Mr. West, this is General Heatherstone, who is about to take a lease of Cloomber Hall." ...|$|R
50|$|Conan O'Brien {{announced}} on the February 18, 2009 episode of Late Night that The Max Weinberg 7 (rechristened as The Tonight Show Band, and adding a second percussionist), the house band on that program, would be accompanying <b>him</b> to The <b>Tonight</b> Show as his version's house band. It was announced February 23, 2009 that former Late Night sidekick Andy Richter would be O'Brien's announcer. Richter replaced O'Brien's former long-time announcer Joel Godard (who stayed behind in New York) when his rendition of The Tonight Show began.|$|R
5000|$|Saturday Night Live {{producer}} Lorne Michaels' company, Broadway Video, replaced Carson Productions and Letterman's Worldwide Pants as the show's co-production company, {{in partnership}} with NBC Studios.

Michaels suggested to O'Brien, an unknown writer for The Simpsons and former writer for Saturday Night Live, that he should audition for the job. Despite having [...] "about 40 seconds" [...] of television-performance experience as an occasional extra on Saturday Night Live sketches, O'Brien auditioned for the show on April 13, 1993. His guests were Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers, and the audition took place on the set of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. O'Brien was offered the show on April 26, 1993, and made his first meaningful television appearance later that day when Leno introduced <b>him</b> on <b>Tonight.</b>|$|R

Tal Hajus has ordered me to bring you before <b>him</b> <b>tonight.</b> I have ten thoats, John Carter; you may take your choice from among them, and I will accompany you to the nearest waterway that leads to Helium.

6000|$|He redrew the will, and his {{ostensible}} nephew was heir to {{a fortune}} again. As he was finishing his task, Tom, wearied with another brooding tramp, {{entered the house}} and went tiptoeing past the sitting room door. He glanced in, and hurried on, for {{the sight of his}} uncle was nothing but terrors for <b>him</b> <b>tonight.</b> But his uncle was writing! That was unusual at this late hour. What could he be writing? A chill of anxiety settled down upon Tom's heart. Did that writing concern him? He was afraid so. He reflected that when ill luck begins, it does not come in sprinkles, but in showers. He said he would get a glimpse of that document or know the reason why. He heard someone coming, and stepped out of sight and hearing. It was Pembroke Howard. What could be hatching? ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{had thought}} of herself as insisting on {{standing}} beside him and sharing his peril. Had he been himself she must have don so, {{but this was a}} stranger, whose claiming her made her shrink apart till she could feel the identity which, though she believed, she could not realize. Her hand lay cold and tremulous within his warm pressure, but he was too much wrought up and too full of joy and haste to be sensible of anything but of the brave affection that had dared all to come to him; and he was perfectly happy, even as a trumpet-call among the foe warned him to press her fingers to his lips and say, as his bright blue eye kindled, 'God grant that we may meet and thank <b>Him</b> <b>tonight!</b> Farewell, my lost and found! I fight as one who has something to fight for.' ...|$|E
2500|$|NBC was not {{prepared}} to replace both Letterman and Late Night. Aside from the name, it needed to build a new show. Both Dana Carvey and Garry Shandling declined to host it.

50|$|Johnny visits an {{unlicensed}} doctor, Kroenig (Christopher Lloyd), who shoots up heroin before trading {{his services}} for Johnny's last $40 and his shoes. Realizing he left Marcie unprotected, Johnny rushes {{to his hotel}} but finds the Senator waiting for him, along with Marcie's dismembered head and hands. Again, the senator lets him go. Intent on taking down Roark, Johnny scrounges a dollar from a sympathetic waitress (Lady Gaga) which he uses to regain enough money playing slots to buy his way into Roark's game the following night. Playing a card shark's con, Johnny folds his first few hands, allowing Roark to taunt him about his dead mother. He once again cons Roark into going all in, then reveals his winning hand. Johnny taunts his father, reminding <b>him</b> that <b>tonight's</b> {{story of how the}} same man beat him twice will follow him {{for the rest of his}} life. His vengeance completed, Johnny smiles resignedly, a single tear running down his face as Roark shoots him in the head, commanding his men to get rid of the body.|$|R
