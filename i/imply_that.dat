5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E

5|$|In general relativity, gravity {{becomes a}} fictitious force that arises in {{situations}} where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry.

5|$|According to American {{composer}} David Schiff, his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used to <b>imply</b> <b>that</b> he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion in 1960, after 50years of neglect. Schiff {{points out}} that such neglect was only relative—far less than the (incomplete) disregard of Bach {{in the years after}} his death. Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus, it was well under way before 1960, sustained by conductors such as Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli, and by the long-time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland.|$|E
