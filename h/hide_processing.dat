The prevalences and concentrations of these organisms were determined in feces and hides (at feedlot and processing plant), pre-evisceration carcasses, and final carcasses from three lots of fed cattle (n= 184). The prevalences and concentrations were further determined for strip loins from 103 of the carcasses. 3 GCr Salmonella was detected on 7. 6 % of <b>hides</b> during <b>processing</b> and was not detected on the final carcasses or strip loins. NALr S. enterica was detected on only one hide. 3 GCr E. coli and COTr E. coli were detected on 100. 0 % of <b>hides</b> during <b>processing.</b> Concentrations of 3 GCr E. coli and COTr E. coli on hides were correlated with pre-evisceration carcass contamination. 3 GCr E. coli and COTr E. coli were each detected on only 0. 5 % of final carcasses and were not detected on strip loins. Five hundred and 42 isolates were screened for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) virulence-associated markers.

40|$|Many {{water utility}} {{companies}} {{are beginning to}} amass large volumes of data by means of remote sensing of flow, pressure and other variables. For district meter area monitoring there has been increasing interest in using this sensor data for abnormality detection, such as the real-time detection of bursts. Research pilots have explored systems for generating 'smart alarms' and a key requirement is usually a prediction of future time series values. Artificial neural networks have been employed in this capacity, however built in temporal memory in the network architecture (tap delays, feedback etc.) has not been widely explored. In this comparative study, a number of artificial neural network architectures are evaluated for water distribution flow time series prediction, in particular by exploring using temporal memory. These models included multilayer perceptron, mixture density network, time delay network and recurrent network. In addition the mean diurnal cycle (calculated from the data set) was utilised as a baseline prediction. Genetic algorithm optimisation was utilised {{in some cases to}} optimise the number of <b>hidden</b> <b>processing</b> elements and the learning rates parameters for the neural network. Two reference data sets are used as a case study originating from typical real world distribution systems and the performance assessed by means of mean absolute error. The results of the study show that of the static networks, the mixture density network is superior for repeatability and insensitivity to parameter settings. Similarly, the recurrent network is generally superior to the time delay network in this capacity. However, the use of either time delays or feedback results in approximately 50 % less error than a static network for the best performing networks...|$|R
40|$|Some {{people with}} aphasia may have {{difficulty}} in talking about events because of trouble in processing situations in a language-ready fashion. A number of models of language production include a level at which messages are shaped {{to the demands of}} a particular language system. However, the relation between such conceptual processing and production in aphasia has been less fully explored. This study takes an empirical approach, investigating the relationship between the verb and sentence difficulties of six people with aphasia and their conceptualisation of events. Following a range of preparatory assessments, so individuals were hypothesised to have some difficulty in conceptualising events for language. Three novel tests were then devised to explore the skills of these individuals, and in one case, the whole group, in more detail. One test examines participants' focus over pictured situations, through their naming of the people and objects involved. A second probes the adoption of perspective over a particularly problematic situation type, investigating the effect of visual and linguistic cues on verb production. The third test focuses on gesture, exploring the relationship between verbal description and the production of action gestures. One participant's drawing of simple events was also probed using a recently developed assessment (Sacchett, 2005). In each case the results point to some differences between the participants with aphasia and a group of non-brain damaged speakers, thus providing support for the psychological reality of the notion of 'thinking for speaking' (Slobin, 1996) in aphasia. In addition, the test findings bring to light some previously <b>hidden</b> <b>processing</b> strengths. However, they also highlight the difficulty both of designing valid tests in this area and of accurately interpreting their results. The discussion considers the implications of the findings for therapy in aphasia, and for our understanding of the relationship between language loss and event conceptualisation...|$|R

The Alcian Blue colorimetric technique was used to assay the sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) portion of decorin. The corresponding residual decorin content was correlated to the mechanical properties of the BCD samples and was comparable to the control leather made traditionally. The waterless dehydration and instantaneous chrome tanning process is a good eco-friendly alternative to transforming hides to leather because no additional effects were observed after examination using NIR spectroscopy and additional chemometric analysis...|$|R
