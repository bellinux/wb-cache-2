5|$|A {{railway station}} opened in Banagher in 1884 as the {{terminus}} for the Clara to Banagher {{line of the}} Great Southern & Western Railway Company. It operated both a passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> until 1947, when the passenger service was withdrawn. The station closed completely in 1963.|$|E
5|$|In September 1962 the {{passenger}} railway service from Barry to Pontypridd was terminated. <b>Goods</b> <b>service</b> at stations was cancelled in April 1964. but the through line was officially closed in July 1963 following the devastating fire at Tynycaeau Junction signal box in March 1963.|$|E
5|$|By 1932 the Cronulla tramway had closed. Competing bus {{services}} {{had begun}} to run with unrestricted competition, and the tram line by this time was so full with services that trams often ran late due to holdups at the crossing loops and passengers missed their connections at Sutherland. The line suffered large losses in its later years, {{and the effect of}} the Great Depression at the time forced it to cease its services, the last passenger service operating on 3 August 1931. The <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> continued until 12 January of the next year.|$|E
50|$|Conferment of the Permanent Force <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal was {{discontinued}} in 1975, when it {{was replaced}} by a new set of three <b>good</b> <b>service</b> medals, the <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal, Gold, <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal, Silver and the <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal, Bronze.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal, Bronze {{was instituted}} by the State President in 1975 and, until 1993, {{was named the}} South African Defence Force <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal, Bronze. The medal is the junior {{of a set of}} three {{military}} medals for <b>good</b> <b>service,</b> along with the <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal, Gold for thirty years of <b>good</b> <b>service</b> and the <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal, Silver for twenty.|$|R
50|$|Bophuthatswana's {{military}} decorations and medals were modelled {{on those}} of the Republic of South Africa and these three medals are the approximate equivalents of, respectively, the <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal, Gold, the <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal, Silver and the <b>Good</b> <b>Service</b> Medal, Bronze.|$|R
5|$|The <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> at {{individual}} stations was also withdrawn after Beeching's report. A freightliner depot opened at Aberdeen in 1966, allowing the Peterhead line to close completely on 7 September 1970. In 1969â€“70 {{the line between}} Aberdeen and Keith was singled, with passing loops, the line to Fraserburgh closing completely in 1979 and that from Keith to Dufftown in 1985. In the 1969 timetable there were early morning trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie, and five services a day between Aberdeen to Inverness, supplemented by two Aberdeen to Elgin services that by the late 1970s were running through to Inverness. The cross-country DMUs were replaced in 1980 by diesel locomotives hauling Mark I compartment coaches, later Mark II open saloons. These were similarly replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by newer DMUs, first the Class 156 Super Sprinter and then Class 158 Express and Class 170 units.|$|E
25|$|When the Northern {{line was}} {{extended}} over {{the lines of}} the LNER to High Barnet and Mill Hill East in 1940, the stations retained their <b>goods</b> <b>service.</b> Starting at midnight trains would leave Highbury every five to ten minutes and access the line from Finsbury Park via Highgate High Level. The Central line stations also kept their <b>goods</b> <b>service,</b> worked from Temple Mills and accessed via Leytonstone, the Hainault loop stations being served via Woodford.|$|E
25|$|After the 1923 {{grouping}} the <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> was {{operated by}} London and North Eastern Railway (as successors to the GER), with the Metropolitan Railway continuing to provide passenger services.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, there were active <b>goods</b> <b>services</b> {{along the lines}} to Varese, and the station had a goods yard. Since then, {{following}} the termination of <b>goods</b> <b>services,</b> that yard has been transformed, with the agreement of FS, into a car parking station.|$|R
25|$|The Central line {{stations}} east of Stratford {{kept their}} <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> for a time, being worked from Temple Mills, with the Hainault loop stations served via Woodford. The BR line south of Newbury Park closed in 1956 and Hainault loop stations lost their <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> in 1965, {{the rest of}} the stations on the line following in 1966. Early morning passenger trains from Stratford (Liverpool Street on Sundays) ran to Epping or Loughton until 1970. The single-track section from Epping to Ongar was electrified in 1957 and then operated as a shuttle service using short tube trains. However, carrying only 100 passengers a day and losing money, the section closed in 1994, and is now used by the heritage Epping Ongar Railway.|$|E
25|$|During heavy {{air raids}} in 1941 many Plymouth workers {{preferred}} to find accommodation outside the city, and in 1941 the passenger service was reinstated, transferring to Plymouth Friary as the terminal. This service ceased in 1947 and the <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> {{on the line}} finished in 1960.|$|E
25|$|An LBSCR <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> {{first used}} the spur from about 1867, but the {{introduction}} of a passenger service was delayed until 1 February 1876. Even by 1894, only 5 passenger services and 1 goods train were using the spur in a down direction from the Central station. Usage did however increase when the Southern Railway took over the line following the grouping and in 1924, 9 down passenger services used it. By 1952, this had increased to 13, and in 1958, to 29 plus one <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> each way, which made the spur one of the busiest single-track sections anywhere in the country. Through-running on the Cuckoo Line had been possible since 5 April 1880 when the LBSCR extended the line from Hailsham to Eridge which enabled services to run through to Tunbridge Wells West.|$|E

25|$|Although the J class {{produced}} the same nominal tractive effort as the K or N class, {{they had a}} slightly higher adhesive weight (and as such a better factor of adhesion) and were permitted to haul heavier loads on gradients.

25|$|Despite these attempts, the FR Co. were unsuccessful, {{the last}} {{passenger}} train ran in 1936 {{and the last}} <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> in 1937. The early tourist industry did not provide sufficient visitors to make the railway pay, especially during the Depression. Competition from buses which ran a faster and more regular service from Caernarfon and Beddgelert also played a part. The last passenger train ran on 5 September 1936 and, in February 1937, the FR {{decided not to run}} the WHR again.|$|E
25|$|Goods {{services}} were withdrawn in the 1950s and '60s. The GNR goods depot on the City Widened Lines closed in 1956 and Smithfield Market was last served by train in 1962. Goods {{yards on the}} Uxbridge branch closed in 1964, and Northern line stations saw their last goods train in the same year. The closure of West Kensington yard the following year meant the withdrawal of goods trains from District and Piccadilly tracks. On the Central line, Hainault loop stations lost their <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> in 1965, and in 1966 {{the rest of the}} line followed.|$|E
50|$|Passenger {{services}} ceased in 1952, but <b>goods</b> <b>services</b> {{continued until}} 1973, {{due in part}} to milk train services to the Co-op later Dried Milk Products creamery co-located at the station, which produced cheese.

25|$|The Rs were {{pressed into}} {{secondary}} passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>service,</b> roles {{for which a}} Hudson with large diameter driving wheels was sometimes a less than ideal choice. There was little opportunity to exploit their high speed capability. Furthermore, their relatively low factor of adhesion (4.08) and lack of fully compensated springing, coupled with the tendency of locomotives to transfer weight to the rearmost wheels under high drawbar pull conditions (which {{in the case of}} the R meant a weight transfer from the driving wheels to the unpowered trailing truck) caused them to slip when starting heavy goods trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Rowley {{railway station}} was opened in 1845 (as Cold Rowley, renamed Rowley in 1868) by the NER antecedent, the Stockton and Darlington Railway, consisting {{of just a}} platform. Under NER ownership, {{as a result of}} increasing use, in 1873 the station building was added. As demand declined, passenger service was withdrawn in 1939, followed by the <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> in 1966. Trains continued to use the line for another three years before it closed, the track being lifted in 1970. Although in a state of disrepair, the museum acquired the building, dismantling it in 1972, being officially unveiled in its new location by railway campaigner and poet, Sir John Betjeman.|$|E
25|$|Australia was a {{relatively}} early adopter of electric traction and Electric Multiple Unit trains, with a General Electric advertisement in Railway Age magazine of 1924 claiming that Melbourne had the largest suburban electrification scheme {{in the world at}} 346 miles (557km). However, electrification in Victoria had until the 1950s been restricted to the Melbourne suburban network. Apart from the EMU fleet the only electric locomotives operated by the VR were a fleet of 12 small 620hp (460kW) E class electric locomotives, built at VR's Newport Workshops for suburban <b>goods</b> <b>service,</b> using the same General Electric traction motors and electrical equipment employed on Melbourne's EMU fleet.|$|E

25|$|Even {{after the}} war, {{upgrades}} {{on the line}} to Ararat necessary for H class operation were not made as the VR struggled with a backlog of maintenance work which had built up during the 1940s. When the VR finally embarked on major capital investment in the early 1950s, diesel and electric traction were under consideration. Although diesel locomotives of the early 1950s typically had far lower power outputs than the H class, they could be run in multiple-unit operation, with one crew controlling two or more locomotives. In August 1952, two new B class diesel-electric locomotives established their credentials during trials by hauling a 1,121 ton goods train up Ingliston Bank and covering in 44 minutes the same distance two A2 class locomotives took to haul a 690-ton load in 67 minutes. The B class locomotives proved their ability to provide the same (if not better) performance as the H class, but without the heavy axle load and requirements for upgraded infrastructure. They became the new motive power not only for The Overland, but also mainline <b>goods</b> <b>service.</b> The days of mainline steam locomotives were numbered.|$|E
500|$|The {{upper level}} had two sheds which covered {{different}} periods; {{they were both}} known as [...] "Brendon Hill". The first had one [...] "road" [...] (track) and was located within the Raleigh's Cross Mine site. It opened with the public <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> on 28 September 1858 and closed before 1880. It was subsequently used as a carpenter's workshop until the mine closed in 1882. The second shed also had a single [...] "road", and was located south of the line south of the site of Carnarvon Pit. It was open for two periods: from lifting of the Raleigh's Cross branch in Summer 1884 to 7 November 1898 and from 4 July 1907 to 1910. Both Brendon Hill sheds have long been demolished.|$|E
500|$|In 1830 {{the company}} opened new offices {{at the corner}} of Northgate and Union Street in Darlington. Between 1831 and 1832 a second track was laid between Stockton and the foot of Brusselton Bank. Workshops were built at Shildon for the {{maintenance}} and construction of locomotives. In 1830 approximately 50 horses shared the traffic with 19 locomotives, but travelled at different speeds, so to help regulate traffic horse-drawn trains were required to operate in groups of four or five. This had led to horses, startled by a passing locomotive and coming off their dandy cart, being run down by the following train. On one occasion a driver fell asleep in the dandy cart of the preceding train and his horse, no longer being led, came to a stop and was run down by a locomotive. The rule book stated that locomotive-hauled trains had precedence over horse-drawn trains, but some horse drivers refused to give way and on one occasion a locomotive had to follow a horse-drawn train for over [...] The committee decided in 1828 to replace horses with locomotives on the main line, starting with the coal trains, but there was resistance from some colliery owners. After the S bought out the coach companies in August 1832, a mixed passenger and small <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> began between Stockton and Darlington on 7 September 1833, travelling at locomotive-hauled services began to Shildon in December 1833 and to Middlesbrough on 7 April 1834. The company had returned the five per cent dividend that had been promised by Edward Pease, and this had increased to eight per cent by the time he retired in 1832. When the treasurer Jonathan Backhouse retired in 1833 to become a Quaker minister he was replaced by Joseph Pease.|$|E
