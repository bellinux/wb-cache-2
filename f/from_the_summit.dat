5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact that}} the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E

5|$|In 1929 Gareloi Volcano {{underwent}} a major explosive eruption where it generated four lava flows, andesitic tuff, volcanic glass, and scoria of red tone. Thirteen craters, all {{located in the}} fissure, contributed to this episode. All are most likely phreatic. During the eruption, pyroclastic flows convened with tephra, as suggested by deposits. Lahar also streamed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mayon Volcano, the Philippines {{most active}} volcano. It {{has been the}} site of many {{different}} types of eruptions, Peléan included. Approximately 40 ravines radiate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> and provide pathways for frequent pyroclastic flows and mudslides to the lowlands below. Mayon's most violent eruption occurred in 1814 and was responsible for over 1200 deaths.|$|E
5|$|On a {{clear day}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> other visible volcanoes in the Cascade Range include Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, and Glacier Peak to the north, Mount Saint Helens to the west, all in Washington; and Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, the Three Sisters, Mount Thielsen, Mount Scott, Diamond Peak, and Mount McLoughlin, all to the south in Oregon.|$|E

5|$|The Rhyd Ddu path, {{also called}} the Beddgelert Path, leads {{from the village of}} Rhyd Ddu, west of Snowdon, gently up on to Llechog, a broad ridge {{dropping}} west <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> It {{is considered one of the}} easier routes to the summit, with the advantage that the summit is visible from the start, but is one of the least used routes. It climbs at a shallow gradient to Bwlch Main, shortly southwest of the summit, from where it climbs more steeply, meeting up with the Watkin Path at a site marked with a large standing stone a few hundred metres <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> An alternative start begins at Pitt's Head on the A4085 road.|$|E
5|$|The {{climb up}} or down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known {{accident}} spot. In winter it involves climbing down another snow cornice onto steep icy ground. There {{have been a number}} of accidents at this spot in recent years, making it as dangerous as Striding Edge.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the western}} slope that the Cog Railway ascends is {{straightforward}} from base to summit, the mountain's other sides are more complex. On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain's largest glacial cirque—forms an amphitheater {{surrounded by the}} Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. These connected peaks reach well into the treeless alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge extends northeast <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of Washington to form the amphitheater's southern wall and the incline is ascended by the Mount Washington Auto Road.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>summit</b> of Gregory Bald can {{be reached}} via several well-maintained hiking trails. <b>From</b> Cades Cove, <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> {{can be reached}} via the Gregory Ridge Trail (5.5 miles). This trail begins at the end of Forge Creek Road, which is a gravel road on the Cades Cove Loop just past the Cable Mill area. <b>From</b> Fontana, <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> is reached via the Appalachian Trail and a two-mile {{connector}} trail (7.3 miles). <b>From</b> Twentymile, <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> is reached via the Wolf Ridge Trail (7.3 miles).|$|R
5|$|The summit area is {{triangular}} in {{plan with}} ridges {{running to the}} north, south and east. The actual top is toward the northern corner and set back a little from the drop to Nethermost Cove. There is a rash of stones on the summit although the surroundings are mostly covered in rough grass, and several small cairns have been built. Other than northward, where the bulk of Helvellyn intervenes, the view is extensive, {{with much of the}} Lake District visible. Further ground is brought into view <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of High Crag.|$|E
5|$|The weather of Mount Washington is {{notoriously}} erratic. This is {{partly due to}} the convergence of several storm tracks, mainly from the Atlantic to the south, the Gulf region and the Pacific Northwest. The vertical rise of the Presidential Range, combined with its north-south orientation, makes it a significant barrier to westerly winds. Low-pressure areas are more favorable to develop along the coastline in the winter due to the relative temperature differences between the Northeastern United States and the Atlantic Ocean. With these factors combined, hurricane-force wind gusts are observed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of the mountain on average of 110 days per year.|$|E
5|$|Today the town, {{which was}} rebuilt {{following}} the war, {{is a popular}} destination for visitors to French Flanders. It is renowned for its extensive views <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of Mont Cassel and is {{the location of the}} Nord départment's principal museum of local art, history and folklore. It is also the home of the legendary giants Reuze-Papa and Reuze-Maman, which are paraded in effigy each Easter during the town's annual carnival.|$|E
5000|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>summit,</b> a long rappel {{is needed}} to reach the very steep and narrow pass between <b>the</b> two <b>summits.</b> <b>The</b> climb to <b>the</b> middle <b>summit</b> needs no equipment. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>summit</b> three rappels are needed {{to get all the}} way down to the even more steep and narrow pass between <b>the</b> two last <b>summits.</b> <b>The</b> climb up <b>the</b> lowest, western <b>summit,</b> is quite easy, but many would prefer to use a rope on a short part of <b>the</b> climb. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> western <b>summit,</b> a sharp edge leads down to the long ridge turning northwards towards lake Gjende. The rest of the descent is long talus slopes.|$|R

North of Cave Junction, US 199 leaves the Illinois River, which curves west towards the ocean, and follows several small creeks past Selma to Hayes Hill Summit (elevation about 1700 feet/500 m). The highway descends <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> alongside Slate Creek past Wonder and Wilderville and ends up in the Rogue River Valley, where it enters Grants Pass.|$|E
5|$|California debuted {{at number}} one on the US Billboard 200, moving 186,000 {{equivalent}} album units; it sold 172,000 copies in its first week, with the remainder of its unit total reflecting the album's streaming activity and track sales. It marked the band's second number one album and first in over 15 years, when Take Off Your Pants and Jacket debuted at number one in 2001. It also knocked Drake's Views <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> after having spent nine weeks at the top. The album became the band's first to top the charts in the United Kingdom, selling 24,000 copies in its debut week. The album also managed to reach higher chart positions worldwide than its predecessor Neighborhoods and outsold both its first-week and total sales in the US. As of December 2016, California has sold 408,000 units in the United States; making it the ninth best selling rock album of 2016. The album re-entered the Billboard 200 at number 17 in the week of the deluxe edition release.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Ross Williamson cites a {{tale about}} St. Collen, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the summit of the Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is made of glass so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of the Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.|$|E

5|$|In October 1843, future California {{governor}} Peter H. Burnett recounted a {{story of}} an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident. British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, {{and two years later}} Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent {{about a third of the}} way down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{the worst}} {{disasters}} on the mountain in over thirty years, six climbers—two guides, and four clients—last heard from on May28, 2014, were presumed dead on May31, 2014, when low-flying search helicopters pinged the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by the climbers. Officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after the climbers fell 3,300 feet (1,000 m) while attempting or returning <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> via the Liberty Ridge climbing route. Searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on the Carbon Glacier at , possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing, though the exact cause of the accident is unknown. The bodies of three of the guest climbers were spotted on August7, 2014, during a training flight and subsequently recovered on August19, 2014. The bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located.|$|E
5|$|Six days later, on {{the advice}} of Stepan Khojiants, the village chief of Akhuri, the ascent was {{attempted}} from the northwest side. After reaching an elevation of , they turned back because they did not reach the summit before sundown. They reached the summit on their third attempt at 3:15 p.m. on October 9, 1829. Abovian dug a hole in the ice and erected a wooden cross facing north. Abovian picked up a chunk of ice <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> and carried it down with him in a bottle, considering the water holy. On November 8, Parrot and Abovian climbed up Lesser Ararat. Years later, in 1845, the German mineralogist Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich climbed Ararat with Abovian. Abovian's third and last ascent of Ararat was with the Englishman Henry Danby Seymour in 1846.|$|E
