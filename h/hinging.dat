5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was <b>hinging</b> on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York.

The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E

Saville {{graduated}} in May 1934, {{at the top}} of his class, and remained at the school as an instructor in the Maps and Photographs Section. At ACTS, Saville joined Claire L. Chennault in favoring an air defense strategy <b>hinging</b> on a strong fighter force. Saville argued against the so-called Bomber Mafia; he did not believe that fleets of bombers were unstoppable, and he considered close coordination between ground units and tactical air power a key part of Army doctrine. In July 1935, at the temporary rank of captain, he was named recorder of the Air Corps Board at Maxwell Field, in addition to his duties as fighter aviation instructor. Saville removed a degree of independent command from fighter squadron leaders who previously could ignore instructions radioed from the ground. Backed by Brigadier General Henry Conger Pratt, Saville's unpopular control methods proved their worth, as ground controllers were often in possession of better information than squadron leaders in flight. From 1935 to 1937, as Chennault was eased out by the bomber advocates, Saville took his place as the top fighter proponent. Saville avoided Chennault's fate by refraining from disputing the bomber's important role in offensive operations. He felt that the fighter aircraft was undervalued in its defensive role.|$|E

25|$|Like many auks, puffins eat both {{fish and}} zooplankton, but feed their chicks {{primarily}} with small marine fish {{several times a}} day. The prey species of the Atlantic puffin include the sandeel, herring and capelin. The puffins are distinct {{in their ability to}} hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer foraging trips, since they can come back with more food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behaviour is made possible by the unique <b>hinging</b> mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.|$|E

25|$|Safety {{syringes}} {{help reduce}} occurrences of accidental needlesticks. One {{of the most}} recent developments has been the auto-disable injection device. These injection devices automatically disable after a single use. This can be done by retracting the needle back into the syringe or rendering the syringe plunger inoperable. With the injection device now inoperable, it cannot be reused. Shielding the needle after the injection is another approach for safe management of sharps. These are hands free methods usually involving a <b>hinging</b> cap that can be pressed on a table to seal the needle. Another technology in sharps waste management relating to injections is the needle remover. Varying approaches can be taken with the main goal to separate the needle from the syringe. This allows the sharp needle to be quarantined and disposed of separate from the syringe. There is debate around the use of these devices as they involved in additional step in the handling of sharps waste.|$|E
25|$|No. 616 Squadron {{exchanged}} its F.1s for {{the first}} Meteor F.3s on 18December 1944. These first 15 F.3s differed from the F.1 in having a sliding canopy {{in place of the}} sideways <b>hinging</b> canopy, increased fuel capacity and some airframe refinements. They were still powered by Welland I engines. Later F.3s were equipped with the Derwent I engines. This was a substantial improvement over the earlier mark, although the basic design still had not reached its potential. Wind tunnel and flight tests demonstrated that the original short nacelles, which did not extend far fore and aft of the wing, contributed heavily to compressibility buffeting at high speed. New, longer nacelles not only cured some of the compressibility problems but added 120km/h (75mph) at altitude, even without upgraded powerplants. The last batch of Meteor F.3s featured the longer nacelles; other F.3s were retrofitted in the field with the new nacelles. The F.3 also had the new Rolls-Royce Derwent engines, increased fuel capacity, and a new larger, more strongly raked bubble canopy.|$|E

40|$|Flexure <b>hinges</b> {{have been}} used to produce {{frictionless}} and backlashless transmissions in a variety of precision mechanisms. Although there are many types of flexure <b>hinges</b> avail-able, designers often chose a single type of flexure <b>hinge</b> (e. g., circular flexure <b>hinges)</b> without considering others in the design of flexure-based mechanisms. This is because the analytical equations are unique to each kind of flexure <b>hinge.</b> This work offers a solution to this problem {{in the form of a}} generalized flexure <b>hinge</b> model. We propose a new class of flexure <b>hinges,</b> namely, elliptical-arc-fillet flexure <b>hinges,</b> which brings elliptical arc, circular-arc-fillet, elliptical-fillet, elliptical, circular, circular-fillet, and right-circular flexure <b>hinges</b> together under one set of equations.

40|$|Abstract Background Relating {{features}} of protein sequences to structural <b>hinges</b> {{is important for}} identifying domain boundaries, understanding structure-function relationships, and designing flexibility into proteins. Efforts in this field have been hampered {{by the lack of}} a proper dataset for studying characteristics of <b>hinges.</b> Results Using the Molecular Motions Database we have created a <b>Hinge</b> Atlas of manually annotated <b>hinges</b> and a statistical formalism for calculating the enrichment of various types of residues in these <b>hinges.</b> Conclusion We found various correlations between <b>hinges</b> and sequence features. Some of these are expected; for instance, we found that <b>hinges</b> tend to occur on the surface and in coils and turns and to be enriched with small and hydrophilic residues. Others are less obvious and intuitive. In particular, we found that <b>hinges</b> tend to coincide with active sites, but unlike the latter they are not at all conserved in evolution. We evaluate the potential for <b>hinge</b> prediction based on sequence. Motions {{play an important role in}} catalysis and protein-ligand interactions. <b>Hinge</b> bending motions comprise the largest class of known motions. Therefore it is important to relate the <b>hinge</b> location to sequence features such as residue type, physicochemical class, secondary structure, solvent exposure, evolutionary conservation, and proximity to active sites. To do this, we first generated the <b>Hinge</b> Atlas, a set of protein motions with the <b>hinge</b> locations manually annotated, and then studied the coincidence of these features with the <b>hinge</b> location. We found that all of the features have bearing on the <b>hinge</b> location. Most interestingly, we found that <b>hinges</b> tend to occur at or near active sites and yet unlike the latter are not conserved. Less surprisingly, we found that <b>hinge</b> residues tend to be small, not hydrophobic or aliphatic, and occur in turns and random coils on the surface. A functional sequence based <b>hinge</b> predictor was made which uses some of the data generated in this study. The <b>Hinge</b> Atlas is made available to the community for further flexibility studies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Flexure <b>hinges</b> are {{advantageous}} {{for use in}} high-precision applications {{because of}} their lack of hysteresis, friction and backlash. However, their range of motion is limited due to increasing stresses and a decreasing support stiffness at large strokes. Currently available <b>hinges</b> are typically designed for strokes of up to 10 ∘ and {{only a small number}} of <b>hinges</b> achieve a stroke of 40 ∘. In this paper we present <b>hinge</b> concepts with a stroke up to 90 ∘. On the one hand, the conceptual design of such <b>hinges</b> is addressed and, on the other hand, a method to optimise the design of such <b>hinges</b> is presented. The <b>hinge</b> performance is measured by evaluating the natural frequency of the second relevant eigenmode of the <b>hinge</b> with a specific load. For best performance the minimal value for this frequency throughout the full operating range is maximised. Analysing known <b>hinge</b> concepts in view of this criterion gives insight in the strengths and weaknesses of these <b>hinges.</b> This knowledge helps to improve the <b>hinge</b> layout. Also the possibility of stacking multiple <b>hinges</b> is considered. To find the optimal geometric parameters of a given design, a numerical optimisation routine is formulated and implemented, making use of the tools present in the ANSYS finite element program. Two types of conceptual <b>hinges</b> are synthesised and optimised for a range of ± 45 ∘. Their behaviour is studied and compared to a commonly used three flexure cross <b>hinge</b> that is also optimised for this large stroke. A significant performance gain is found for the new <b>hinge</b> concepts. The paper shows that it is possible to design flexure <b>hinges</b> for large strokes of up to 90 ∘.
