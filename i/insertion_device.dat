Each cell has two bending magnets detuned to allow some dispersion in the straights – the so-called double-bend achromat structure – and thus reduce the overall beam size. As {{well as the}} two bend magnets each cell has three families of quadrupole magnets and two families of sextupole magnets. The ring circumference is 171m, with a straight section length of 5.2m. The CLS is {{the smallest of the}} newer synchrotron facilities, which results in a relatively high horizontal beam emittance of 18.2nm-rad.

Fields with <b>insertion</b> <b>devices</b> are considered to be periodic in the longitudinal direction with period length s. The magnetic fields of the different types of magnet structure, namely AGID, APID and EPU, are derived and discussed.

40|$|The Advanced Photon Source (APS) uses Nd-Fe-B {{permanent}} magnets in the <b>insertion</b> <b>devices</b> to produce x-rays for scientific research [1, 2]. Earlier investigations have exhibited {{varying degrees of}} demagnetization of these magnets [3] due to irradiation from electron beams [4, 5, 6], {sup 60 }Co {gamma}-rays [5], and high-energy neutrons [7, 8]. Radiation-induced demagnetization has been observed in the APS <b>insertion</b> <b>devices</b> [9] and was first measured in December of 2001. Partial demagnetization has also been observed in <b>insertion</b> <b>devices</b> at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) [4, 6], where Nd-Fe-B {{permanent magnets}} are also used. Growing concern for the lifetime of APS <b>insertion</b> <b>devices,</b> {{as well as the}} permanent magnets that will be used in next-generation, high-power light sources, like the FEL [10, 11], resulted from the partial demagnetization observations made at both facilities. This concern in relation to radiation-induced demagnetization spurred a long-term project to measure and analyze the absorbed doses received by the APS <b>insertion</b> <b>devices.</b> The project required a reliable photon high-dose dosimetry technique capable of measuring absorbed doses greater than 10 {sup 6 } rad, which was not readily available at the APS. Through a collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), one such technique using radiachromic films was considered, tested, and calibrated at the APS. This consequently led to the implementation of radiachromic film dosimetry for measuring the absorbed doses received by the <b>insertion</b> <b>devices</b> for each of the APS runs...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>insertion</b> <b>device</b> (ID) is a {{component}} in modern synchrotron light sources, so called {{because they are}} [...] "inserted" [...] into accelerator track. They are periodic magnetic structures that stimulate highly brilliant, forward-directed synchrotron radiation emission by forcing a stored charged particle beam to perform wiggles, or undulations, as they pass through the device. This motion {{is caused by the}} Lorentz force, and it is from this oscillatory motion that we get the names for the two classes of device, which are known as wigglers and undulators.As well as creating a brighter light, some insertion devices enable tuning of the light so that different frequencies can be generated for different applications.|$|E
50|$|A wiggler is an <b>insertion</b> <b>device</b> in a synchrotron. It is {{a series}} of magnets {{designed}} to periodically laterally deflect ('wiggle') a beam of charged particles (invariably electrons or positrons) inside a storage ring of a synchrotron. These deflections create a change in acceleration which in turn produces emission of broad synchrotron radiation tangent to the curve, much like that of a bending magnet, but the intensity is higher due to the contribution of many magnetic dipoles in the wiggler. Furthermore, as the wavelength (λ) is decreased this means the frequency (ƒ) has increased. This increase of frequency is directly proportional to energy, hence, the wiggler creates a wavelength of light with a larger energy.|$|E
50|$|At a large {{synchrotron}} facility {{there will}} be many beamlines, each optimised for a particular field of research. The differences will depend on the type of <b>insertion</b> <b>device</b> (which, in turn, determines the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation); the beam conditioning equipment; and the experimental end station. A typical beamline at a modern synchrotron facility will be 25 to 100 m long from the storage ring to the end station, and may cost up to millions of US dollars. For this reason, a synchrotron facility is often built in stages, with the first few beamlines opening on day one of operation, and other beamlines being added later as the funding permits.|$|E

40|$|When it {{goes into}} {{operation}} in 2016, the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring {{will be the first}} ultralow-emittance storage ring based on a multibend achromat lattice. Such ultralow-emittance rings make use {{of a large number of}} weak bending magnets which leads to low radiation losses in the dipoles compared to power radiated from <b>insertion</b> <b>devices.</b> Therefore, the emittance in such rings depends strongly on the <b>insertion</b> <b>devices</b> and gap settings. The large stored current along with the low transverse emittance lead to strong intrabeam scattering which blows up the beam's 6 D emittance. The Touschek lifetime depends on the 6 D emittance: it grows with increasing longitudinal emittance which makes bunch lengthening cavities attractive. On the other hand, in the ultralow-emittance regime, reducing the transverse emittance actually increases the Touschek lifetime. Damping wigglers and <b>insertion</b> <b>devices</b> reduce the transverse emittance, but they can also increase the Touschek lifetime by reducing the available cavity overvoltage and thus increasing the bunch length. Using the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring as an example, this paper demonstrates the intricate interplay between transverse emittance (<b>insertion</b> <b>devices,</b> emittance coupling), longitudinal emittance (tuning of main cavities as well as harmonic cavities), and choice of stored current in an ultralow-emittance ring as well as its implications for brightness optimization...|$|R
5000|$|An {{undulator}} is an <b>insertion</b> <b>device</b> from high-energy {{physics and}} usually {{part of a}} larger installation, a synchrotron storage ring, or it may be a component of a free electron laser. It consists of a periodic structure of dipole magnets. The static magnetic field is alternating {{along the length of the}} undulator with a wavelength [...] Electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to undergo oscillations and thus to radiate energy. The radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum. It is also collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons. This radiation is guided through beamlines for experiments in various scientific areas.|$|E

Two of the straight sections are used to host the storage ring 500 MHz RF cavities, which are essential for replacing the energy that the beam loses through synchrotron radiation.
