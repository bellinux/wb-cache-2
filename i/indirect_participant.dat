40|$|When {{scholars}} have covered {{events like the}} Wounded Knee Massacre comprehensively, the record of an unlikely observer or <b>indirect</b> <b>participant</b> can provide a fresh and valuable perspective. The correspondence of John Vance Lauderdale offers the views of one surgeon at the Pine Ridge Reservation whose participation in the Native American stereotypes of the time is complicated by {{his involvement in the}} aftermath of the Massacre and his personal interaction with individual Lakota. To reconstruct Lauderdale 2 ̆ 7 s situation, Jerry Green offers an extensive introduction divided into three sections dealing with the surgeon 2 ̆ 7 s personal background, the medical department 2 ̆ 7 s practices, and the conditions on the Sioux reservations in the Dakotas. Each section is informative and well-constructed; the transition from the introduction to the letters, however, is abrupt and awkward, drawing attention away from the intimate association of general and personal history that distinguishes the letters themselves. Green wisely includes Lauderdale 2 ̆ 7 s complete correspondence from 1 January to 3 March 1891. The letters condemn the mismanagement of the Department of the Interior and the corruption of Indian Agents. They also address Lauderdale 2 ̆ 7 s difficulties understanding his Lakota patients and comment on his relations with fellow officers, missionaries, and colleagues. Yet mixed with these observations are complaints about army service, advice to his family, and gossip about his acquaintances. Although Lauderdale participates in the events of Wounded Knee, he is not absorbed by them. Consequently, his letters offer a unique perspective on how larger events are integrated into one individual 2 ̆ 7 s life. The value of this perspective can be seen by comparing his general comments on N ative Americans with his p 2 ̆ 7 ersonal comments on the Sioux physician Charles Eastman and his fiancee, the New England missionary and school teacher Elaine Goodale. His respect for each and his easy acceptance of their relationship complicate the earlier ethnocentric observations Green provides in the introduction. Lauderdale 2 ̆ 7 s responses to such personal relations, preserved in the unpolished, immediate notice of his letters, testify to their value in understanding the complexities of Indianwhite relations. For that reason alone, his letters contribute to our understanding of the events surrounding the Wounded Knee Massacre...|$|E
40|$|Domino Servite School (DSS) is {{a private}} school, founded in 1986, and {{situated}} on KwaSizabantu (KSB) mission station in the Natal midlands. This research into DSS is a case study which aims to present an illuminative evaluation in the Whole School genre, within that branch of educational research concerned with effective schools. The project aimed {{to make use of}} a compatibility paradigm accommodating nomothetic and anthropological data. In attempting triangulation of methodological approaches, it tried to establish the extent to which DSS may be considered an efficient and effective 'New Private' school. It also aimed to understand the school's raison d'ětre. In order to illuminate the relevance and social processes of DSS, evaluation made use of internal and external referents. The internal investigation sought to make judgements in reference to the efficiency of the school as an organisation. On the macro-level, whole school evaluation required extensive curriculum evaluation. On the micro-level, appraisal of teaching and assessment of pupil performance was undertaken. This internal investigation required a critical analysis of the school's formal, informal and hidden curriculum. The external evaluation sought to make judgement in reference to the effectiveness of DSS. On the macro-level, this required evaluation of the findings of the internal investigation in terms of a broader South African context. Implications, for example of the school's 'private' status, and its 'Christian' curriculum in respect of multi-culturalism, education for nationhood, and ethnicity were examined. The analysis of these dimensions paid attention to the school's spatial context in terms of both its 'rural' and missionary setting. Here the focus was on the school's formal curriculum. Analysis of the inter-relational context paid attention to its informal curriculum or {{the way in which the}} school deals with the commonality and diversity of its clientele and staff. The inter-relational context of the school examined the hidden curriculum, or the relationship between the school and the broader South African Community. A critical ethnographic account of this institution was therefore possible because of the dual focus on the internal and external evaluation reference points. Internal evaluation made extensive use of direct (non-participant) observation, structured and nonstructured interviews, questionnaires, and documentary analysis. <b>Indirect</b> (<b>participant)</b> observation, in particular Clinical Supervision (CS), was also used. Indirect (non-participant) observation made extensive use of Flanders' Interaction Analysis Categories (FIAC). Teacher self-evaluation was also included, while analysis of pupil performance made use of 'standardised' achievement testing and a tracer study. External evaluation required detailed study of local and international literature on issues relating to private schooling, rural and multi-cultural education, education for nationhood and ethnicity. The research found that much of the school's curriculum path is incongruous with its rural context largely because of its association with the former Department of Education and Training (DET), and because of its missionary heritage. As such the school is presently (1) located within a questionable (formal) curriculum tradition which has little relevance to, nor potential for, the transformational needs of either rural Natal or South Africa in general. However, this does not preclude the possibility of the school making a contribution to education for development in South Africa. (2) The school advocates a mono-cultural Christian value system and modified cultural pluralism which attempts to assimilate pupils from diverse socio-economic and ideologically homogeneous backgrounds. Multi-cultural education, plural values, religious and values democracy are therefore not part of the school's raison d'ětre. (3) The school, through its associated organisation Christians for Truth (CFT), represents a social view espousing either a modified cultural pluralism or multi-nationalism which allows for allegiance to a transcendent value system without compromising group values and associations. This means that the school aims at assimilating or amalgamating diversity into a mono-cultural unity that transcends group identity. This transcendent culture is defined in Christian terms. The study recommends inter alia, further investigation into the educational implications of_values neutrality and the particularism of secular humanism; a comparative analysis of a random sample of private missionary schools and ordinary state controlled rural schools so that more generalisable results might be obtained; and a more thorough investigation into the parental and pupil contributions to the school, their attitudes and perspectives on missionary education and their feelings about the management styles evident in the organisation. ...|$|E

Five specific strategies were used to create a high degree of connection between the World Literature course and the Music Appreciation course that formed the learning community: 1) Exploring the formal connections between literature and music; 2) Organizing the class by movements in intellectual history common to both disciplines; 3) Focusing on musical works inspired by works of literature; 4) Selecting music and literature from identical non-Western regions; and 5) Combining course web supplements for both courses into a single, “super site ” web page.

In day-ahead markets, DR aggregator schedules those contracts and submits accumulated DR offers to the system operator. The objective is to maximize the profit of the DR aggregator. The key element affecting the bidding decision and aggregator's profit is the uncertain hourly DA prices. The stochastic programming adopts scenario-based approach for helping the profit-seeking DR aggregator control uncertainties. Robust optimization employs forecast values with bounded price intervals to address uncertainties while adjusting the robustness of the solution flexibly.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{contemporary and}} historical roles {{of women in}} war, focusing upon a reduction in gender role stereotypes due to women?s expanded activities (e. g. as direct combatants) {{as well as the}} adoption of so-called ?masculine? roles that maintain and support military practices. Background: Narratives from a variety of disciplines have focused upon ?masculinity? as a military ideal that enables the recruitment of a willing army and the maintenance of a supporting wartime industry, with women viewed primarily as supporters of pacifism. Such stereotypes overlook contemporary and historical examples of women as direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>participants</b> in war, and psychological inquiries into such phenomena have placed minimal emphasis to date upon women?s adoption of so-called ?masculine? roles in this context. Methods: Investigative psychology in the UK now reflects a more robust and systematically eclectic qualitative approach. The present study adapts methods pioneered in the performing arts to thematic analysis, applying an investigative method that is relatively new for psychology ? namely, ?poetic inquiry? ? to access data otherwise inaccessible when seeking to make sense of a respondent?s personal experiences. Conclusions: Analysing men?s and women?s poetry about wartime roles and experiences further enables psychologists to explain how gender role stereotypes have been eroded and reconstructed. Data from the present study help to explain how: (1) wartime roles are not merely an issue of ?masculine? versus ?feminine? characteristics; (2) ?masculinity? is just a ?label? in this context; and (3) it is the rationalisation of violence that underlies the continued legitimisation of war.

The authors state that one and the same sports situation can constructively or destructively affect the psychological safety of direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>participants</b> of sports events. In this context, it is important to create the psycholinguistic basis of experimental research of psychological safety in sports. Great attention is paid to systematization of the content of the concept “psychological safety in sports”. The created models of words and expressions that convey ideas about this phenomenon are of particular value. In the structure of the concept the dominant meanings, expressed in the nucleus, and additional meanings, related to the periphery of the concept are distinguished. Purpose: to explore the ideas of psychological safety in sports and their representation in printed or verbal form; to determine ways of overcoming the conceptual psycholinguistic problems in the process of experimental research of psychological safety in sports; to create the model of words and expressions which are used to verbalize the concept “psychological safety in sports”.

Unfortunately, myriad research in social psychology has demonstrated that people are very poor judges of their own levels of accomplishment. In this paper, the social psychological dynamics that contribute to biased self-assessments are overviewed. These include the self-serving bias (e. g., Miller & Ross, 1975), the better-than-average effect (e. g., Alicke et al., 1995; Brown, 1986), and the overconfidence phenomenon (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Methods of correcting these biased reports are generally ineffective, as illustrated by Kruger and Dunning's (1999) findings that people lowest in mastery generally lack the metacognition even to understand what mastery looks like. As this type of person learns the skill in question, they often realize {{the level of their}} ignorance and lower their self-reported knowledge and skill levels.

Lifespan cueing found nonbelieved memories to be most frequent in middle childhood (ages 6 – 11).

Chapter 1 outlines the problems based on up to now findings especially foreign historical science.

In association with the thematic areas, it is possible {{to pay attention to the}} problems of duels. In this Chapter is also a detailed introduction to the chosen methodological solution { [...] } historical-anthropological draft of honour in the Early Modern Period. The Early Modern Period is based on many categories as e. g. inward and outward honour, honour of a male and a female or individual and collective honour. Chapter 2 puts the Early Modern Period in a spatiotemporal context and tries to introduce not only the predecessor in the way of medieval court duels, aristocratic hate perhaps even knightly tournaments but also his successors in the way of strictly ritualistic duels of the long 19 th century. A special attention is paid to an analysis of duel books of references of the 19 th century, which is supposed to serve as a solution for the third chapter. Chapter 3 is a personal analysis of the Early Modern Period considering all possible aspects which are possible to be discovered in the context. Attention is paid to all possible reasons of the beginning of the Early Modern Period duels, direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>participants,</b> circumstances which accompanied the Early Modern Period as well as potential results for all parties concerned. The Early Modern duel should be roughly outlined as an original development in the history of duels in terms of untold references in the source of personal nature and personal research.

If sweet-smelling strawberry and caramel odours really do share this perceptual characteristic in common with sweet tasting sucrose, then frequency estimates for sucrose should be overestimated relative to non-sweet tastes.

Drawing significantly on two methodological approaches, comparative case study and grounded theory, this dissertation examines three controversies in which government officials challenged academic scientists' federally sponsored research, which had implications for national environmental policies. To structure this examination, I used a two- part framework. For the first part, I investigated the evolving interpretations of events and actors' interests, which revealed the tactics and pressures employed by government officials when challenging the academic scientists' federally sponsored research. For the second part, I used Freidson's theory of professional dominance to help us understand how and in what ways institutionalized arrangements within society supported the academic profession's autonomy and authority over its work. This analysis identified the means by which the academic scientists in my three cases exerted some degree of control over scientific decisions regarding the research assumptions, methods, and analyses of their findings. The study's key findings are presented in the form of five research claims: First, the government challengers may try - sometimes successfully - to exercise their influence over <b>indirect</b> <b>participants</b> in the federally funded research in an attempt to control the dissemination of the federally sponsored research findings. Second, the government challengers, though not scientists themselves, relied heavily on their own judgment to declare publicly the kinds of activities that can and cannot count as legitimate scientific research, rather than relying on the traditional scientific peer-review process. Third, academic scientists may involve members of the public in the dispute. When that happens, the public may help decide whether government officials or academic scientists are better equipped to address the scientific matters associated with the federal policy. Fourth, academic scientists' political allies can support academic scientists' efforts to defend their research within the policymakers' setting. Fifth, academic scientists may assert academic conventions (e. g., peer review) as the standard (or possibly as the preferred) practice through which to evaluate science, even when government challengers question the validity of those conventions. Placed in context of the extant literature, these claims, taken together, suggest that the government officials tried to take actions that exceed their professional competence, specifically as boundary breakers who attempted to infiltrate the jurisdictional responsibilities of the academic scientists. In addition, despite the government officials' attempts to engage in professional boundary-crossing activities, the academic scientists asserted institutionalized practices and standards of the profession (e. g., peer review and open dialogue) and drew on the assistance of external actors (i. e., members of the public and political allies) as countervailing forces to exert control over their research...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{asked whether}} {{standing}} posture {{could be controlled}} relative to audible oscillation of the environment. Blindfolded sighted adults were exposed to acoustic flow in a moving room, {{and were asked to}} move so as to maintain a constant distance between their head and the room. Acoustic flow had direct (source) and <b>indirect</b> (reflected) components. <b>Participants</b> exhibited strong coupling of postural motion with room motion, even when direct information about room motion was masked and was available only in reflected sound. Patterns of hip–ankle coordination closely resembled patterns observed in previous research involving coupling of sway with a visible moving room. The results demonstrate that blindfolded adults can control the dynamics of stance relative to motion of the audible environment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an ontology-based approach to interaction of users and mobile robots for joint task solving. The use of ontologies allows supporting semantic interoperability between robots. The ontologies store {{knowledge about the}} tasks to be performed, knowledge about the functionality of robots and the current situation factors like a robot location or busyness. Ontologies are published in a smart space which allows <b>indirect</b> interaction between <b>participants.</b> On {{the basis of the}} knowledge, a robot can define a task that is to be performed and get the current status of other robots. The paper presents a reference model of the approach to indirect interaction between mobile robots for joint task solving, an ontology model for the knowledge organization, and application of the presented approach for the scenario for obstacle overcoming...|$|R
40|$|Online social {{networking}} (e. g., Facebook), {{has become a}} significant part of many individual???s lives as a way to communicate with friends or family members and to express emotions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to consider the impact that online {{social networking}} could have on the types of interactions individuals engage in and how satisfied they are with their current level of social support. Respondents consisted of 130 students at California State University, Stanislaus. The Social Support Questionnaire was used to examine levels of perceived and received support. The researcher examined whether participants would report having more perceived support (greater number of friends) when they exclusively consider their indirect contact (i. e., Facebook friends), in comparison to when participants exclusively consider their direct contact (face-to-face contact). This study also examined whether participants would report having more received support (higher rating of satisfaction) when exclusively considering their direct contact, in comparison to when participants exclusively consider their <b>indirect</b> contact. <b>Participants</b> perceived more social support from individuals with whom they typically engaged in direct interactions, rather than individuals with whom they primarily communicated with via Facebook. Furthermore, participants reported receiving social support at a higher level of satisfaction through direct interactions than through indirect interactions. These results suggest that individuals are not using Facebook as a replacement for direct interactions, but rather as possibly only an extension of direct contact...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the interaction of}} structure and convention {{in the emergence of}} schemes for joint reference in the context of <b>indirect</b> category learning. <b>Participants</b> worked individually or in dyads to learn a set of functionally-defined categories, instantiated as supposed alien creatures. The perceptual structure of these categories was complex: one function could be predicted by a unidimensional rule but the other was defined by a family-resemblance substructure. In addition to the main function-prediction task, each learner worked individually to sort the exemplars (pre- and post-function prediction) and in an individual prediction test that yielded selective attention data. Dyadic learners predicted the functional features with significantly greater accuracy compared to individual learners. This dyadic advantage was even greater for predicting the simple rule-based function compared to the FR function. Also, the post-task sorts produced by dyadic learners correlated more closely to the true categories than did those of individual learners...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{the first attempt}} to study the emerging online peer-to-peer (P 2 P) barter markets, in which individuals trade goods or services {{without the use of}} money. Using detailed transaction data from a leading P 2 P barter marketplace for books, we examine how the norm of reciprocity affects transaction outcomes. We find that although the barter marketplace is designed under the norm of <b>indirect</b> reciprocity, market <b>participants</b> also exhibit a strong preference towards direct reciprocity. We further find that both indirect reciprocity and direct reciprocity affect transactions, but in different ways. While both forms of reciprocity help improve the probability of success of a transaction, only direct reciprocity helps facilitate the fulfillment speed of a transaction. We also provide evidence that direct reciprocity is favored for exchanging rare goods. We discuss the implication of our findings for the design of P 2 P barter marketplaces...|$|R
