40|$|The {{installation}} {{and operation of}} systems that exploit solar energy through photovoltaic conversion, recently promoted in some European countries by new sell-back tariffs, is a relevant transformation of the territory for various reasons (land use, elimination of the existing vegetation, visual impact on {{the components of the}} landscape, microclimate change, glare from the reflection of the direct sunlight). The weak energy intensity of the solar source coupled with the low conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic cells, make the physical dimensions of such systems relevant and, with them, also the environmental, territorial and landscape impacts that basically depend on the physical extent of the system. If {{it is well known that}} an incentive to the exploitation of renewable sources is one of the features of the policy of land conservation, including the one of the protected areas, at the same time the concerns of local communities and governments about the environmental, territorial and landscape impacts of this technology are increasing rapidly. Given this picture, this work is intended to clarify the territorial impacts of the ground mounted photovoltaic systems. Later, the paper concentrates on a specific impact, which is the assessment of the risk of <b>glare</b> <b>by</b> <b>reflection</b> of direct sunlight from the surfaces of photovoltaic modules. The methodologies that can be used to assess this impact and the outcomes of an evaluation carried out for a 5000 Â m 2 PV system currently designed on a hilly territory in Italy are presented.

40|$|Abstract. Coxeter groups {{arise in}} a wide variety of areas, so every {{mathematician}} should know some basic facts about them, including their connection to “Dynkin diagrams. ” Proofs about these “groups generated <b>by</b> <b>reflections</b> ” mainly use group theory, geometry, and combinatorics. This talk will briefly explain: • what it means to say that G is a “group generated <b>by</b> <b>reflections</b> ” (or, equivalently, that G is a “Coxeter group”); • what it means to say that G is “of type An, Bn, or Dn”, and • that all but finitely many of the “irreducible ” finite groups generated <b>by</b> <b>reflections</b> are either dihedral groups or belong to these types. For further reading, see [1, Chap. 1], [2], or [3]. 1. What is a group generated <b>by</b> <b>reflections?</b> Example.
