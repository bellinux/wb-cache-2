500|$|Pacer is a {{favourite}} {{album of}} actor Elijah Wood, who said [...] "I think Pacer has everything. It's kind of experimental; there's {{a lot of}} vocal experimentation on the record. I love the recording. [...] The drums are very abrasive and raw, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>everything.</b> There's an incredible mix of pop songs and weird, kind of abrasive almost punk rock songs, and there's real beauty I think on this record." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} less positive reviews as well. Rahul Gairola of PopMatters wrote that while [...] "the pilot lays the usual groundwork by showing how the characters' lives are intertwined, it also demonstrates immediately the sitcom's major drawback, that the stereotypical gay character is the stand-out comic figure." [...] A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times said [...] "there's something {{not quite right}} about this show's approach to homosexuality... <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> to do with Will's attitude. It approaches asexual, his gayness appearing to exist solely as a device {{to give him the}} moral authority to repeatedly ridicule the mincing manner of his bandanna-wearing homosexual friend, Jack, without being labeled homophobic." [...] Suite101.com's Hana Lewis thought it was [...] "regrettable" [...] that the pilot's jokes revolved [...] "solely around gay stereotypes and sexual innuendo". Some reviewers were also skeptical {{about the future of the}} show. [...] One such review said, [...] "If Will & Grace can somehow survive a brutal time period opposite football and Ally McBeal, it could grow into a reasonably entertaining little [...] — that is, a series about a man and a woman who have no sexual interest in one another. But don't bet on it. If it's a doomed relationships viewers want, they'll probably opt for Ally." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{combines}} the downtuned riffs of nu metal/alternative metal with elements of New Jersey hardcore, hip hop, jazz and hard rock. Regarding the album's sound, rhythm guitarist Joey D'Amico remarked in September 2001 that [...] "the music is definitely emotional, but its hardcore in its roots". Songs such as [...] "Falling Down" [...] and [...] "Rejection" [...] feature a volatile brand of singing which frequently alternates between melodic crooning, rapping and more extreme vocal stylings. Jordan Plingos stated [...] "If somebody asks {{me what this}} band sounds like, I say 'go listen to 'Falling Down,' because <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>everything.</b> It starts off fast and heavy and brutal, and then, from the bridge and chorus to the end, it makes you cry. That song right there covers it all." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It had {{a massive}} chorus, an {{instantly}} memorable melody and lyric, {{and was a}} natural transition from the B.o.B and Travie McCoy songs ... it didn’t sound like anything else on the radio. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> we could want in a first single for Bruno." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but Paucis was not {{a common}} cat, Amuba. It {{did not want to}} catch mice and birds for a living. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> <b>it</b> could {{possibly}} want--cushions to lie on, and fresh water and milk to drink, and plenty of everything to eat." ...|$|R
2500|$|.....crystallized {{the essence}} of the band. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> there and showed the band at its best... as a band, as a unit. Not talking about solos or anything, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> there. We were careful never to release it as a single. It was a {{milestone}} for us. Every musician wants to do something of lasting quality, something which will hold up {{for a long time and}} I guess we did it with [...] "Stairway". [...] Townshend probably thought that he got it with Tommy. I don't know whether I have the ability to come up with more. I have to do a lot of hard work before I can get anywhere near those stages of consistent, total brilliance.|$|R
2500|$|Game Revolution's Calvin Hubble {{rated the}} game an A-, calling it [...] "both {{one of the}} best sequels to hit the scene and one of the finest titles on the RTS market." [...] He too felt it {{improved}} on the original, writing, [...] "Bungie did an excellent job at reading the faults of the original by making change where change was needed and leaving the successful areas alone." [...] He praised the level design and gameplay variety, citing [...] "some of the most creative and immersive environments in the industry." [...] He also lauded the graphics and multiplayer mode, concluding [...] "Myth II offers the best real-time strategy experience in the industry. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> that made Myth {{one of the best}} games of last year, plus a free set of steak knives [...] Myth II is simply one of the best sequels ever designed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ryan Lindsay of CBR gave issue #4 {{three stars}} writing, [...] "The Fearless Defenders #4 is an {{entertaining}} issue {{chock full of}} story and solid moments. Bunn packs the pages with dialogue, which can feel bulky at times, but it means he can chock in {{quite a lot of}} narrative for one issue." [...] Lima also gave issue #4 four stars writing, [...] "This issue is very balanced: <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> from mystery to humor and the pacing is really good. Of the issues before it, this is certainly {{one of the best in}} the way that it showcases these characters individually whilst continuing to develop a story that is both interesting and entertaining." [...] Grey again gave it a 7.9 writing, [...] "Now that the personalities of the Fearless Defenders are slotting into place and the shady force behind the rise of the Doom Maidens is amping up her villainy, The Fearless Defenders is shaping up to be one of the more unique and enjoyable titles in Marvel's monthly lineup." ...|$|E

In fact, not Australia only, but all Australasia has levied tribute upon the flora {{of the rest of}} the world; and wherever one goes the results appear, in gardens private and public, in the woodsy walls of the highways, and in even the forests. If you see a curious or beautiful tree or bush or flower, and ask about it, the people, answering, usually name a foreign country as the place of its origin--India, Africa, Japan, China, England, America, Java, Sumatra, New Guinea, Polynesia, and so on.|$|E
6000|$|I am myself {{primarily}} {{opposed to}} Socialism, or Collectivism or Bolshevism or whatever we call it, for a primary reason not immediately involved here: {{the ideal of}} property. I say the ideal and not merely the idea; and this alone disposes of the moral mistake in the matter. It disposes of all the dreary doubts of the Anti-Socialists about men not yet being angels, and all the yet drearier hopes of the Socialists about men soon being supermen. I do not admit that private property is a concession to baseness and selfishness; I {{think it is a}} point of honour. I think it is the most truly popular of all points of honour. But this, though <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> to do with my plea for a domestic dignity, {{has nothing to do with}} this passing summary of the situation of Socialism. I only remark in passing that it is vain for the more vulgar sort of Capitalist, sneering at ideals, to say to me that in order to have Socialism [...] "You must alter human nature." [...] I answer [...] "Yes. You must alter it for the worse." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{palace of}} Hampton Court was first founded and built {{from the ground}} by that great statesman and {{favourite}} of King Henry VIII, Cardinal Wolsey; and if it be a just observation anywhere, as is made from {{the situation of the}} old abbeys and monasteries, the clergy were excellent judges of the beauty and pleasantness of the country, and chose always to plant in the best; I say, if it was a just observation in any case, it was in this; for if there be a situation on the whole river between Staines Bridge and Windsor Bridge pleasanter than another, it is this of Hampton; close to the river, yet not offended by the rising of its waters in floods or storms; near to the reflux of the tides, but not quite so near as to be affected with any foulness of the water which the flowing of the tides generally is the occasion of. The gardens extend almost to the bank of the river, yet are never overflowed; nor are there any marshes on either side the river to make the waters stagnate, or the air unwholesome on that account. The river is high enough to be navigable, and low enough to be a little pleasantly rapid; so that the stream looks always cheerful, not slow and sleeping, like a pond. This keeps the waters always clear and clean, the bottom in view, the fish playing and in sight; and, in a word, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>everything</b> that can make an inland (or, as I may call it, a country) river pleasant and agreeable.|$|E
