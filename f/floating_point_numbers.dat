5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, {{each of which is}} an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers,</b> rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E
5|$|To fit {{the program}} into the 320 words {{available}} on the chip, some significant modification was used. By not using regular <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers,</b> which require lots of instructions to keep the decimal point in the right place, some space was freed up. Trigonometric functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log about 20 on top of that. The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs.|$|E

25|$|A {{compiler}} {{may also}} use the static type of a value to optimize the storage it needs and the choice of algorithms for operations on the value. In many C compilers the float data type, for example, is represented in 32 bits, {{in accord with the}} IEEE specification for single-precision <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers.</b> They will thus use floating-point-specific microprocessor operations on those values (floating-point addition, multiplication, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Computer algebra, {{also called}} {{symbolic}} computation or algebraic computation is a scientific area {{that refers to}} the study and development of algorithms and software for manipulating mathematical expressions and other mathematical objects. Although, properly speaking, computer algebra should be a subfield of scientific computing, they are generally considered as distinct fields because scientific computing is usually based on numerical computation with approximate <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers,</b> while symbolic computation emphasizes exact computation with expressions containing variables that have not any given value and are thus manipulated as symbols (therefore the name of symbolic computation).|$|E

50|$|Wilkinson {{chose the}} {{perturbation}} of 2&minus;23 because his Pilot ACE computer had 30-bit <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> significands, so for numbers around 210, 2&minus;23 was {{an error in}} the first bit position not represented in the computer. The two real numbers, &minus;210 and &minus;210 &minus; 2&minus;23, are represented by the same <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>number,</b> which means that 2&minus;23 is the unavoidable error in representing a real coefficient close to &minus;210 by a <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>number</b> on that computer. The perturbation analysis shows that 30-bit coefficient precision is insufficient for separating the roots of Wilkinson's polynomial.|$|R
25|$|HDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than {{traditional}} images—to represent many more colors over {{a much wider}} dynamic range. For that purpose, they don't use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g., 0-255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (half precision) or 32-bit <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate transfer function is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a color depth that has as few as 10–12bits for luminance and 8bits for chrominance without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{arithmetic}} operations {{required to perform}} row reduction {{is one way of}} measuring the algorithm's computational efficiency. For example, to solve a system of n equations for n unknowns by performing row operations on the matrix until it is in echelon form, and then solving for each unknown in reverse order, requires n(n+1) / 2 divisions, (2n3 + 3n2 − 5n)/6 multiplications, and (2n3 + 3n2 − 5n)/6 subtractions, for a total of approximately 2n3 / 3 operations. Thus it has arithmetic complexity of O(n3); see Big O notation. This arithmetic complexity is a good measure of the time needed for the whole computation when the time for each arithmetic operation is approximately constant. This is the case when the coefficients are represented by <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> or when they belong to a finite field. If the coefficients are integers or rational numbers exactly represented, the intermediate entries can grow exponentially large, so the bit complexity is exponential.|$|E
500|$|Since this {{algorithm}} {{relies heavily}} on the bit-level representation of single-precision <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers,</b> a short overview of this representation is provided here.

50|$|The {{standard}} {{provides a}} predicate totalOrder which defines a total ordering for all floating numbers for each format. The predicate {{agrees with the}} normal comparison operations when they say one <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>number</b> is less than another. The normal comparison operations however treat NaNs as unordered and compare −0 and +0 as equal. The totalOrder predicate will order these cases, and it also distinguishes between different representations of NaNs and between the same decimal <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>number</b> encoded in different ways.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>Point</b> - A <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>number,</b> usually {{expressed}} in its simplest form with a decimal point as in [...] "1.2", [...] "0.004", etc...

500|$|Microsoft also marketed {{through an}} Apple dealer in West Palm Beach, Florida two {{products}} for the Radio-Shack TRS-80. One was [...] "Typing Tutor" [...] which led the user through learning to use a keyboard. The other was authored by {{a professor at the}} University of Hawaii called [...] "MuMATH" [...] and had the ability to do mathematics in long integer math to avoid <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers.</b> In this sense it was similar to the early ARPANET.|$|E
500|$|Negative zero {{is another}} {{redundant}} feature of {{many ways of}} writing numbers. In number systems, such as the real numbers, where [...] "0" [...] denotes the additive identity and is neither positive nor negative, the usual interpretation of [...] "−0" [...] is that it should denote the additive inverse of 0, which forces −0=0. Nonetheless, some scientific applications use separate positive and negative zeroes, as do some computing binary number systems (for example integers stored in the sign and magnitude or ones' complement formats, or <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> as specified by the IEEE floating-point standard).|$|E
500|$|Python has {{extensive}} {{built-in support}} for arbitrary precision arithmetic. Integers are transparently switched from the machine-supported maximum fixed-precision (usually 32 or 64 bits), {{belonging to the}} python type int, to arbitrary precision, belonging to the python type long, where needed. The latter have an [...] "L" [...] suffix in their textual representation. (In Python 3, {{the distinction between the}} int and long types was eliminated; this behavior is now entirely contained by the int class.) The Decimal type/class in module decimal (since version 2.4) provides decimal <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> to arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. The Fraction type in module fractions (since version 2.6) provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.|$|E
50|$|The {{trade-off}} between <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> and integers is {{that the}} space between large <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> values {{is greater than the}} space between large integer values of the same bit depth. Rounding a large <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>number</b> results in a greater error than rounding a small <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>number</b> whereas rounding an integer number will always result in the same level of error. In other words, integers have round-off that is uniform, always rounding the LSB to 0 or 1, and <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> has SNR that is uniform, the quantization noise level is always of a certain proportion to the signal level. A <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> noise floor will rise as the signal rises and fall as the signal falls, resulting in audible variance if the bit depth is low enough.|$|R
5|$|Reinterpreting {{this last}} bit pattern as a <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>number</b> gives the {{approximation}} , {{which has an}} error of about 3.4%. After the single iteration of Newton's method, the final result is , an error of only 0.17%.|$|R
50|$|Most {{computer}} programming languages include functions or library routines that provide random number generators. They are often {{designed to provide}} a random byte or word, or a <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>number</b> uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.|$|R
2500|$|Although the {{quadratic}} formula {{provides an}} exact solution, {{the result is}} not exact if real numbers are approximated during the computation, as usual in numerical analysis, where real numbers are approximated by <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> (called [...] "reals" [...] in many programming languages). In this context, the quadratic formula is not completely stable.|$|E
2500|$|Some C/C++ {{implementations}} (e.g., GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), Clang, Intel C++) implement long double using 80-bit <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers</b> on x86 systems. However, this is implementation-defined {{behavior and}} is not required, but allowed by the standard, as specified for IEEE 754 hardware in the C99 standard [...] "Annex F IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic". GCC also provides __float80 and __float128 types.|$|E
2500|$|This variant {{is almost}} never used in computations, except in {{situations}} where one wants to avoid rounding 0.5 or −0.5 to zero; or to avoid increasing the scale of <b>floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>numbers,</b> which have a limited exponent range. With round half to even, a non-infinite number would round to infinity, and a small [...] value would round to a normal non-zero value. [...] Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out-of-range results when possible for even-based number systems (such as binary and decimal).|$|E
