40|$|ObjectiveFetal {{cardiac surgery}} is a {{potential}} innovative treatment for certain congenital heart defects that have significant mortality and morbidity in utero or after birth, {{but it has been}} limited by placental dysfunction after fetal cardiac bypass. We have used the TinyPump device for fetal cardiac bypass in sheep fetuses at 90 to 110  days gestation. MethodsTen mixed-breed pregnant ewes were used over a period of 6 months, and 10 fetuses were placed on bypass for 30 minutes. Five fetuses with a mean gestational age of 104 ± 4. 5 days and mean weight of 1. 4 ± 0. 4 kg were placed on bypass using the TinyPump device, and 5 fetuses with a mean gestational age of 119 ± 4. 5 days and mean weight of 3. 4 ± 0. 4 kg were placed on bypass using the <b>roller</b> <b>head</b> pump. The fetuses were monitored for up to 3 hours after bypass or until earlier demise. ResultsProgressive respiratory and metabolic acidosis developed in all fetuses. The TinyPump group had a lower gestational age and weight compared with the <b>roller</b> <b>head</b> pump group. However, the rate of postbypass deterioration in the TinyPump group, as measured with blood gases, was noted to be significantly slower compared with the <b>roller</b> <b>head</b> pump group. ConclusionsWe demonstrate the feasibility of the TinyPump device for fetal cardiac bypass in a fetal sheep model. The TinyPump group showed improved results compared with the <b>roller</b> <b>head</b> group despite more immature fetuses. The TinyPump device seems to be a promising device for future studies of fetal cardiac bypass in immature fetal sheep and in primates...|$|R
50|$|A tape {{transport}} is {{the collection}} of parts of a magnetic tape player or recorder that the actual tape passes through. Transport parts include the <b>head,</b> capstan, pinch <b>roller,</b> tape pins, and tape guide. The tape transport {{as a whole is}} called the transport mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The bolt rigidly {{engages the}} barrel extension—a {{cylindrical}} component welded to the receiver {{into which the}} barrel is pinned. The delay mechanism is of the same design as that used in the G3 rifle. The two-part bolt consists of a bolt <b>head</b> with <b>rollers</b> and a bolt carrier. The heavier bolt carrier lies up against the bolt head when the weapon is ready to fire and inclined planes on the front locking piece lie between the rollers and force them out into recesses in the barrel extension.|$|R
25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing <b>head</b> <b>rollers</b> and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|R
50|$|A slipper type {{torque wrench}} {{consists}} of a roller and cam (or similar) mechanism. The cam {{is attached to the}} driving <b>head,</b> the <b>roller</b> pushes against the cam locking it in place with a specific force which is provided by a spring (which is in many cases adjustable). If a torque is demanded which is able to defeat the holding force of the roller and spring, the wrench will slip and no torque will be applied to the bolt. A slipper torque wrench will not over tighten the fastener by continuing to apply torque beyond a predetermined limit.|$|R
50|$|This {{evolutionary}} {{redesign of}} the American 2.9 solved {{many of the}} reliability issues that plagued its predecessor. A stronger cylinder head design eliminated the 2.9's common failure of cracked <b>heads.</b> Hydraulic <b>roller</b> lifters replaced the simple hydraulic lifters used in the 2.9, which were sometimes overly sensitive to oil contamination, often requiring the lifters to be replaced prematurely. However, one major design fault was not completely eliminated: Valve rockers and upper pushrod tips still received poor oil supply, resulting in eventual wear to these areas, and consequential valvetrain noise {{as a result of}} the increased clearance. Required replacement of these parts is common in older engines.|$|R

50|$|The {{cast-iron}} {{heads were}} designed with hemispherical combustion chambers {{and a single}} overhead camshaft over each <b>head,</b> operating shaft-mounted <b>roller</b> rocker arms. The valvetrain consisted of valves larger than those on Ford wedge head engines, made out of stainless steel and with sodium-filled exhaust valves to prevent the valve heads from burning, and dual valve springs. This design allowed for high volumetric efficiency at high engine speed.|$|R
5000|$|A {{new problem}} with {{chemical}} stability became notable in the mid-seventies when two significant tape manufacturers changed their dispersion formulations by introducing a polyurethane binder that, in time, turned hygroscopic and broke down as it absorbed water molecules {{into the long}} hydrocarbon molecular chains. The tape coatings became sticky and shed oxide onto all tape recorder parts in their path, including <b>heads,</b> guides, <b>rollers,</b> and capstans. This is commonly called sticky-shed syndrome. Although the problem was confined {{to two of the}} four major tape manufacturers (neither BASF nor 3M studio tapes suffer from the problem because neither manufacturer used the hygroscopic binder), the reputation of all magnetic tapes has been tainted by the defect.|$|R
5000|$|The Custom Cruiser was restyled in 1980 with a {{lower front}} fascia. The doors and window {{mechanisms}} were also redesigned to be lighter. The woodgrained side panels on models so equipped no longer followed the curves of the wheel wells like the 1977-1979 versions, but were positioned higher on the body sides to give a straighter, sleeker look similar to the first generation. 1980 saw the last restyling of the second generation Custom Cruisers.Minor mechanical changes were made between 1980 and 1990. The new E4ME electronic carburetor which used GM's CCC (Computer Command Control) system was introduced in 1980 for models sold in California. In 1981, all Custom Cruisers used the E4ME with the CCC system, although Canadian emission cars continued to use the mechanical M4ME carburetor until 1986. Also new in 1981 was GM's new Turbo Hydramatic 200-4R automatic transmission with overdrive. This transmission was equipped with a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Custom Cruiser could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range. 1985 saw major changes to the 5.0 L (307 CID) V8 engine's cylinder head design. Introduced were new [...] "swirl port" [...] heads, which improved driveability and low-end torque. These new heads also featured very small intake ports, which reduced the higher RPM power and performance significantly. Along with the new <b>heads,</b> <b>roller</b> lifters replaced flat lifters. The 1989 Custom Cruiser was the last edition to have front shoulder belts mounted in the B-pillars; 1990 introduced door-mounted [...] "passive" [...] shoulder belts.|$|R
40|$|Key words: roller {{grinding}} machine; {{static and}} dynamic analysis; {{transfer matrix method}} Abstract. In the article, the vibration resistance of spindle system in grinding <b>head</b> of <b>roller</b> grinding machine is studied by means of harmonic response and modal analysis, by using the method of the transfer matrix, obtained the first five orders of the natural frequency of spindle system. By studying the M 84100 A type spindle system in grinding <b>head</b> of <b>roller</b> grinding machine, obtained {{the conclusion that the}} natural frequency was far from the work frequency, so laid a foundation of the spindle system dynamic design. Preface With the improvement of product quality requirements, the precision of roll grinder is increasing [1]. As {{an important part of the}} roll grinder, the Spindle system static and dynamic performance directly affects the overall performance and the roll accuracy and surface quality[2]. In this paper, choose M 84100 A type roll grinding machine spindle system as the research object mainly used the transfer matrix method to analyze the vibration resistance of the spindle system. The transfer matrix method The transfer matrix method is mainly used for bending vibrations of the shaft components, torsional vibration and torsional vibration of the drive system to establish dynamics model. The method uses a lumped mass modeling, it can be used to deal with elastic support, multi-sectional, multi-supporting structure, the transfer matrix can measure the impact of the gyroscopic and unbalanced moment easily [3, 4]. The transfer matrix of the right end massless shaft segment The transfer matrix links the two points of the system state vector. Usually the two selected points are those points of forming a component boundary[5]. The shaft segment elements.

50|$|The roller-locked bolt {{assembly}} {{consists of a}} bolt <b>head,</b> two <b>rollers,</b> a striker sleeve, bolt body, and a large return spring, {{which is responsible for}} pushing the {{bolt assembly}} into battery (the locked position) and returning it there when it is unlocked and pushed backwards by the recoil of firing or by the charging handle. As the striker sleeve is movable back and forth within the bolt assembly, the return spring is also responsible for pushing the striker sleeve forward during locking (described below). The bolt assembly locks with the barrel's breech (the end the cartridge is loaded into) via a prong type barrel extension behind the breech. As it is recoil-operated and fired from an open bolt, the weapon must be manually charged with the side-mounted charging handle.|$|R

50|$|Cans {{are filled}} before {{the top is}} crimped on. The filling and sealing {{operations}} need to be extremely fast and precise. The filling head centers the can using gas pressure, purges the air, and lets the beverage flow {{down the sides of}} the can. The lid is placed on the can, and then crimped in two operations. A seaming head engages the lid from above while a seaming roller to the side curls the edge of the lid {{around the edge of the}} can body. The <b>head</b> and <b>roller</b> spin the can in a complete circle to seal all the way around. Then a pressure roller with a different profile drives the two edges together under pressure to make a gas-tight seal. Filled cans usually have pressurized gas inside, which makes them stiff enough for easy handling.|$|R
50|$|Most {{magnetic}} tape recorders use one capstan motor and one pinch roller located after the magnetic heads {{in the direction of}} the moving tape. However multiple pinch rollers may also be employed in association with one or more capstans. An example of the application of multiple pinch rollers is the Technics-RS1520 tape recorder, which utilizes two pinch rollers located on opposite sides of a single capstan shaft, providing a more stable transport across two sets of magnetic <b>heads.</b> Dual pinch <b>rollers</b> are also used (along with dual capstans) in auto-reverse cassette decks to drive the tape in both directions as needed. In this case, only one pinch roller is pressed against its corresponding capstan at a time.|$|R
50|$|A typical 9-track unit {{consisted}} of a tape transport—essentially all the mechanics that moved tape from reel to reel past the read/write and erase heads—and supporting control and data read/write electronics. The transport typically {{consisted of}} supply motor, take-up motor, hubs for locking the tape reels in place, a capstan motor (though not necessarily a pinch roller, see below), tape <b>head</b> assembly, miscellaneous <b>rollers</b> which kept the tape in a precise path during operation, and vacuum columns which prevented tape 'snatch'. Data could become corrupted by stretched tape or variations in tape speed, so the transport had to guide the tape through without damaging its edges, move it with minimal wow and flutter, {{and give it a}} tension that was low but sufficient to keep the tape in constant contact with the read/write head.|$|R

60|$|All {{hands were}} at work, next morning, {{with the first}} gleam of daylight. The rollers were still almost {{as high as the}} day before; but there was now a slight breath of wind, which sufficed to give the vessel {{steerage}} way. She was put <b>head</b> to the <b>rollers,</b> changing the motion from the tremendous rolling, when she was lying broadside to them, for a regular rise and fall that interfered but little with the work. A spare spar was fitted in the place of the bowsprit, the stump of the topmast was sent down, and the topgallant mast fitted in its place and, by midday, the light spars were all in their places again, and the brig was showing a fair spread of canvas; and a casual observer would, at a distance, have noticed but slight change in her appearance.|$|R
50|$|The delay {{results from}} {{the amount of time}} it takes for enough recoil energy to be {{transferred}} through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber {{for a short period of}} time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4 mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt <b>head</b> and the <b>rollers</b> are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the locking rollers are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.|$|R
50|$|The G3A3 (A4) is a selective-fire {{automatic}} weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. The two-piece bolt assembly {{consists of a}} breech (bolt head) and bolt carrier. The bolt is held in battery by two sliding cylindrical rollers that engage locking recesses in the barrel extension. The breech is opened when both rollers are compressed inward against camming surfaces driven by the rearward pressure of the expanding gases upon the bolt <b>head.</b> As the <b>rollers</b> move inward, recoil energy is transferred to the locking piece and bolt carrier which begin to withdraw while the bolt head slowly moves rearward {{in relation to the}} bolt carrier. As the bolt carrier clears the rollers, pressure in the bore drops to a safe level, the bolt head is caught by the bolt carrier and moves to the rear as one unit, continuing the operating cycle. The bolt also features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the bolt while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling bolt).|$|R

A scared-white-as-a-sheet life #3 takes his place on the waiting bench, the cat recovers and finds Tweety amongst the moving targets in a shooting gallery. He climbs into the targets to get at his prey but is shot several times in rapid succession. With each shot (except the first two), lives 4 through 7 pop up on the bench. Sylvester bursts out of the gallery (narrowly missing another shot) and sees Tweety <b>heading</b> towards the <b>roller</b> coaster. As Tweety sits in the front seat proclaiming [...] "That puddy tat will never find me here", the cat takes the seat directly behind him.

Just as he is about to pummel an unsuspecting Tweety with a club, he slams into the entranceway of a tunnel. Upon impact, the train carrying life #8 in the front seat runs through the tunnel and down Hell's twisted escalator conveyor belt route that took Sylvester's first life down earlier.|$|R
