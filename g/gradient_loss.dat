40|$|Structural brain {{changes as}} {{measured}} with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{are associated with}} progression of Huntington’s Disease (HD), a trinucleotide repeat neurodegenerative disorder. Neurophysiological measures may offer additional biomarkers of the onset and progression of brain disease. We used quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) power measures to assess resting state brain function in 27 HD subjects and 15 healthy controls. Those QEEG features that distinguished between HD subjects and healthy controls were examined in relation to illness severity, using Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) subscales, {{as well as to}} the number of CAG repeats in the HD cohort. HD subjects showed a global increase in delta power as compared to controls, even when examining unmedicated HD subjects only (n = 13), or premanifest HD subjects only (n = 3). HD subjects also showed loss of the normal anterior-posterior (AP) gradient of relative alpha and delta power. Relative alpha AP <b>gradient</b> <b>loss</b> was associated with lower Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and greater cognitive dysfunction. Relative delta AP <b>gradient</b> <b>loss</b> was associated with lower TFC, more severe motor symptoms, and greater number of CAG repeats. Overall, results suggest that QEEG power measures may capture perturbations of brain function that are related to functional status as well as to underlying genetic repeat expansion in HD. Pilot data in the three premanifest HD subjects are consistent with the hypothesis that brain functional abnormalities may be detectable even in premanifest gene carriers. Cross-sectional findings suggest that QEEG measures may be biomarkers of HD progression; prospective studies in larger samples are needed to confirm these findings and test hypotheses regarding underlying mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|All {{types of}} part-of-speech (POS) tagging errors have been equally treated by {{existing}} taggers. However, the errors are not equally important, since some errors affect {{the performance of}} subsequent natural language processing (NLP) tasks seriously while others do not. This paper aims to minimize these serious errors while retaining the overall performance of POS tagging. Two <b>gradient</b> <b>loss</b> functions are proposed to reflect {{the different types of}} errors. They are designed to assign a larger cost to serious errors and a smaller one to minor errors. Through a set of POS tagging experiments, it is shown that the classifier trained with the proposed loss functions reduces serious errors compared to state-of-the-art POS taggers. In addition, the experimental result on text chunking shows that fewer serious errors help to improve the performance of subsequent NLP tasks. ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE—Noonan's {{syndrome}} {{is a common}} dysmorphic syndrome in which failure to thrive and gastrointestinal symptoms are frequent but poorly understood.  DESIGN—Twenty five children with Noonan's syndrome were investigated by contrast radiology, pH monitoring, surface electrogastrography (EGG), and antroduodenal manometry (ADM).  RESULTS—Sixteen had poor feeding and symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction. All 16 required tube feeding. Seven of 25 had symptoms of foregut dysmotility and gastro-oesophageal reflux. In the most symptomatic children (four of seven) EGG showed fasting frequency <b>gradient</b> <b>loss</b> along the stomach fundus and pylorus with antral postprandial frequency loss. ADM showed shortened fasting cycle length, with abnormal phase III and shortened postprandial activity containing phasic contractions.  IMPLICATIONS—Gastroduodenal motor activity was reminiscent of 32 - 35 week preterm patterns.

40|$|SummarySubthreshold-activating A-type K+ {{currents}} {{are essential}} for the proper functioning of the brain, where they act to delay excitation and regulate firing frequency. In CA 1 hippocampal pyramidal neuron dendrites, the density of A-type K+ current increases with distance from the soma, playing {{an important role in}} synaptic integration and plasticity. The mechanism underlying this gradient has, however, remained elusive. Here, dendritic recordings from mice lacking the Kv 4 transmembrane auxiliary subunit DPP 6 revealed that this protein is critical for generating the A-current <b>gradient.</b> <b>Loss</b> of DPP 6 led to a decrease in A-type current, specifically in distal dendrites. Decreased current density was accompanied by a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation. Together these changes resulted in hyperexcitable dendrites with enhanced dendritic AP back-propagation, calcium electrogenesis, and induction of synaptic long-term potentiation. Despite enhanced dendritic excitability, firing behavior evoked by somatic current injection was mainly unaffected in DPP 6 -KO recordings, indicating compartmentalized regulation of neuronal excitability...|$|E
40|$|This work tackles {{the face}} {{recognition}} task on images captured using thermal camera sensors which can {{operate in the}} non-light environment. While it can greatly increase the scope and benefits of the current security surveillance systems, performing such a task using thermal images is a challenging problem compared to face recognition task in the Visible Light Domain (VLD). This {{is partly due to}} the much smaller amount number of thermal imagery data collected compared to the VLD data. Unfortunately, direct application of the existing very strong face recognition models trained using VLD data into the thermal imagery data will not produce a satisfactory performance. This is due to the existence of the domain gap between the thermal and VLD images. To this end, we propose a Thermal-to-Visible Generative Adversarial Network (TV-GAN) that is able to transform thermal face images into their corresponding VLD images whilst maintaining identity information which is sufficient enough for the existing VLD face recognition models to perform recognition. Some examples are presented in Figure 1. Unlike the previous methods, our proposed TV-GAN uses an explicit closed-set face recognition loss to regularize the discriminator network training. This information will then be conveyed into the generator network in the forms of <b>gradient</b> <b>loss.</b> In the experiment, we show that by using this additional explicit regularization for the discriminator network, the TV-GAN is able to preserve more identity information when translating a thermal image of a person which is not seen before by the TV-GAN...|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} the subdiaphragmatic venous physiology in patients {{subjected to the}} Fontan operation to {{understand some of the}} early and late problems of this circulation. Methods: Flows were evaluated by Doppler ultrasonography in the subhepatic inferior vena cava, hepatic vein, and portal vein during respiratory monitoring and with a tilt table. Twenty control subjects (group A) and 56 patients who had the Fontan operation, 27 in functional class I (group B) and 29 in class III or IV (group C), were studied. Inspiratory/expiratory flow ratio was calculated to reflect respiratory effects, and upright/supine flow ratio was calculated to assess gravity effects. Inferior vena caval, hepatic venous, and wedged hepatic venous pressures were measured during catheterization in 21 control subjects and 25 Fontan patients. The difference between wedged and hepatic venous pressures represents the transhepatic venous pressure gradient. Results: Fontan hepatic venous flow depended more on inspiration than control, but without difference between groups B and C (inspiratory/expiratory flow ratios: 1. 7, 2. 9, and 2. 9, respectively; P <. 02). Normal portal venous flow was higher in expiration; this effect was lost in group B and reversed in group C (inspiratory/expiratory flow ratios: 0. 8, 1. 0, and 1. 3; P <. 0005). Gravity reduced portal venous flow in groups A and B, but progression to functional class III or IV (group C) exacerbated this effect (upright/supine flow ratios: 0. 8, 0. 7, and 0. 5; P <. 01). Inferior vena caval, hepatic venous, and wedged hepatic venous pressures (in millimeters of mercury) in the Fontan groups were all elevated compared with the control group (inferior vena cava, 14. 4 ± 4. 4 vs 5. 9 ± 2. 3; hepatic vein, 14. 7 ± 4. 5 vs 5. 9 ± 1. 9; wedged hepatic vein, 14. 7 ± 4. 0 vs 8. 3 ± 2. 6; P <. 0001).

40|$|Abstract. Synthetic {{aperture}} radar interferometry (InSAR) {{has been}} widely used {{over the past two}} decades for such geodetic applications as topographic mapping and ground deformation monitoring. In particular, in contrast to other geodetic techniques, differential InSAR has the capability of measuring surface deformation with a measurement precision of a few millimetres and a spatial resolution of a few tens of metres or less, over areal extents of thousands of square kilometres. However, the ground surface may deform by a large amount within a small area due to localised effects such as earthquakes, underground mining, groundwater extraction, and others, which may cause severe damage to manmade surface and underground structures. Current satellite radar interferometry, because of its single-frequency signal structure, cannot measure deformations with large horizontal gradients as they produce very dense fringe patterns. The upper limit of the deformation gradient is determined by the signal wavelength and pixel spacing. Although the longer wavelength of the radar signal is less susceptible to high deformation <b>gradients,</b> <b>loss</b> of correlation often still occurs even when L-band imagery is used. In this paper, the authors propose a method to effectively monitor such large-gradient deformation using differential InSAR by linear combinations of interferograms acquired from dual-frequency sensors. Some simulated interferograms are generated through the combination of the commonly used radar wavelengths, for instance C, L 1, L 2, S and even P-band. Using appropriate linear combinations, the virtual wavelength of the combined interferogram is flexible enough to be used for different applications. From the simulated results, it is found that the linear combination technique is powerful and can improve the correlation, as well as making the phase unwrapping process much easier...|$|R
