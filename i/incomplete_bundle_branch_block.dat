Protease inhibitors (PIs) are suspected to contribute to this adverse reaction. However, many factors can prolong QTc interval. We examined factors influencing QTc duration in HIV-infected patients. METHODS: Unselected HIV-infected patients (n = 978) were enrolled in this prospective, single-centre cross-sectional study. Variables related to infection and treatments were collected. A digital electrocardiographic record was recorded in each patient and QT interval duration was measured and corrected using both Bazett's (QTcB) and Fridericia's (QTcF) formula. Results were analysed with a multivariable linear model. RESULTS: After excluding arrhythmias and complete bundle branch blocks, QT interval was measured in 956 patients. The mean (SD) QTcB was 418 ms (23) and QTcF was 405 ms (20). QTc was found prolonged (> 450 ms in women and > 440 ms in men) in 129 [13. 5 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 11. 5, 15. 8] and 38 (4 %; 95 % CI 2. 9, 5. 4) patients using Bazett and Fridericia corrections, respectively. On multivariable analysis, <b>incomplete</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block,</b> ventricular hypertrophy, signs of ischaemic cardiopathy, female gender, White ethnic origin and age were significantly associated with QTc prolongation. The only HIV variable independently associated with QTc prolongation was the duration of infection (P = 0. 023). After adjustment, anti-HIV treatment, in particular PI (P = 0. 99), was not associated with QTc prolongation. CONCLUSIONS: Although PIs block in vitro hERG current, they are not independently associated with QTc interval prolongation. Prolonged QTc interval in HIV-infected patients is primarily associated with factors commonly known to prolong QT and with the duration of HIV infection...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the clinical significance of a “crochetage” pattern—a notch near {{the apex of the}} R wave in electrocardiographic (ECG) inferior limb leads—in secundum atrial septal defect. Background. Atrial septal defect is often overdiagnosed on the basis of classical clinical features. Thus, more specific signs on the ECG for screening are needed. Methods. We searched for a crochetage pattern in 1, 560 older children and adults: 532 with secundum atrial septal defect, 266 with ventricular septal defect, 146 with pulmonary stenosis, 110 with mitral stenosis, 47 with cor pulmonale and 459 normal subjects. Results. This pattern was observed respectively in 73. 1 %, 35. 7 %, 23. 3 %, 6. 4 %, 10. 6 % and 7. 4 % of these groups (p < 0. 001). In atrial septal defect, its incidence increased with larger anatomic defect (p < 0. 0001) or greater left-to-right shunt (p < 0. 0001), even in the presence of pulmonary hypertension. By multiple regression analysis, only shunt size (p < 0. 0006) and defect location (p < 0. 0001) were the determinants of its presence. In all groups, the specificity of this sign for the diagnosis was remarkably high when present in all three inferior limb leads (≥ 92 %), even when comparison was limited to patients with an <b>incomplete</b> right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block</b> (≥ 95. 2 %). Early disappearance of this pattern was observed in 35. 1 % of the operated-on patients although the right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block</b> pattern persisted. Conclusions. A crochetage pattern of the R wave in inferior limb leads is frequent in patients with atrial septal defect, correlates with shunt severity and is independent of the right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block</b> pattern. Sensitivity and specificity of this sign are remarkably high when it is associated with an <b>incomplete</b> right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block</b> or present in all inferior limb leads...|$|R

BackgroundCardiac resynchronization therapy has been proven effective in patients with HF and wide QRS by ameliorating contraction asynchrony. MethodsFifty-two patients with severe HF received biventricular pacing. The patients were eligible in the presence of echocardiographic evidence of interventricular and intraventricular asynchrony, regardless of QRS duration. The patient population was divided into group 1 (n = 38), with a QRS duration > 120 ms, and group 2 (n = 14), with a QRS duration ≤ 120 ms. ResultsThe baseline parameters considered in the study were similar in both groups. At follow-up, CRT determined narrowing of the QRS interval in the entire population and in group 1 (p < 0. 001), whereas a small increase in QRS duration was observed in group 2 (p = NS); in all patients and within groups, we observed improvement of New York Heart Association functional class (p < 0. 001 in all), left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0. 001 in all), left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter (p < 0. 05 within groups), mitral regurgitation area (p < 0. 001 in all), interventricular delay (p < 0. 001 in all), and deceleration time (group 1 : p < 0. 001, group 2 : p < 0. 05), with no significant difference between groups.

Therefore, several studies have been orchestrated to delineate electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, and heart rate variability (HRV) findings in athletes. Purpose: To assess the ECG, echocardiography, and HRV {{in a group of}} dynamic and static type athletes. Methods: Fifty professional athletes (20 static and 30 dynamic exercise athletes) and 50 healthy nonathletes (control group) were recruited. Standard 12 -lead ECG and transthoracic echocardiography was performed on all athletes and the control group. Through echocardiography, variables including left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic/systolic diameter, LV mass, and left atrial volume index were measured. In addition, both the athletes and the control group underwent ECG Holter monitoring for 15 minutes and several parameters related to HRV (time and frequency domain) were recorded. Results: The most common ECG abnormalities among the athletes were sinus bradycardia and <b>incomplete</b> right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block.</b> LV end-diastolic diameter and left atrial volume index were significantly greater in the dynamic athletes (P &lt; 0. 001). LV end-systolic diameter was significantly lower in the static group (P &lt; 0. 001). LV mass of the dynamic and static athletes was significantly greater than that of the controls (P &lt; 0. 001). Among the ECG Holter monitoring findings, the dynamic athletes had lower systolic blood pressure than the controls (P = 0. 01). Heart rate was lowest in the control group (P &lt; 0. 001).

Tumor was surgically removed, and histological findings was supported a diagnosis of the cardiac myxoma. The right cardiac myxoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, particularly in cases presented in conjunction with constitutional symptoms and/or hematological disturbances. In these patients echocardiography should be undertaken early to exclude the rare but treatable diseases of the right heart...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The SQUID {{magnetometer}} {{system with}} ultra-high magnetic sensitivity {{has made it}} possible to measure the very weak magnetic field generated by the activity of the brain and the heart. Biomagnetic measurement of the magnetic field perpendicular to the body surface is widely used. We had developed a 39 -channel SQUID system consisting of thirteen 3 -D second-order gradiometers (12 measurement positions (43) and a noise measurement) for vector measurement of the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) and the magnetocardiogram (MCG). This SQUID magnetometer can detect magnetic field components perpendicular to the body and tangential to the body simultaneously [1]. We carried out 3 -D vector measurements of MEG with a mixed auditory evoked field (AEF) and somatosensory evoked field (SEF) overlapping in time, and MCG with normal subjects and an IRBBB (<b>incomplete</b> right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block)</b> patient were also measured [2]. In order to discuss the frequency characteristics with time course, a sho...|$|R

A patient with melanoma metastatic to the right ventricle which was diagnosed clinically by evi-dence of recent onset of right ventricular inflow and outflow tract obstruction is described. Important information re-garding the extent of the metastatic process and potential resectability ofthe tumor was gained by magnetic resonance imaging. P atients with malignant disease frequently may have metastases to the heart. 1. 2 We describe what we believe to be the first reported case ofmetastatic malignancy to present with hemodynamically significant inflow and outflow tract obstruction ofthe right ventricle (RV).

40|$|A 41  year old {{man with}} <b>incomplete</b> right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block</b> and {{persistent}} coved-type ST elevation in the right precordial leads during sinus rhythm had an episode of syncope while driving. He had never had syncope before {{and there was no}} family history of sudden cardiac death. Ventricular fibrillation was induced during electrophysiological study (EPS) by double extrastimuli applied to the right ventricle. Disopyramide was effective in preventing ventricular fibrillation during EPS. β Adrenoceptor stimulation manifested bifid T waves and reduced ST segment elevation in right precordial leads. Simultaneously recorded monophasic action potential (MAP) duration at 90 % repolarisation did not change in the right ventricular outflow tract, while it shortened in the left ventricular septum. These findings suggest that right precordial bifid T waves might result from relatively early repolarisation of the left ventricles. Moreover the gradient of action potential duration might explain the mechanism of ST segment abnormalities in a patient with Brugada syndrome.    Keywords: ventricular fibrillation;  Brugada syndrome;  monophasic action potential;  bifid T wave...|$|R

We here report {{a case of}} a 56 -year-old woman presenting with chest pain secondary to pulmonary artery embolism which was initially diagnosed as ACS due to electrocardiographic changes and raised troponin. PE presenting with negative T-wave inversion can mimic ACS and misdirect the diagnostic approach. Simultaneous T-wave inversions in anterior and inferior leads are important clues suggesting PE. Most common ECG findings in PE are anteroseptal T-wave inversion/ST-elevation or depression along with complete or <b>incomplete</b> right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block,</b> sinus tachycardia, low QRS-complex voltage, an S 1 Q 3 T 3 pattern, and right axis deviation.

40|$|Introduction For fear of {{life-threatening}} arrhythmia, {{monitoring of}} patients takes place {{for up to}} 24 hours following an electrical accident. There is no scientific {{evidence to support the}} necessity of this costly procedure. Method A retrospective analysis of illness-related secondary data from all patients who were admitted as in-patients to the Charité, Campus Virchow Clinic with the principle hospital diagnosis T 75. 4 (damage caused by electricity) between January 2001 and December 2008. The occurrence of delayed cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment represented the primary endpoint of the study. Admission ECGs, all hospital-derived ECGs and documented anomalies in monitoring were examined. The data material was available in form of patient files in the archive of the Campus Virchow Clinic of the Charité. Results 268 patients were included in the time period mentioned. 71 % were male. 94 % of accidents were low voltage accidents, 3 % high voltage accidents (rest unclear). The median age was 23 years (interquartile range 6 - 35). 64 % of accidents occurred in private setting. In 81 % of cases, carelessness was determined as the cause of the accident. The median duration of hospitalisation was 19 : 50 hours (interquartile range 15 : 58 - 23 : 28 hours). The shortest hospital stay was 2 : 25 hours; the longest stay was 430 : 18 hours. Three patients were unconscious directly following the accident; one of these required reanimation due to ventricular fibrillation. For 98 % of patients, an admission ECG was taken; in 4 % of cases there were anomalies with regard to excitation and conduction. These were sporadically occurring VES, SVES and AV-Block I°. In 61 % of patients, an ECG control was carried out. 3 patients presented with anomalies. 1 patient had an <b>incomplete</b> right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block,</b> 1 patient had supraventricular extrasystoles and an <b>incomplete</b> right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block,</b> and 1 patient showed sporadically occurring supraventricular extrasystoles, sporadically occurring ventricular extrasystoles and VES couplets. Monitoring was carried out for 100 % of patients. In one patient, a nocturnal sinus bradycardia was documented. No patient developed life-threatening arrhythmia during the monitoring period.

On physical examination, the patient appeared healthy, with no signs of discomfort or heart failure. Cardiac aus-cultation revealed normal heart sounds with a mild respi-ratory-dependant systolic murmur at the apex. Labora-tory studies did not detect any significant abnormalities. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia of 100 bpm and an <b>incomplete</b> right <b>bundle</b> <b>branch</b> <b>block</b> with a QRS duration of 0. 10 sec. Transthoracic echocar-diography showed a round homogeneously echogenic mass of 30 X 20 mm in the right atrium, which was adja-cent to the interatrial septum. Left ventricular diameters and function were normal. No diastolic prolapse of the mass into the right ventricle was detected. The left atrium was not entirely visible, and further studies were sug-gested to exclude tumor in the left atrium.
