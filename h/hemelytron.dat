5|$|In Hemiptera (true bugs), the {{forewings}} may be hardened, {{though to}} a lesser extent than in the beetles. For example, the anterior part of the front wings of stink bugs is hardened, while the posterior part is membranous. They are called <b>hemelytron</b> (pl. hemelytra). They are only found in the suborder Heteroptera; the wings of the Homoptera, such as the cicada, are typically entirely membranous. Both forewings and hindwings of Cicada are membranous, most species are glass-like although some are opaque. Cicadas are not good fliers and most fly only a few seconds. When flying, forewing and hindwing are hooked together by a grooved coupling along the hindwing costa and forewing margin. Most species have a basic venation as shown in the following picture.|$|E

50|$|The {{forewings}} of {{the winged}} aquatic bugs are modified into hemelytra (singular, <b>hemelytron),</b> {{in which the}} basal part is thickened and leathery and the apical part is membranous. The thickened region is divided into a corium and clavus. The membranous region has veins and the venation is of taxonomic importance. However, in many families, {{the distinction between the}} leathery and membranous regions of the <b>hemelytron</b> is not pronounced, and the wing tends to be more fully sclerotized (e.g., Pleidae) or more fully membranous (e.g., winged Gerridae).The hind wings are fully membranous and held beneath the hemelytra when at rest. Many adult aquatic bugs are brachypterous, micropterous, or apterous, having reduced wings or none at all., however, it is common that entomologists refer to the entire basal portion of the wing as the corium..|$|E

50|$|Miridae are small, {{terrestrial}} insects, usually oval-shaped or elongate {{and measuring}} less than 12 mm in length. Many {{of them have}} a hunched look, because of the shape of the prothorax, which carries the head bent down. Some are brightly coloured and attractively patterned, others drab or dark, most being inconspicuous. Some genera are ant mimics at certain stages of life. The Miridae do not have any ocelli. Their rostrum has four segments. One useful feature in identifying members of the family is the presence of a cuneus; it is the triangular tip of the corium, the firm, horny part of the forewing, the <b>hemelytron.</b> The cuneus is visible in nearly all Miridae, and only in a few other Hemiptera, notably the family Anthocoridae, which are not much like the Miridae in other ways. The tarsi almost always have three segments.|$|E
5000|$|The {{forewings}} of Hemiptera {{are either}} entirely membranous, {{as in the}} Sternorrhyncha and Auchenorrhyncha, or partially hardened, as in most Heteroptera. The name [...] "Hemiptera" [...] is from the Greek [...] ( [...] ; [...] "half") and [...] ( [...] ; [...] "wing"), referring to the forewings of many heteropterans which are hardened near the base, but membranous at the ends. Wings modified in this manner are termed hemelytra (singular: <b>hemelytron),</b> by analogy with the completely hardened elytra of beetles, and occur only in the suborder Heteroptera. In all suborders, the hindwings - if present at all - are entirely membranous and usually shorter than the forewings. [...] The forewings may be held [...] "roofwise" [...] over the body (typical of Sternorrhyncha and Auchenorrhyncha), or held flat on the back, with the ends overlapping (typical of Heteroptera). The antennae in Hemiptera typically consist {{of four or five}} segments, although they can still be quite long, and the tarsi of the legs have two or three segments.|$|E
