They note {{that there is no}} historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out significant differences in the stage of development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>life</b> and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>life</b> or after-life).|$|E

5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not {{anything}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>life.</b> He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes {{in opposition to}} other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E

5|$|In Hinduism, {{suicide is}} {{generally}} frowned upon {{and is considered}} equally sinful as murdering another in contemporary Hindu society. Hindu Scriptures state that one who dies by suicide will {{become part of the}} spirit world, wandering earth until the time one would have otherwise died, had one not taken one's own life. However, Hinduism accepts a man's right to end one's life through the non-violent practice of fasting to death, termed Prayopavesa. But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to people who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>life.</b> Jainism has a similar practice named Santhara. Sati, or self-immolation by widows, was prevalent in Hindu society during the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|The Fountain is a 2006 American epic magical realism romantic drama {{film that}} blends {{elements}} of fantasy, history, spirituality, and science fiction. It {{is directed by}} Darren Aronofsky, and stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. The film consists of three storylines involving immortality and the resulting loves lost, and one man's pursuit of avoiding this fate <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>life</b> or beyond it. Jackman and Weisz play sets of characters bonded by love across time and space: a conquistador and his ill-fated queen, a modern-day scientist and his cancer-stricken wife, and a traveler immersed in a universal journey alongside aspects of his lost love. The storylines—interwoven with use of match cuts and recurring visual motifs—reflect the themes and interplay of love and mortality.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} his theodicy {{required}} Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed.

The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>life</b> irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.|$|E
