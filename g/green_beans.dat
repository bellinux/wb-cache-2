40|$|The low {{technology}} {{adoption in}} the application of high-quality <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> seeds is identified as the main reason for the low farming productivity in Indonesia. A survey was conducted to 80 farmers in Godong District Grobogan Regency Central Java, aimed to analyze factors that affect the decision in technology adoption of the application of high-quality <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> seeds in Central Javanese farmers’ household. Data were collected through interview with the structured questioner and analyzed with multiple regression models to identify factors that affect the decision of farmers to use high-quality <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> seeds. Results showed that the area of agricultural land, the allocation time of family member, the use of pesticide, and farming experience were significant factors in the decision of technology adoption. It can be concluded that the decision of technology adoption in farmers’ household depend on social economic condition and the effectiveness of the related institution. Appropriate policies should be formulated to take the advantage of technology adoption {{in the application}} of high-quality <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> seeds to improve agricultural productivity.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobium bacteria effects on leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration and root characteristics of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> and maize under intercropping, experiment {{was carried out}} in the research field of College of Agriculture, Payame Noor University of Azna, Lorestan, Iran. In experiment, sandy loam soil with pH 7. 3 and EC 0. 49 dS m - 1 was used. The treatments comprised three cropping systems (sole cropping of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> and maize, and intercropping), and four inoculations (control, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, rhizobium and mix of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobium). The results showed that inoculation with rhizobium improved length, diameter, volume and area of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> root. The highest of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> N, P concentration and root dry mass were observed in sole culture of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Moreover, root length, diameter, volume and area of maize increased by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and total concentration of N and P enhanced with use of rhizobium in sole cropping. Although the usage of Rhizobium and AMF can be affected on increasing the root growth and nutrient uptake of crops, application of bacterium and fungi combination at the same time would not be suitable. Overall, intercropping of maize with <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> caused to increase of leaf N and P concentrations and root growth of maize. </p...|$|R

The aim {{of study}} is know {{the effect of}} some {{cropping}} system and N, P, K fertilizer {{as well as the}} interaction of both factors to improve growth and yield maize, <b>green</b> <b>bean,</b> and groundnut. The experimental design was Completely Block Randomized Design with two factors and two replications. The first factor was cropping system: Those were maize monoculture, <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> monoculture, groundnut monoculture, maize-green bean intercropping, and maize-ground nut intercropping. Then the second factor was level of N, P, K fertilizer: Those were control, low dose (90 kg ha- 1 N, 35 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5, 20 kg ha- 1 K 2 O) and high dose (180 kg ha- 1 N, 70 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5, 40 kg ha- 1 K 2 O). The observation was done for growth and production of maize, <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> and ground nut. The research result showed that, cropping system did not have significant different on the height of maize plant at 15, 30, and 45 days after planting (DAP). Application of fertilizer had significant different on maize plant at 30 and 45 DAP and did not have significant different of maize plant at 15 DAP. Furthermore, cropping system and fertilizer application did not have significant different on the height of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> and groundnut at 15 DAP, but cropping system and fertilizer application have very significant different on height of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> and groundnut at 30 and 45 DAP, as well as interaction between cropping system and application fertilizer on height of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> and groundnut at 30 and 45 DAP. Furthermore, cropping system did not have significant different on cornhusk-maize yield, and application of fertilizer have very significant different on cornhusk-maize yield.

5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. <b>Green</b> <b>beans</b> can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and <b>green</b> <b>beans</b> are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E

Objective: To analyze the effect of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus Radiatus) juice on changes in blood profile levels in pregnant women with anemia who received Fe tablet supplementation. Methods: This was a quasy-experimental study with pretest posttest with control group design conducted from November 2016 to January 2017 in the working area of the Community Health Center of Kedungmundu Semarang. Consecutive sampling was used in this study to select 40 samples based on the hypothesis formula of two independents. There were 20 samples assigned in each group. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and Independent t-test. Results: The results of this study showed that there were significant increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocytes (p = 0. 000) after given <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus Radiatus) juice. Conclusion: There was a significant effect of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus Radiatus) juice in increasing the levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocytes.
