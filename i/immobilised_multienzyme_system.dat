40|$|Inspired by the {{structural}} organization of mitochondria and the bioadhesive principle, {{a simple and}} versatile approach to construct a <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system</b> is developed. More specifically, the <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system</b> is composed of a polydopamine (PDA) microcapsule scaffold and three spatially separated enzymes. The PDA microcapsules are prepared through the rapid, spontaneous self-polymerization of dopamine {{on the surface of}} CaCO(3) microparticle template, followed by dissolution of the template using EDTA. The wall thickness of the microcapsules can be tuned by the dopamine concentration in an aqueous solution. The three enzymes are respectively immobilized through physical encapsulation in the lumen, in situ entrapment within the wall and chemical attachment on the out surface under extremely mild conditions. As an example, a <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system,</b> containing alpha-amylase, beta-amylase and glucosidase, was constructed to convert starch into isomaltooligosaccharide, and the <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system</b> displays higher catalytic activity and enhanced operational stability.

The immobilization of an artificial <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system</b> on a nanomaterial to mimic natural multienzyme organization could lead to promising biocatalysts.

40|$|BackgroundPolyketide synthases (PKSs) are {{bacterial}} <b>multienzyme</b> <b>systems</b> that synthesize a {{broad range}} of natural products. The ‘minimal’ PKS consists of a ketosynthase, a chain length factor, an acyl carrier protein and a malonyl transferase. Auxiliary components (ketoreductases, aromatases and cyclases) are involved in controlling the oxidation level and cyclization of the nascent polyketide chain. We describe the heterologous expression and reconstitution of several auxiliary PKS components including the actinorhodin ketoreductase (act KR), the griseusin aromatase/cyclase (gris ARO/CYC), and the tetracenomycin aromatase/cyclase (tcm ARO/CYC). ResultsThe polyketide products of reconstituted act and tcm PKSs were identical to those identified in previous in vivo studies. Although stable protein-protein interactions were not detected between minimal and auxiliary PKS components, kinetic analysis revealed that the extended PKS comprised of the act minimal PKS, the act KR and the gris ARO/CYC had a higher turnover number than the act minimal PKS plus the act KR or the act minimal PKS alone. Adding the tcm ARO/CYC to the tcm minimal PKS also increased the overall rate. ConclusionsUntil recently the principal strategy for functional analysis of PKS subunits was through heterologous expression of recombinant PKSs in Streptomyces. Our results corroborate the implicit assumption that the product isolated from whole-cell systems is the dominant product of the PKS. They also suggest that an intermediate is channeled between the various subunits, and pave the way for more detailed structural and mechanistic analysis of these <b>multienzyme</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{aromatic}} {{complex of}} Neurospora crassa is an aggregated <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system</b> which catalyzes five consecutive reactions {{in the central}} pathway leading to the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids. In an attempt to understand the physiological importance of this complex in particular, {{as well as the}} importance of cellular organization of enzyme systems in general, we have isolated the complex and have begun to characterize its catalytic properties. Optimum conditions for the assay of the overall 5 -step reaction catalyzed by the partially purified complex have been determined. An analog computer was programmed to represent an unaggregated system of five enzymes with rate constants identical to those found for the constituent enzymes of the complex. By direct comparison, it was shown that the lags (transient times) obtained for the overall reaction were 10 - 15 times longer for the hypothetical unaggregated system than for the complex.

50|$|Because malate {{dehydrogenase}} is {{closely tied to}} the citric acid cycle, regulation is highly dependent on TCA products. Citrate also affects MDH activity by very complex manner. It inhibits the reduction of oxaloacetate under all conditions. Citrate also inhibits malate oxidation, but only at low malate or NAD concentrations. When both malate and NAD concentrations are high (10 mmol/l and 5 mmol/l, respectively), citrate can actually augment MDH2 activity. All three effectors (malate, oxaloacetate and citrate) bind to the same putative allosteric site. Recent studies of mitochondrial {{malate dehydrogenase}} are focused into the nature of the inactivation processes. The oligomeric structure of MDH2 has a variety of biological implications. Some researches have suggested that the dimeric structure is critical for enzymatic activity. It was first proposed that the reciprocating compulsory ordered mechanism where each subunit alternates as the active and the helper subunit, but both are needed for activity. This mechanism predicts an inactive monomer, and was corroborated by studies that showed a dramatic reduction of enzymatic activity. Studies with mitochondrial MDH2 have shown that this enzyme is allosterically regulated as a complex as well. Binding experiments indicate that mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase can associate with the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and that mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase can associate with this binary complex to form a ternary complex. Formation of this ternary complex enables low levels of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, {{in the presence of the}} aminotransferase, to reverse inhibition of malate oxidation by glutamate. Thus, glutamate can react with the aminotransferase in this complex without glutamate inhibiting production of oxalacetate by the malate dehydrogenase in the complex. The conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate could also be facilitated because in the trienzyme complex, oxalacetate might be directly transferred from malate dehydrogenase to the aminotransferase. In addition, association of malate dehydrogenase with these other two enzymes enhances malate dehydrogenase activity due to a marked decrease in the Km of malate. The potential ability of the aminotransferase to transfer directly alpha-ketoglutarate to the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex in this <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system</b> plus the ability of succinyl-CoA, a product of this transfer, to inhibit citrate synthase could play a role in preventing alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate from accumulating in high levels. This would maintain the catalytic activity of the <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system</b> because alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate allosterically inhibit malate dehydrogenase and dissociate this enzyme from the <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

In addition, the kinetic parameters were studied for both fusion and parent enzymes, showing no effect of fusion on the KM values while the kcat values were smaller for the fusion protein than those from the parental partners. The kcat value for the kinase activity in the fusion enzyme (3. 53 x 102) was about one order of magnitude lower than the kcat of its native equivalent {{and in the case of}} the aldolase activity the kcat (1. 70 x 103) drop 4 orders of magnitude. Besides this lost in the turnover number, the fusion enzyme maintains a so good catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) about 104 min- 1 x mM- 1. The proximity of the active centres in the fusion enzyme promotes a kinetic advantage as indicate the 20 -fold increment in the initial velocity of the overall aldol reaction.

We report here such measurements of the metabolic flux in the conversion of ethanol to the two products, CO 2 and lipids, for six different active genotypes, containing the predominant naturally recurring alleles and covering a threefold range of in vitro activity. In adult flies we have found nonsignificant differences between genotypes in metabolic flux when estimates for individual genotypes had standard errors of approximately 10 % of the mean value. In vitro activities are, therefore, poor predictors of the physiological consequences of enzyme variation since such determinations ignore the interactions inherent in <b>multienzyme</b> <b>systems.</b> We have no evidence that heterozygote show overdominance either at the enzyme or the flux level. Since fitness differences between genotypes must be generated by physiological differences, investigations of polymorphisms should be based on in vivo studies...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{hallmarks}} of assembly line polyketide synthases have motivated {{an interest in}} these unusual <b>multienzyme</b> <b>systems,</b> their stereospecificity and their capacity for directional biosynthesis. In this review, we summarize the state of knowledge regarding the mechanistic origins of these two remarkable features, using the 6 -deoxyerythronolide B synthase as a prototype. Of the 10 stereocenters in 6 -deoxyerythronolide B, the stereochemistry of nine carbon atoms is directly set by ketoreductase domains, which catalyze epimerization and/or diastereospecific reduction reactions. The 10 th stereocenter is established by the sequential action of three enzymatic domains. Thus, {{the problem has been}} reduced to a challenge in mainstream enzymology, where fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of the structural basis for this exquisite stereochemical control by relatively well-defined active sites. In contrast, testable mechanistic hypotheses for the phenomenon of vectorial biosynthesis are only just beginning to emerge. Starting from an elegant theoretical framework for understanding coupled vectorial processes in biolog...|$|R
40|$|Eduard Buchner (1897) is rightly {{regarded}} as the founder of modern biochemistry, because his observation that alcoholic fermentation could proceed in a cell-free extract of yeast supplied the final nail in the coffin of the vitalism that dominated physiological thinking in the 19 th Century. His work can also be {{regarded as}} the beginning of enzymology, but although he regarded his “zymase ” as a single enzyme it became clear {{in the years that followed}} his discovery that it is really a mixture of several enzymes, all of them necessary if fermentation is to proceed. His experiments can equally well, therefore, be {{regarded as the}} first study of the behaviour of a multi-enzyme system, a topic that has taken nearly a century to be taken up again seriously. In this chapter I shall consider one particular type of <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system,</b> in which the combined effects of at least three different enzymes allow regulatory properties that would not be possible with just one...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The overall {{objective}} of this research project was to evaluate the metabolism of benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) by the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) -bacteria system. Individual oysters exist in nature as "systems" with commensal microorganisms and should be recognized as such when the metabolism of a specific environmental contaminant is being studied. Since bivalves are exposed to environmental pollutants that enter coastal waters, {{it is important to}} determine if the "natural" oyster system can detoxify those contaminants likely to cause biological damage. Tritiated-BaP was incubated with whole animal multienzyme preparations of (1) oyster/bacteria and (2) bacteria-free oyster. Background controls were run with homogenizing buffer (no oyster tissue added), homogenizing buffer + antibiotics (no oyster tissue added) and autoclaved oyster/bacteria <b>multienzyme</b> <b>systems.</b> Extraction techniques allowed separation of four fractions: (1) unmodified ³H-BaP plus simple non-conjugated derivatives; (2) ³H-BaP - glucuronides and -sulfates; (3) other ³H-BaP polar derivatives susceptible to cleavage by base/acid hydrolysis; and (4) the remaining ³H-BaP derivatives tightly bound and unaffected by previous treatment. Further separation of the unaltered ³H-BaP and the simple non-conjugated derivatives was effected by thin-layer chromatography. The results show a metabolic conversion of ³H-BaP by both <b>multienzyme</b> <b>systems</b> to simple, non-conjugated ³H-BaP derivatives and to other more polar ³H-BaP derivatives which were not susceptible to cleavage by glucuronidase/sulfatase or hydrolysis treatment. Hydrolysis-susceptible ³H-BaP metabolites were detected in the oyster/bacteria multienzyme preparations. Thus, {{it was not possible to}} clearly distinguish the metabolism of BaP by bacterial multienzymes from that of oyster multienzymes, but it does appear that the major proportion were contributed by oyster multienzymes. There were several additional points of interest. The treatment of oysters with antibiotics prior to and during the ³H-BaP incubation eliminates their indigenous bacterial flora as established by most-probable-number analyses of bacterial numbers. Further studies are required to determine whether or not metabolic conversions are due to the presence of bacterial cell-free enzymes. Also, the importance of establishing a background measure by an inviable enzyme incubation with the substrate is deemed critical as a result of this study. Finally, two oxidative degradation products are formed during the stustrate incubation, the subsequent organic extraction and/or the TLC preparation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prodiginines are a {{large family}} of {{pigmented}} oligopyrrole antibiotics with medicinal potential as immunosuppressants and antitumour agents that are produced by several actinomycetes and other eubacteria. Recently, a gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor encoding the biosynthesis of undecylprodiginine and butyl-meta-cycloheptylprodiginine has been sequenced. Results: Using sequence comparisons, functions have been assigned {{to the majority of}} the genes in the cluster, several of which encode homologues of enzymes involved in polyketide, nonribosomal peptide, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Based on these assignments, a complete pathway for undecylprodiginine and butyl-meta-cycloheptylprodiginine biosynthesis in S. coelicolor has been deduced. Gene knockout experiments have confirmed the deduced roles of some of the genes in the cluster. Conclusions: The analysis presented provides a framework for a general understanding of the genetics and biochemistry of prodiginine biosynthesis, which should stimulate rational approaches to the engineered biosynthesis of novel prodiginines with improved immunosuppressant or antitumour activities. In addition, new mechanisms for chain initiation and termination catalysed by hitherto unobserved domains in modular <b>multienzyme</b> <b>systems</b> have been deduced.

40|$|Cellulose is {{the most}} {{abundant}} and the most resistant and stable natural organic compound on earth. Enzyme hydrolysis is difficult because of its insolubility and heterogeneity. Some (anaerobic) microorganisms have overcome this by having a <b>multienzyme</b> <b>system</b> called the cellulosome. The aims {{of the study were}} to isolate a mesophilic Clostridium sp. from a biosulphidogenic bioreactor, to purify the cellulosome from this culture, to determine the cellulase and endoglucanase activities using Avicel and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as substrates and the dinitrosalicyclic (DNS) method. The organism was identified using 16 S rDNA sequence analysis. The sequence obtained indicated that a strain of Clostridium beijerinckii was isolated. The cellulosome was purified from the putative C. beijerinckii sLM 01 host culture using affinity chromatography purification and affinity digestion purification procedures. The cellulosomal and non-cellulosomal fractions of C. beijerinckii sLM 01 were separated successfully, but the majority of the endoglucanase activity was lost during the Sepharose 4 B chromatography step. These cellulosomal and non-cellulosomal fractions were characterised with regards to their pH and temperature optima and effector sensitivity...|$|R
