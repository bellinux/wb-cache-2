40|$|Abstract—modeling and {{simulation}} of a micromachined microhotplate (MHP) designed to achieve low power dissipation and uniform temperature distribution on the sensing area at operating temperatures {{of up to}} 700 °C is presented in this paper. At the operating temperature of 700 °C, it is demonstrated that as the silicon nitride (S i 3 N 4) and silicon carbide (S iC) membrane and <b>heat</b> <b>distributor</b> layer, respectively, is increased from 0. 3 µm to 3 µm, the power dissipation of the MHP increases while the mechanical displacement of the MHP membrane decreases. On the other hand, the temperature gradient on the MHP decreases as {{the thickness of the}} S iC temperature distributor layer is increased and is a minimum with a value of 0. 005 °C/m for S iC thickness of 2 µm and above. However for an increase in the tin dioxide (SnO 2) thickness from 0. 3 µm to 3 µm, the power dissipation on the MHP is not affected while the mechanical displacement decreases. A comparison between simulation and mathematically modeled results for power dissipation and current density of the MHP showed close agreement. An optimized simulated device exhibited low power dissipation of 9. 25 mW and minimum mechanical deflection of 1. 2 µm at the elevated temperature o...|$|E

Testing of this evaporator {{was carried out}} during the 2001 and 2002 seasons. Initially the scaling rate was rapid and heat transfer performance was disappointing. However, following modifications to the juice <b>distributor</b> the <b>heat</b> transfer performance was improved and the scaling rate was reduced. With the new juice <b>distributor</b> <b>heat</b> transfer coefficients typically ranged from 5, 000 W. m - 2. K - 1 immediately after a clean to about 2, 600 W. m - 2.

40|$|International audiencen this paper, {{the idea}} of {{coupling}} constructal distributors/collectors with a mini crossflow heat exchanger (MCHE) {{to solve the problem}} of flow maldistribution is presented. After a brief description of the design and scaling laws of the constructal distributor, experimental and simulation results have been discussed to investigate relations among flow distribution, heat transfer and pressure drop. It is shown that the introduction of constructal distributors and/or collectors could improve the quality of fluid distribution and consequently lead to heat transfer intensification of the MCHE, but it also results in higher pressure drops. Different assembly configurations involving <b>distributor,</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger and collector have also been compared. The configuration where the inlet is equipped with a conventional pyramid distributor and the outlet is equipped with a constructal collector (Apec) shows a relatively higher thermal performance as well as low pressure drops in our cases considered...|$|R
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} by the Pennsylvania Energy Office (PEO) to summarize its activities under the State Heating Oil and Propane Program (SHOPP) for the 1994 - 95 heating season. The PEO is under a cooperative agreement, Agreement DE- 7 C 01 - 91 E 122784, Amendment No. 3, with the U. S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (DOE/EIA) to conduct these activities. The objective of the SHOPP program was to collect Pennsylvania-specific price information for residential No. 2 heating oil and propane and transmit this information to DOE/EIA for compilation into its various reports and publications. Under the PEO`s cooperative agreement with DOE/EIA, prices were collected on {{the first and third}} Mondays of each month, starting on October 3, 1994, and extending through March 20, 1995. Prices were obtained via telephone calls made by PEO staff. For each <b>heating</b> oil <b>distributor</b> in the survey sample, the PEO collected charge prices for a standard delivery quantity of No. 2 heating oil. For propane, dealers were requested to provide the price for a customer using between one thousand and fifteen hundred gallons of fuel during the heating season. The PEO agreed to forward the survey results to the DOE/EIA within three days of the date of each survey. DOE/EIA`s responsibility was to compile the data from all states and distribute a bi-weekly report. In addition, DOE/EIA took responsibility for the collection of primary stock information for No. 2 heating oil...|$|R
40|$|The 4 th Generation of District Heating (4 GDH) is {{a complex}} {{agglomeration}} of <b>heat</b> providers, <b>distributors,</b> and consumers that must be automatically, continuously managed and coordinated. It {{is a complex}} system of systems; a definition which we align to Maier’s architecting principles for systems-of-systems as collaborative systems. Wrapped {{in the idea of}} system of systems is the reality that the 4 GDH systems’ descriptions and specifications are not currently all known. Nonetheless, the transition into the 4 GDH is actual. We propose the use of two frameworks to secure a smooth metamorphosis and assure systems’ operation, maintenance, and evolution. The two frameworks are the Arrowhead Framework and the OPTi Framework. The first one enables system integration through Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the second one offers the overall system optimization with respect to all stakeholders. This paper uses the Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tool SysML to model a district heating complex’s structures and behaviors from the concept level down to the sensors and actuators within a district heating substation where we apply the SOA technology based on the open Arrowhead Framework. We focus on the Arrowhead Framework’s core services, i. e. Service Registry, Authorization and Orchestration to clearly describe the interactions between the different service providers and consumers. Going back up from the sensors to the systems, it is clear that SOA is the architecture that will empower the 4 GDH. Upprättat; 2016; 20160701 (deventer) </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{constructal}} approach, {{proposed by}} Bejan is an emergent notion which quickly develops {{at the international}} level and in a multidisciplinary frame. It is a method of optimization of the conception of objects and ‘‘components'' which allows finding the geometry of a multi-scale system in view of an optimal performance. The constructal concept, as the fractal concept, is a way of connecting the geometry of a microscopic world (the structures of an equipment or a material at the finest scales) with the macroscopic world in which it is immersed, through several intermediate scales. Essential differences with the fractal object are that the constructal object optimizes the passages from one scale to the other, that the geometry is not necessarily invariant from one scale to the other, and that there maybe some thermodynamic content to the optimization, such as minimizing entropy production. The present paper addresses these issues through several aspects: general introduction to the constructal approach; discussion of some examples of multi-scale components (<b>heat</b> exchanger, fluid <b>distributor,</b> coupling of fluid <b>distributor</b> to <b>heat</b> exchange...|$|R
40|$|Is {{the heat}} and mass {{transfer}} intensification defined as a new paradigm of process engineering, {{or is it just}} a common and old idea, renamed and given the current taste? Where might intensification occur? How to achieve intensification? How the shape optimization of thermal and fluidic devices leads to intensified heat and mass transfers? To answer these questions, Heat & Mass Transfer Intensification and Shape Optimization: A Multi-scale Approach clarifies  the definition of the intensification by highlighting the potential role of the multi-scale structures, the specific interfacial area, the distribution of driving force, the modes of energy supply and the temporal aspects of processes.   A reflection on the methods of process intensification or heat and mass transfer enhancement in multi-scale structures is provided, including porous media, <b>heat</b> exchangers, fluid <b>distributors,</b> mixers and reactors. A multi-scale approach to achieve intensification and shape optimization is developed and clearly explained.   Providing readers with a tool box of reflections, techniques, methods, supported by literature reviews, Heat & Mass Transfer Intensification and Shape Optimization: A Multi-scale Approach will be a key guide for students, a teaching aid for lecturers and a source of inspiration for future research subjects...|$|R
