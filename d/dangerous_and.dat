5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} {{is regarded}} as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.|$|E
5|$|Other predators {{attack the}} adults {{while they are}} {{foraging}} or traveling to satellite nests. It {{is difficult to determine}} the number of adults that are killed away from the nest because they are difficult to track. However, it has been observed that the queen's flight to the satellite nest isn't <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> does not reduce its survivability.|$|E

5|$|The Maclennan Hill was a <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> steep {{bottleneck}} {{for traffic}} leaving the inner city. The first recommendations involved creating an underpass beneath the CPR tracks.

5|$|The new Greenville Bridge {{opened to}} traffic on August 4, 2010.

At times the river has been closed to traffic to aid the demolition. The job is <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> two workers have died.|$|E
5|$|Thucydides and Plutarch {{say that}} Themistocles {{asked for a}} year's grace to learn the Persian {{language}} and customs, after which he would serve the king, and Artaxerxes granted this.

5|$|A Scientology {{representative}} in France {{asserted that the}} Scientology personality test was not created by the Church of Scientology, {{and that it was}} not related to Ballo's death. The Church of Scientology's information chief in Norway, Matthias Fosse stated that the test was not <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> that the organization did not bear any responsibility for Ballo's death. Ballo's father retained a lawyer to investigate his daughter's death, and the family considered filing a lawsuit against Scientology. 500 people attended Ballo's funeral on April 11, 2008 at Grefsen Church in Oslo, Norway.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversial}} strategy {{proposed by}} Gale {{results in a}} decisive victory in District 2, enabling the rebels to launch a final assault against the Capitol itself. Katniss is assigned to a squad and sent to a relatively quiet sector so that a film crew can shoot propaganda. President Coin sends Peeta along, {{even though he is}} still <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> unpredictable. From this, Katniss suspects Coin wants her dead because she has too much influence and has not shown much support for Coin.|$|E
5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E

5|$|Areas of {{the coast}} near Exmouth, The Fleet at Weymouth and the beaches at Studland have also been used for {{training}} for war, but have since been returned to civilian use. Parts {{of the coast}}, especially around Portland, can be <b>dangerous,</b> <b>and</b> shipwrecks have been {{a feature of the}} coast. In January 2007 the coast experienced its most environmentally damaging wreck when the MSC Napoli, a 2,400 capacity container ship, was beached at Branscombe near Sidmouth, losing oil and cargo.|$|E
5|$|But the WFM's {{success at}} Cripple Creek {{also created a}} {{significant}} backlash. The WFM was forever tarred as a <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> violent organization {{in the eyes of}} employers. Never again would the WFM have in a local strike the level of public support it enjoyed at Cripple Creek in 1894. Indeed, when the union struck the Cripple Creek mines again in 1898, its public support ended after violence broke out. During another strike in 1903–4, whose violent significance earned it the name Colorado Labor Wars, the union went up against the power of the employers and the state combined.|$|E
5|$|During the 1937 season, Verity {{played only}} one of the three Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and {{although}} batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, he did not look <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> was left out of the remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack. He was not selected for the Players and his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter. Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2011, Universal Music issued remastered and {{expanded}} editions of Jailbreak, Johnny the Fox <b>and</b> Live <b>and</b> <b>Dangerous.</b> Jailbreak <b>and</b> Johnny the Fox are double CD editions {{with the second}} disc containing outtakes, BBC session recordings and newly remixed versions of two of that particular album's tracks. Live <b>and</b> <b>Dangerous</b> also comes as a double CD set, with two bonus tracks which are both unused live recordings.

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, the {{automobile}} gradually became the primary form of transportation. Motorists crossing the Pennsylvania mountains during the 1930s {{were limited to}} hilly, winding roads such as the Lincoln Highway (US30) or the William Penn Highway (US22), which had grades exceeding nine percent. Due to their sharp curves and steep grades, the roads were <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> caused many fatal accidents from skids.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the side of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, but many of the peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> {{difficult}} for the explosion of vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E

5|$|In 97 AD, Ban Chao sent an envoy named Gan Ying {{to explore}} the far west. Gan made his way from the Tarim Basin to Parthia and reached the Persian Gulf. Gan left a {{detailed}} account of western countries; he apparently reached as far as Mesopotamia, then {{under the control of the}} Parthian Empire. He intended to sail to the Roman Empire, but was discouraged when told that the trip was <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> could take two years. Deterred, he returned to China bringing much new information on the countries to the west of Chinese-controlled territories, as far as the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E
5|$|It took {{sixteen years}} from the initial {{developing}} stage begun in 1994, until the Greenville Bridge opened to traffic on August 4, 2010. The entire cost of the bridge totaled $336 million.

5|$|Like many of Verne's novels, {{the play}} is deeply imbued with themes of initiation, echoing the {{traditional}} mythic pattern of a young hero coming of age and reaching maturity through a <b>dangerous</b> <b>and</b> transformative journey. In Journey Through the Impossible, the young Georges, initially trapped by obsessions {{similar to those that}} drove his father mad, resolves his inner torments during a harrowing series of experiences in which Ox and Volsius compete as substitute father-figures. Both father-figures are highly symbolic: Ox is a sinister tempter representing knowledge and science, balancing the Guardian Angel Volsius.|$|E
