40|$|We {{argue the}} {{prospects}} of an Asian <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> and an Asian currency union with a comprehensive survey of the literature, an empirical analysis and {{a study of the}} European <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit's</b> (ECU) experience. Asian countries may meet optimal currency area conditions. However, many other factors along the dimensions of history, politics and economic structure should be addressed for the realization of currency unification. The ECU experience suggests that even a successful Asian <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> requires firm political commitment and expectations of eventual currency unification.

5000|$|The ruble or rouble ( [...] ; рубль) is or was a <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> of {{a number}} of {{countries}} in Eastern Europe closely associated with the economy of Russia. Originally, the ruble was the <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> of Imperial Russia and then the Soviet Union (as Soviet ruble), and it is currently the <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> of Russia (as Russian ruble) and Belarus (as Belarussian ruble). The Russian ruble is also used in the partially recognised states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In the past, several other countries influenced by Russia and the Soviet Union had <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> that were also named rubles. One ruble is divided into 100 kopeks (копе́йка).|$|R
50|$|Many games {{also have}} their own <b>internal</b> <b>currency</b> to {{facilitate}} in-game trade. Proper balance of an in-game economy becomes extremely important if it is desired to have an exchange rate linkage between the <b>internal</b> <b>currency</b> and a real worldcurrency, such as the US Dollar. Mismanagement or imbalance can result in real-world financial losses with legal impacts.|$|R
50|$|For example, if you borrow 10,000,000 <b>units</b> of a <b>currency</b> {{from the}} bank at 10.5% annual {{interest}} {{for a period of}} 10 years (i.e., 120 months), then EMI = <b>Units</b> of <b>currency</b> 10,000,000 * 0.00875 * (1 + 0.00875)^120 / ((1 + 0.00875)^120 - 1) = <b>Units</b> of <b>currency</b> 134,935. i.e., you will have to pay total <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> 134,935 for 120 months to repay the entire loan amount. The total amount payable will be 134,935 * 120 = 16,192,200 <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> that includes <b>currency</b> <b>units</b> 6,192,200 as interest toward the loan.|$|R

5000|$|The ISO 4217 {{standard}} {{includes a}} crude mechanism for expressing {{the relationship between}} a major <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> and its corresponding minor <b>currency</b> <b>unit.</b> This mechanism is called the currency [...] "exponent" [...] and assumes a base of 10. For example, USD (the United States dollar) is equal to 100 of its minor <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> the [...] "cent". So the USD has exponent 2 (10 to the power 2 is 100, which is the number of cents in a dollar). The code JPY (Japanese yen) is given the exponent 0, because its minor unit, the sen, although nominally valued at 1/100 of a yen, is of such negligible value that it is no longer used. Usually, as with the USD, the minor <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but in some cases (including most varieties of the dinar) 1/1000 is used, and sometimes ratios apply which are not integer powers of 10. Mauritania does not use a decimal division of units, setting 1 ouguiya (UM) equal to 5 khoums, and Madagascar has 1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja. Some currencies do not have any minor <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> at all and these are given an exponent of 0, as with <b>currencies</b> whose minor <b>units</b> are unused due to negligible value.|$|R

25|$|The {{concept of}} an Asian <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit</b> (ACU) started {{in the middle of}} the nineties, prior to the 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis.

40|$|While most {{observers}} concur {{that the time}} is not ripe for Asia to consider a common currency, {{there has been some}} discussion about the possible creation of an Asian <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit</b> (ACU). This paper examines the specific issue of the ACU which, in a general sense, is a weighted average of regional currencies a la the European <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit</b> (ECU) which was created in March 1979 under the European Monetary System (EMS). The paper critically examines the rationale for the ACU proposal and offers an initial attempt at computing optimal currency composition of the ACU. The optimal basket weights computed are aimed at ensuring a regional currency basket that has minimal variance. Hence it will deliver stability in intra-regional exchange rates for alternative configurations of currency baskets in the Asian and Pacific region.

50|$|ASEAN Plus Three, in {{establishing}} the Chiang Mai Initiative, has been credited as forming the basis for financial stability in Asia, the lack of such stability having contributed to the Asian Financial Crisis.

The Asian <b>Currency</b> <b>Unit's</b> purpose is to help stabilise the region's financial markets. The ACU as it is proposed is a currency basket and not a real currency, i.e., a weighted index of East Asian currencies that will function as a benchmark for regional currency movements.|$|R
