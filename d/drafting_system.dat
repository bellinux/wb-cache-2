500|$|Originally, {{players who}} were either born or {{naturalized}} in Puerto Rico were able to sign with MLB teams as free agents, usually receiving minor-league contracts prior to their debut in the league. In , Major League Baseball decided to include the island {{in the list of}} jurisdictions within the United States, which made mandatory that first-year players include their name in the Major League Baseball Draft in order to receive a contract. This was based on an initiative that was supposed to create a national and international <b>drafting</b> <b>system.</b> The change reduced the amount of players that were able to participate in the league, by limiting the number of them selected by the teams; [...] this led to the island's Secretary of Recreation and Sports, to formally ask to Major League's involvement in developing specialized schools to produce more players and other measures to reduce the impact of the draft's implementation. The original proposal included Puerto Rico's exclusion of the draft for a period of ten years, but this was not approved by the league.|$|E
500|$|Backbreaker also {{features}} two different franchise-style modes. The first, [...] "Season Mode", allows {{a player to}} create a custom league of either 8, 16, or 32 teams and insert custom-made and/or default teams into it. Season mode features a scouting and <b>drafting</b> <b>system,</b> but lacks trades and free agent signings. Players can play for an unlimited number of seasons, building a team through scouting college players and drafting them onto their team. The other franchise mode included is titled [...] "Road to Backbreaker." [...] This mode allows the player to take a custom or default team into a league structured {{along the lines of}} the English Football League including promotion and relegation. The player's team begins with a low rating in an 8-team league. By winning games, the player earns credits, which can be used to purchase the contracts of free agents. By finishing high in the 8-team league, the player's team advances to a 16-team league and eventually a 32-team league. The player improves their team by periodically signing free agents, as the competition is tougher in each league. The player wins the mode after winning a playoff tournament in the 32-team league. Afterwards, they may continue if they wish.|$|E

50|$|This basic <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> {{requires}} an accurate table and constant {{attention to the}} positioning of the tools. A common error is to allow the triangles to push {{the top of the}} T-square down slightly, thereby throwing off all angles.

50|$|Powell led Apex High School in Apex, North Carolina to the 2000 4-A state {{championship}} as a junior. Because {{he was already}} 18 years old, he was eligible to enter the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft and did so. However, he went undrafted because his agent, Scott Boras, did not inform teams he was available. This made Powell a free agent, but he chose to attend college after failing to receive an acceptable offer from an MLB club. This loophole in the <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> was later closed due to this incident and one a year later involving pitcher Jeremy Bonderman.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} &# 039;tanking&# 039; {{is a growing}} trend in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is often the topic of debate. &# 039;Tanking&# 039; is when a team lose games on purpose {{in order to improve}} their draft position. Previous {{research}} has been conducted on the incentives teams have to win games under the current NBA weightedlottery system. The research has suggested that non-playoff bound teams do not have an incentive to win games under the current <b>draft</b> <b>system,</b> leading to the system being heavily criticised. With this in mind, the aim of this research was to implement a <b>draft</b> <b>system</b> that would reward non-playoff bound teams for winning games that are deemed to be &# 039;unimportant&# 039; with respect to making the playoffs. The calculation of &# 039;unimportance&# 039; is based on the probability of a team making the playoffs after the completion of each game of the season. A variety of approaches were then examined to help derive a score for &# 039;unimportant&# 039; and unlikely wins. The results found evidence that non-playoff bound teams would have an incentive to win games late in the season under this alternative <b>draft</b> <b>system.</b> As well as exploring incentives to win, we wiii explore the attractiveness of this system as well as evaluating past draft picks to examine the reward teams could have obtained under this alternative <b>draft</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
50|$|Famous British {{computer}} scientist Dr. Dick Newell worked {{there on a}} file-based macro language driven 3D plant design system called PDMS (Plant Design Management System). Together with colleague Tom Sancha he left the CADCentre in 1977 to form a company called Cambridge Interactive Systems or CIS and primarily concentrated on 2D CAD. CIS had developed an electrical cabling solution initially called CABLOS, which was first purchased by Dowty Engineering in about 1979. Another early adopter was BMW, which used the system for car wiring diagrams. CABLOS soon became known and sold as the MEDUSA <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> under CIS.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Gerber {{introduced}} the first automated machines for drafting. By allowing engineers and designers {{to interact with}} the design process graphically, automated drafting represented a seminal application of computers to enhance creativity. Gerber’s automated drafting technologies enabled the design of complex design products, such as the first [...] "jumbo" [...] military and commercial aircraft, the U.S. Air Force C-5 Transport by Lockheed Martin and the Boeing 747. This technology was credited with integrating the engineering design function with the numerically controlled machine tools in the aircraft, automotive, and shipbuilding industries, dramatically improving cost and manufacture time. Gerber’s automated systems would capture three quarters of the automated <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> market during the following two decades. Gerber also introduced the Automatic Line Follower, the first automated digitizer for vector graphics.|$|E

40|$|Results of {{simulation}} {{investigations of}} the influence of changes in the spinning zone ge-ometry of a ring spinning machine on the tension and quality of the yarn manufactured are presented in this study. Changes in the geometry resulted from modification of the conven-tional <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> into a compact <b>drafting</b> <b>system.</b> For the investigations, construction parameters of the machine and the technological process of spinning were taken into con-sideration. Numerical investigations were based on the mathematical model for the dynam-ics of yarn motion through the twisting-winding unit. Experimental tests were performed on the Polish ring spinning machine type PJ 35, equipped with a conventional <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> and the author’s compact <b>drafting</b> <b>system.</b> It was shown that changes in the spinning zone geometry on the spinning machine caused by modification of the conventional <b>drafting</b> <b>system</b> into a compact system had no effect on the mean tension value of the yarn.
