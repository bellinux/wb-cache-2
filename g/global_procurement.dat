40|$|Corporate {{responsibility}} (CR) {{has become}} one of the key themes in business life and in academic literature and research. As companies need to be increasingly responsive towards stakeholders´ expectations, practices how companies have adopted CR have expanded rapidly over time. A very topical and important CR issue is how to incorporate CR into global sourcing and procurement successfully. This thesis has three themes for enhancing knowledge in this field. The first theme concerns contextuality of CR (in <b>global</b> <b>procurement).</b> Despite the fact that companies are internally and externally remarkably different, literature provides strong suggestions and “best practices” for companies to follow. In this thesis a thorough literature review was conducted on best practices and constructs present in the extant literature. After this phase the feasibility of these suggestions was analyzed in the context of a single case company (consumer brands industry). The second theme concerns managerial practices in general terms. Multifaceted information was gathered about why and how the case company develops and aims to implement its <b>global</b> <b>procurement</b> responsibility program. The third theme concerns understanding about different strategies and management practices of incorporating CR into <b>global</b> <b>procurement,</b> also from an analytical conceptual point of view. Methodologically the thesis is grounded especially on inductive empirical findings from the single case study but also on deductive conclusions grounded on the literature analysis. Results have several academic and managerial implications: • a thorough referential listing of best practices and constructs for incorporating CR into <b>global</b> <b>procurement</b> was generated especially for managerial purposes • context matters, although this is undervalued in the literature: best practices successful in some contexts might not be feasible in others, but the content and the process of managing CR in <b>global</b> <b>procurement</b> are context-laden • important processual perspective of generating and implementing CR in <b>global</b> <b>procurement</b> is neglected in the literature • management models usually present in the literature are not holistic but lack or undervalue certain constructs or interrelationships between constructs, leading for instance to short-sighted and sub-optimal compliance-management • several managerial reference points and experiences were provided by analyzing and disclosing the content and the development process of the initiative in the case company • different ways to carry out CR (in <b>global</b> <b>procurement)</b> may lead to remarkably different financial and societal outcomes.

40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{competitive}} {{pressure in the}} production sector has led to considerable changes in the global competitive structure. Currently, companies attempt to counteract cost pressure by increasing their global outsourcing activities as well as focusing on their core competencies. Hence, <b>global</b> <b>procurement</b> has gained increasing importance among general purchasing activities of companies and is predicted to have an increasing influence on future cost development. Due to this development, companies are looking for new suppliers in low-wage countries. However, companies have to consider negative effects {{in the fields of}} quality, service level, and counterfeiting or plagiarising of merchandise. Therefore, cost savings in low-wage countries can only be achieved through major efforts during the planning and the realisation phase of the supplier selection process. Purchasing companies lack systematic assistance in analysing the procurement object and the economic environment of potential supplier candidates. This paper presents a two-step approach dealing with the issue of <b>global</b> <b>procurement</b> in low-wage countries and how this issue is faced taking business environment into account. In the first step, a method is described using the help of a requirement profile for suppliers and a cost structure analysis to select potential suppliers. In the second step, an approach for modelling and identifying potential dynamics and risks related to the acquisition of new suppliers in low-wage countries is developed...|$|E

A host country's natural resources have an impact on China's decision on how much to invest in the country rather than on whether to invest in the country or not.

30|$|For the decision-makers, {{the results}} can be used to develop and enrich {{acquisition}} and evaluation policies and guidelines that will improve access to medical technologies that are safe, effective, and of high quality. These policies can be implemented at four levels: in support of companies during research and development phases, with regulatory bodies, technological evaluation units, and groups involved in <b>global</b> or local <b>procurement</b> processes. The nature of decision-making involves a process that is often contested, and this is particularly true for health technology policy making. In recognition of the field in which these technologies are developed and the often-divergent interests of a range of stakeholders, compliance with certain principles should be particularly applied. It is the development of policies based on the basic values of the health system, a largely consultative and transparent process, the participation of all stakeholders, evidence-based decisions, and ultimately, the ascertainment that technology responds to real health needs and is used efficiently and effectively.|$|R
