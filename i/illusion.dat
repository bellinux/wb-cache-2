5|$|Back in {{the present}} time, Tisiphone and Daemon cast another <b>illusion</b> to deceive Kratos, who overcomes it and {{retrieves}} the Oath Stone of Orkos. He encounters the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, but devolved into ruthless beings because of Ares. Continuing his pursuit of the Furies, Kratos reaches the door to Alecto's Chamber, but seemingly returns home {{to his wife and}} daughter: another <b>illusion,</b> this time cast by the Fury Queen Alecto. She tries to convince Kratos he can live within this <b>illusion</b> if he rejoins Ares, but he refuses. Enraged, Alecto and Tisiphone attack Kratos, who retrieves the eyes, and Alecto transforms into a giant sea monster. After a brutal battle, Kratos uses the eyes to break through the Furies' illusions before killing them both, which destroys the prison.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, Angel {{escaped from}} a beachside hotel before its {{demolition}} {{in front of}} a crowd of about 50,000 people, an <b>illusion</b> that also aired on the television program. After the <b>illusion,</b> Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then smashed the window of the room in order to enter the hotel, and picked padlocks on both the room's internal door and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from the rubble after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire <b>illusion</b> was 4 minutes, with dynamite located on the first, second, and fourth floors of the building.|$|E
5000|$|Cognitive <b>illusions</b> {{are assumed}} to arise by {{interaction}} with assumptions about the world, leading to [...] "unconscious inferences", an idea first suggested in the 19th century by the German physicist and physician Hermann Helmholtz. Cognitive <b>illusions</b> are commonly divided into ambiguous <b>illusions,</b> distorting <b>illusions,</b> paradox <b>illusions,</b> or fiction <b>illusions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tactile <b>illusions</b> are <b>illusions</b> {{that affect}} the sense of touch. Some tactile <b>illusions</b> require active touch (e.g., {{movement}} of the fingers or hands), whereas others can be evoked passively (e.g., with external stimuli that press against the skin). In recent years, a growing interest among perceptual researchers {{has led to the}} discovery of new tactile <b>illusions</b> and to the celebration of tactile <b>illusions</b> in the popular science press. Some tactile <b>illusions</b> are analogous to visual and auditory <b>illusions,</b> suggesting that these sensory systems may process information in similar ways; other tactile <b>illusions</b> don't have obvious visual or auditory analogs.|$|R

5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the <b>illusion</b> of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this <b>illusion.</b> He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the <b>illusion</b> of its passage.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Lafayette, Indiana, Rose moved in the early 1980s to Los Angeles, where he became active in the local hard rock scene and joined several bands, {{including}} Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns. In 1985, he co-founded Guns N' Roses, {{with whom he had}} great success and recognition in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their first album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), has sold in excess of 30 million copies worldwide, {{and is one of the}} best-selling debut albums of all time in the U.S. with 18 million units sold. Its full-length follow-ups, the twin albums Use Your <b>Illusion</b> I and Use Your <b>Illusion</b> II (1991), were also widely successful; they respectively debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the two and}} a {{half year}} world tour in support of the albums Use Your <b>Illusion</b> I and Use Your <b>Illusion</b> II, Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash {{returned}} to Los Angeles. He soon sold his home, the Walnut House, and moved to Mulholland Drive. He built a small home studio, nicknamed The Snakepit, over his garage and began working on demos for songs he had written during the tour. Slash worked on the demos with Guns N' Roses bandmate and drummer Matt Sorum. They were later joined by guitarist Gilby Clarke and Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez, jamming and recording most nights. Slash played the demos for Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose who rejected the material, though he would later want to use them for the next Guns N' Roses album. They had recorded twelve songs by 1994, the same year that Guns N' Roses went on hiatus.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{entered the}} 1990s {{as one of}} the {{dominant}} forms of commercial music. The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC's The Razors Edge (1990), Guns N' Roses' Use Your <b>Illusion</b> I and Use Your <b>Illusion</b> II (both in 1991), Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tears (1991), and Van Halen's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (1991) showcased this popularity. Additionally, the Black Crowes released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker (1990), which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies. In 1992, Def Leppard followed up 1987's Hysteria with Adrenalize, which went multi-platinum, spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after hearing}} the rumours about the Qurayza, Muhammad had sent 100 men to the inner city for its protection. Later he sent 300 {{horsemen}} (cavalry was not needed at the trench) as well to protect the city.

50|$|People {{generally}} hold unrealistically positive {{views about}} themselves. Such flattering views {{can often be}} neatly categorised within what {{has become known as}} the Triad of Positive <b>Illusions.</b> The three <b>illusions</b> in question are Above-average effect, <b>illusions</b> of control, and Unrealistic optimism. These <b>illusions</b> can be replicated across many situations and are highly resistant to revision. Rather ironically, when informed of the existence of such <b>illusions,</b> people generally consider themselves to be less prone to them than others.|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} portray the {{characters}} underwater, the actors wore Heelys wheeled footwear, which simulate the gliding action of swimming creatures. The actors playing Ariel and the other merfolk had wire-frame tails attached to their hips.

5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the <b>illusion</b> of drugs, because they give you the <b>illusion</b> of getting closer to God, but {{ultimately}} they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

40|$|Positive <b>illusions</b> are a {{key feature}} of couple relationship. The present work {{investigated}} the factors that may contribute to or inhibit the development of couple positive <b>illusions.</b> In addition, it explored the linkage between such <b>illusions</b> and relational and individual well-being. The study was conducted on 337 couples in transition to marriage. This stage in partners’ life {{is supposed to be}} a crucial moment in the processes of consolidation of couple identity and of differentiation from the families of origin and thus to be a favourable observation point to study the process of establishment of couple positive <b>illusions.</b> Data were analyzed through structural equation modeling. Results showed that both the centrality of couple relationship to one’s identity and positive <b>illusions</b> towards one’s family of origin were significant predictors of positive <b>illusions.</b> However, the relationship between couple and family positive <b>illusions</b> was moderated by the level of intrusive parenting. Finally, couple positive <b>illusions</b> predicted couple and individual well-being...|$|R
