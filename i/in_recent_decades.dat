40|$|Abstract. Molecularly {{imprinted}} {{techniques have}} been rapidly developed <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decade.</b> Some novel molecularly imprinted techniques and some novel application forms of molecularly imprinted polymers have been developed. And {{it has been}} widely used in sample pretreatment. In this paper, novel mixed-template molecularly imprinted techniques are introduced. The development and applications of mixed-template molecularly imprinted techniques <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decade</b> are reviewed, including dual-template molecularly imprinted technique and multi-template molecularly imprinted technique, and its application in chromatographic solid phase, solid phase extraction and microsphere extraction. Moreover, the trends of mixed-template molecularly imprinted techniques in sample pretreatment are prospected...|$|R

5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades</b> due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol-lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E
