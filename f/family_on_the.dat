5|$|As {{the wars}} in Gaul come to an end, Julius Caesar (Ciarán Hinds) is faced with both triumph and tribulation. On {{the heels of his}} victory comes news of his daughter's death. Awarded with the {{adulation}} of the people, he also garners the enmity of politicians in Rome, including Pompey the Great (Kenneth Cranham). In Rome, Pompey must balance honor and politics as he is urged to betray his former friend. Meanwhile, Caesar's niece Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker) tries to steer her <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dangerous path between the growing divisions of power. In the Gallic countryside, two unlikely allies (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson) journey to reclaim the stolen standard of the Roman legion.|$|E

5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army in 1863, Goebel's father moved his family to Covington, Kentucky. William {{attended}} school in Covington and was then apprenticed to a jeweler in Cincinnati, Ohio. After a brief time at Hollingsworth Business College, he became an apprentice in {{the law firm of}} John W. Stevenson, who had served as governor of Kentucky from 1871 to 1877. Goebel eventually became Stevenson's partner and executor of his estate. Goebel graduated from Cincinnati Law School in 1877, then enrolled at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, but withdrew to support his <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> death of his father. Goebel was in private practice for several years, before partnering with Kentucky state representative John G. Carlisle for five years. He then rejoined Stevenson in Covington as a partner.|$|E
5|$|Following this, Wilfrid {{moved to}} a ranch in the {{emerging}} settlement of Orion, Alberta with his <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advice of a neighbor; the farming of wheat was a predominant activity. However, following a major crop failure in 1917, he became the town's bank clerk after employment in a convenience store, but later left for Kronau, Saskatchewan due {{to a combination of}} poor business and boredom; the family ranch was later abandoned in 1923. After skipping several years of high school education through a fast-track course at Regina College, Eggleston enrolled for a Bachelor of Arts program at Queen's University in 1926.|$|E
5|$|He {{returns to}} Gastown and learns Scrotus' {{location}} from Scab. Max and Chumbucket find Scrotus driving around the Purgatory Flatlands an area {{far away from}} the Great White and use the Magnum Opus to crash the Land Mover, which is pushed {{to the edge of a}} cliff. Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the Magnum Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and Magnum Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car at the start of the game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him. The game ends with Max entering the Interceptor and placing a picture of his <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dashboard before he leaves for parts unknown.|$|E

5|$|In 1586, {{following}} the death of previous Polish king, Stefan Bathory, the Swedish duke Sigismund III Vasa and Habsburg Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria took part in the election to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne. Each of the two candidates had supporters in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with the two opposing sides gathered around pro-Sigismund Chancellor and Great Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski and the Primate of Poland, Stanisław Karnkowski {{on one side and the}} pro-Maximilain Zborowski <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other. The rivalry between Zamoyski and the Zborowski family dated years past and tensions during the elections ran high.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, while Miller and Colmesnil {{were busy}} with their {{entry in the}} {{competition}} to redesign San Francisco City Hall {{as well as with}} the design of many new hotels, apartments and private homes, Timothy L. Pflueger was given the opportunity to serve as chief architect on a rural church project funded by The Family, a club to which Miller belonged. Pflueger designed Our Lady of the Wayside Church with a main theme of Spanish Mission Revival based on his childhood familiarity with Mission San Francisco de Asís (locally known as Mission Dolores) but added his own personal statement: a striking Georgian main entrance topped by a scrolled pediment. After working with sub-contractor members of The <b>Family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> project, Pflueger joined the club himself. The rural church was declared California Historical Landmark number 909 in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In America, documentaries were {{produced}} in various ways: General Marshall commissioned the Why We Fight propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War Department's Information-Education Division started out making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston's The Battle of San Pietro. Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America's allies, such as Mrs. Miniver (1942), which portrayed a British <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> home front; Edge of Darkness (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters, and The North Star (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. Towards {{the end of}} the war popular books provided higher quality and more serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal Diary (film) (1943), Mervyn LeRoy's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), and John Ford's They Were Expendable (1945).|$|E

5|$|Ivo Andrić was Yugoslavia's {{best known}} and most {{successful}} literary figure, and {{was awarded the}} Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. He was born to Bosnian Croat parents near Travnik on 9 October 1892, but {{spent most of his}} childhood in the town of Višegrad. His formative years were spent {{in the shadow of the}} town's most distinctive landmark, the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge. As a child, Andrić played in its vicinity and heard the legends surrounding it and its patron, Mehmed-paša Sokolović. Born into a Serb <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of the town, Sokolović had been abducted by the Ottomans as a child as part of the devşirme tax imposed on Christian subjects, taken to Istanbul and inducted into the janissary corps. Despite this, he remained in contact with his Christian family, and in 1557, convinced the Porte to grant the Serbian Orthodox Church autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Jane Austen lived {{her entire}} life {{as part of a}} large and close-knit <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower fringes of the English gentry. Her family's steadfast support was {{critical}} to Austen's development as a professional writer. Austen read draft versions of all of her novels to her family, receiving feedback and encouragement, and it was her father who sent out her first publication bid. Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.|$|E
5|$|Joaquim Inácio's {{parents were}} José Vitorino de Barros and Maria Isabel de Barros. In 1808, the Portuguese Royal {{family moved to}} Brazil, then the largest and wealthiest colony of Portugal. Two years later, on 10 July 1810, José de Barros arrived in the Brazilian capital, Rio de Janeiro. As a crew member of the frigate D. Carlota, {{he was charged with}} {{transporting}} what remained of the personal property of Prince Regent Dom João, later King Dom JoãoVI to Brazil. José de Barros also brought his <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> voyage, including Joaquim Inácio, who was then one year and eight months old. Joaquim Inácio had an older sister named Maria and six younger siblings (who were born after the arrival in Brazil), among them Bento José de Carvalho and Antônio José Vitorino de Barros.|$|E

5|$|Princess Andrew {{returned}} to Great Britain in April 1947 {{to attend the}} November wedding of her only son, Philip, to Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heir presumptive of King George VI. She had some of her remaining jewels used in Princess Elizabeth's engagement ring. On {{the day of the}} wedding, her son was created Duke of Edinburgh by George VI. For the wedding ceremony, Princess Andrew sat at the head of her <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side of Westminster Abbey, opposite the King, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary. It was decided not to invite Princess Andrew's daughters to the wedding because of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War II.|$|E
5|$|Show {{producers}} {{removed a}} sketch {{which would include}} a rape joke upon Carter's discovery of his daughter, Lois, with her secret <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern plantation. Unlike past requests to cut and/or alter jokes, this was not one imposed by the broadcast standards and practices; this was done on the writers' own accord. The sequence showing Peter's silent film star ancestor being stabbed in a card fight was omitted from television broadcasting to save time. Near {{the end of the}} episode, the Griffins are shown arguing over the quality of The Godfather; this scene is drawn from an actual argument that has taken place in the Family Guy writing room over its quality. MacFarlane prefers The 'Burbs and The Money Pit, both of which were received very poorly. Adolf Hitler talking to his wife about his annoyance at Peter Hitler was also removed from television broadcasting for timing purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Dove Street Festival of Lights – Begun 1990, the Dove Street Festival of Lights {{takes place}} each December. It began when a local <b>family</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street adopted their {{daughter}} {{and wanted to}} dedicate an event to her. Local families on Dove street decorated the entire street with holiday lights, connecting the homes {{together to create a}} light tunnel effect. Previously, the Glee Club of the Miami University of Ohio serenaded residents with holiday songs. Town volunteers collect donations of money, food and toys at the festival that are given to The Deep Well Project, a local charity. In recent years the festival has moved from the original Dove Street to Shelter Cove Lane where the town can assist in the electrical costs.|$|E
