5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle had lost its defensive role, and was used more as a military prison than a military fortification. Numerous people were executed or held captive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison,</b> including Cossack starshynas (officers), haidamakas, and even the three-year-old pretender to the Polish throne, Stanisław August Poniatowski.|$|E

5|$|Many {{elements}} can {{be considered}} as tributes to the power of cinema. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The interchangeability of the films used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject which is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. Then in the end of the film, Andy passes through a movie poster to escape his cell and ultimately Shawshank.|$|E

5|$|Imprisoned debtors {{were allowed}} some social contact, but the regime for criminals was {{designed}} to be one of isolation, according to the separate system. Consequently, the seating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> chapel is designed to enclose each prisoner individually so that the preacher could see everyone but each could see only him. By 1878 the system was discredited and the inmates were transferred to the new gaol in the eastern outskirts of Lincoln. The prison in the castle was left without a use until the Lincolnshire Archives were housed in its cells.|$|E

Bane fights Batman and delivers a crippling blow to his back, before taking him abroad to an underground prison. There, the inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> before finally escaping — the only prisoner to have ever done so.|$|E

5|$|Mladen {{and other}} members of the Tuzla group were sent to the prison in Zenica. Three months after they were sentenced they were joined by Ilić, whose death penalty had been {{commuted}} to 20 years' imprisonment. In the Zenica prison, each convict had to spend the first three months in solitary confinement. This was very hard on Mladen, who became mentally unwell and became so emaciated that Ilić could hardly recognise him. He recovered and took a course in shoe-making which was given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison.</b> Afterwards, he fell seriously ill and had to undergo surgery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> hospital. In late 1917, the Austrian authorities pardoned all convicts of the Tuzla group except Ilić. Mladen went to his family in Prijedor. After a medical examination, he was declared unfit for army service due to his surgery and as a result was not drafted into the Austrian army. He entered the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, shortly before the disintegration of Austria-Hungary in November 1918.|$|E

5|$|Parsons {{submitted}} a last request to walk under the stars, play basketball, and watch science-fiction films to prison warden Hank Galetka.

Prison spokesperson Jack Ford said that the requests would be granted, but that Parsons would only be allowed to shoot some hoops in a fenced recreation area instead of a game of basketball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> gymnasium. The authorities were concerned that an injury could delay the execution. Parsons was permitted to walk outdoors at night {{to the place of}} execution.|$|E

5|$|The {{land was}} officially renamed Melville Island in late 1804 or early 1805 {{in honour of}} Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville (who at the time had just been {{appointed}} First Lord of the Admiralty). A wooden barracks-style military prison was constructed to house common prisoners, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1808 and is today preserved as a monument, while a multi-storey building was designed to hold officers. As no exchange system was established with the French, the prison quickly became overcrowded. Some Spanish prisoners were also housed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> at this time.|$|E

5|$|Abel Starkey (died September 28, 1827) was {{a convicted}} {{counterfeiter}} whose death is {{closely tied to}} Old Newgate Prison after fatally falling during an escape attempt {{the night before the}} close of the prison. Starkey was from Roxbury, Massachusetts and became a counterfeiter. Members of a counterfeiting ring had eluded authorities for years, but they finally discovered the secret third attic of a lightning splitter home. Starkey was arrested, tried and convicted of counterfeiting. He was sentenced to a term of twenty years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison,</b> where he would amass a sum of money. His attempt to escape ended in his death, accounts of Starkey's attempt continued to be popular in reference to the prison's history.|$|E
5|$|According to Dickens {{specialist}} Trey Philpotts, {{the newest}} arrival was usually placed with the youngest prisoner {{who was living}} alone. A wealthier prisoner could pay his roommate to go away—"buy out the chum"—for half-a-crown a week in 1818, while the outcast chum would sleep in the tap room or find another room to rent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison.</b> The only prisoners not expected to pay chummage were debtors who had declared themselves insolvent by swearing an oath that they had assets worth less than 40 shillings. If their creditors agreed, they could be released after 14days, but if anyone objected, they remained confined to the poor side of the building, near the women's side, receiving a small weekly allowance from the county and money from charity.|$|E

Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison.</b> The corridor between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue.

5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> camp yard, fill it back in, and then be beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from {{the windows of the}} bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E

Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are sent to help the U.S. Marshals find them. The agents note that the FBI does not normally investigate prison escapes, and become suspicious as the prison is quarantined by the CDC and the National Guard.
