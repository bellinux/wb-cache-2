5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked me <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over {{what had once been}} her face.|$|E
25|$|In most congregations, the oleh {{does not}} himself read the Torah aloud. Rather, he stands near it while a practiced expert, called a ba'al k'ri'ah ("one {{in charge of}} reading"; {{sometimes}} ba'al ko're), reads the Torah, with cantillation, for the congregation. In some congregations the oleh follows along with the expert, reading <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper.</b> In Yemenite communities, the oleh reads the portion himself, while another person, usually a young boy, recites the Targum after each verse.|$|E
25|$|Filming {{began in}} November 1997. On {{the first day}} of {{principal}} photography, Anderson delivered his directions to Murray <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> so {{that he would not be}} embarrassed if the actor shot him down. However, the actor publicly deferred to Anderson, hauled equipment, and when Disney denied the director a $75,000 shot of Max and Mr. Blume riding in a helicopter, Murray gave Anderson a blank check to cover the cost, although ultimately the scene was never shot.|$|E

25|$|Goddard's serious {{bout with}} {{tuberculosis}} weakened his lungs, affecting {{his ability to}} work, and was one reason he liked to work alone, {{in order to avoid}} argument, and confrontation with others and use his time fruitfully. He labored with the prospect of a shorter than average life span. After arriving in Roswell, Goddard applied for life insurance, but when the company doctor examined him he said that Goddard belonged in a bed in Switzerland (where he could get the best care). Goddard's health began to deteriorate further after moving to the humid climate of Maryland to work for the Navy. He was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1945. He continued to work, able to speak only <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper,</b> until surgery was required, and he died in August of that year in Baltimore, Maryland. He was buried in Hope Cemetery in his home town of Worcester, Massachusetts.|$|E
500|$|The {{team made}} two minor {{changes to the}} design: they removed Davros' {{microphone}} and completely redesigned Davros' headpiece. The team felt that the microphone was redundant because Davros did not [...] "speak <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> and need something to make him more audible", and originally intended to leave Bleach's voice unaltered in post-production: the decision to treat the voice was not made until late May 2008; and Gorton thought the original headpiece [...] "always seemed particularly weak" [...] for [...] "such a powerful character". After he was informed that the production designer for Genesis of the Daleks wanted the headpiece to resemble a medical brace, Gorton redesigned it to appear to be [...] "screwed directly into [...] head".|$|E
500|$|As the French Revolution and its {{perceived}} {{threat to the}} United Kingdom gained momentum, so did Garrow's career; he prosecuted {{in most of the}} state trials, and as he increased in experience was left to manage many of them himself, coming up against leading barristers such as Thomas Erskine, James Mingay and James Scarlett. In May 1794 the Government suspended habeas corpus, in 1795 outlawed all public meetings, in 1797 outlawed secret organisations and in 1799 outlawed all societies interested in reforming the way the United Kingdom was run. The Government planned a series of 800 arrests, with 300 execution warrants for high treason made out and signed, making a particular effort to prosecute Thomas Hardy and John Horne Tooke. Hardy was the first to be tried, with the prosecution arguing that he sought a revolution in England similar to that in France. With Garrow prosecuting and Erskine defending, the trial lasted eight days instead of the normal one, and the foreman of the jury was so tense that he delivered the verdict of [...] "not guilty" [...] <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> and then immediately fainted. Tooke was then prosecuted; again, the jury found him not guilty, with the result that the other 800 trials were abandoned.|$|E

2500|$|A {{characteristic}} mannerism in Rossini's orchestral scoring is a long, steady {{building of}} sound over an ostinato figure, {{known as a}} [...] "Rossini crescendo", creating [...] "tempests in teapots by beginning <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whisper</b> and rising to a flashing, glittering storm," [...] which earned him the nickname of [...] "Signor Crescendo".|$|E

50|$|Psychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barrat {{discovered}} that <b>whispering</b> was <b>an</b> effective trigger for 75% of the 475 subjects {{who took part}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> experiment to investigate the nature of ASMR; and that statistic {{is reflected in the}} popularity of intentional ASMR videos that comprise someone speaking <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whispered</b> voice.|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} for {{the first}} time natural phase matching for optical frequency doubling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high-Q <b>whispering</b> gallery mode resonator made of Lithium Niobate. A conversion efficiency of 9 % is achieved at 30 micro Watt in-coupled continuous wave pump power. The observed saturation pump power of 3. 2 mW is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art. This suggests an application of our frequency doubler as a source of non-classical light requiring only a low-power pump, which easily can be quantum noise limited. Our theoretical analysis of the three-wave mixing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whispering</b> gallery mode resonator provides the relative conversion efficiencies for frequency doubling in various modes...|$|R
