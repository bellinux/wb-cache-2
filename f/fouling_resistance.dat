The surface topography of materials directly affects <b>fouling</b> <b>resistance</b> and fouling removal, the two key mechanisms for antifouling technologies. However, the field is hindered by the lack of quantified surface characteristics to guide the development of new antifouling materials. Using a biomimetic approach, key surface parameters are defined and quantified and correlated with <b>fouling</b> <b>resistance</b> and fouling removal from the shells of marine molluscs.

We evaluated nanometer-to-micrometer sized inorganic fillers (silver, copper, silica, zeolite, and silver-zeolite) materials with polysulfone (PSf) as the polymeric dispersing matrix. In general, mixed-matrix membranes were rougher, more hydrophilic, and more mechanically robust. Only sub-micron zeolite-PSf mixed-matrix membranes exhibited simultaneous improvements in water permeability and solute selectivity; all other mixed-matrix membranes were more permeable, but less selective due to defects associated with poor polymer-filler binding. Protein and bacterial <b>fouling</b> <b>resistance</b> of mixed-matrix membranes containing silver, zeolite, and silver-zeolite nanoparticles were compared to a low-fouling, poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) UF membrane.

40|$|International audienceFouling {{problems}} {{cannot be}} avoided in many heat exchanger operations, {{and it is}} necessary to introduce defensive measures to minimize fouling and the cost of cleaning. The fouling control measures used during either design or operation must be subjected to a thorough economic analysis, taking into consideration all the costs of the fouling control measures and their projected benefits in reducing costs due to fouling. Under some conditions, nearly asymptotic <b>fouling</b> <b>resistances</b> can be obtained, and this suggests a somewhat different approach to the economics. Fouling is a generic term for the deposition of foreign matter on a heat transfer surface. Deposits accumulating in the small channels of a compact heat exchanger affect both heat transfer and fluid flow. Fouling deposits constricting passages in a compact heat exchanger are likely to increase the pressure drop and therefore reduce the flow rate. Reduced flow rate may be a process constraint; it reduces efficiency and increases the associated energy use and running costs. Maintenance costs will also increase. Fouling remains the area of greatest concern for those considering the installation of compact heat exchangers. The widespread installation of compact heat exchangers has been hindered by the perception that the small passages are more strongly affected by the formation of deposits.

The overall performance of the process is governed by the accumulation of casein micelles at the membrane surface, {{which leads to the}} formation of an irreversible deposit (a gel) in critical hydrodynamic conditions (CHC). To control the filtration performance, it is then necessary to understand how the micelles accumulate at the membrane and how they interact with each other during accumulation. In that aim, microfiltration of skimmed milks is performed at different ionic strengths (NaCl addition 0 – 0. 3 M) and the properties of the casein micelles deposit are determined in each case in terms of structuration, transmission properties and <b>fouling</b> <b>resistances.</b> Upon addition of salt, our results indicate that the casein micelles turn into a gel at a lower “critical” casein concentration than with native milk. With the increase in ionic strength, the deposit is also more cohesive and harder to remove from the membrane. Finally, the addition of NaCl results in a change in the selectivity of the process, with a decrease in the overall protein transmission through the deposit layer. All these results are explained through a shift in the balance of interactions between and within the micelles as ionic strength is changed.

Thus, the control or mitigation of fouling is critical to all industries which employ heat transfer equipment. In this work, a simplified transient heat transfer <b>resistance</b> <b>fouling</b> measurement apparatus was designed and a simplified analysis protocol was formulated. The design of the apparatus was optimized through first order parametric modeling and finite difference modeling of the system. A solvent evaporation technique was utilized to deposit a film of known thickness and thermal conductivity inside the apparatus. Testing results, from before and after fouling deposition, indicate that the apparatus and analysis protocol were capable of measuring <b>fouling</b> thermal <b>resistances</b> of 2. 6 m 2 K/W. This measurement capability is comparable to the most sensitive fouling monitors disclosed in the open literature...|$|R

ABSTRACT: Fouling problems cannot be avoided in many heat exchanger operations, and {{it is necessary to}} introduce defensive measures to minimize fouling and the cost of cleaning. The fouling control measures used during either design or operation must be subjected to a thorough economic analysis, taking into consideration all the costs of the fouling control measures and their projected benefits in reducing costs due to fouling. Under some conditions, nearly asymptotic <b>fouling</b> <b>resistances</b> can be obtained, and this suggests a somewhat different approach to the economics. Fouling is a generic term for the deposition of foreign matter on a heat transfer surface. Deposits accumulating in the small channels of a compact heat exchanger affect both heat transfer and fluid flow. Fouling deposits constricting passages in a compact heat exchanger are likely to increase the pressure drop and therefore reduce the flow rate. Reduced flow rate may be a process constraint; it reduces efficiency and increases the associated energy use and running costs. Maintenance costs will also increase. Fouling remains the area of greatest concern for those considering the installation of compact heat exchangers. The widespread installation of compact heat exchangers has been hindered by the perception that the small passages are more strongly affected by the formation of deposits. In this paper different types of fouling and treatment are presented...|$|R
40|$|Severe flux decline was {{observed}} during ultrafiltration of a pulp mill effluent. Membrane fouling {{was the result}} of varying combinations of adsorption, pore plugging and concentration polarization or gel layer formation. A wide range of membrane materials and pore sizes were evaluated, showing the relationship between the membrane material, pore size and the relative contribution of the different <b>fouling</b> mechanisms. Individual <b>resistances</b> were evaluated for adsorption, pore plugging and concentration polarization using a series resistance model. These were based on the pure water flux for (1) the new membrane, (2) after static adsorption with the mill effluent, (3) the product rate when ultrafiltering the effluent, and (4) the pure water permeability with the <b>fouled</b> membrane. These <b>resistances</b> were shown to be misleading in terms of the observed flux loss for cases with significant adsorptive fouling. Adsorptive fouling was underestimated and concentration polarization overestimated. An alternative method, which we shall call flux loss ratios, is proposed, which is based on the flux decline due to a particular mechanisms as a fraction of the overall flux decline. These new measures more accurately reflect the flux decline attributable to each fouling mechanism. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
