JWST needs to use propellant to maintain its <b>halo</b> <b>orbit</b> around L2, which provides an upper limit to its designed lifetime, and it is being designed to carry enough for ten years. The planned five year science mission begins after a 6-month commissioning phase. An L2 orbit is meta-stable so it requires orbital station-keeping or an object will drift away from this orbital configuration.|$|E

40|$|The {{computation}} of translunar <b>Halo</b> <b>orbits</b> of {{the real}} Earth-Moon system (REMS) has been an open problem for a long time, but now, {{it is possible to}} compute <b>Halo</b> <b>orbits</b> of the REMS in a systematic way. In this paper, we describe the method used for the numerical computation of <b>Halo</b> <b>orbits</b> for a time span longer than 41 years. <b>Halo</b> <b>orbits</b> of the REMS are computed from quasi-periodic <b>Halo</b> <b>orbits</b> of the Quasi-bicircular Problem (QBCP). The QBCP is a model for the dynamics of a spacecraft in the Earth-Moon-Sun system. It is a Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom and depending periodically on time. In this model, Earth, Moon and Sun are moving in a self-consistent motion close to bicircular. The computed <b>Halo</b> <b>orbits</b> of the REMS are compared with the family of <b>Halo</b> <b>orbits</b> of the QBCP.

Although such <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> about artificial equilibrium points can be generated using a solar sail, there are points inside L 1 and beyond L 2 where a solar sail cannot be placed, so low-thrust, such as solar electric propulsion, is the only option to generate artificial <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> around points inaccessible to a solar sail. Analytical and numerical <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> for such low-thrust propulsion systems are obtained by using the Lindstedt Poincaré and differential corrector method respectively. Both the period and minimum amplitude of <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> about artificial equilibrium points inside L 1 decreases {{with an increase in}} low-thrust acceleration. The <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> about artificial equilibrium points beyond L 2 in contrast show an increase in period with an increase in low-thrust acceleration. However, the minimum amplitude first increases and then decreases after the thrust acceleration exceeds 0. 415 mm/s 2.

The Earth-Moon-SunSpacecraft case is considered and the Hamiltonian which governs {{the motion of the}} fourth mass is derived. That is a Hamiltonian with three degrees of freedom depending periodically on time.

We demonstrate that, in both the cases considered, the lobes exhibit two different regimes, namely, one where completely disjoint lobes occur symmetrically above and below the equatorial plane, and another where the lobes are joined across the plane. A possible application of the model concerns the structure of putative circumpulsar discs consisting of dust particles. We suggest that the particles can acquire a small (but non-zero) net electric charge, and this drives them to form the halo lobes...|$|R

Spectral analysis of <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> {{can be used}} to construct "frequency maps" which provide a compact representation of the 6 -dimensional phase space distribution function. Frequency maps identify important major orbit families, and the orbital abundances reflect the shape and orientation of the dark matter halo relative to the disk. We apply spectral analysis to <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> in a series of controlled simulations of disk galaxies. Although the shape of the simulated halo varies with radius, frequency maps of local samples of <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> confined to the inner halo contain most of the information about the global shape of the halo and its major orbit families. Quiescent or adiabatic disk formation results in significant trapping of <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> in resonant orbit families (i. e. orbits with commensurable frequencies). If a good estimate of the Galactic potential in the inner halo (within ~ 50 kpc) is available, the appearance of strong, stable resonances in frequency maps of <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> will allow us to determine the degree of resonant trapping induced by the disk potential. The locations and strengths of these resonant families are determined both by the global shape of the halo and its distribution function.

40|$|Accurate phase‐space {{coordinates}} (three {{components of}} position and velocity) of individual stars are rapidly becoming available with {{current and future}} resolved star surveys. These data will enable the computation of the full three‐dimensional orbits {{of tens of thousands}} of stars in the Milky Way’s stellar halo. We demonstrate that the analysis of stellar <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> in frequency space can be used to construct a ‘frequency map’ which provides a highly compact, yet intuitively informative way to represent the six‐dimensional halo phase‐space distribution function. This representation readily reveals the most important major orbit families in the halo, and the relative abundances of the different orbit families, which in turn reflect the shape and orientation of the dark matter halo relative to the disc. We demonstrate the value of frequency space orbit analysis by applying the method to <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> in a series of controlled simulations of disc galaxies. We show that the disc influences the shape of the inner halo making it nearly oblate, but the outer halo remains largely unaffected. Since the shape of the halo varies with radius, the frequency map provides a more versatile way to identify major and minor orbit families than traditional orbit classification schemes. Although the shape of the halo varies with radius, frequency maps of local samples of <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> confined to the inner halo contain most of the information about the global shape of the halo and its major orbit families. Frequency maps show that adiabatic growth of a disc traps <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> in numerous resonant orbit families (i. e. having commensurable frequencies). The locations and strengths of these resonant families are determined by both the global shape of the halo and its stellar distribution function. If a good estimate of the Galactic potential in the inner halo (within ∼ 50  kpc) is available, the appearance of strong, stable resonances in frequency maps of <b>halo</b> <b>orbits</b> will allow us to determine the degree of resonant trapping induced by the disc potential.
