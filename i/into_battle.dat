5|$|In 1963, {{when the}} I-196/US 131 freeway opened, the western {{terminus}} of M-89 {{was extended to}} meet the new freeway. A few years later, when M-96 was realigned onto a route that took it <b>into</b> <b>Battle</b> Creek, M-89 was extended southeasterly along Michigan Avenue (the old M-96) and terminated at M-37. The highway was extended further southeasterly <b>into</b> <b>Battle</b> Creek to replace the old routing of M-37 along Michigan Avenue; it then turned south on Washington to the BL I-94 where it terminated, thus bringing the route to its current alignment.|$|E
5|$|The playable {{character}} can lead {{a group of}} three additional allies <b>into</b> <b>battle,</b> controlling their actions to attack a single enemy or to use specific powers. Characters can be set to one of three modes: defensive, neutral, or offensive. In defensive mode, the character remains distant from battles, while offensive mode sends the character directly <b>into</b> <b>battle.</b> The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on screen that reflect their current physical or emotional state, showing sadness, anger, feeding, or the presence of injuries or staking—having been stabbed through the heart and rendered immobile.|$|E
5|$|Dating back to 1919, M-89 was {{originally}} just {{a segment of}} the current highway between the Ganges area and Martin. Changes through the 1920s and 1930s moved the eastern end to Calhoun County. The last section was paved in the 1950s before the highway was rerouted in the Allegan, Michigan area. The last extensions <b>into</b> <b>Battle</b> Creek came in the 1960s and 1998.|$|E

5|$|Each {{character}} can summon a specific Eidolon <b>into</b> <b>battle.</b> These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.|$|E
5|$|In her {{drawings}} {{she uses}} black outlines filled with flat areas of colour, a post-impressionist technique reminiscent {{of some of}} the French poster artists of the late nineteenth century...The regular patterning of men, tents and buildings in many of the works suggests the control that was imposed by the vast machine of men and modern war. In many drawings there is a strong sense of waiting: waiting to move <b>into</b> <b>battle,</b> waiting for the war to end, waiting to be sent home.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1940 the Central Landing Establishment {{was formed}} at Ringway {{airfield}} near Manchester. Although tasked primarily with training parachute troops, {{it was also}} directed to investigate the use of gliders to transport troops <b>into</b> <b>battle.</b> At the same time, the Ministry of Aircraft Production contracted General Aircraft Limited to design and produce a glider for this purpose. The result was the General Aircraft Hotspur, an aircraft capable of transporting eight soldiers, that was used for both assault and training purposes.|$|E

5|$|The Heilongjiang hand cannon is {{also often}} {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the oldest firearm since it was unearthed near the area where the History of Yuan reports a battle took place involving hand cannon. According to the History of Yuan, in 1288, a Jurchen commander by the name of Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannon <b>into</b> <b>battle</b> against the rebel prince Nayan.|$|E
5|$|The Mk VIII {{was also}} {{discussed}} {{in terms of}} another plan known as the Carrier Wing; in this plan flying surfaces, such as wings, would be fitted to the Mk VIII so that it could be towed by a transport aircraft and then glide <b>into</b> <b>battle</b> in support of airborne forces. The plan was dropped, however, after the prototype crashed after it had taken off.|$|E

5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of the Earl of Gloucester's death at the Battle of Bannockburn is the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi. This account is written as a moral tale, expounding on the earl's heroism and the cowardly conduct of his companions. For this reason, its historical accuracy must be taken with some caution. According to some accounts, Gloucester rushed headfirst <b>into</b> <b>battle</b> {{in the pursuit of}} glory, and fell victim to his own foolishness. The Vita, on the other hand, claimed that, as the earl was vigorously trying to fend off the Scottish attacks, he was knocked off his horse, and killed when his own men failed to come to his rescue. It is also likely that the quarrels between Gloucester and Hereford over precedence could have contributed to the chaotic situation. According to one account, Gloucester rushed <b>into</b> <b>battle</b> without a distinguishing coat of arms, exposing himself to the Scottish soldiers, who otherwise would have been eager to secure a valuable ransom.|$|E

5|$|The {{strengths}} {{given for}} the two armies vary somewhat. Historian Digby Smith credited the French with between 40,000 and 45,000 men while stating Austro-Dutch numbers as 43,000. Ramsay Weston Phipps asserted that the French had 40,000 foot and 4,500 horse while the Coalition counted 30,000 infantry and 9,000 cavalry. Theodore Ayrault Dodge wrote that Dumouriez put 42,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry <b>into</b> <b>battle</b> against Coburg's 30,000 foot and 10,000 horse. According to Gunther E. Rothenberg Dumouriez was outnumbered 43,000 to 41,000.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin, {{armed with}} heavy {{anti-aircraft}} batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during {{air strikes against}} Formosa, Luzon, and the Nansei Shoto to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations.

5|$|Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba {{offers a}} longer account, which Abbot Ségéne {{had heard from}} Oswald himself.

This coming night go out from your camp <b>into</b> <b>battle,</b> for the Lord has granted me that at this time your foes shall be put to flight and Cadwallon your enemy shall be {{delivered}} into your hands and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily. Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after the battle. In the battle that followed, the British were routed despite their superior numbers; Cadwallon himself was killed.|$|E
