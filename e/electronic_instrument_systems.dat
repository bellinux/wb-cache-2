50|$|After trials with Rotax and Volkswagen engines, Lambert {{chose the}} Belgian 61 kW (82 hp) ULPower UL260i {{flat-four}} {{to power the}} M106. The development period also produced changes to the undercarriage, which initially had V-strut main legs and half-axles. These were replaced with cantilever spring glass fiber legs. The standard M106 has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, though tricycle gear is an option. The wheels may be faired. A glass cockpit <b>electronic</b> flight <b>instrument</b> <b>system</b> is standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|A Rockwell Collins <b>Electronic</b> Flight <b>Instrument</b> <b>System</b> (EFIS) is fitted, with {{multi-function}} displays (MFDs) in {{the front}} and rear cockpits showing information to the pilots. The emergency cockpit escape system is made up of two Martin-Baker MK-10L rocket-assisted ejection seats which are zero-zero capable, meaning they can be used safely at zero altitude and zero speed. Although JL-8 is designed to have limited capability to deliver air-to-ground weapons, the first rocket attack practice was only completed in May 2011.|$|R

The cockpit also features an three-stage integrated altering system that issues warnings to the flying crew.|$|R
5000|$|AHRS {{have proven}} {{themselves}} to be highly reliable and are in common use in commercial and business aircraft. AHRS are typically integrated with <b>electronic</b> flight <b>instrument</b> <b>systems</b> (EFIS) which are {{the central part of}} so-called glass cockpits, to form the primary flight display. AHRS can be combined with air data computers to form an [...] "air data, attitude and heading reference system" [...] (ADAHRS), which provide additional information such as airspeed, altitude and outside air temperature.|$|R
5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument</b> displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the <b>Electronic</b> Flight <b>Instrument</b> <b>System</b> (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.|$|R
50|$|An <b>electronic</b> flight <b>instrument</b> <b>system</b> (EFIS) is {{a flight}} deck <b>instrument</b> display <b>system</b> that {{displays}} flight data electronically rather than electromechanically. An EFIS normally {{consists of a}} primary flight display (PFD), multi-function display (MFD), and an engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS) display. Early EFIS models used cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, but liquid crystal displays (LCD) are now more common. The complex electromechanical attitude director indicator (ADI) and horizontal situation indicator (HSI) were the first candidates for replacement by EFIS. Now, however, few flight deck instruments cannot be replaced by an electronic display.|$|R

50|$|The 767 {{was one of}} {{the first}} airliners to include an <b>electronic</b> flight <b>instrument</b> <b>system,</b> which {{operated}} on the electricity generated by the aircraft's jet engines. With both engines stopped, the system went dead, leaving only a few basic battery-powered emergency flight instruments. While these provided sufficient information with which to land the aircraft, a vertical speed indicator that would indicate the rate at which the aircraft was descending and therefore how long it could glide unpowered was not among them.|$|R
50|$|The Z-18 uses {{composite}} {{materials for the}} rotor blade and titanium main rotor.

It is a , updated version of the MD-88 with similar <b>electronic</b> flight <b>instrument</b> <b>system</b> (EFIS) and more powerful, quieter and fuel efficient IAE V2500 engines instead of the JT8D engines, which power the MD-80 series. This made the MD-90 the first derivative variant of the DC-9 to use a high-bypass turbofan engine. Typical seating for the MD-90 ranges from 153 to 172 passengers, depending on the cabin configuration and interior layout.|$|R
