40|$|The {{amount of}} wind power which the wind turbine can produce is {{dependent}} on the wind speed region. To optimize wind turbine power, a pitch angle of the wind turbine’s blade needs to be determined. In the high rated wind speed region, the pitch angle need to be controlled to reduce torque and output power variation. In the low rated wind speed region, it is a challenge to maximize available energy. In this paper, a wind turbine is developed for the low rated wind speed in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. Based on the characteristic of power coefficient of the wind turbine and the data profile of wind speed for the last three years, the <b>pitch</b> angle <b>position</b> was determined. It is shown that the wind turbine has its maximum power coefficient at a fixed <b>pitch</b> angle <b>position</b> of 16. 8 o for every wind speed below 10 m/s or low rated wind speed. A total power production of 216. 98 kWh/year can be produced at the <b>pitch</b> angle <b>position</b> of 16. 8 o and a total power production> 200 kWh/year for the <b>pitch</b> angle <b>position</b> of 13. 1 to 20 o. It is suggested that the wind turbine has a good tolerance of <b>pitch</b> angle <b>position.</b> This wind turbine is suitable for the low rated wind speed region and a potentially low cost which can be operated at a fixed <b>pitch</b> angle <b>position</b> of the wind turbine’s blade.

40|$|Pitch {{contrasts}} {{signal word}} meanings by pitch contours (rise versus fall), pitch levels (high versus low) or positions (earlier or {{later in a}} word). Previous studies have largely focused on native or non-native perception of pitch contours and pitch levels (Gandour 1983; Wang et al. 1976; Hallé et al. 2004; Xu et al. 2006; among others). Few studies have been directed towards perception of <b>pitch</b> <b>positions.</b> To fill in the gap, the current study made an attempt to investigate perception of <b>pitch</b> <b>position</b> by listeners of different word prosodic systems, Dutch listeners (stress system) and Japanese listeners (pitch accent system). Dutch resembles Japanese in that they both use positional marking to signal lexical items, but they differ by the means: Dutch exploits the location of stress while Japanese employs pitch accent for positional marking. The two languages also differ {{in the role of}} pitch function at the word level. Pitch is one of the acoustic correlates in Dutch stress while pitch in Japanese is exploited exclusively to distinguish lexical meanings. Given these, the current study aimed to examine whether Dutch listeners whose native languages do not have lexically contrastive pitch were able to perceive non-native <b>pitch</b> <b>position</b> contrasts at the acoustic level and phonological level. An ABX discrimination task and a sequence recall task were implemented in the study for the purpose of examining listeners’ acoustic perception and phonological perception, respectively. Results of the two experiments were discussed with respect to the predictions from different perceptual models.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the situation with early artificial turf pitches, little information has previously been published on the characterisation of third-generation artificial surfaces. The spatial variation of ball rebound resilience and rotational resistance were measured here under dry conditions, late in the season, for two natural turf football pitches and a recently laid third-generation artificial turf pitch. Data for the natural turf pitches show a wider variation with <b>position</b> on the <b>pitch</b> than for the artificial pitch. The latter surface showed remarkable consistency in both quantities measured. Surprisingly, all ball rebound resilience data {{and some of the}} rotational resistance values were found to lie outside current FIFA specifications, possibly due to the level of wear in natural turf {{at this stage of the}} season. For the artificial turf, the deterioration in properties over a period of 6 months is significant and suggests more frequent testing is needed. Taking data from various <b>pitch</b> <b>positions,</b> the two measured quantities were shown for the first time, as far as we are aware, to be inversely related for both natural turf pitches. This correlation may be largely attributed to differences in the extent of grass cover and/or soil compaction.

A 2 MHz ultrasound probe was fixed with a headband nearby the protuberantia occipitalis externa. Fifteen subjects were seated in a motorized three-dimensional turntable. Vm-SS, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored in five whole-body <b>pitch</b> <b>positions</b> from upright (0 degrees) to " 20 degrees head-hanging" (110 degrees) : 0, 30, 60, 90 and 110 degrees. The experiment was repeated during the inspiration of 5 % CO 2. Of 15 subjects, 14 showed reliable ultrasound data; the results of one subject with movement artifacts were excluded. Vm-SS values under normocarbia (hypercarbia) were 23. 9 +/- 4. 2 cm/s (40. 9 +/- 6. 7 cm/s) at 0 degrees, 23. 1 +/- 5. 0 cm/s (38. 0 +/- 5. 0 cm/s) at 30 degrees, 24. 9 +/- 5. 1 cm/s (39. 9 +/- 3. 3 cm/s) at 60 degrees, 29. 2 +/- 8. 5 cm/s (41. 0 +/- 4. 7 cm/s) at 90 degrees and 27. 0 +/- 11. 6 cm/s (43. 6 +/- 12. 1 cm/s) at 110 degrees. Vm-SS measured under normocarbia (p = 0. 09) and hypercarbia (p = 0. 25) were not affected while subjects were positioned from upright toward " 20 degrees head-hanging", whereas blood pressure and heart rate decreased (p < 0. 01).
