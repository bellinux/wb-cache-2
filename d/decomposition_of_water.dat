25|$|High {{pressure}} electrolysis is the electrolysis of water by <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen gas (H2) {{by means of}} an electric current being passed through the water. The difference with a standard electrolyzer is the compressed hydrogen output around 120-200 bar (1740-2900 psi, 12–20 MPa). By pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser, through a process known as chemical compression, the need for an external hydrogen compressor is eliminated, the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3%.|$|E
25|$|Water can be {{converted}} to its component elemental gasses, H2 and O2 through the application of an external voltage. Water doesn't decompose into hydrogen and oxygen spontaneously as the Gibbs free energy for the process at standard conditions is about 474.4 kJ. The <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> into hydrogen and oxygen can be performed in an electrolytic cell. In it, a pair of inert electrodes usually made of platinum immersed in water act as anode and cathode in the electrolytic process. The electrolysis starts with the application of an external voltage between the electrodes. This process will not occur except at extremely high voltages without an electrolyte such as sodium chloride or sulfuric acid (most used 0.1 M).|$|E

The last two appeared in journals in England and Germany, respectively. Morey noted differences in flames near knots, perhaps rich in sap, or in wet wood. Eventually he experimented with anything he could find: “tar, rosin, rough turpentine, or the spirit, or alcohol, or any kind of oil, fat, or tallow; mineral coal, pitch-pine wood, and the knots, birch bark, pumpkin, sun-flower, flax, and other seeds; as well as many other substances.” ...|$|E

During {{the course}} of the {{experiments}} made to render the instrument efficient, I was occasionally surprised at observing a deficiency of the gases resulting from the <b>decompositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and at last an actual disappearance of portions which had been evolved, collected, and measured. The circumstances of the disappearance were these. A glass tube, about twelve inches in length and 3/4ths of an inch in diameter, had two platina poles fixed into its upper, hermetically sealed, extremity: the poles, where they passed through the glass, were of wire; but terminated below in plates, which were soldered to the wires with gold (Plate V. fig. 56.). The tube was filled with dilute sulphuric acid, and inverted in a cup of the same fluid; a voltaic battery was connected with the two wires, and sufficient oxygen and hydrogen evolved to occupy 4/5ths of the tube, or by the graduation, 116 parts. On separating the tube from the voltaic battery the volume of gas immediately began to diminish, and in about five hours only 13-1/2 parts remained, and these ultimately disappeared.|$|R

On {{the other}} hand, the {{relation}} between the conduction of the electricity and the <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> is so close, that one cannot take place without the other. If the water is altered only in that small degree which consists in its having the solid instead of the fluid state, the conduction is stopped, and the decomposition is stopped with it.

50|$|The voltaic pile was {{the first}} {{electrical}} battery that could continuously provide an electric current to a circuit. It was invented by Alessandro Volta, who published his experiments in 1799.

6000|$|... 1009. When {{the extreme}} plates of the {{arrangement}} just described, fig. 90, are connected metallically through the galvanometer g, {{then the whole}} represents a battery consisting of two pairs of zinc and platina plates urging a current forward, which has, however, to decompose water unassisted by any direct chemical affinity {{before it can be}} transmitted across the cell iii, and therefore before it can circulate. This <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> which is opposed to the passage of the current, may, as a matter of convenience, be considered as taking place either against the surfaces of the two platina plates which constitute the electrodes in the cell in, or against the two surfaces of that platina plate which separates the cells ii and iii, fig. 91, from each other. It is evident that if that plate were away, the battery would consist of two pairs of plates and two cells, arranged in the most favourable position for the production of a current. The platina plate therefore, which being introduced as at x, has oxygen evolved at one surface and hydrogen at the other (that is, if the decomposing current passes), may be considered as the cause of any obstruction arising from the <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> by the electrolytic action of the current; and I have usually called it the interposed plate.|$|E
6000|$|... 336. M. Bonijol of Geneva[A] {{is said to}} have {{constructed}} {{very delicate}} apparatus for the <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> by common electricity. By connecting an insulated lightning rod with his apparatus, the decomposition of the water proceeded in a continuous and rapid manner even when the electricity of the atmosphere was not very powerful. The apparatus is not described; but as the diameter of the wire is mentioned as very small, it appears to have been similar in construction to that of Wollaston (327.); and as that does not furnish a case of true polar electro-chemical decomposition (328.), this result of M. Bonijol does not prove the identity in chemical action of common and voltaic electricity.|$|E

In {{concluding}} this {{summary of}} the powers of torpedinal electricity, I cannot refrain from pointing out the enormous absolute quantity of electricity which the animal must put in circulation at each effort. It is doubtful whether any common electrical machine has as yet been able to supply electricity sufficient in a reasonable time to cause true electro-chemical <b>decomposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> (330. 339.), yet the current from the torpedo has done it. The same high proportion is shown by the magnetic effects (296. 371.). These circumstances indicate that the torpedo has power (in the way probably that Cavendish describes,) to continue the evolution for a sensible time, so that its successive discharges rather resemble those of a voltaic arrangement, intermitting in its action, than those of a Leyden apparatus, charged and discharged many times in succession. In reality, however, there is no philosophical {{difference between these two}} cases.|$|E
