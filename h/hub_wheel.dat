30|$|The battery charges with {{electricity}} either when plugged in the electricity grid via a charging device or during braking through recuperation. The charger {{is a crucial}} component since its efficiency can vary today between 60 % and 97 %, wasting 3 % to 40 % of the grid energy as heat. The motor controller supplies the electric motor with variable power depending on the load situation. The electric motor converts the electric energy into mechanical energy and, when used within a drivetrain, to torque. In series BEV produced so far, central engines have been used; however, <b>hub</b> <b>wheel</b> electric engines are also possible and would be available for mass production (summarized in [5]).|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the study is}} {{investigation}} of the effect of an interference fit between the wheel hub and the axle of a rail vehicle as well as some axle dimensions on the state of stress in the transition zone in vicinity of the connection: <b>hub</b> <b>wheel</b> - axle journal. An important role in behaviour of the fatigue notch occurring there plays the interference fit. The influence on the quantitative effects of the stress-strain state is to be considered. In order to investigate this phenomenon the finite element method with use of the three-dimensional elements and the contact was applied. The problem is important because of the increasing speed of modern passenger vehicles. Additionally, a threat occurs {{not only because of the}} loss of capacity of the axle, but also because of the possibility of slip between the wheel and the axle journal...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on a low-speed multistage axial-flow compressor to assess the effects of shrouded stator cavity flows on aerodynamic performance. Five configurations, which involved changes in seal-tooth leakage rates and/or elimination of the shrouded stator cavities, were tested. Data collected enabled differences in overall individual stage and the third stage blade element performance parameters to be compared. The results show conclusively that seal-tooth leakage ran have a large impact on compressor aerodynamic performance while {{the presence of the}} shrouded stator cavities alone seemed to have little influence. Overall performance data revealed that for every 1 % increase in the seal-tooth clearance to blade-height ratio the pressure rise dropped up to 3 % while efficiency was reduced by 1 to 1. 5 points. These observed efficiency penalty slopes are comparable to those commonly reported for rotor and cantilevered stator tip clearance variations. Therefore, it appears that in order to correctly predict overall performance it is equally important to account for the effects of seal-tooth leakage as it is to include the influence of tip clearance flows. Third stage blade element performance data suggested that the performance degradation observed when leakage was increased was brought about in two distinct ways. First, increasing seal-tooth leakage directly spoiled the near hub performance of the stator row in which leakage occurred. Second, the altered stator exit now conditions caused by increased leakage impaired the performance of the next downstream stage by decreasing the work input of the downstream rotor and increasing total pressure loss of the downstream stator. These trends caused downstream stages to progressively perform worse. Other measurements were acquired to determine spatial and temporal flow field variations within the up-and-downstream shrouded stator cavities. Flow within the cavities involved low momentum fluid traveling primarily in the circumferential direction at about 40 % of the <b>hub</b> <b>wheel</b> speed. Measurements indicated that the flow within both cavities was much more complex than first envisioned. A vortical flow structure in the meridional plane, similar to a driven cavity, existed within the upstream cavity Furthermore, other spatial and temporal variations in Row properties existed. the most prominent being caused by the upstream potential influence of the downstream blade. This influence caused the fluid within cavities near the leading edges of either stator blades in space or rotor blades in time to be driven radially inward relative to fluid near blade mid-pitch. This influence also produced large unsteady velocity fluctuations in the downstream cavity because of the passing of the downstream rotor blade...|$|E

The most probable reason for the generation of such forces appears to be either due to heavy landing or inadequate tyre pressure.
