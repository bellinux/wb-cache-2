5|$|During the {{reintroduction}} of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, <b>enteritis</b> and {{ill health}} in pre-release birds {{was due to}} bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species. Subsequently, microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal {{properties}} {{have been}} ascribed to Phallus indusiatus {{from the time}} of the Chinese Tang Dynasty when it was described in pharmacopoeia. The fungus was used to treat many inflammatory, stomach, and neural diseases. Southern China's Miao people continue to use it traditionally for a number of afflictions, including injuries and pains, cough, dysentery, <b>enteritis,</b> leukemia, and feebleness, and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for laryngitis, leucorrhea, fever, and oliguria (low urine output), diarrhea, hypertension, cough, hyperlipidemia, and in anticancer therapy. Modern science has probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} in this genus include the widespread fluke Prosthogonimus ovatus(which {{lives in the}} oviducts of birds), the parasitic worm Plagiorchis elegans, the larvae of parasitic flies, the feather mite Metanalges elongatus, and hard ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis and Ixodes. During the reintroduction of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, <b>enteritis</b> and ill health in pre-release birds was due to bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species. Subsequently, microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviral <b>enteritis</b> is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery {{diarrhoea}} and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} known to be toxic to goats; a study {{published}} in the early 1980s revealed that 11 out of 12 goats died after 1 to 40 days of daily oral dosing of Tephrosia apollinea shoots (fresh or dried), and that they displayed adverse reactions to ingesting it such as dyspnoea, weakness of the limbs and joints causing instability in movement, changes in fat composition, catarrhal <b>enteritis,</b> and hemorrhage in the heart, lungs, and intestinal mucosa. Rotenoids extracted from the seeds of the plant also caused complete mortality in Aphis craccivora, when applied at a concentration of 0.1% for 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|Proximal <b>enteritis,</b> {{also known}} as {{anterior}} <b>enteritis</b> or duodenitis-proximal jejunitis (DPJ), is inflammation of the duodenum and upper jejunum. It is potentially caused by infectious organisms, such as Salmonella and Clostridial species, but other possible contributing factors include Fusarium infection or high concentrate diets. The inflammation of the intestine leads to large secretions of electrolytes and fluid into its lumen, and thus large amounts of gastric reflux, leading to dehydration and occasionally shock.|$|E
25|$|Small bowel {{obstruction}} {{caused by}} Crohn's disease, peritoneal carcinomatosis, sclerosing peritonitis, radiation <b>enteritis,</b> and postpartum bowel obstruction are typically treated conservatively, i.e. without surgery.|$|E
25|$|Differentiation between {{proximal}} <b>enteritis</b> {{and small}} intestinal obstruction {{is important to}} ensure correct treatment, and can be assisted {{with the help of}} ultrasound. Horses with small intestinal obstruction will usually have an intestinal diameter of -10nbsp&cm with a wall thickness of 3-5mm. Horses with proximal <b>enteritis</b> usually have an intestinal diameter that is narrower, but wall thickness is often greater than 6mm, containing a hyperechoic or anechoic fluid, with normal, increased, or decreased peristalsis. However, obstructions that have been present for some time may present with thickened walls and distention of the intestine.|$|E

25|$|The small {{intestine}} {{consists of the}} duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Inflammation of the {{small intestine}} is called <b>enteritis,</b> which if localised to just part is called duodenitis, jejunitis and ileitis, respectively. Peptic ulcers are also common in the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} {{differential diagnosis}} is extensive and requires consideration {{of many other}} infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, shigellosis, rickettsial diseases, cholera, sepsis, borreliosis, EHEC <b>enteritis,</b> leptospirosis, scrub typhus, plague, Q fever, candidiasis, histoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis, measles, and viral hepatitis among others.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{cases have}} been {{associated}} with acute fever, myalgias, bronchospasm, pruritic rashes, lymphadenopathy, subcutaneous nodules associated with eosinophilia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated creatinine kinase levels. Symptoms may last as long as five years. Segmental necrotizing <b>enteritis</b> has been reported on one occasion.|$|E
25|$|Deworm pet {{dogs and}} cats. Canine and feline hookworms rarely develop to {{adulthood}} in humans. Ancylostoma caninum, the common dog hookworm, occasionally develops into an adult to cause eosinophilic <b>enteritis</b> in people, but their invasive larvae can cause an itchy rash called cutaneous larva migrans.|$|E
25|$|Rectal biopsy {{is rarely}} {{performed}} {{due to its}} risks of abscess formation, rectal perforation and peritonitis, and because it requires a skilled clinical to perform. However, it {{can be useful in}} cases of suspected intestinal cancer, as well as some inflammatory diseases (such as IBD) and infiltrative diseases, like granulomatous <b>enteritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{strains of}} C jejuni produce a cholera-like enterotoxin, which is {{important}} in the watery diarrhea observed in infections. The organism produces diffuse, bloody, edematous, and exudative <b>enteritis.</b> In a small number of cases, the infection may be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura through a poorly understood mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Backing up {{of fluid}} through the {{intestinal}} tract is usually {{due to a}} downstream obstruction, ileus, or proximal <b>enteritis,</b> and its presence usually indicates a small intestinal disease. Generally, the closer the obstruction is to the stomach, the greater amount of gastric reflux will be present. Approximately 50% of horses with gastric reflux require surgery.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{causes of}} deaths were choking, reflexogenic circulatory {{collapse}} and pulmonary oedema. Findings during autopsies revealed changes {{not only in}} the lungs but also cerebral oedema, tubular necrosis of the kidneys, fatty degeneration of the liver and necrotising <b>enteritis.</b> The stillbirth rate increased by up to 300% and neonatal mortality rate by around 200%.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{diarrhea}} {{occurs when}} there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border, {{which leads to a}} passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids. Features of all three of the other types of diarrhea can be found in this type of diarrhea. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases. It can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and <b>enteritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Campylobacter {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of human {{bacterial}} gastroenteritis. For instance, an estimated 2 million cases of Campylobacter <b>enteritis</b> occur annually in the U.S., accounting for 5â€“7% of cases of gastroenteritis. Furthermore, in the United Kingdom during 2000, Campylobacter jejuni was involved in 77.3% in all cases of laboratory confirmed foodborne illness. About 15 of every 100,000 people are diagnosed with campylobacteriosis every year, and with many cases going unreported, up to 0.5% of the general population may unknowingly harbor Campylobacter in their gut.|$|E
25|$|Potentially painful cancer {{treatments}} include immunotherapy which may produce joint or muscle pain; radiotherapy, {{which can cause}} skin reactions, <b>enteritis,</b> fibrosis, myelopathy, bone necrosis, neuropathy or plexopathy; chemotherapy, often associated with mucositis, joint pain, muscle pain, peripheral neuropathy and abdominal pain due to diarrhea or constipation; hormone therapy, which sometimes causes pain flares; targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab and rituximab, which can cause muscle, joint or chest pain; angiogenesis inhibitors like bevacizumab, known to sometimes cause bone pain; and surgery, which may produce post-operative pain, post-amputation pain or pelvic floor myalgia.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{made through}} {{detection}} of CPV2 in the feces by either an ELISA or a hemagglutination test, or by electron microscopy. PCR has become available to diagnose CPV2, {{and can be}} used later in the disease when potentially less virus is being shed in the feces that may not be detectable by ELISA. Clinically, the intestinal form of the infection can sometimes be confused with coronavirus or other forms of <b>enteritis.</b> Parvovirus, however, is more serious and the presence of bloody diarrhea, a low white blood cell count, and necrosis of the intestinal lining also point more towards parvovirus, especially in an unvaccinated dog. The cardiac form is typically easier to diagnose because the symptoms are distinct.|$|E
25|$|Nasogastric intubation, a {{mainstay}} of colic management, is often repeated multiple times until resolution of clinical signs, both {{as a method of}} gastric reflux removal and as a way to directly administer fluids and medication into the stomach. Reflux must be removed periodically to prevent distention and possible rupture of the stomach, and to track reflux production, which aids in monitoring the progression of the colic. Its use is especially important in the case of strangulating obstruction or <b>enteritis,</b> since both of these cause excessive secretion of fluid into the intestine, leading to fluid back-up and distention of the stomach. Nasogastric intubation also has the benefit of providing pain relief resulting from gastric distention.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Sari Bair of August 1915, {{during which}} the New Zealanders {{attacked}} Chunuk Bair, the assistant director of medical services of the New Zealand and Australian Division, Colonel Neville Manders, was wounded and Begg took over his duties. He immediately set about dealing with the backlog of wounded soldiers that had accumulated at the beach. Shortly after completing this task, he became ill with gastro <b>enteritis.</b> Initially evacuated to Malta, {{he was sent to}} England for further treatment. He returned to Gallipoli on 12 November and was made the acting director of medical services. Promoted to temporary colonel, he helped with the organisation of the evacuation of Allied forces from Gallipoli the following month. His services at Gallipoli were recognised with a mention in despatches and he was made a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George.|$|E
25|$|Barium X-ray {{examinations}} {{are useful}} tools {{for the study}} of appearance and function of the parts of the gastrointestinal tract. They are used to diagnose and monitor esophageal reflux, dysphagia, hiatus hernia, strictures, diverticula, pyloric stenosis, gastritis, <b>enteritis,</b> volvulus, varices, ulcers, tumors, and gastrointestinal dysmotility, as well as to detect foreign bodies. Historically barium X-ray examinations are the standard approach used to assess and diagnose diseases of the gut, but they are increasingly being replaced by more modern techniques such as computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, endoscopy and capsule endoscopy. However, barium contrast imaging remains a common diagnostic test, which has the advantage of lower costs and being more widely available as compared to newer techniques. Newer techniques are also not able to assess superficial mucosal lesions in as much detail as some barium X-ray techniques such as enteroclysis.|$|E
25|$|Many {{bacteria}} are parasitic, though since {{the result is}} infection and disease, sometimes leading to death, they are generally thought of as pathogens instead. Parasitic {{bacteria are}} extremely diverse, and infect their hosts {{by a variety of}} routes. To give a few examples, Bacillus anthracis, the cause of anthrax, is spread by contact with infected domestic animals; the bacillus's spores, which can survive for years outside the body, can enter a host through an abrasion or may be inhaled. Borrelia, the cause of Lyme disease and relapsing fever, is transmitted by a vector, ticks of the genus Ixodes, from the diseases' reservoirs in animals such as deer. Campylobacter jejuni, a cause of severe <b>enteritis</b> (gut inflammation), is spread by the fecal-oral route from animals, or by eating insufficiently cooked poultry, or by contaminated water. Haemophilus influenzae, an agent of bacterial meningitis and respiratory tract infections such as influenza and bronchitis, is transmitted by droplet contact. Treponema pallidum, the cause of syphilis, is spread by sexual intercourse.|$|E
25|$|Fluids are {{commonly}} given, either orally by nasogastric tube or by intravenous catheter, to restore proper hydration and electrolyte balance. In cases of strangulating obstruction or <b>enteritis,</b> the intestine will have decreased absorption and increased secretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen, making oral fluids ineffective and possibly dangerous if they cause gastric distention and rupture. This process of secretion into the intestinal lumen leads to dehydration, and these horse require {{large amounts of}} IV fluids to prevent hypotension and subsequent cardiovascular collapse. Fluid rates are calculated by adding the fluid lost during each collection of gastric reflux to the daily maintenance requirement of the horse. Due {{to the fact that}} horses absorb water in the cecum and colon, the IV fluid requirement of horses with simple obstruction is dependent on the location of the obstruction. Those that are obstructed further distally, such as at the pelvic flexure, are able to absorb more oral fluid than those obstructed in the small intestine, and therefore require less IV fluid support. Impactions are usually managed with fluids for 3â€“5 days before surgery is considered. Fluids are given based on results of the physical examination, such as mucous membrane quality, PCV, and electrolyte levels. Horses in circulatory shock, such as those suffering from endotoxemia, require very high rates of IV fluid administration. Oral fluids via nasogastric tube are often given in the case of impactions to help lubricate the obstruction. Oral fluids should not be given if significant amounts of nasogastric reflux are obtained. Access to food and water will often be denied to allow careful monitoring and administration of what is taken in by the horse.|$|E

500|$|The depot {{was reached}} on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, {{was unable to}} pull or to eat {{anything}} but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: [...] "BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit". A few days later, {{the rest of the}} party were struck with severe <b>enteritis,</b> the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. Fortunately a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate.|$|E
500|$|In November 1623, Donne fell seriously ill. London was {{the scene}} of a 'spotted' or {{relapsing}} fever, which hit its victims unexpectedly and left them conscious but physically helpless. What disease Donne suffered from is not known. Writers have suggested typhus as a likely culprit, but Donne's writings on the subject reference multiple diseases. Clara Lander, writing in , suggests that the typhus may have exacerbated the <b>enteritis</b> Donne had suffered from since childhood. Donne was of the opinion â€“ as were many others of the age â€“ that illness reflected a state of internal sinfulness, and constituted a visit from God. Despite being ordered to rest, he insisted that a pen and paper be given to him, and he wrote down his impressions of the disease. After his recovery, in December, these became Devotions upon Emergent Occasions, one of his few published prose works, and also one of only seven printed works of which he acknowledged authorship. Written with [...] "near super-human speed and concentration", the work was registered with the Stationers' Company by 9 January 1624. It was published that year, and again in 1634 and 1638. The full, albeit rarely used, title is Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, and severall steps in my Sicknes.|$|E

2500|$|While {{access to}} the {{intestine}} is not possible via this route, it can occur via ingestion; in a report of 93 <b>enteritis</b> cases in northern Queensland, Australia which were possibly caused by A. canium infection, all those interviewed described behaviour consistent with A. caninum exposure and a colonoscopy of one patient gave positive identification of an adult A. caninum worm. [...] Since then work has shown A. caninum can easily go unnoticed or fail to be preserved in specimens making the true incidence of infection in humans likely {{to be higher than}} is officially recorded.|$|E
2500|$|Rotavirus <b>enteritis</b> is {{the most}} common cause of severe {{diarrhoea}} among infants and young children. It is caused by Rotavirus, a genus of double-stranded RNA virus in the family Reoviridae. By the age of five, nearly every child in the world has been infected with rotavirus at least once. However, with each infection, immunity develops, and subsequent infections are less severe; adults are rarely affected. [...] There are five species of this virus, referred to as A, B, C, D, and E. Rotavirus A, the most common, causes more than 90% of infections in humans.|$|E

To date, six human azaspiracid poisoning (AZP) events have been confirmed, but it is quite possible, due to the similarity of symptoms observed for people with DSP or other types of food poisoning (e.g., bacterial <b>enteritis),</b> that many more undocumented events have occurred. [...] Coincidently, each of the confirmed AZP events have been traced to contaminated Irish shellfish (M. edulis).|$|E
