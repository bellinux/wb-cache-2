5|$|The milk <b>fat</b> <b>globule</b> is {{surrounded}} by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting mammary epithelial cell (lactocyte). This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM. While MFGM only makes up an estimated 2% to 6% of the total milk <b>fat</b> <b>globule,</b> it is an especially rich phospholipid source, accounting for the majority of total milk phospholipids. In contrast, the inner core of the milk <b>fat</b> <b>globule</b> is composed predominantly of triacylglycerols.|$|E
5|$|For example, infant {{formulas}} traditionally were {{lacking the}} MFGM because this fraction is lost during regular dairy processing. However, more {{recent advances in}} technology have facilitated the separation of MFGM from the <b>fat</b> <b>globule,</b> allowing bovine MFGM to be added in concentrated form. The MFGM fraction is now commercially available and {{can be added to}} infant formula or other nutritional products.|$|E
5|$|The {{process takes}} place in {{multiple}} stages. First, fat synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in droplets between {{the inner and outer}} phospholipid monolayers of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually pinch off. This leads to the surrounding of the droplet in a phospholipid monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the droplet and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat droplet in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The milk <b>fat</b> <b>globule</b> thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 μm in average diameter, is surrounded by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{bioavailability}} {{of dietary}} lipids is of primary importance in human nutrition and health, the mechanisms involved in lipid digestion {{are not fully}} understood and are of growing interest. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of the size of milk <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> and of the composition of their interface on the activity of the human pancreatic lipase (PL). Native milk <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> of various sizes covered by their biological membrane (MFGM) and homogenized <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> of various sizes covered by milk proteins were prepared from whole milk and underwent lipolysis by the human PL with colipase and bile salts. A lag phase preceding the hydrolysis of milk TAG occurred with all native milk <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> samples but not with homogenized milk samples. The kinetic parameters of human PL were determined by measuring the enzyme activity either after the lag phase for native milk <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> samples or immediately after the addition of the enzyme for homogenized milk samples. The catalytic efficiency of human PL is 4. 6 -fold higher on small (1. 8 mm) than large (6. 7 mm) native milk <b>fat</b> <b>globules,</b> related to a 3. 6 -fold larger available surface. Despite the 25 -fold larger available surface, milk TAG from homogenized milk are only 2 -fold better hydrolyzed compared to native milk <b>fat</b> <b>globules,</b> as a possible result of a less favourable interface covered by milk proteins. The potential mechanisms involved in native vs. homogenized milk <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> digestion by the human PL are discussed. Our study highlights the crucial role of the MFGM in the efficient digestion of milk <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> and brings new insight for the design of dairy products and infant formulas...|$|R
50|$|Changing {{whole milk}} to butter {{is a process}} of {{transforming}} a fat-in-water emulsion (milk) to a water-in-fat emulsion (butter). Whole milk is a dilute emullsion of tiny <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> surrounded by lipoprotein membranes that keep the <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> separate from one another.|$|R
25|$|Initially {{milk fat}} is {{secreted}} {{in the form}} of a <b>fat</b> <b>globule</b> surrounded by a membrane. Each <b>fat</b> <b>globule</b> is composed almost entirely of triacylglycerols and is surrounded by a membrane consisting of complex lipids such as phospholipids, along with proteins. These act as emulsifiers which keep the individual globules from coalescing and protect the contents of these globules from various enzymes in the fluid portion of the milk. Although 97–98% of lipids are triacylglycrols, small amounts of di- and monoacylglycerols, free cholesterol and cholesterol esters, free fatty acids, and phospholipids are also present. Unlike protein and carbohydrates, fat composition in milk varies widely in the composition due to genetic, lactational, and nutritional factor difference between different species.|$|E
25|$|Freezing of {{milk can}} cause <b>fat</b> <b>globule</b> {{aggregation}} upon thawing, resulting in milky layers and butterfat lumps. These can be dispersed again by warming and stirring the milk. It {{can change the}} taste by destruction of milk-fat globule membranes, releasing oxidized flavors.|$|E
25|$|An {{embolism}} is the lodging of an embolus, a blockage-causing {{piece of}} material, inside a blood vessel. The embolus {{may be a}} blood clot (thrombus), a <b>fat</b> <b>globule</b> (fat embolism), a bubble of air or other gas (gas embolism), or foreign material. An embolism can cause partial or total blockage of blood flow in the affected vessel. Such a blockage (a vascular occlusion) may affect {{a part of the}} body distant from where the embolus originated. An embolism in which the embolus is a piece of thrombus is called a thromboembolism. Thrombosis, the process of thrombus formation, often leads to thromboembolism.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} pointed out that even under similar {{environmental}} conditions, fatty acid composition in milk from dairy cattle of different breeds may be not homogeneous (Beaulieu and Palmquist, 2000; Palmquist et al., 1993; Bitman et al., 1995).

50|$|The {{agitation}} of the cream, {{caused by}} the mechanical motion of the device, disrupts the milk fat. The membranes that surround the fats are broken down, subsequently forming clumps known as butter grains. These butter grains, {{during the process of}} churning, fuse with each other and form larger <b>fat</b> <b>globules.</b> Air bubbles are introduced into these <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> via the continued mechanical action of the churn. The butter grains become more dense as <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> attach to them while the air is forced out of the mixture. This process creates a liquid known as buttermilk. With constant churning, the <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> eventually form solid butter and separate from the buttermilk. The buttermilk is then drained off and the butter is squeezed to eliminate excess liquid and to form it into a solid mass.|$|R
25|$|Milk {{often is}} homogenized, a {{treatment}} that prevents a cream layer from separating {{out of the}} milk. The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation. A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than {{a smaller number of}} larger ones, and the original <b>fat</b> <b>globule</b> membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces. Nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new membrane structure. The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization.|$|E

2500|$|Melted butter {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the preparation of sauces, most obviously in French cuisine. Beurre noisette (hazelnut butter) and Beurre noir (black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of vinegar or lemon juice. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are emulsions of egg yolk and melted butter; they are in essence mayonnaises made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful emulsifiers in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the <b>fat</b> <b>globule</b> membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own. Beurre blanc (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. Beurre monté (prepared butter) is melted but still emulsified butter; it lends its name to the practice of [...] "mounting" [...] a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.|$|E

40|$|Breast milk <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> are {{the natural}} {{colloidal}} assemblies secreted by lactating mothers to provide dietary energy and bioactive molecules to infants. Although {{they are important}} in newborn infant nutrition, growth and health, their physical properties remain poorly known. In this study, the crystallization and melting properties of breast milk triacylglycerols (TAG; 98 % of milk lipids) were investigated in <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> and in anhydrous state. The thermal and structural properties of breast milk TAG were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction, respectively. Breast milk <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> have a mean diameter of 4 to 5 mu m. They contain 48 - 57 % saturated fatty acids with 27 - 29 % of C 16 : 0. Storage of breast milk at 4 degrees C in the refrigerator leads to the crystallization of high-melting point TAG within <b>fat</b> <b>globules</b> in beta 2 L (41. 7 angstrom) lamellar structures. The final melting point of these TAG crystals, T-offset = 41. 1 +/- 1. 6 degrees C, is above inbody temperature of infants.
