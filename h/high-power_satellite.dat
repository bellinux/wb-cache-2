USSB was awarded five frequencies by the FCC, at the coveted 101 degree west satellite location. Hughes Communications, Inc. was also awarded 27 frequencies at the same 101-degree location. After many years, the technology was developed to enable the building of very <b>high-power</b> <b>satellites,</b> and digital compression (MPEG-2) standards were developed that allowed multiple digital television channels to be sent through each satellite frequency.|$|R
40|$|Thanks to {{both the}} rapid {{deployment}} of the Internet and advances in satellite technology, the market for broadband satellite services is poised for substantial growth in the coming decade. Current communications satellite systems have generally been designed to provide either voice or data transaction (low data rate) services through small terminals, or trunking (high data rate, or broadband) services through large terminals. However, technological advances are enabling new systems that combine broadband data rates with small terminals, thereby providing more affordable "last-mile" network access to home and small business users worldwide.

40|$|Technological {{advances}} are enabling new {{satellite communications}} systems that combine broadband data rates with small terminals. These novel systems are being {{designed to provide}} affordable "last-mile" network access to home and small business users worldwide. In particular, two types of advanced broadband satellite systems are under development: <b>high-power</b> <b>satellites</b> deployed at traditional geostationary (GEO) orbits, and large constellations of satellites deployed at much lower (LEO) orbits. In this report, we explore research problems that have arisen from the attempt to use GEO satellites to provide Internet access. In particular, performance of the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is degraded by the high latency and high degree of bandwidth asymmetry present in such systems, and the degradation {{is compounded by the}} packet-level congestion found in today's Internet. We first study whether TCP's congestion avoidance algorithm can be adjusted to provide better fa [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{design for}} a low-user-cost, 9000 channel {{capacity}} second generation mobile satellite system (Msat- 2) for continental U. S., Alaska and Canada using two geostationary satellites at 90 and 130 deg west longitude, is presented. The increased capacity over the first generation system is obtained by use of a 20 m deployable antenna with an offset-fed antenna configuration, a <b>high-power</b> <b>satellite</b> bus, and by relaxing the north-south stationkeeping requirement to + or - 2 deg and the eclipse capability to 50 percent. Efficient frequency utilization is achieved for uplink and downlink spectra by a 7 -frequency reuse scheme with 285 5 -kHz channels per subband, and subband reuse of up to four times. Problems of interbeam interference and multipath fading contributed to {{the choice of a}} nonoverlapping feed for the Msat- 2, and a proper modulation scheme using Gaussian baseband filtered minimum-shift-keying with differential detection...|$|E

40|$|A new E -plane {{filtering}} structure {{suitable for}} very <b>high-power</b> telecom <b>satellite</b> applications is presented. The conceived configuration exploits the design flexibility provided by cascading highly integrated step/stub resonators with pseudoelliptic frequency responses. Several design examples of filters and diplexers in Ku-, K-, and Q-band are reported {{and supported by}} experimental tests campaigns. The components have been designed with a full-wave 2 -D spectral element method. Prototypes have been realized in aluminum clam-shell technology. Excellent agreement between the models and the experimental results has been achieved. An alternative manufacturing of the proposed architecture based on the selective laser melting technology is also reported.

5000|$|Hughes {{attempted}} {{to create a}} joint venture with NBC, News Corp., and Cablevision in 1990, to launch the first high-power digital television service called Sky Cable. Failing to do so, the company instead created DirecTV as a separate division, and secured an agreement with USSB to build and launch the first <b>high-power</b> direct-broadcast <b>satellite</b> system. DirecTV's name is a portmanteau of [...] "direct" [...] and [...] "TV" [...] (as in direct broadcast satellite television). Hughes/DirecTV then turned to Thomson Consumer Electronics (under the RCA, GE, and ProScan brands) to develop the digital satellite system for the service that would be capable of receiving 175 channels on a small 18-inch dish. These dishes utilized a new generation of smaller, lighter receiver dishes based on military technology introduced by the Global Broadcast System, which predated DirecTV's viability by almost ten years. Hughes was awarded the contract to build and launch the new high-powered satellites, and USSB and DirecTV agreed that the new satellites would carry the two separate programming services: USSB and DirecTV.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOptical Solar Reflectors (OSR) are {{efficient}} thermal emitter glass tiles with {{a typical}} size of 40 x 40 mm. They cover spacecraft radiator panels to reduce absorption of solar radiation and to dissipate internally generated heat into space. On modern <b>high-power</b> telecom <b>satellites</b> total radiator areas reach sizes {{of more than}} 20 m². State-of-the-art processes to apply such OSR tiles are labour intensive and involve application of two-component adhesives, manual placing of tiles and long duration temperature controlled adhesive curing cycles. This paper presents the qualification campaign of a sophisticated OSR application method using electrically conductive pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) and a semi-automated OSR pick-and-place facility. Compared to standard OSR application using electrically conductive filled silicone resins, the new process is resulting in radiator surfaces with up to 27 % lower mass. After manual application of the PSA the panel {{is placed in the}} 3 -axis controlled gantry system, where a precise manipulator takes each tile and places it on the CAD pre-defined position on the panel. When the panel is covered with OSR an automated rolling process applies the required pressure to activate tape adhesion. The application process in the pick-and-place system guarantees high degree of reproducibility and increased precision at decreased radiator through-put durations. For qualification, samples prepared with the automated process were subjected to a thorough space environmental test campaign. This campaign involved vacuum thermal-cycling and exposures to electrons, protons and UV-radiation simulating a 15 year GEO mission, followed by tile pull-off testing. Since successful completion of the qualification campaign a number of spacecraft radiators have been equipped with single sizes up to 2, 1 x 2, 2 meters including radiators of the SmallGEO, Exomars and EDRS-C programs...|$|R
40|$|Two-phase liquid-gas flow has a {{wide variety}} of {{applications}} in space, including active thermal control systems, <b>high-power</b> communications <b>satellites,</b> heat pumps and space nuclear reactors. Two-phase systems have many potential advantages over current single-phase systems due to reductions in system size, weight and power consumption. The mechanisms of pressure drop, heat transfer coefficients, void fractions, and flow regimes must be well understood under microgravity conditions in order to design reliable two-phase systems. The main objective of this present research is to develop a new mathematical model that can accurately predict the annular two-phase friction pressure drop to optimize the design of two-phase systems. The two-phase flow tests were conducted aboard the NASA KC- 135 aircraft by the Interphase Transport Phenomena (ITP) group from Texas A&M University. The two-phase flow pressure drops were measured across a single transparent test section 12. 7 mm ID and 1. 63 m long in annular regimes under microgravity conditions during two flight campaigns. Different from previous work, {{this was the first time}} both the void fraction and the film thickness were measured under microgravity conditions. The empirical correlations for the interfacial friction factor and void fraction were developed from 57 experimental data using a linear least squares regression technique. The annular two-phase friction pressure drop can be predicted by the new mathematical model requiring only knowledge of the length and diameter of the tube, liquid and vapor mass flow rates, and properties of the working fluid. In addition, the new mathematical model was validated using Foster-Miller & ITP data collected over twelve flights aboard the KC- 135 with working fluid R- 12 (77 data points), Sundstrand data collected aboard the KC- 135 with working fluid R- 114 (43 data points) and Zhao and Rezkallah data aboard the KC- 135 with working fluid water and air (43 data points). Compared with the LockhartMartinelli model, Wheeler model, Chen model and homogeneous model, the new mathematical model is the optimal model for predicting the two-phase friction pressure drop in annular regimes. The majority of the data falls within +- 20 % of the proposed correlation and the average error is 12 %...|$|R
