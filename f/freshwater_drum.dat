In addition, many fish species have been either intentionally or accidentally introduced to Lake Superior: Atlantic salmon, brown trout, carp, chinook salmon, coho salmon, <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum,</b> pink salmon, rainbow smelt, rainbow trout, round goby, ruffe, sea lamprey and white perch.|$|E
25|$|First hand, the Detroit River {{provides}} {{a substantial amount}} of revenue for the local economies. A study in 1991 showed that $20.1 million came from sales related to waterfowl hunting along the Detroit River. During the same year, bird watching, photography, and other non-consumptive uses of waterfowl contributed an additional $192.8 million to Michigan’s economy. Local economies benefit through boating registrations and fishing licenses. It is estimated that walleye fishing alone brings in $1 million to the economy of communities along the lower Detroit River each spring. Other fish caught by recreational fisherman include white bass, bluegill, crappie, <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum,</b> smallmouth bass, northern pike and muskie. There are over 800,000 recreation boats in the state of Michigan, {{and more than half of}} those are regularly used on or near the Detroit River. A percentage of the tourist revenue depends on the Detroit River, which is the most noticeable environmental feature in Detroit. Popular river destinations in the city of Detroit include the Detroit International Riverfront and Belle Isle Park — both of which host a number of events throughout the year. Several restaurants on the river have dock facilities for boaters. Tour boats and dinner cruises travel through the sights of Detroit and the undeveloped islands downriver. Cruise ships support tourism on the Great Lakes and dock at the Port Detroit passenger terminal downtown. The iconic Renaissance Center is located on the banks of the Detroit River.|$|E

50|$|The Sand Ridge Site {{lies about}} 0.3 mi {{away from the}} Clough Creek Site. Located along a {{prominent}} ridgeline {{to the west of}} the old Union Bridge along the road between Cincinnati and Batavia, it has long been known as a significant archaeological site. As early as the 1880s, many individuals frequently visited the ridge to collect artifacts from the surface, such as bones, pottery, and pieces of flint. The residents appear to have inhabited the site only seasonally, with autumn and winter being the most likely times of occupation. They appear to have been heavily dependent on fish for their food, as many fish bones have been discovered at Sand Ridge; among the most common types of fish were suckers, channel catfish, and <b>freshwater</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|R

Females continue to outgrow the male throughout their lives reaching a length of 12 to 30 in. Usually the <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> weighs 2 - 10 lb, but they can reach well over 36 lb. <b>Freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> are long-lived and have attained maximum ages of 72 years old in Red Lakes, Minnesota and 32 years old in the Cahaba River, Alabama. [...] Using sectioned otoliths from archaeological sites near Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> have attained the age 74 years. Though they can reach a very old age, the average age of a <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> is between 6 and 13 years.|$|E
5000|$|Predators on drum include {{humans and}} other fish. During its first year, the <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> {{serves as a}} forage fish for many species of predatory fish. These include smallmouth bass, walleye, and many other piscivores. After its first year, the primary predators on <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> are humans. The drum is an {{important}} commercial crop on the Mississippi River, but in other areas it constitutes {{only a small portion}} of the commercial catch. Consistent with other Sciaenids, <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> are strongly nocturnal with the bulk of most catches being derived from night angling/sampling. [...] Commercial fisheries are present for this species, although market price tends to be quite low.

40|$|Plasma {{corticosteroid}} {{concentrations were}} measured in 14 {{species of fish}} immediately after they were electrofished from reservoirs on the Alabama River and after they had been transported for 2 h. There was no corticosteroid response in spotted gars Lepisosteus oculatus. Bowfins Amia calva, longnose gars Lepisosteus osseus, and <b>freshwater</b> <b>drums</b> Aplodinotus grunniens had only small corticosteroid increases (14 - 39 ng/mL) during transportation. Corticosteroids increased by intermediate amounts (59 - 184 ng/mL) during transportation in blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus, paddlefish Polyodon spathula, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, river carpsuckers Carpiodes carpio, white bass Morone chrysops, striped bass Morone saxatilis, and crappies Pomoxis sp. The greatest increases were 223 ng/mL in gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and 286 ng/mL in common carp Cyprinus carpio. Spotted and longnose gars, largemouth bass, and common carp also were held in tanks for about 2 months at 21 ░C and then stressed by confinement in a dip net for 30 min. The confinement caused significant increases (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) of plasma corticosteroid concentration in all four species. Dip-net confinement {{appears to be a}} useful method for comparing corticosteroid responses among species of warmwater fish...|$|R
40|$|The Missouri River {{has been}} {{subjected}} to human alteration for over 150 years and the flow regime is one physical attribute that has drastically changed as a result of alteration. Likewise, using flow characteristics has been identified as a driving variable to describe fish community structure in lotic systems. Therefore, my goal was to assess fish community structure in the Missouri River system in relation to flow. I first used a time series approach to examine daily mean flow data from 10 gauging stations on the Missouri River, and tested for differences associated with human alteration. Daily mean flow over the entire year was significantly higher for the post-alteration period (1966 [...] 1996) compared to the pre-alteration period (1925 [...] 1948) reflecting long-term differences in precipitation. Daily mean flows over a spring fish spawning period (1 April [...] 30 June) were significantly lower in reaches influenced by impoundments suggesting that human alterations have resulted in changes to the natural spring flow regime;I then used a multivariate approach to group post-alteration daily mean flow data from 15 gauge stations along the Missouri and lower Yellowstone Rivers. I identified six hydrologically distinct units composed of gauge stations exhibiting similar flow characteristics based largely on flow variability and predictability. I then explored fish community structure, functional composition, and life-history attributes in relation to these six flow regimes where altered areas are thought to be dominated by generalist type species. My results suggest this to be true as the units most influenced by the reservoirs (i. e., most altered) did have a higher percentage of generalist species;The final focus {{of this study was to}} evaluate growth rates over a latitudinal gradient for five fish species (channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus; emerald shiners Notropis atherinoides; <b>freshwater</b> <b>drums</b> Aplodinotus grunniens; river carpsuckers Carpiodes carpio; saugers Stizostedion canadense). Species specific growth rates were different (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) for each section of river analyzed. Most species displayed some regional trends in growth rate but river-wide patterns were largely inconclusive. However, emerald shiners did exhibit higher growth grates with an increase in latitude. Based on these results, improved flow management in the heavily altered areas of the Missouri River may facilitate rehabilitation of the native fish community...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>{{freshwater}}</b> <b>drum,</b> Aplodinotus grunniens, is a fish {{endemic to}} North and Central America. It {{is the only}} species in the genus Aplodinotus. The <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> {{is a member of}} the family Sciaenidae, and is the only North American member of the group that inhabits freshwater for its entire life. Its generic name, Aplodinotus, comes from Greek meaning [...] "single back", and the specific epithet, grunniens, comes from a Latin word meaning [...] "grunting". It is given to it because of the grunting noise that mature males make. This noise comes from a special set of muscles within the body cavity that vibrate against the swim bladder. The purpose of the grunting is unknown, but due to it being present in only mature males, it is assumed to be linked to spawning.|$|E

50|$|During the summer, <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> {{move into}} warm, shallow {{water that is}} less than 33 ft deep. The <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> then spawn during a six to seven-week period from June through July when the water reaches a {{temperature}} of about 65 F. During the spawn, females release their eggs into the water column and males release their sperm. Fertilization is random. Males generally reach sexual maturity at four years, whereas females reach maturity at five or six years. Females from six to nine years old have a clutch size of 34,000 to 66,500 eggs and they spawn in open water giving no parental care to their larvae. The eggs then float {{to the top of}} the water column and hatch between two and four days. Due to the broadcasting of eggs in open water and lack of parental care, many eggs and larvae fall victim to predation upon hatching, the pro-larvae average 3.2 mm long. The post larval stage begins about 45 hours after hatching and a length of 4.4 mm is attained.|$|E
50|$|Sauger feed on {{a variety}} of {{invertebrates}} and small fishes depending on the time of year and size of the sauger. Channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus and <b>freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> Pylodictus olivaris are a midsize (300-379 mm) and large (>379 mm) sauger's main food source during spring. The diet of a small sauger (200-299 mm) is slightly different than a larger sauger's. Smaller saugers generally feed on benthic invertebrates, mayfly larvae, and catfish during spring and summer. Mid-size and large saugers feed mainly on fish from spring to autumn, but their diets alter during summer. Mid-size and large saugers feed predominantly on mayfly larvae but only during summer months. <b>Freshwater</b> <b>drum</b> Aplodinotus grunniens and gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum are dominant food sources for saugers of all sizes during autumn. Fish accounted for over 99% of a sauger's diet during autumn. Saugers also prey on shiners during spring and summer but they do not account for a significant part of their diet. Shiners are absent from a sauger's diet in autumn probably due to their availability.|$|E
