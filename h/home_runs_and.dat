5|$|The White Sox {{acquired}} Orlando Cabrera to play shortstop in 2008, forcing Uribe {{to compete}} with Alexei Ramírez, Danny Richar, and Pablo Ozuna for the position in spring training. Uribe won the second base job, but after an injury in May, Uribe lost his spot in the White Sox starting lineup to Ramírez. However, Uribe took over third base from Josh Fields (who had spent a week filling in for an injured Joe Crede) on August 1.

5|$|Before the 2014 season, the Phillies signed Mayberry to a {{guaranteed}} $1.5875 million contract. Mayberry entered the season {{a member of}} the Phillies bench who some writers thought was not worth his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was successful early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> <b>and</b> 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would have value in a potential trade, as the Phillies were not expected to make the playoffs, and thus might prefer to get a prospect for future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that the}} Phillies used him in an appropriate role, rather than trying to utilize him every day.|$|E
5|$|David Price {{recorded}} the first complete {{game in a}} tie-breaker game since Al Leiter in 1999. The game counted as a regular season game in baseball statistics. For example, Evan Longoria's third-inning home run broke Stan Musial's record for the most home runs in the last game of the season, setting the mark at seven. He went 3-for-4 with a double, a home run, and two RBI in the game overall. This left him 11-for-19 with seven <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> <b>and</b> ten RBIs in season finales from 2009–2013. Tampa Bay's win clinched the team's fourth post-season berth in franchise history. The Rays played the Cleveland Indians in the American League Wild Card Game and advanced to the American League Division Series (ALDS) with a 4-0 win. However, the Rays lost to the eventual World Series champions, the Boston Red Sox in the ALDS, 3 games to 1.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Kinsler hit 20 {{home runs}} (leading all AL second basemen) and was 23-for-25 in stolen base {{attempts}} (a 92% success rate). He {{was one of}} only six batters in the AL to have at least 20 <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> <b>and</b> 20 stolen bases, along with Alex Rodriguez, Gary Sheffield, Grady Sizemore, B.J. Upton, and Curtis Granderson. He also became the sixth player in franchise history to reach the 20–20 plateau, joining Alfonso Soriano (2005), Iván Rodríguez (1999), Rafael Palmeiro (1993), Bobby Bonds (1978), and Toby Harrah (1975 and 1977). He did it despite his stress fracture, which kept him under 500 at bats. His 23 stolen bases and 96 runs led the Rangers.|$|E

5|$|Kemp {{wound up}} hitting 39 {{home runs in}} 2011 with 126 RBIs, leading the league in both categories, the first Dodger to do so since Dolph Camilli in the 1941 season. He also {{led the league in}} runs scored (115), total bases (353), OPS+ (171), and WAR (10.0). He {{finished}} second in slugging percentage (.586), OPS (.986), extra base hits (76), and stolen bases (40, tied), and third in batting average (.324) and outfield assists (11). Kemp also extended his games played streak to 364 games, as he played in every game of the season. He was the first player to finish in the top two in both <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> <b>and</b> steals since Hank Aaron in the 1963 season.|$|E
5|$|Musial {{finished}} the 1948 season leading {{the major leagues}} in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702). Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became {{the first player to}} win three NL MVP awards. If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, <b>home</b> <b>runs,</b> <b>and</b> runs batted in.|$|E
5|$|On September 8 Braun, the Brewers' career {{home run}} leader, hit his 300th career home run. With {{the home run}} he became the 6th {{baseball}} player {{to have at least}} 300 <b>home</b> <b>runs</b> <b>and</b> 180 stolen bases in his first 11 big league seasons, joining Willie Mays (368 HRs, 240 SB), Reggie Jackson (313 HRs, 188 SB), Barry Bonds (334 HRs, 380 SB), Sammy Sosa (336 HRs, 224 SB), and Alex Rodriguez (381 HRs, 205 SB).
