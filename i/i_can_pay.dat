500|$|In early 1850, Dickinson {{wrote that}} [...] "Amherst is alive with fun this winter ... Oh, {{a very great}} town this is!" [...] Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died {{suddenly}} of [...] "brain congestion" [...] at age 25. Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:some {{of my friends are}} gone, and some of my friends are sleeping– sleeping the churchyard sleep– the hour of evening is sad– it was once my study hour– my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school alone, make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> the departed Humphrey.|$|E
2500|$|By the {{following}} morning, both men reasoned {{that they would}} have to leave NBC, and O'Brien opened that night's show with [...] "We’ve got a great show for you tonight—I have no idea when it will air, but it's gonna be a great show." [...] Polone viewed the move, as a whole, a reactionary one by Zucker, concluding that he was acting in self-preservation, since NBCUniversal owner General Electric (GE) was in the process of negotiating the sale of a controlling interest in the company to cable operator Comcast. When a story ran that night on The New York Times website that Fox had an [...] "overt interest" [...] in O'Brien and was not going along with the plan, Zucker reasoned that Polone was to blame. The situation became heated when Zucker placed a call to O'Brien's agent, Rick Rosen, inquiring on the story and demanding an immediate answer from the O'Brien camp regarding the changes. Gaspin spoke on the situation at a previously scheduled press conference that Sunday, noting that [...] "I obviously couldn’t satisfy either with 100 percent of what they wanted. That’s why I came up with this compromise." [...] Zucker, upon hearing that O'Brien still did not take the proposal well, threatened Rosen: [...] "I'm going to tell you right now that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> him or play him. I can ice you guys." [...] On Monday night's show, O'Brien continued jokes on the subject; responding to thunderous applause, he joked, [...] "You keep that up, and this monologue won’t start until 12:05." ...|$|E

If I keep one or two <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> for them. Of course I owe a lot of money, but other people owe me money too. I'm all right, and you needn't frighten yourself.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, dear friend, I {{thought you}} were going to leave me!" [...] she cried. [...] "How {{agitated}} I am--feel how my heart beats. Never mind, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> now <b>pay</b> that wretch out. Is not revenge sweet, sweet, sweet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> give Manylodes a cheque for the whole, dated {{this day}} week. You'll {{be back in}} town before that. We must allow him £5 for the accommodation. <b>I</b> suppose you <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> the money in at my banker's by that day?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It sounds simple, {{but there}} are difficulties. Now, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> these bills, {{but not in the}} time mentioned. Have you power to extend it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Paul, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> it off. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>pay</b> off {{the hopes}} and {{aspirations}} I have blighted. I must become a schoolmaster, or a barrister, or something of that sort, and never repay them for their self-sacrifice and devotion in making me whatever I shall become. They may get back their money, but they will have lost their cherished Apostle for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The war affects Dorfield, too, and we've {{only two}} papers," [...] said the man. [...] "But your {{business}} isn't my business, in any event. <b>I</b> suppose you <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> in advance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Muddle it away, paying {{my bills}} with it,--according to the very, very old story. The fact is, I {{live in that}} detestable no-man's land, between respectability and insolvency, which has none of the {{pleasure}} of either. I am fair game for every creditor, as I am supposed to pay my way,--and yet <b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> my way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You seem to {{have been}} brought into it," [...] her brother {{observed}} grimly, [...] "and I'm not sure that I am satisfied. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> my own debts." ...|$|E
6000|$|Cartwright smiled. [...] "You {{are a good}} sort and I'm {{going to}} borrow now because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> back. I want you to {{telegraph}} your bank to meet my check." ...|$|E
60|$|SHIRLEY [eagerly] Yes, yes: that's true. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> you back: it's only a loan. [Shivering] Oh Lord! oh Lord! [He {{turns to}} the table and attacks the meal ravenously].|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Richard Shelton, ye {{are well}} found," [...] he said. [...] "I owe {{you one thing}} that I value little, my life; and one that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>pay</b> you for, this victory.--Catesby, if I had ten such captains as Sir Richard, I would march forthright on London.--But now, sir, claim your reward." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Lambert would starve if I did {{not provide}} for him," [...] {{he said with a}} sneer. [...] "Adam, his brother, could do naught for him: he is poor as a church-mouse, poorer even than I--but nathless," [...] he added with a violent oath, [...] "it strikes {{everyone}} as madness that I should keep a secretary when <b>I</b> scarce <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> the wages of a serving maid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure she}} is even ower gude," [...] said Jeanie, [...] "and it glads me muckle that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> back Dumbiedikes his siller, without {{distressing}} my father, honest man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{will take}} it," [...] Walter said, decidedly. [...] "It {{is only to}} be loaned, and until <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> it back you shall have half the profits of the business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could pay}} a little more on the principal," [...] she explained, [...] "but I guess it'll be better to use it for my stock. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pay</b> better {{dividends}} next year.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] says he, grimly. [...] "I {{could not}} ask better. There {{is a long}} score to pay, and now - at last - <b>I</b> <b>can</b> begin to <b>pay</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every one is {{very kind}} to me, but every one seems {{to go to sleep}} when autumn comes; so I felt alone and sad, and {{expected}} to die in the snow. But if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find a cosey place to live in till spring I shall be very glad, and will do anything <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to <b>pay</b> for it," [...] answered Bud, much comforted by her good dinner and a kind word.|$|R

6000|$|... "The wine may {{be worth}} it," [...] Mountjoy {{answered}} quietly; [...] "but {{it is more than}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> afford to <b>pay.</b> No, ma'am; I will leave you to find some lover of good claret with a longer purse than mine." ...|$|R

6000|$|Then {{she also}} {{sat down and}} wrote to him, on that her last night beneath his father's roof--wrote to him when she had nearly {{prepared}} herself for her bed; and honestly, out of her full heart, thanked him for his love.

5000|$|When Israel {{withdrew from}} {{southern}} Lebanon in 2000, Lahad {{was determined to}} carry on against Hezbollah. He pleaded for support from Israel, [...] "I need three things: 1 - I need Israel not to stop the money, keep the flow of money coming so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep <b>paying</b> my soldiers; 2- I need logistical support so the SLA will have adequate ammunition; 3- I need the border to remain open because I don't have sophisticated hospitals in the South, and in this instance all my wounded should be transported to northern Israel to be treated. When I'll have those three things, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hold for 200 years. That's all I need." ...|$|R
