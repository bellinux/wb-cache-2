25|$|Art {{therapy and}} other creative, {{humanistic}} <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> are becoming popular methods {{for working with}} life-threatened patient and for working with the family members of patients who die—particularly bereaved children. Art therapy stimulates the conscious and unconscious expression of the mourning process in adult and child patients. Children are at greater psychological risk because their grief is less overt and can occur {{months or even years}} after the death. Group therapy is used to provide social sanction for the expression of that grief and to promote adaptive mourning responses.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{should be}} {{considered}} in the development of <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies.</b> These include, but are not limited to: developmental level of the child, comorbid disabilities, environmental changes, motivating factors, and coaching strategies. It is also recommended that strategies should take a proactive approach in managing behaviour or skill deficits (when possible), rather than adopt a reactive approach. For example, an awareness of where a student may have difficulty throughout {{the course of the day}} can aid the teacher in planning to avoid these situations or in planning to accommodate the needs of the student.|$|E
25|$|Political officials, policymakers, administrators, {{and service}} {{providers}} were increasingly willing {{to recognize the}} relevance of a substantial body of scientific research that suggested effective <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> that could {{change the course of}} the epidemic. Also, major policy recommendations with regard to behavioral interventions were preceded by small pilot projects that showed feasibility or efficacy in those populations at highest risk. Once the evidence base was documented, both the policymakers and politicians publicly showed their support for HIV prevention and care, as well as passing legislation to enforce and broadly disseminate health practices (e.g., routine HIV testing and access to care).|$|E

25|$|As {{previously}} stated function {{refers to}} the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> {{that are likely to}} be effective.|$|E
25|$|Statistics on {{incidence}} of domestic violence, {{published in the}} late 1970s, helped raise {{public awareness of the}} problem and increase activism. A study published in 1976 by the Police Foundation found that the police had intervened at least once in the previous two years in 85 percent of spouse homicides. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, feminists and battered women's advocacy groups were calling on police to take domestic violence more seriously and change <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies.</b> In some instances, these groups took legal action against police departments, including in Oakland, California and New York City, to get them to make arrests in domestic violence cases. They claimed that police assigned low priority to domestic disturbance calls.|$|E
25|$|In Latin America, stigma and {{discrimination}} against HIV/AIDS serve as barriers to effective responses and {{are linked to}} social inequalities associated with gender, living status, and sexuality. One study found that while 90% of Nicaraguan adolescents would accept and care for a family member with HIV/AIDS, only 69% would tell anyone else if they got diagnosed as HIV-infected and only 46% would share food with someone who was infected. Nine years following the detection of the first HIV case in Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan government instituted Law 238 {{to protect the rights}} of those infected with HIV/AIDS in regards to confidentiality, access to healthcare, and nondiscrimination, setting the precedent for future <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> focused on decreasing AIDs stigma amongst various professionals, including health care workers.|$|E

25|$|The {{challenge}} {{of managing the}} {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) epidemic (November 2002 to June 2003) is often credited with further motivating the government to take aggressive policy action on HIV-related issues. SARS showed not only how infectious diseases could threaten economic and social stability but also the effect of China's policies on international health problems. Policymakers announced a change of focus from purely economic goals to increasing the focus on health and social wellbeing and, as a result, increased support for public health agencies. In controlling SARS, contact between the government and international agencies such as WHO, UN, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was essential and further stimulated stronger international collaboration for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. <b>Intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> necessary for SARS control have been translated into HIV/AIDS prevention – e.g., real-time electronic case reporting.|$|E

40|$|Australia is {{the only}} high-income country in which endemic {{trachoma}} persists. In response, the Australian Government has recently invested heavily towards the nationwide control of the disease. A novel simulation model was developed to reflect the trachoma epidemic in Australian Aboriginal communities. The model, which incorporates demographic, migration, mixing, and biological heterogeneities, {{was used to evaluate}} recent intervention measures against counterfactual past scenarios, and also to assess the potential impact of a series of hypothesized future intervention measures relative to the current national strategy and intensity. The model simulations indicate that, under the current <b>intervention</b> <b>strategy</b> and intensity, the likelihood of controlling trachoma to less than 5 % prevalence among 5 - 9 year-old children in hyperendemic communities by 2020 is 31 % (19 %- 43 %). By shifting intervention priorities such that large increases in the facial cleanliness of children are observed, this likelihood of controlling trachoma in hyperendemic communities is increased to 64 % (53 %- 76 %). The most effective <b>intervention</b> <b>strategy</b> incorporated large-scale antibiotic distribution programs whilst attaining ambitious yet feasible screening, treatment, facial cleanliness and housing construction targets. Accordingly, the estimated likelihood of controlling trachoma in these communities is increased to 86 % (76 %- 95 %). Maintaining the current <b>intervention</b> <b>strategy</b> and intensity is unlikely to be sufficient to control trachoma across Australia by 2020. However, by shifting the <b>intervention</b> <b>strategy</b> and increasing intensity, the likelihood of controlling trachoma nationwide can be significantly increased...|$|R

Additional risk factors were that most schools had no physical education curriculum and nutrition education is not emphasized.
