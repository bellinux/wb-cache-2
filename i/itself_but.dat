5|$|A {{cytotoxic}} agent can {{be linked}} to an anti-tumor antibody for drug targeting purposes. The word vedotin, for example, stands for monomethyl auristatin E which is toxic by <b>itself</b> <b>but</b> predominantly affects cancer cells if used in conjugates like glembatumumab vedotin.|$|E
5|$|Suburban localities in Royton include Haggate, Heyside, Holden Fold, Long Sight (or Longsight), Oozewood, Royley, Salmon Fields, Stott Field, Thornham, and Thorp. Thornham was {{formerly}} a township in <b>itself,</b> <b>but</b> was amalgamated into Royton in the late-19th century.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} of the castle, stripped down what remained of the fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on {{the north end of the}} tennis courts, while the north side of the outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow <b>itself,</b> <b>but</b> decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle armoury, and may have charged visitors for admittance.|$|E
5|$|Borscht, {{like any}} other soup in East Slavic cuisines, is seldom eaten by <b>itself,</b> <b>but</b> rather {{accompanied}} by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread. Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with pork cracklings, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides exists as well.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is metabolized in {{the liver}} by the {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzyme CYP2B6. It has several active metabolites: R,R-hydroxybupropion, S,S-hydroxybupropion, threo-hydrobupropion and erythro-hydrobupropion, which are further metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated through excretion into the urine. Both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act {{in the liver}} as potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes not only bupropion <b>itself</b> <b>but</b> also {{a variety of other}} drugs and biologically active substances. This mechanism creates the potential for a variety of drug interactions.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain and {{the entire}} {{subsequent}} government carries the blame not to have taken equivalent steps when they discovered Germany's preparations for war. A world power must always be prepared to successfully and energetically repulse any attack. Everyone is certain that England was not sufficiently prepared. Also the fleet did not appear capable of taking decisive action. It's possible that it was merely constraining <b>itself,</b> <b>but</b> that strategy is a mistake. It should have been put into action immediately. Neither in Africa nor in the Mediterranean has the English fleet rigorously counter-attacked.|$|E
5|$|Eros International {{released}} the DVD of Ra.One on 13 December 2011 across all regions in one-disc and two-disc packs {{complying with the}} NTSC format. The DVD of the film contained alternate endings. Initially, Khan had wanted to add alternate endings to the theatrical release <b>itself,</b> <b>but</b> later deemed it risky. The DVD version was made interactive as well. VCD and Blu-Ray versions of the film were also released.|$|E
5|$|Frampton {{resigned}} from the project through pressure of work, and Drury and Pomeroy carried out the project, each contributing four monumental statues, which were installed in late 1907. On the upstream piers are Pomeroy's Agriculture, Architecture, Engineering and Pottery, whilst on the downstream piers are Drury's Science, Fine Arts, Local Government and Education. Each statue weighs approximately two tons. Despite their size, the statues are little-noticed by users of the bridge as they are not visible from the bridge <b>itself,</b> <b>but</b> only from the river banks or from passing shipping.|$|E

5|$|I {{believe that}} my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina).

5|$|In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy <b>itself,</b> <b>but</b> were defeated. However, in 406 AD an {{unprecedented}} number of tribes {{took advantage of}} the freezing of the Rhine to cross en masse: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in the Sack of Moguntiacum and the Sack of Treviri, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the bombing of Banski dvori of 7 October, Croatian {{authorities}} instructed the ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in the Zagreb area if commanders considered it possible.

The declaration of the independence of Croatia came into force the next day.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that many transient phenomena might not {{be associated with the}} Moon <b>itself</b> <b>but</b> could be a result of unfavourable observing conditions or phenomena associated with the Earth. For instance, some reported transient phenomena are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol <b>itself,</b> <b>but</b> from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E

5|$|Roma {{was damaged}} again by two bombs in another raid on 2324 June. One hit the ship aft and to {{starboard}} {{of the rear}} main battery turret and obliterated several staterooms, which were promptly flooded from broken piping. The second landed atop the rear turret <b>itself,</b> <b>but</b> little damage was suffered due to the heavy armor in that location. This attack did not seriously damage Roma or cause any flooding, but she nevertheless sailed to Genoa for repairs. Roma reached the city on 1 July, and returned to La Spezia, on 13 August, once repairs were complete.|$|E
5|$|Scouting {{virtually}} started <b>itself,</b> <b>but</b> {{the trigger}} that set it going was the 1908 publication of Scouting for Boys written by Robert Baden-Powell.

Later, as a military officer, Baden-Powell was stationed in British India in the 1880s where he took an interest in military scouting and in 1884 he published Reconnaissance and Scouting.|$|E
