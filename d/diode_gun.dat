The purpose {{of the program is}} to develop long-life power microwave tubes for space communications. Four commercial-type cathodes are being evaluated in this investigation. They are the 'Tungstate', 'S' type, 'B' type, and 'M' type cathodes, all of which are capable of delivering 1 A/ sq cm or more of emission current at an operating temperature in the range of 1000 - 1100 C. The life test vehicles used in these studies are similar in construction to that of a high-power microwave tube and employ a high-convergence electron-gun structure; in contrast to earlier studies that used close-space <b>diodes.</b> These <b>guns</b> were designed for operation at 2 A/sq cm of cathode loading. The 'Tungstate' cathodes failed at 700 h or less and the 'S' cathode exhibited a lifetime of about 20, 000 h.

Computational modelling and experimental measurements of the field evolution inside co-axial 2 D Bragg structures as well as recent progress in the use of these structures to define the cavity of a high power Free Electron Maser will be presented. The 2 D Bragg cavity has been designed and constructed. Microwave measurements have been performed using a Vector Network Analyser. Good agreement between the measured transmission properties of the 2 D Bragg structures and PIC code (MAGIC) simulations was obtained. The high current accelerator to drive the FEM consists of a Marx bank power supply which resonantly charges a transmission line which sub-sequently discharges through a high pressure (16 Bar) nitrogen-filled spark gap providing a 200 ns duration flat-top high voltage pulse to an explosive emission electron (EEE) <b>gun</b> <b>diode</b> immersed in a 0. 6 T guide field provided by a 30 cm diameter 2. 25 m long solenoid.
