5|$|Eli Lilly {{experienced}} dramatic growth during Daniels' {{tenure at}} the company. Prozac sales made up 30–40% of Lilly's income during the mid-to-late 1990s, and Lilly doubled its assets to $12.8 billion and doubled its revenue to $10 billion during the same period. When Daniels later became Governor of Indiana, he drew <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> former Lilly colleagues to serve as advisers and agency managers.|$|E
5|$|In 1002 King Æthelred the Unready married Emma of Normandy, {{the sister}} of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Their son Edward the Confessor, who spent many years in exile in Normandy, succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led to the {{establishment}} of a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Childless and embroiled in conflict with the formidable Godwin, Earl of Wessex and his sons, Edward may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.|$|E
5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E

5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger {{would not be able to}} handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E
5|$|In 911, French Carolingian ruler Charles the Simple {{allowed a}} group of Vikings to settle in Normandy under their leader Rollo. Their {{settlement}} proved successful, and they quickly adapted to the indigenous culture, renouncing paganism, converting to Christianity, and intermarrying with the local population. Over time, the frontiers of the duchy expanded to the west. In 1002, King Æthelred II of England married Emma, the sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Their son Edward the Confessor spent many years in exile in Normandy, and succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led {{to the establishment of}} a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church.

5|$|Modern Guilt was {{the final}} release in Beck's {{contract}} with Geffen Records. Beck, then 38, had held the contract since his early 20s. Released from his label contract and going independent, Beck began working more <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own seven-year-old label, which went {{through a variety of}} names. His focus on smaller, more quixotic projects, Beck moonlighted as a producer, working with artists such as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Thurston Moore and Stephen Malkmus. Beck worked for five or six days a week at the small studio on his property in Malibu, and founded Record Club, a project whereby an entire classic album—by The Velvet Underground, Leonard Cohen, INXS, Yanni—would be covered by another singer in the span of a single day. Beck provided four songs for the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), each attributed to the title character's fictional band, Sex Bob-Omb. Beck also collaborated with Philip Glass, Jack White, Tobacco of Black Moth Super Rainbow, Jamie Lidell, Seu Jorge, Childish Gambino, and The Lonely Island.|$|E

5|$|Siddhpur, {{historically}} {{known as}} Sristhal. Sidhpur, under {{the rulers of}} Chaulukya dynasty, was a prominent town in the 10th century. In the tenth century (943 AD) Mularaja, {{the founder of the}} Chaulukya dynasty of Gujarat, started the erection of the Rudra Mahalay temple. In his youth, Muladev had slain his maternal uncle, usurped his throne, and murdered the whole of his mother's kindred; and in old age his crimes hung <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind. He made pilgrimages and courted the favour of Brahmins from far and near. To a band of them he gave Sristhal, and committing the kingdom to his son Chamundaraja, he retired there to end his days in their company (996 AD). But the Rudra Mahalay was still incomplete, nor was it finished till 1140 AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind {{during the}} seven months that he awaited trial. Two {{weeks after the}} arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him {{it was not a}} drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag. Although Hendrix {{was one of the biggest}} stars in North America at the time, and the world's highest-paid performer, only a couple of Toronto newspapers carried the story. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he bribed a member of the Associated Press with a case of liquor in an effort to prevent the story from going out on the news wire.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E

25|$|King Thomas reconquered Srebrenica {{again in}} February 1449, but {{hostilities}} continued until 1451, when the King made peace again with his insubordinate father-in-law. The dispute was even taken before the Diet of Hungary. To finance this incessant warfare {{as well as}} to sustain the royal court, King Thomas engaged in vigorous commerce and made business deals with Dalmatian traders. He relied <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> silver mining but profited most from his salt trade monopolies.|$|E

Pelet fought in the French invasion of Russia, including during Marshal Michel Ney's epic retreat at Krasnoi where he was wounded again. Promoted to general officer, he led troops in the 1813 and 1814 campaigns, including a brief stint as acting division commander. He led a regiment of the Old Guard at Waterloo.|$|E
25|$|The Chávez {{platform}} comprised {{three basic}} pledges. First, Chávez promised {{that he would}} begin his presidency by abolishing Venezuela's old puntofijismo political system of two-party patronage, and opening up political power to independent and third parties. Second, Chávez promised to end corruption. Third, Chávez promised to eradicate poverty in Venezuela. In working to gain the trust of voters, Chávez drafted an agenda that drew <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> interpretation of Bolivarianism. Chávez also utilized his charisma and flamboyant public speaking stylenoted for its abundance of colloquialisms and ribald manneron the campaign trail to help win the trust and favor of a primarily poor and working class following.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson's {{approximately}} $100,000 of debt weighed <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind in {{his final}} months, as it became increasingly clear {{that he would have}} little to leave to his heirs. In February 1826, he successfully applied to the General Assembly to hold a public lottery as a fund raiser. His health began to deteriorate in July 1825, due to a combination of rheumatism from arm and wrist injuries, as well as intestinal and urinary disorders and, by June 1826, he was confined to bed. On July 3, Jefferson was overcome by fever and declined an invitation to Washington to attend an anniversary celebration of the Declaration.|$|E
25|$|Weiser's colonial service {{began in}} 1731. The Iroquois sent Shikellamy, an Oneida chief, as an {{emissary}} to other tribes and the British. Shikellamy {{lived on the}} Susquehanna River at Shamokin village, near present-day Sunbury, Pennsylvania and Shikellamy State Park. An oral tradition holds that Weiser met Shikellamy while hunting. In any case, the two became friends. When Shikellamy traveled to Philadelphia for a council with the Province of Pennsylvania, he brought Weiser with him. The Iroquois trusted him and considered him an adopted son of the Mohawks. Weiser impressed the Pennsylvania governor and council, which thereafter relied <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> services. Weiser also interpreted in a follow-up council in Philadelphia in August, 1732.|$|E
25|$|His {{form in the}} Premier League {{picked up}} remarkably as he {{remained}} unbeaten in his final 11 matches which included a 7–4 victory over Van Gerwen.

Taylor led Raymond van Barneveld 3–0 in the semi-finals but could only hit 26% of his doubles during the match and, ultimately was defeated 8–5. This was the first time that the Dutchman had beaten him in the tournament in 21 attempts. Later, Taylor said that the six missed darts at double to move 5–2 ahead had played <b>heavily</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind and had made him nervous during the match- a feeling which he had never experienced before during his 26-year career.|$|E
