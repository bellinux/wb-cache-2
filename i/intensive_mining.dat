25|$|In Spring 1916 the {{division}} {{was moved to}} the Vimy Ridge sector near Arras. This was quiet to begin with, but in April <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> operations were begun by both sides, and on 20 May the Germans attacked and took some ground from {{the division}}. The 1/21st and 1/24th Bns counter-attacked on the evening of 23 May. The 1/24th was held up, but A Company of the First Surreys went ahead and recaptured the old line, holding it for about an hour and causing heavy casualties to the enemy. However, they were unsupported by flanking forces and were compelled to return: 'Nothing was left to show for this gallant and costly action beyond a few yards of our old front line'. To hold its position against German counter-attack {{at the end of the}} action, the battalion had to be reinforced by a company of the 1/22nd Londons, by the divisional engineers and pioneers and by the tunnelling companies. The First Surreys suffered 187 casualties of all ranks in this action.|$|E

50|$|Due to its {{subterranean}} natural resources, such as iron ore, {{silver and}} lead deposits, Dernbach {{was characterized by}} <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> for a long time. This very day only some typical place names (Silberstollen, Alte Grube, Schöne Aussicht) remind us of this.|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} founded in 1952, near a village of the same name, as an {{industrial}} centre for the grinding of uranium mined in nearby Băița (serving the <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> development set as an imperative by the Romanian Communist regime).|$|E
50|$|The Forest of Dean Coalfield, {{underlying}} the Forest of Dean, in west Gloucestershire, {{is one of}} the smaller coalfields in the British Isles, although <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> during the 19th and 20th centuries has had enormous influence on the landscape, history, culture, and economy of the area.|$|E

50|$|Eppawala and its {{surroundings}} are located within a geological region of high-grade phosphate deposits - Sri Lanka's only phosphate deposits. Mined since the 1970s by government-owned Lanka Phosphate, the deposits attracted media attention and spawned national protests {{in the late}} 1990s when overseas corporations expressed interest in initiating <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> operations.|$|E
50|$|There was <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> {{activity}} in the hills {{to the south of}} Aberdare, and the Vale of Neath Railway had already opened a branch there. In 1866 the Dare Valley Railway, incorporated 1863, was opened from Aberdare to the Bwllfa Colliery in 1866. The line was worked by and leased to the TVR.|$|E
50|$|Thus the {{landscape}} was modeled since Roman times, with overexploitation of forests {{in favor of}} <b>intensive</b> <b>mining,</b> documented from old time because Cayo Mario, brilliant strategist and 7 times consul during the last period of the Roman Republic, based his fortune on the mining concessions in the mountains called Sierras Mariánicas, named after him (Sierra Morena and Sierra Madrona).|$|E
50|$|Stony Creek {{is one of}} {{a number}} of tributaries of Sandy Creek, in the Limestone {{district}} south of the Palmer River, that were subjected to a major rush and <b>intensive</b> alluvial <b>mining</b> by Chinese prospectors following James Venture Mulligan's discovery of gold in Sandy Creek in 1874. The alluvial gravels yielded fine gold for several years.|$|R
50|$|Karori {{experienced}} a gold rush when {{the valley of}} the Upper Kaiwharawhara Stream was subject to <b>intensive</b> gold <b>mining</b> activity between 1869 and 1873. This activity eventually led to the building of the lower Karori Dam in 1873. At the height of the rush, there were about 200 men working the claims, and shafts and drives up to 500 feet in length were driven into the hills.|$|R

It was functionally and physically linked by the railway to the Mount Cuthbert smelter. The place is located above the valley floor with views south over the smelter.|$|R
50|$|<b>Intensive</b> <b>mining</b> {{activity}} in the Ebagoola district proved to be of short duration. Within a decade, the mines were closing. In 1907 the Pioneer battery {{was moved to the}} nearby Lukin field and in the same year the Ada Stewart battery changed ownership, and again in 1910. From 1909 to 1913 Berryman and Pool cyanided the Ada Stewart battery sands.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} about 40 weavers working from home. Although by the 20th Century mining was the {{dominant}} industry, workers {{had to travel}} to outlying areas. Eight pits producing around 124,000 tons a year were operating in the 1940s. With {{the decline of the}} labour-intensive deep mining, the area is now dependent on its replacement - opencast (capital <b>intensive)</b> <b>mining.</b>|$|E
50|$|While great {{incomes are}} produced, most staff {{employed}} in the mining industries are from outside Mali, and residents {{in the areas of}} <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> complain of little benefit from the industry. Populations complain of displacement for the construction of mines: at Sadiola Gold Mine, 43 villages have lost some land to the mine there, while in Fourou, near the large Syama goldmines, 121 villages saw some displacement.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the Middle Ages {{and again}} during the Second World War there was <b>intensive</b> ore <b>mining</b> in the municipality. In 1967 the mine was shut down. In 1872 a thread factory opened in Herznach and in 1918 it {{switched}} to making fabrics. The other factory in Herznach, was built in 1952, and manufactures advertising balloons. At {{the beginning of the}} 21st Century Herznach was a farming community with a residential core and two industrial plants.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the river}} is used for {{domestic}} consumption, it does suffer from pollution, particularly from nitrates. These come {{from the use of}} fertilizers that are not fully used by the plants. Other than that, there were <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> activities along the river between 1950 and 1999, and factories also produced pollution. That being said, the river's water quality is not uniformly poor, and the upper areas of the river are relatively free from pollution.|$|E
50|$|Beach seine fishers {{targeting}} prawns try {{to avoid}} the Hortle's whipray, but still take it regularly as bycatch. The meat, and possibly also the skin and cartilage, is utilized. This ray is also threatened by habitat degradation, from the large-scale destruction of mangroves, <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> activity, and river pollution. While the Hortle's whipray remains common within its small range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) believes these factors {{have led to a}} population decline, and has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|New Quay {{is a small}} once {{industrial}} abandoned hamlet and <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> port on the steep, winding {{banks of}} the river Tamar in Devon. New Quay village is immediately east of and downstream of the similar port of Morwellham Quay (now {{the heart of an}} open-air museum). New Quay was formerly an important copper, tin and later arsenic port serving the local mines including the George and Charlotte Mine, Bedford Consolidated Mine and Gawton Arsenic Mine. Since July 2006 New Quay is within the World Heritage Site that is the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape.|$|E
30|$|Accumulation of mud is {{observed}} on various continental shelves, normally {{due to the}} discharge of large rivers supplying significant amounts of fine-grained sediments (e.g. Walsh and Nittrouer, 2009). However, such a sediment source is missing in the study area. From other studies, {{it is known that}} the mud supply to the shelf has increased in historical times due to direct or indirect anthropogenic impact (Wolanski and Spagnol, 2000; Sommerfield and Wheatcroft, 2007; Szczuciński et al., 2009). An increased supply of fine sediment during the last century may also be expected in the study area offshore Khao Lak, due to <b>intensive</b> tin <b>mining</b> activities, agriculture, tourism and related land-use change (e.g. deforestation).|$|R
40|$|An ongoing {{question}} in paleoenvironmental reconstructions {{of the central}} African rainforest concerns the role that prehistoric metallurgy played in shaping forest vegetation. Here we report evidence of <b>intensive</b> iron-ore <b>mining</b> and smelting in forested regions of the northern Congo Basin dating to the late Holocene. Volumetric estimates on extracted iron-ore and associated slag mounds from prehistoric sites in the southern Central African Republic suggest large-scale iron production on par with other archaeological and historically-known iron fabrication areas. These data document the first evidence of <b>intensive</b> iron <b>mining</b> and production spanning approximately 90 years prior to colonial occupation (circa AD 1889) and during an interval of time that is poorly represented in the archaeological record. Additional site areas pre-dating these remains by 3 - 4 centuries reflect an earlier period of iron production on a smaller scale. Microbotanical evidence from a sediment core collected from an adjacent riparian trap shows a reduction in shade-demanding trees in concert {{with an increase in}} light-demanding species spanning the time interval associated with iron intensification. This shift occurs during the same time interval when many portions of the Central African witnessed forest transgressions associated with a return to moister and more humid conditions beginning 500 - 100 years ago. Although data presented here do not demonstrate that iron smelting activities caused widespread vegetation change in Central Africa, we argue that intense mining and smelting can have localized and potentially regional impacts on vegetation communities. These data further demonstrate the high value of pairing archeological and paleoenvironmental analyses to reconstruct regional-scale forest histories...|$|R

50|$|The {{formation}} and sedimentation {{of the basin}} lasted from Upper Carboniferous to the Lower Permian and were tectonically affected by the adjacent NW-SE trending fault zone (the Elbe Valley zone). About half of the 800-metre-thick basin filling is made of pyroclastic rock. Of economic importance were the coal seams of the Döhlen formation, whose occurrence has been known since the 16th century {{and particularly in the}} late 19th and early 20th century was the reason for an <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> industry. From 1968, mining activity became restricted to the extraction of uranium-bearing coal on the northwest edge of the Döhlen Basin by SDAG Wismut. Since 1989, the surface and underground facilities in the region have been safeguarded and sanitised.|$|E
5000|$|With {{more than}} 80 known deposits, the Iberian Pyrite Belt became {{an area of}} <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> of {{sulphide}} ore since the Chalcolithic era. The Aljustrel camp consists of six separate orebodies (Estação, Feitais, Algares, Moinho, São João and Gavião) that lie on the limbs of four main SWverging folds: the Feitais anticline (towards the northeast), the Central anticline, the São João sincline and the southwestern anticline. The Aljustrel Group structures are truncated and rejected by a major northeast-southwest fault (the Messejana fault). It terminates in the northwest with a hidden by tertiary cover and constitutes the Paleozoic basement where the main two Gavião orebodies occur, with 30 MT of total massive sulfides.|$|E
50|$|Clausnitz was {{probably}} founded by Frankish settlers around 1200 {{in the course}} of the agricultural colonisation of the ancient forest that covered the entire Ore Mountains. Its settlement was carried out by the feudal lords at Purschenstein Castle. The village was first mentioned in the records in 1398, spelt as Clussenicz. The village name changed in the following centuries through Klawßnitz (1451) and Clawsenicz (1479) to Claußnitz (1641). Clausnitz developed quickly into a comparatively large farming village. By 1551 the place had 46 freeholding farmers (besessene Mann) and 172 other home owners (Inwohner), i.e. a total of about 400 inhabitants. The economic basis of the village was agriculture and, in the 15th and 16th centuries, <b>intensive</b> <b>mining</b> for silver and copper ore.|$|E
50|$|The Spokane area is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most productive mining districts in North America. In the late 19th century, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Northwest, leading to <b>intensive</b> development of <b>mines</b> in the region. The expansion and growth of Spokane abruptly stopped in the 1910s and was followed by a period of population decline due to economic factors.|$|R
50|$|The site of <b>intensive</b> lead <b>mining</b> in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the valley}} still {{contains}} much evidence of its industrial past. Streams were dammed, {{and the water}} released as a torrent to scour soil off the surface and reveal lead ore (galena) seams. The resultant scars are known as hushes (perhaps an onomatopoeia of the sound that the water made). Bunton, Friarfold, and Gorton hushes are {{on the east side}} of the valley, with the North Hush being on the opposite side. Large areas of the upper valley are covered in spoil heaps from the mining activity, and a number of buildings remain. Many of the buildings and mine structures are scheduled ancient monuments.|$|R
