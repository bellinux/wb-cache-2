40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} the sampling distribution and usefulness <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life in comparisons of mortality at health district level or below.  DESIGN—Derivation of {{a formula for}} the variance <b>of</b> the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life, confirmation of the result and generation of the sampling distribution by Monte Carlo simulation; comparison <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life with standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and other summary indices of mortality.  SETTING—A health district in Trent Region, England.  SUBJECTS—Routinely available mortality statistics at electoral ward level and above.  MAIN RESULTS—Given reasonable and simple assumptions the sampling distribution <b>of</b> the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life is approximately normal. <b>Expectation</b> <b>of</b> life shows a high negative correlation with SMR even if the oldest age band for the SMR is open ended.  CONCLUSIONS—Where sampling error is an issue, inference concerning differences in mortality rates between populations can be based on <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life, which is better for illustrative purposes than SMR. The formula for the variance <b>of</b> the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> life is more complex however.
