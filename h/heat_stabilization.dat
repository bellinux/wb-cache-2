40|$|Abstract. Some {{companies}} in the motor and generator industry utilizing sintered NdFeB magnets have adopted pre-ageing heat treatment {{in order to improve}} the stability of the magnets. The parameters of this <b>stabilization</b> <b>heat</b> treatment are based mainly on assumptions rather than on any published research results. In this work, the effects of pre-ageing treatment on the time-dependent polarization losses of two different types of commercial sintered NdFeB magnets were studied. The material showing the squarer J(H) curve did not benefit from the pre-ageing treatment, since it seems to be stable under a certain critical temperature. In contrast, a stabilizing effect was observed in the material showing rounder J(H) curve. After the <b>stabilization</b> <b>heat</b> treatment, the polarization of the magnets was found to be at lower level, but unchanged over a certain period of time. The length of this period depends on the temperature and the duration of the pre-ageing treatment. In addition, our analysis reveals that the <b>stabilization</b> <b>heat</b> treatment performed in an open circuit condition does not stabilize the magnet uniformly. ...|$|R

These effects were readily quantified using the following methodology. First, the effect of solution cooling rate was assessed to determine its impact on a given property. The as-cooled property was then modified by using two multiplicative factors which assess the impact of solution temperature and stabilization parameters. Comparison of experimental data with predicted values showed this physically based analysis produced good results that rivaled the statistical analysis employed, which required numerous changes in the form of the regression equation depending on the property and temperature in question. As this physically based analysis uses the data for input, it should be noted that predictions which attempt to extrapolate beyond the bounds of the data must be viewed with skepticism.

40|$|AbstractAnalysis of {{multiple}} analytes from biological samples {{can be challenging}} as different analytes require different preservation measures. Heat induced enzymatic inactivation is {{an efficient way to}} preserve proteins and their modifications in biological samples but RNA quality, as measured by RIN value, has been a concern in such samples. Here, we investigate the effect of <b>heat</b> <b>stabilization</b> compared with standard snap freezing on RNA quality using two RNA extraction protocols, QiaZol with and without urea pre-solubilization, and two RNA quality measurements: RIN value, as defined by the Agilent Bioanalyzer, and an alternative qPCR based method. DNA extraction from heat stabilized brain samples was also examined. The snap frozen samples had RIN values about 1 unit higher than heat stabilized samples for the direct QiaZol extraction but equal with stabilized samples using urea pre-solubilization. qPCR based RNA quality measurement showed no difference in quality between snap frozen and heat inactivated samples. The probable explanation for this discrepancy is that the RIN value is an indirect measure based on rRNA, while the qPCR score is based on actual measurement of mRNA quality. The DNA yield from heat stabilized brain tissue samples was significantly increased, compared to the snap frozen tissue, without any effects on purity or quality. Hence, <b>heat</b> <b>stabilization</b> of tissues opens up the possibility for a two step preservation protocol, where proteins and their modifications can be preserved in the first heat based step, while in a second step, using standard RNA preservation strategies, mRNA be preserved.

The methane-air combustion characteristics in the combustion space were examined with and without catalytic platinum wires. The installing locations and scale effects of the platinum wires were varied to distinguish between thermo-fluidic and catalytic effects. Temperature distribution through the channels and the compositions of burned gas were measured. Conclusively, the platinum wires in the upstream channel slightly enhanced flame stabilization by an enhanced heat transfer, not by a catalytic reaction. In contrast, the platinum wire located within the recirculation area of the combustion space promoted the catalytic reaction and extended the self-sustainable reaction conditions when it had sufficient surface area. Two reaction regimes, of an ordinary gas reaction and of a catalytic reaction, were distinguished and a hysteresis in the reaction-mode transition was confirmed through the comparison of CO, O 2, and methane across the transition conditions.

A model was proposed for the mechanism of {{interaction of}} the enzyme with the surface based on {{the shape of the}} adsorption isotherm, the morphological characteristics of the enzyme, and the thermodynamic parameters of the system. The enzyme was irreversibly immobilized at the solid/liquid interface even at high temperatures, and most interestingly, it acquired further <b>heat</b> <b>stabilization</b> upon adsorption.

Maintenance of the biological function particularly at high temperatures is important for the development of solid substrate immobilized enzymes for applications in biocatalysis and biotechnology.

Whey protein aggregation prior to homogenization is a means to modifyemulsion heat stability but the underlying mechanism of <b>heat</b> <b>stabilization</b> has hardly been studied in anindustrial context where whey protein ingredients contain caseins. Emulsions were prepared with 30 %anhydrous milk fat and 70 % whey protein/casein solutions with protein concentrations ranging from 3 to 6 %. The proteins were either unheated (WP/Cas samples) or heat-aggregated (A-WP/Cas samples). Afterhomogenization, the fat droplet interface was characterized and emulsion stability was analyzed visuallyand at microscopic level. WP/Cas emulsions were heat stable at low protein concentrations but exhibiteda gradual decrease in heat stability when the protein concentration increased (> 3 %). This instability wasdue to the co-gelation of the protein-coated fat droplets and the proteins in the dispersing phase. Incontrast, A-WP/Cas emulsions were rapidly heat destabilized at low protein concentrations (< 4 %) butwere more heat stable than WP/Cas emulsions at higher protein concentrations. The stability of the AWP/Cas emulsions at protein concentrations higher than 4 % was correlated with the heat stability of thewhey protein aggregates in the dispersing phase and the decrease {{in the proportion of}} whey proteinaggregates at the oil/water interface due to increasing competition with caseins present in the wheyprotein ingredient.

40|$|The nuclear matrix, a {{proteinaceous}} network {{believed to}} be a scaffolding structure determining higher-order organization of chromatin, is usually prepared from intact nuclei by a series of extraction steps. In most cell types investigated the nuclear matrix does not spontaneously resist these treatments but must be stabilized before the application of extracting agents. Incubation of isolated nuclei at 37 C or 42 C in buffers containing Mg++ has been widely employed as stabilizing agent. We have previously demonstrated that heat treatment induces changes in the distribution of three nuclear scaffold proteins in nuclei prepared in the absence of Mg++ ions. We studied whether different concentrations of Mg++ (2. 0 - 5 mM) affect the spatial distribution of nuclear matrix proteins in nuclei isolated from K 562 erythroleukemia cells and stabilized by heat at either 37 C or 42 C. Five proteins were studied, two of which were RNA metabolism-related proteins (a 105 -kD component of splicing complexes and an RNP component), one a 126 -kD constituent of a class of nuclear bodies, and two were components of the inner matrix network. The localization of proteins was determined by immunofluorescent staining and confocal scanning laser microscope. Mg++ induced significant changes of antigen distribution even at the lowest concentration employed, and these modifications were enhanced in parallel with increase in the concentration of the divalent cation.
