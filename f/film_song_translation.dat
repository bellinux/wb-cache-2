40|$|This thesis {{examines}} translation in English Canadian {{music of}} the late 20 th/early 21 st century and the challenges unique to <b>song</b> <b>translation.</b> It first explores this increasingly apparent trend {{in the light of}} Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations, and then studies the history and background of Canadian music. It then looks at <b>song</b> <b>translation</b> as a form of poetry translation, to study the challenges faced in the process and the solutions found, focussing specifically on the translation of various poetic devices used in the corpus. Further, it examines the intentions that generate these translations and seeks to analyze the finished products in the light of these motivations. Do musical groups translate their work in order to expand their horizons and explore another culture, or do they do so primarily to expand the fan base and generate more revenue? And what methods are used to deal with all the inherent restrictions of <b>song</b> <b>translation?</b> What does the finished product tell the listener about the intention of the translation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to compare the Dutch and Italian <b>translations</b> of the <b>songs</b> from the Disney movie Frozen (2013). The field of <b>song</b> <b>translation,</b> and musical <b>song</b> <b>translation</b> in particular, has been {{underdeveloped}} and underresearched compared to other areas in translation. For this reason, the author decided to compare the translations of the original English songs, focusing on elements such as word count, grammar, humour, use of abstract vs concrete language, exaggeration and culture. This thesis first examines the research and studies done {{on the subject of}} <b>song</b> <b>translation</b> over the years. In a second stage, the lyrics from the original movie are compared to the Dutch and Italian translations, with special focus on the elements listed above. The results of the author’s research show that the Dutch translation is truer to the original English source text, whereas the Italian translation differs in areas such as concrete language, humour and word count. The author recommends further research on multiple other musicals, and the comparison between English, Dutch and Italian translation of the musical songs in particular, {{in order to be able}} to fully support this conclusion...|$|R
