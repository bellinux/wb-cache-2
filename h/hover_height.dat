40|$|The U-CAS is a {{spinning}} magnetized top that is levitated in a static magnetic field. The field {{is produced by}} a permanent magnet base, positioned below the hovering top. In this paper we derive {{upper and lower bounds}} for h - the maximum <b>hovering</b> <b>height</b> of this top. We show that the bounds are of the form a*L where a is a dimensionless number ranging from about 1 to 12, depending on the constraints on the shape of the base and on stability considerations, and L is a characteristic length for the problem.

50|$|The {{main focus}} of the SLIDE is in the {{levitation}} of the hoverboard. The levitation is achieved {{through the use of}} superconductors inside the board. Superconductors are conductors that have no internal resistance {{as long as they are}} kept below a certain temperature. When a metal has no internal resistance, that means with a current running through the metal, the current will run forever without a power source. When a superconductor is subjected to a magnetic field, essentially the superconductor aligns itself with the magnetic field and floats on top of it. The magnetic field in which the SLIDE will ride on has a magnetic pole of two south poles on the ends with a north pole in the middle. Generally with magnetic fields, the direction goes from north pole to south pole, so to simplify, the magnetic field created for the SLIDE pushes upwards in the middle and outwards equally split in both directions of the board keeping it levitating. The SLIDE maintains a <b>hover</b> <b>height</b> of about 1 to 2 inches above ground and can support about 440 pounds in weight. Superconductors only have their no internal resistance property when cooled to a certain temperature. In order to achieve this the SLIDE uses liquid nitrogen to cool it down to -197° Celsius. Even though liquid nitrogen cools down the superconductors of the SLIDE, it also boils at -197° Celsius. Because of this, it is difficult to have a constant supply of liquid nitrogen to continually cool down the superconductors, this is why the SLIDE can go for an average of 20 minutes on maximum liquid nitrogen capacity. Ross McGouran managed to get a maximum ride time of 30 minutes.|$|E

40|$|A highly-instrumented UH- 60 A {{aircraft}} was tested at NASA-Ames Research Center from August 1993 to February 1994 obtaining an extensive data base for level flight, maneuvers, acoustics (both {{with respect to}} ground microphone arrays and inflight microphones), and flight dynamics. A majority of the data obtained are now in an electronic data base, however, {{only a small fraction}} of the data have been examined. The proposed paper will examine the issue of hovering steadiness in more detail. In particular, a single set of data obtained during ground acoustic testing may provide considerable insight as the wind speeds were measured at a <b>hover</b> <b>height</b> of 250 feet and the {{aircraft was}} positioned in 15 deg. steps in heading from 0 to 180 deg. Also, hover housekeeping data were obtained for many of the 31 flights and these will also allow a characterization of the unsteadiness. The variation in section lift will be examined in terms of the induced flow angle variation and this will be related to possible physical explanations...|$|E
25|$|Insects are {{the only}} group of {{invertebrates}} that have evolved wings and flight. Two insect groups, the dragonflies and the mayflies, have flight muscles attached directly to the wings. Other insects have the flight muscles attached to the thorax, making it oscillate and indirectly causing the wings to beat. Some very small insects make use not of steady-state aerodynamics but of the Weis-Fogh clap and fling mechanism, generating large lift forces {{at the expense of}} wear and tear on the wings. Many insects can <b>hover,</b> maintaining <b>height</b> and controlling their position. Some insects such as moths have the forewings coupled to the hindwings so these can work in unison.|$|R
50|$|The name kestrel (from French crécerelle, {{derivative}} from crécelle, i.e. ratchet) {{is given}} to several different members of the falcon genus, Falco. Kestrels are most easily distinguished by their typical hunting behaviour which is to <b>hover</b> at a <b>height</b> of around 10 - 20 m over open country and swoop down on prey, usually small mammals, lizards or large insects. Other falcons are more adapted to active hunting in flight. In addition, kestrels are notable for usually {{having a lot of}} brown in their plumage.|$|R

40|$|Aerodynamic {{performance}} and energetic savings for flight {{in ground effect}} are theoretically maximized during hovering, but have never been directly measured for flying animals. We evaluated flight kinematics, metabolic rates and induced flow velocities for Anna's hummingbirds <b>hovering</b> at <b>heights</b> (relative to wing length R 5. 5 cm) of 0. 7 R, 0. 9 R, 1. 1 R, 1. 7 R, 2. 2 R and 8 R above a solid surface. Flight at heights {{less than or equal}} to 1. 1 R resulted in significant reductions in the body angle, tail angle, anatomical stroke plane angle, wake-induced velocity, and mechanical and metabolic power expenditures when compared with flight at the control height of 8 R. By contrast, stroke plane angle relative to horizontal, wingbeat amplitude and wingbeat frequency were unexpectedly independent of height from ground. Qualitative smoke visualizations suggest that each wing generates a vortex ring during both down-and upstroke. These rings expand upon reaching the ground and present a complex turbulent interaction below the bird's body. Nonetheless, hovering near surfaces results in substantial energetic benefits for hummingbirds, and by inference for all volant taxa that either feed at flowers or otherwise fly close to plant or other surfaces...|$|R
50|$|The Eurasian skylark is 16 to 18 {{centimetres}} long. It is a bird of open farmland and heath, {{known throughout}} its range {{for the song}} of the male, which is delivered in <b>hovering</b> flight from <b>heights</b> of 50 to 100 m, when the singing bird may appear as just a dot in the sky from the ground. The long, unbroken song is a clear, bubbling warble delivered high in the air while the bird is rising, circling or hovering. The song generally lasts two to three minutes, but it tends to last longer later in the mating season, when songs can last for 20 minutes or more. The male has broader wings than the female. This adaptation for more efficient hovering flight may have evolved because of female Eurasian skylarks' preference for males that sing and hover for longer periods and so demonstrate that they are likely to have good overall fitness.|$|R

Smith {{believed}} his shots were accurately aimed, but had no effect. Police sergeant Piet Kitching and police station commander Van Rensburg stated they arrived and fired shots at the object, described as metallic and shaped like a 44-gallon drum with three legs that changed colors before it flew away. They said they found imprints and markings on the ground they believed were made by the object. It is claimed that the Grahamstown army regiment te investigated the site, but the base has no records of such an event. The incident received coverage by international press, and led to businesses capitalizing on the incident, with a tavern calling itself the [...] "UFO Bar" [...] and painting flying saucers on the walls and the local Savoy Hotel keeping clippings of the stories posted on its walls.

30|$|At the {{application}} layer, {{constant bit rate}} (CBR) traffic was generated. Packet size was adjusted according to the physical rate to ensure airtime fairness. IEEE 802.11 a {{was used as the}} radio technology, and because this a multi-rate network, the physical data rate for each user was selected based on the SINR and received signal power according to Table  1. In our simulations, we assumed there were no sources of interference outside the network. With DumbAgent as routing protocol, we found that the frame size at MAC layer was 40 bytes larger than the CBR packet size. Therefore, to achieve airtime fairness, we used the CBR packet with different rates as shown in Table  2. Given that the maximum MAC Service Data Unit (MSDU) size for IEEE 802.11 a is 2304 bytes, the maximum CBR packet size was chosen, so the packet size does not exceed the MSDU after the header overhead is added. Because in different environments (urban, suburban, and rural) different channel models are applicable and, in this work, we do not focus on any particular environment, we used Friis free-space propagation model owing to its simplicity. The transmission range was kept at 250 m, so when the UAV <b>hovers</b> at the <b>height</b> of 20 m, the transmission radius in the user plane is about 249 m. The values for MAC capacity against each physical rate in Table  2 were obtained experimentally using ns- 2. Initially, the UAV is positioned at coordinates (250, 250, 20) m. User positions were generated inside a circle of radius 249 m and centered at (250, 250, 0). For the heuristic method, β= 11 was used, which was experimentally determined.|$|R
