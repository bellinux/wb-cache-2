5|$|The {{principal}} {{employment of}} the working population of Eccles and vicinity at that time, was the manufacture of Cotton Goods on the home or domestic plan. These were not then, according to my present recollection, more than two Spinning Manufactories in Manchester, Arkwright's with its loft chimney, and Douglas's extensive Works, on the River Irwell, near the Broken bank... At the period of my first residence in Eccles Parish, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> above Mills chiefly supplied the Weavers of Eccles and other parishes with twist for warps, which were purchased by the Master Manufacturers.|$|E

Our next congressman must go to Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress.|$|E

In his review, film critic Noel Vera {{point out that the}} show is rare creature in Philippine television, the political melodrama. Longer and more complex soap operas have been mounted on Philippine television before, and politics has been touched upon before, but far as I can recall {{there has never been a}} series (the exact name of the genre is, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>the</b> teleserye) fully driven by politics, hinging upon the election into office and subsequent administration of the main character. All of the performances were great especially Aunor which gave her a nomination from Golden Screen TV Awards and a best actress trophy from 2012 Star Awards for Television. This miniseries would be the last collaboration between Aunor and O'hara before his death from leukemia.|$|E

Lloyd George wrote that [...] "What {{he says in}} one of his letters, 'I hate this game, but it is the only thing one must do just now', represents, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>the</b> conviction of those vast armies who, realising what is at stake, have risked all and endured all that liberty may be saved". Haig spoke of Ball's [...] "unrivalled courage" [...] and his [...] "example and incentive to those who have taken up his work".

500|$|The first {{mentions}} of Palsgraf in law reviews were case notes {{written by}} law students, appearing {{over the course}} of the year following the decision by the Court of Appeals. Professor Robert L. Goodhart, in the Yale Law Journal in 1930, was at the front of an avalanche of commentary to such an extent that by 1938, Louisiana State University professor Thomas A. Cowan deemed Palsgraf [...] "a legal institution". The case entered the standard legal casebooks, from which law students learn, in the early 1930s, usually to illustrate the necessary connection between defendant's misconduct and plaintiff's injury in negligence cases. According to Posner, writing in 1990, [...] "Palsgraf is now the subject of a large scholarly literature, and is, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>the</b> only case reprinted in all American casebooks on tort law." [...] Manz wrote, [...] "everyone who has sat in an American law school torts class can recall the basic facts—the crowded railroad platform, the running men, the dropped package, the explosion, and the falling scale. Palsgraf has become a sort of legal 'urban legend'—an allegedly true, but improbable, tale told and retold to each new class of law students." [...] Professor W. Jonathan Cardi noted, [...] "in law school classrooms, 'Palsgraf Day' is often celebrated with food and drink, dramatic reenactments, interpretive poems, and even mock duels between Judges Cardozo and Andrews".|$|E

500|$|It {{seems that}} Mohun later had second {{thoughts}} about {{the removal of the}} Arab slavers from the Congo and their replacement by pro-Belgian Congolese village chiefs. [...] In the late 1890s he made his views known to Roger Casement, the British-Irish diplomat who was then campaigning for reform in the Congo. [...] Mohun stated [...] "we were all called upon to admire as an achievement of civilisation over barbarism" [...] the removal of the Arab slavers but that [...] "I believe the Arabs when they permanently occupied a country did a very great deal of good, much more than they will ever be given credit for". [...] It was then his, and Casement's, belief that [...] "slavery still exists ... For the native <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> change has been for the worst as they certainly don't have the same respect for a dirty native chief as they had for the powerful Arab always clean, and even the worst of them with the manners of gentlemen". [...] Mohun also recounts the case of Nyangwe, a town of 3,000 houses and up to 45,000 inhabitants that he encountered, within a year of a Free State army post being established there the town had been completely destroyed. [...] In 1896 he noted that one of the Belgian generals had encouraged the cruelty and that the situation improved after he was recalled by King Leopold.|$|E

Castro also associated with the Spaniard Alberto Bayo, who agreed to teach Castro's rebels the necessary skills in guerrilla warfare. Requiring funding, Castro toured the U.S. in search of wealthy sympathizers, there being monitored by Batista's agents, who allegedly orchestrated a failed assassination attempt against him. Castro kept in contact with the MR-26-7 in Cuba, where they had gained a large support base in Oriente. Other militant anti-Batista groups had sprung up, primarily from the student movement; most notable was the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE), founded by José Antonio Echeverría. Antonio met with Castro in Mexico City, but Castro opposed the student's support for indiscriminate assassination.|$|E
