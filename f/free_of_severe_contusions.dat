40|$|It {{has been}} the general policy of most neurosurgeons to {{evacuate}} the intracranial hematoma as soon as possible, and to treat the cerebral contusion conservatively without any surgical intervention. In many cases of intracranial hematoma, especially of acute subdural hematoma, cerebral contusion of considerable degree is coexistent. Even for such cases, the hematoma is evacuated through multiple burr holes which has no beneficial effect upon the underlying contusion.

40|$|Abstract. Late {{benefits}} of remote antischistosomal therapy were estimated among long-term residents {{of an area}} with high transmission of Schistosoma haematobium (Msambweni, Kenya) by comparing infection and disease preva-lence in two local adult cohorts. We compared 132 formerly treated adults (given treatment in childhood or adolescence 10 years previously) compared with 132 age- and sex-matched adults from the same villages who had not received prior treatment. The prevalence of current infection, hematuria, and ultrasound bladder abnormalities were significantly lower among the previously treated group, who {{were found to be}} <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> bladder disease. Nevertheless, heavy infection was equally prevalent (2 – 3 %) in both study groups, and present rates of hydronephrosis were not significantly different. Therapy given in childhood or adolescence appears to improve risk for some but not all manifestations of S. haematobium infection in later adult life. Future prospective studies of continued treatment into adulthood will better define means to obtain optimal, community-based control of S. haematobium-related disease in high-risk locations...|$|R

BackgroundPercutaneous repair has emerged as an effective therapy for patients with paravalvular prosthetic regurgitation. MethodsWe retrospectively identified 126 patients who underwent catheter-based treatment of symptomatic prosthetic paravalvular regurgitation. Patients were contacted for symptoms, clinical events, and vital status. ResultsThe 3 -year estimate for survival was 64. 3 % (95 % confidence interval: 52. 1 % to 76. 8 %). Mortality occurred due to cardiac, noncardiac, and unknown causes in 9. 5 %, 7. 1 %, and 5. 6 % of patients, respectively. Among survivors, 72 % of patients who had presented with heart failure were <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> symptoms and need for cardiac surgery. Severity of residual regurgitation was not related to overall survival but was an important determinant of other clinical events. For those with no, mild, or moderate or severe residual regurgitation, 3 -year estimate <b>of</b> survival <b>free</b> <b>of</b> death or need for surgery was 63. 3 %, 58. 3 %, and 30. 3 % (p = 0. 01), respectively.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} found the e 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE e 4) is {{associated}} with an unfavourable outcome after head injury, but {{this has not been}} related to specific pathological features. Objectives: This study tested the postulate that head injured patients with APOE e 4, amounting to approximately a third of the population, are selectively predisposed to {{one or more of the}} different pathological features that constitute the response to traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that this underlies the association of APOE e 4 with poor clinical outcome. Methods: Included in the study were 239 fatal cases of TBI (1987 - 1999) for which APOE genotypes were determined from archival tissue. For each case, specific pathological features of trauma were recorded by researchers blinded to the APOE e 4 status. Of the 239 cases examined, 83 (35 %) were APOE e 4 carriers and 156 (65 %) were non-carriers. Results: Possession of APOE e 4 was associated with a greater incidence <b>of</b> moderate or <b>severe</b> <b>contusions</b> (42 % v 30 % for carriers versus e 4 non-carriers; p = 0. 05) and there was a trend towards a greater incidence <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> ischaemic brain damage (54 % v 42 %; p = 0. 08). Significant differences were not noted between the other pathological features examined.

In a multi-year (1984 - 1992) control program in Kenya, we examined risk for S. haematobium reinfection and late disease during and after annual school-based treatment. In this setting, long-term risk of new infection was independently associated with location, age, hematuria, and incomplete treatment, but not with sex or frequency of water contact. Thus, very local environmental features and age-related factors {{played an important role}} in S. haematobium transmission, such that population-based control programs should optimally tailor their efforts to local conditions on a village-by-village basis. In 2001 - 2002, the late benefits of earlier participation in school-based antischistosomal therapy were estimated in a cohort of formerly-treated adult residents compared to never-treated adults from the same villages. Among age-matched subjects, current infection prevalence was lower among those who had received remote therapy. In addition, prevalence of bladder abnormality was lower in the treated group, who were <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> bladder disease.

Summary Ultra-rapid opiate detoxification typically involves {{a day or two}} of hospitalisation during which patients dependent on opiate-type ('opioid') drugs like heroin are anaesthetised or deeply sedated while the opiate-blocking drug naloxone is administered by infusion in to the blood stream to precipitate sudden withdrawal. Then patients are started on prescriptions of naltrexone tablets which (as long as they are taken) continue to block the effects of opiate-type drugs, an attempt to prevent the relapse to regular opioid use which commonly follows withdrawal. For the featured study records were analysed of 45 male patients admitted for such procedures between 2003 and 2005 to a surgical centre's department of anaesthesiology in Iran's capital Tehran. They were selected to be <b>free</b> <b>of</b> dependence on other drugs or alcohol except for cannabis, and <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> physical or mental illness which might contraindicate general anaesthesia. For this and for other reasons they were relatively well placed to overcome their dependence via an abstinence-oriented route. Forty of the 45 were addicted to opium and just five injected. On average in their early 30 s, they were committed to abstinence and had good family support. Over half were married and nearly 80...|$|R
50|$|Australia {{has perhaps}} the world's strictest {{quarantine}} standards. Quarantine in northern Australia {{is important because}} of its proximity to South-east Asia and the Pacific, which have many pests and diseases not present in Australia. For this reason, the region from Cairns to Broome—including the Torres Strait—is the focus for many important quarantine activities that protect all Australians. As Australia has been geographically isolated from other major continents for millions of years, there is an endemically unique ecosystem <b>free</b> <b>of</b> several <b>severe</b> pests and diseases that are present {{in many parts of}} the world. If other products are brought inside along with pests and diseases, it would damage the ecosystem seriously and add millions of costs in the local agricultural businesses.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Previous studies {{suggested}} that the phenothiazine chlorpromazine (CPZ) could reverse or reduce the antibiotic resistance of bacteria. In {{some areas of the}} world, the majority of Staphylococcus aureus isolates are now resistant to methicillin, prompting this study to see whether such resistance can be altered by phenothiazine thioridazine (TZ), an agent with equal antibacterial activity, which is <b>free</b> <b>of</b> the <b>severe</b> side-effects associated with chronic administration of CPZ. The results indicated that, whereas methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were not rendered more susceptible to oxacillin, resistance to oxacillin by highly-resistant strains (MRSA) could be significantly reduced by sub-inhibitory concentrations of TZ. Reserpine, an inhibitor of efflux pumps, was also shown to reduce the resistance of MRSA strains to oxacillin in a concentration-dependen...|$|R
