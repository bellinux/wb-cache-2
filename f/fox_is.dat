5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like the Arctic hare, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} have snow camouflage, changing their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey {{in the summer}} to white in the winter; the Arctic <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E
5|$|The cunning <b>Fox</b> <b>is</b> {{commonly}} found in Native American mythology, where it is portrayed as an almost constant companion to Coyote. Fox, however, is a deceitful companion that often steals Coyote's food. In the Achomawi creation myth, Fox and Coyote are the co-creators of the world, that leave just {{before the arrival of}} humans. The Yurok tribe believed that Fox, in anger, captured the sun, and tied him to a hill, causing him to burn a great hole in the ground. An Inuit story tells of how Fox, portrayed as a beautiful woman, tricks a hunter into marrying her, only to resume her true form and leave after he offends her. A Menominee story tells of how <b>Fox</b> <b>is</b> an untrustworthy friend to the Wolf.|$|E
50|$|Gordon Dennis <b>Fox</b> <b>was</b> born on December 21, 1961, at Providence, Rhode Island. One of six children, {{he is the}} son of Mary Fox and Mr. <b>Fox.</b> Mary <b>Fox</b> <b>was</b> of Cape Verdean lineage, and Mr. <b>Fox</b> <b>was</b> of Irish-American descent. Mr. <b>Fox</b> <b>was</b> an artisan {{and served}} as a jewelry polisher, while his wife Mary served on private home staffs and later at a golf ball manufacturer. Fox's parents met while his father was stopped in Providence on return to Boston after service in the Korean War. Fox's father died when he was eighteen.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} environmental factors on the spatial epidemiology of infections with Echinococcus multilocularis, <b>foxes</b> <b>were</b> sampled in a focal endemic region in the Northwest of Brandenburg, Ger-many, and examined for infection by the parasite. The locations where <b>foxes</b> <b>were</b> obtained were recorded in a geographic information system database. Positions of infected and uninfected <b>foxes</b> <b>were</b> analyzed on the background of geographic vector data of water, settlements, streets, forests, crop, and pasture. <b>Fox</b> positions <b>were</b> allocated to different land-use classes by use of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite image. Infected <b>foxes</b> <b>were</b> more frequently shot near water, in areas of high soil humidity, and on pastures, suggesting that dryness may limit the tenacity of E. multilocularis oncospheres. Thus open landscapes with humid soil seem to be favorable for {{the life cycle of}} the parasite. In contrast, infected <b>foxes</b> <b>were</b> significantly underrepresented in forest areas...|$|R

5|$|The grey-headed flying <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> {{endemic to}} the {{south-eastern}} forested areas of Australia, principally {{east of the}} Great Dividing Range. Its range extends approximately from Bundaberg in Queensland to Geelong in Victoria, with outlying colonies in Ingham and Finch Hatton in the north, and in Adelaide in the south. In the southern parts of its range it occupies more extreme latitudes than any other Pteropus species.|$|E
5|$|The grey-headed flying <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> now a {{prominent}} federal conservation problem in Australia. Early {{in the last}} century, the species was considered abundant, with numbers estimated in the many millions. In recent years, though, direct evidence has been accumulating that the species is in serious decline. Current estimates for the species are between 200,000 - 300,000 and the national population may have declined by over 30% between 1989 and 1999 alone.|$|E
5|$|The red <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} a more specialised form of Vulpes than the Afghan, corsac and Bengal foxes {{in the direction}} of size and adaptation to carnivory; the skull displays much fewer neotenous traits than in other species, and its facial area is more developed. It is, however, not as adapted for a purely carnivorous diet as the Tibetan fox.|$|E
50|$|The {{causes of}} <b>foxing</b> <b>are</b> not well understood. One theory <b>is</b> that <b>foxing</b> <b>is</b> {{caused by a}} fungal growth on the paper. Another theory <b>is</b> that <b>foxing</b> <b>is</b> caused by the effect on certain papers of the {{oxidation}} of iron, copper, or other substances in the pulp or rag from which the paper was made. It is possible that multiple factors are involved. High humidity may contribute to foxing.|$|R

50|$|Cross <b>foxes</b> <b>are</b> {{relatively}} {{common in}} the northern areas of North America, and comprise up to 30% of Canada's red fox population. Cross <b>foxes</b> <b>were</b> once abundant in Idaho and Utah before being largely killed off.|$|R
5|$|The wolf is {{likened to}} a wicked man who oppresses others. The <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> likened to the devil. The farmer is likened to the godly man, {{with whom the}} fiend finds fault. The woods where the wolf was cheated are corrupting goods that man longs to get. The cheese {{represents}} covetousness; the well that contains it is fraud and fantasy, which draws men downwards into hell.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|Movements of grey-headed {{flying foxes}} are {{influenced}} by the availability of food. Their population is very fluid, as they move in response to the irregular blossoming of certain plant species. They are keystone pollinators and seed disperses over 100 species of native trees and plants. The grey-headed flying <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> a partial migrant that uses winds to facilitate long-distance movement. It does not migrate in a specific direction, but rather in the direction that will be the most beneficial at the time.|$|E

50|$|<b>Foxes</b> <b>are</b> small-to-medium-sized, {{omnivorous}} mammals {{belonging to}} several genera {{of the family}} Canidae. <b>Foxes</b> <b>are</b> slightly smaller than a medium-size domestic dog, with a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush).|$|R
5|$|Some {{animals of}} the far north, like the showshoe and Arctic hares, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to white in the winter; the Arctic <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on the presumption that natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment.|$|E
5|$|The Wolverine is a 2013 superhero film {{featuring}} the Marvel Comics character Wolverine. The film, distributed by 20th Century <b>Fox,</b> <b>is</b> the sixth installment in the X-Men film series. Hugh Jackman reprises his role from previous films {{as the title}} character, with James Mangold directing a screenplay written by Scott Frank and Mark Bomback, based on the 1982 limited series Wolverine by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. In the film, which follows the events of , Logan travels to Japan, where he engages an old acquaintance in a struggle that has lasting consequences. Stripped of his healing factor, Wolverine must battle deadly samurai while struggling with guilt.|$|E
5|$|The film, {{produced}} through 20th Century <b>Fox,</b> <b>is</b> a co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom. Producer Simon Kinberg began {{developing the}} film after Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, which Drew Goddard adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct, {{but the film}} did not move forward. Scott replaced Goddard, and with Damon in place as the main character, production was approved. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately seventy days. Twenty sets were built on a sound stage in Budapest, Hungary, {{one of the largest}} in the world. Wadi Rum in Jordan was also used as a backdrop for filming.|$|E
50|$|Arctic <b>foxes</b> {{can usually}} <b>be</b> found where polar bears venture {{on the fast}} ice close to land {{in their search for}} seals.

5|$|The red fox {{originated}} from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period, and colonised North America {{shortly after the}} Wisconsin glaciation. Among the true foxes, the red fox represents a more progressive form {{in the direction of}} carnivory. Apart from its large size, the red <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments. Despite its name, the species often produces individuals with other colourings, including albinos and melanists. Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised, which are divided into two categories: the large northern foxes, and the small, basal southern foxes of Asia and North Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} a long history of {{association}} with humans, having been extensively hunted as a pest and furbearer for many centuries, as well as being represented in human folklore and mythology. Because of its widespread distribution and large population, the red <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> one of the most important furbearing animals harvested for the fur trade. Too small to pose a threat to humans, it has extensively benefited from the presence of human habitation, and has successfully colonised many suburban and urban areas.|$|E
5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying <b>fox</b> <b>is</b> fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E
