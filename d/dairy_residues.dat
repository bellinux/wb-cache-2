40|$|Analyses {{of organic}} {{residues}} preserved in ceramic potsherds enable {{the identification of}} foodstuffs processed in archaeological vessels. Differences in the isotopic composition of fatty acids allow differentiation of non-ruminant and ruminant fats, as well as adipose and dairy fats. This paper investigates the trends in milk use in areas where sheep and goats are dominant in the faunal assemblage and in some sites from the Linearbandkeramik culture. Sites include: Colle Santo Stefano, Abruzzo, Italy, and the Oldest to Young Linearbandkeramik sites of Zwenkau, Eythra and Brodau, Saxony, and Wang and Niederhummel, Bavaria, Germany. More than 160 potsherds were investigated including cooking pots, bowls, jars, and ceramic sieves. The lipid residues presented provide direct evidence for the processing of ruminant and non-ruminant commodities at Zwenkau and Eythra, {{despite the absence of}} faunal remains at the sites. No <b>dairy</b> <b>residues</b> were detected in potsherds from LBK sites, except in a ceramic sieve at Brodau. Lipids from non-ruminant and ruminant fats, including from dairy fats, were detected at the site of Colle Santo Stefano showing a reliance on dairy products {{during the first half of}} the sixth millennium at this site; where sheep and goats were the major domestic animals...|$|E

For example, dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the rabbis grant pareve status to products manufactured with it. Nevertheless, someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to the <b>dairy</b> <b>residue,</b> {{and that is why}} some products that are legitimately pareve carry [...] "milk" [...] warnings.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out to explore the lignin-degrading ability of white rot fungi, as B. adusta and P. crysosporium, grown in different media containing (i) glucose and mineral salts; (ii) a dairy residue; (iii) a <b>dairy</b> <b>residue</b> and mineral salts. Both fungi were then used as inoculum to treat synthetic and industrial pulp-and-paper mill wastewater. On synthetic wastewater, up to 97 % and 74 % of lignin degradation by B. adusta and P. crysosporium, respectively, have been reached. On industrial wastewater, both fungal strains were able to accomplish 100 % delignification in 8 – 10 days, independent from pH control, with a significant reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) of the solution. Results have confirmed the great biotechnological potential of both B. adusta and P. crysosporium for complete lignin removal in industrial wastewater, and can open the way to next industrial applications on large scale...|$|R
5000|$|Those {{allergic}} to dairy foods may assume items labeled as [...] "pareve" [...] to be dairy-free, {{though this is}} not always the case. Kashrut has procedures by which equipment can be cleaned of its previous non-kosher use, but that might be inadequate for those with allergies, vegetarians, or adherents to other religious statutes. For example, dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the rabbis grant pareve status to products manufactured with it. Nevertheless, someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to the <b>dairy</b> <b>residue,</b> and that is why some products that are legitimately pareve carry [...] "milk" [...] warnings. The general rule on such matters is that an item accidentally containing dairy ingredients could be considered pareve if the dairy is present in a fraction of less than 1/60 (1.67%) of the total. Furthermore, in commercial pareve food production supervising agencies often try to be stricter than that. However, people with allergies can be sensitive to far lower concentrations of such ingredients — even parts-per-million concentrations — and therefore {{may not be able to}} rely on a pareve marking.|$|R

Such a high organic-strength wastewater is particularly suitable for methane production via anaerobic digestion. The biological degradation of cheese whey is characterized by unstable operation. Supplementation of alkalinity is necessary during the start-up or high loading rate period. pH control system was created by using porous composite material (AM) with additional buffering capability up to few weeks. The porous structure provides slow alkali release system which is necessary in anaerobic fermentation processes with unstable pH to provide optimal conditions for the microorganisms.

40|$|The genomic region {{containing}} the lactase (LCT) gene shows {{one of the}} strongest signals of positive selection in Europeans, detectable using a range of approaches including haplotype length, linked microsatellite variation and population-differentiation-based tests. Lactase is the enzyme that carries out the digestion of the milk sugar lactose. Its expression decreases at some point after the weaning period is over in most mammals and in around 68 % of all living adult humans. However, in some humans, particularly those from populations with a history of dairying, lactase is expressed throughout adulthood. This trait is called lactase persistence (LP), and in people of European ancestry, it is associated with a single mutation (- 13910 *T). Evidence from the detection of <b>dairy</b> fat <b>residues</b> in potsherds, and allele frequencies in ancient DNA samples suggest that LP arose after dairying practices had developed. However, the reasons why LP may have been advantageous are still debated, and the respective contribution of demography and natural selection remains to be disentangled. This paper discusses various studies, from archaeology to population genetics, that have shed some light on the subject by investigating the evolution of LP in Europe...|$|R
40|$|Ivermectin (22, 23 -dihydroavermectin B₁) is a broad-spectrum {{antiparasitic}} {{drug that}} was introduced {{for the control}} of parasitic worms and lice in sheep and cattle. This review summarises {{what is known about}} the impact of ivermectin in pastures and catchments and also on freshwater systems. Differing results have been obtained for the effects on decomposition of dung from ivermectin-treated cattle, although other experiments have shown adverse effects on growth of earthworms. There were likely to be risks to sediment-dwelling invertebrates where farmed salmon had been treated with ivermectin to control sea lice. In laboratory tests, freshwater fish appeared to have low sensitivity to ivermectin. In view of the lack of published information about environmental effects of use of avermectins and about endocrine-disrupting chemicals in detergents used in dairy operations, it is recommended that monitoring of <b>dairy</b> discharges for <b>residues</b> of such chemicals should be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTetracyclines {{are used}} for the {{prevention}} and control of <b>dairy</b> cattle diseases. <b>Residues</b> of these drugs can be excreted into milk. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to develop a microbiological method using Bacillus megaterium to detect tetracyclines (chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline and tetracycline) in milk. In order to approximate the limits of detection of the bioassay to the Maximum Residue Limit (100 μg/l) for milk tetracycline, different concentrations of chloramphenicol (0, 1000, 1500 and 2000 μg/l) were tested. The detection limits calculated were similar to the Maximum Residue Limits when a bioassay using B. megaterium ATCC 9885 spores (2. 8 × 108 spores/ml) and chloramphenicol (2000 μg/l) was utilized. This bioassay detects 105 μg/l of chlortetracycline, 100 μg/l of oxytetracycline and 134 μg/l of tetracycline in 5 h. Therefore, this method is suitable to be incorporated into a microbiological multi-residue system for the identification of tetracyclines in milk...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: There are global {{public health}} and {{economic}} concerns on chemical residues in food of animal origin. The use of antibiotics in dairy cattle {{for the treatment of}} diseases such as mastitis has contributed to the presence of <b>residues</b> in <b>dairy</b> products. Penicillin <b>residues</b> as low as 1 ppb can lead to allergic reactions and shift of resistance patterns in microbial population as well as interfere with the processing of several dairy products. Antibiotic monitoring is an essential quality control measure in safe milk production. This study was aimed at determining antibiotic residue contamination and the level of penicillin in dairy products from Fulani cattle herds in Oyo State. Materials and Methods: The presence of antibiotic residues in 328 samples of fresh milk, 180 local cheese (wara), and 90 fermented milk (nono) from Southwest, Nigeria were determined using Premi® test kit (R-Biopharm AG, Germany) followed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of penicillin-G residue. Results: Antibiotic residues were obtained in 40. 8...|$|R
40|$|Since ancient times, the {{agricultural}} and industrial wastes {{have been used}} for production of laccases by Basidiomycetes in higher quantity but the usage of such wastes is still not up to the mark. In this work we used Ghee <b>residue</b> (<b>Dairy</b> waste) and wheat bran (agricultural waste) in the laccases production medium (Potato dextrose broth) which is cheaper and efficient when compared to the costly chemical based conventional media using improved strain of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus (KX 8, Accession number 56259) obtained by physical or chemical mutagenesis followed by intraspecific protoplast fusion. In vitro bioassay of the parental P. cinnabarinus (154. 65 U/ml/min), its best mutant (165. 219 U/ml/min) and fusant (176. 14 U/ml/min) indicated a gradual increase in production of laccases by 17. 59 %. Its purification by ammonium sulphate precipitation, dialysis followed by anion exchange chromatography resulted in 23. 86 % yield. Thus intraspecific protoplast fusion technique can be used to develop superior hybrid strains of laccases producing fungi as successful tools to enhance the productivity in industrial point of view.

50|$|Direct {{evidence}} for how domestic animals were exploited in later prehistoric Europe has grown substantially, in quantity and diversity, since 1981. Initially {{the concepts of}} the SPR were tested by analysing the appearance of certain artefact types (e.g. ploughs, wheeled vehicles). By the middle 1980s the most common means of testing the model derived from the more ubiquitous faunal (zooarchaeological) assemblages, through which mortality patterns, herd management and traction-related arthropathies were utilized to confirm or reject the SPR model. Many zooarchaeological studies in both the Near East and Europe have confirmed the veracity of the model. However the detection of milk residues in ceramic vessels is now considered the most promising means of detecting the origins of milking. Discovery of such residues has pushed back the earliest date for milking into the Neolithic. A {{study of more than}} 2,200 pottery vessels from sites in the Near East and Southeastern Europe indicated that milking had its origins in northwestern Anatolia. The lowland, coastal region around the Sea of Marmara favoured cattle-keeping. Pottery from these sites dating from 6500-5000 BCE showed milk being processed into <b>dairy</b> products. Milk <b>residues</b> had already been found in vessels from the British Neolithic, but farming arrived in Britain late (c. 4000 BCE).|$|R
40|$|International audienceQuaternary {{ammonium}} compounds (QACs) {{are both}} cationic surfactants and biocidal substances widely used as disinfectants {{in the food}} industry. A sensitive and reliable method {{for the analysis of}} benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) and dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides (DDACs) has been developed that enables the simultaneous quantitative determination of ten quaternary ammonium <b>residues</b> in <b>dairy</b> products below the provisional maximum residue level (MRL), set at 0. 1 mgkg(- 1). To the best of our knowledge, this method could be the one applicable to milk and to three major processed milk products selected, namely processed or hard pressed cheeses, and whole milk powder. The method comprises solvent extraction using a mixture of acetonitrile and ethyl acetate, without any further clean-up. Analyses were performed by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-ESI-MS/MS) operating in positive mode. A C 18 analytical column was used for chromatographic separation, with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water both containing 0. 3 % formic acid; and methanol in the gradient mode. Five deuterated internal standards were added to obtain the most accurate quantification. Extraction recoveries were satisfactory and no matrix effects were observed. The method was validated using the total error approach in accordance with the NF V 03 - 110 standard in order to characterize the trueness, repeatability, intermediate precision and analytical limits within the range of 5 - 150 mugkg(- 1) for all matrices. These performance criteria, calculated by e. noval((R)) 3. 0 software, were satisfactory and in full accordance with the proposed provisional MRL and with the recommendations in the European Union SANTE/ 11945 / 2015 regulatory guidelines. The limit of detection (LOD) was low (< 1. 9 mugkg(- 1)) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 5 mugkg(- 1) to 35 mugkg(- 1) for all matrices depending on the analytes. The validation results proved that the method is suitable for quantifying quaternary ammoniums in foodstuffs from <b>dairy</b> industries at <b>residue</b> levels, and could be used for biocide residues monitoring plans and to measure the exposition consumer to biocides products...|$|R
