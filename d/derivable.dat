25|$|M4 and M5 are {{two ways}} of asserting supplementation, the mereological analog of set complementation, with M5 being {{stronger}} because M4 is <b>derivable</b> from M5. M and M4 yield minimal mereology, MM. MM, reformulated in terms of Proper Part, is Simons's (1987) preferred minimal system.|$|E
25|$|A {{deductive}} {{system is}} sound if any formula {{that can be}} derived in the system is logically valid. Conversely, a deductive system is complete if every logically valid formula is <b>derivable.</b> All of the systems {{discussed in this article}} are both sound and complete. They also share the property {{that it is possible to}} effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called effective.|$|E
25|$|If {{a theory}} has a binary formula A(x,y) which {{satisfies}} reflexivity and Leibniz's law, {{the theory is}} said to have equality, or to be a theory with equality. The theory may not have all instances of the above schemas as axioms, but rather as <b>derivable</b> theorems. For example, in theories with no function symbols and a finite number of relations, it is possible to define equality in terms of the relations, by defining the two terms s and t to be equal if any relation is unchanged by changing s to t in any argument.|$|E
25|$|M6 {{asserts that}} any two underlapping objects {{have a unique}} sum; M7 asserts that any two {{overlapping}} objects have a unique product. If the universe is finite or if Top is assumed, then the universe is closed under sum. Universal closure of Product and of supplementation relative to W requires Bottom. W and N are, evidently, the mereological analog of the universal and empty sets, and Sum and Product are, likewise, the analogs of set-theoretical union and intersection. If M6 and M7 are either assumed or <b>derivable,</b> {{the result is a}} mereology with closure.|$|E
25|$|Figure 1.1 {{represents}} the aero-thermo domain of turbomachinery. The horizontal axis {{represents the}} energy equation <b>derivable</b> from The first law of thermodynamics. The vertical axis, {{which can be}} characterized by Mach Number, represents the range of fluid compressibility (or elasticity). The Z-axis, which can be characterized by Reynolds number, represents the range of fluid viscosities (or stickiness). Mathematicians and physicists who established the foundations of this aero-thermo domain include: Isaac Newton, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Claude-Louis Navier, George Stokes, Ernst Mach, Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky, Martin Wilhelm Kutta, Ludwig Prandtl, Theodore von Kármán, Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius, and Henri Coandă.|$|E
25|$|The rosy {{periwinkle}} case {{dates from}} the 1950s. The rosy periwinkle, while native to Madagascar, had been widely introduced into other tropical {{countries around the world}} well before the discovery of vincristine. This meant that researchers could obtain local knowledge from one country and plant samples from another. The use of the plant as a cure for diabetes was the original stimulus for research. Effectiveness in the treatment of both Hodgkin's Disease and leukemia were discovered instead. Different countries are reported as having acquired different beliefs about the medical properties of the plant. The Hodgkin's lymphoma chemotherapeutic drug vinblastine is <b>derivable</b> from the rosy periwinkle.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Newton {{demonstrated}} that Kepler's laws were <b>derivable</b> from {{his theory of}} gravitation and that, in general, the orbits of bodies subject to gravity were conic sections (this assumes that {{the force of gravity}} propagates instantaneously). Newton showed that, for a pair of bodies, the orbits' sizes are in inverse proportion to their masses, and that those bodies orbit their common center of mass. Where one body is much more massive than the other (as is the case of an artificial satellite orbiting a planet), it is a convenient approximation to take the center of mass as coinciding with the center of the more massive body.|$|E
25|$|Hadza {{is noted}} for having medial clicks (clicks within morphemes). This {{distribution}} {{is also found}} in Sandawe and the Nguni Bantu languages, but not in the Khoisan languages of southern Africa. Some of these words are historically <b>derivable</b> from clicks in initial positions (many appear to reflect lexicalized reduplication, for example, and some are due to prefixes), but others are opaque. As in Sandawe, most medial clicks are glottalized, but not all: puche 'a spleen', tanche 'to aim', tacce 'a belt', minca 'to lick one's lips', laqo 'to trip someone', keqhe-na 'slow', penqhenqhe ~ peqeqhe 'to hurry', haqqa-ko 'a stone', shenqe 'to peer over', exekeke 'to listen', naxhi 'to be crowded', khaxxe 'to jump', binxo 'to carry kills under one's belt'.|$|E
500|$|A {{committee}} of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) has proposed revised formal definitions of the SI base units, which are being examined by the CIPM and which are expected to come into force on May 20, 2019, following a final vote at the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) on November 16, 2018. The metric system was originally conceived as a system of measurement that was <b>derivable</b> from nature. When the metric system was first introduced in France in 1799, technical limitations necessitated the use of artefacts such as the prototype metre and prototype kilogram. [...] In 1960 the metre was redefined {{in terms of the}} wavelength of light from a specified source, making it <b>derivable</b> from nature, leaving the kilogram as the only unit still defined by an artefact. [...] If the proposed redefinition is accepted, the metric system (SI) will, for the first time, be wholly <b>derivable</b> from nature.|$|E
500|$|It {{follows that}} the P2 and P3 tilings are {{mutually}} locally derivable: a tiling by {{one set of}} tiles {{can be used to}} generate a tiling by another [...] for example a tiling by kites and darts may be subdivided into A-tiles, and these can be composed in a canonical way to form B-tiles and hence rhombs. The P2 and P3 tilings are also both mutually locally <b>derivable</b> with the P1 tiling (see figure 2 above).|$|E
500|$|The {{process of}} diaphonic {{identification}} occurs when pidgins are fashioned; although lexical and morphosyntactic patterns are shared, speakers often use the phonological systems of their native language, meaning they {{must learn to}} recognize such diaphonic correspondences in the speech of others to facilitate the mutual intelligibility of a working pidgin. [...] proposes that rule differences {{can be used to}} determine the distance a particular utterance has between a post-creole continuum's acrolectal and basolectal forms. [...] points out that mesolectal varieties often have features not <b>derivable</b> from such rules.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by , Uriel Weinreich first {{advocated}} {{the use of}} diasystems in structural dialectology, and suggested that such a system would represent {{a higher level of}} abstraction that can unite related dialects into a single description and transcription. While phonemic systems describe the speech of a single variety, diaphonemic systems can reflect the contrasts that aren't made by all varieties being represented. [...] The way these differ can be shown in the name New York. This word may be transcribed phonemically as [...] in American English, as many varieties thereof do not allow the cluster [...] as a syllable onset; in Received Pronunciation, syllable-final [...] doesn't occur so this name would be transcribed [...] to reflect that pronunciation. A diaphonemic transcription such as [...] (with both the [...] and the [...] ) would thus cover both dialects. Neither is described exactly, but both are <b>derivable</b> from the diaphonemic transcription.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} other ways a {{password}} can be weak, corresponding to the strengths of various attack schemes; the core principle is that a password should have high entropy (usually taken to be equivalent to randomness) and not be readily <b>derivable</b> by any [...] "clever" [...] pattern, nor should passwords be mixed with information identifying the user. On-line services often provide a restore password function that a hacker can figure out and by doing so bypass a password. Choosing hard-to-guess restore password questions can further secure the password.|$|E
2500|$|In set theory, Cantor's {{paradox is}} <b>derivable</b> from the theorem {{that there is}} no {{greatest}} cardinal number, so that the collection of [...] "infinite sizes" [...] is itself infinite. The difficulty is handled in axiomatic set theory by declaring that this collection is not a set but a proper class; in von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory it follows from this and the axiom of limitation of size that this proper class must be in bijection with the class of all sets. Thus, not only are there infinitely many infinities, but this infinity is larger than any of the infinities it enumerates.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{this theory}} is {{unacceptable}} {{for a variety}} of reasons. [...] Two objections are theoretical. [...] First, this theory is not <b>derivable</b> from a Lagrangian, unlike the Newtonian field theory (or most metric theories of gravitation). [...] Second, the proposed field equation is linear. [...] But by analogy with electromagnetism, we should expect the gravitational field to carry energy, and on the basis of Einstein's work on relativity theory, we should expect this energy to be equivalent to mass and therefore, to gravitate. [...] This implies that the field equation should be nonlinear. [...] Another objection is more practical: this theory disagrees drastically with observation.|$|E
2500|$|Axioms in {{traditional}} thought were [...] "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic. At a formal level, an axiom {{is just a}} string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only {{in the context of}} all <b>derivable</b> formulas of an axiomatic system. It was the goal of Hilbert's program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to Gödel's incompleteness theorem every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has undecidable formulas; and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.|$|E
