500|$|On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were {{travelling}} by limousine to a New York {{airport for}} their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then {{reminded him that}} they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: [...] "Jimi, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs." [...] Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: [...] "Trust me, Bob, {{no one is going to}} recognize me", to which he replied: [...] "Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you." [...] Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953 Egyptian leader President Gamal Abdel Nasser {{was told}} by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood that they wanted to enforce the wearing of the hijab, to which Nasser responded, [...] "Sir, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a {{daughter}} in college - and she doesn't wear a headscarf or anything! Why don't you make her wear the headscarf? So you can't make one girl, your own daughter, wear it, and yet {{you want me to go}} and make ten million women wear it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{attempted}} in vain {{to capitalize}} on Kennedy's youth, poor health, and failure {{to take a position}} regarding Joseph McCarthy. He had formed a [...] "Stop Kennedy" [...] coalition with Adlai Stevenson, Stuart Symington, and Hubert Humphrey, but it proved a failure. Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention, which nominated John F. Kennedy. Tip O'Neill was a representative from Kennedy's home state of Massachusetts at that time, and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said, [...] "Tip, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to support Kennedy at the start, but I'd like to have you with me on the second ballot." [...] O'Neill replied, [...] "Senator, there's {{not going to be any}} second ballot." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm not {{surprised}} to find you in New York. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> come over. But I am surprised to find you on the stage, being bullied by Mr. Miller." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The shame," [...] he answered, [...] "is all mine, or {{ought to}} be. But is it {{possible}} that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> no suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> none." ...|$|R
60|$|Pand. Now, {{my sweet}} prince! {{have you seen}} my niece? no, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not.|$|E
6000|$|MR MARCH. Johnny, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{the best}} intentions, but really the proper {{people to help}} the young are the old--like-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not intentionally, mamma; I {{have never}} meant to keep {{anything}} secret from you. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> known what I felt about Charley.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, say no {{more about}} it," [...] said the captain. [...] "If anybody asks {{you can say that}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> it. Now go and put that back in the bureau." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so glad <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{told me all}} this, Harry dear, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{been less}} at home of late, and I was almost afraid you were not going on quite well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, mistress, don't talk so!" [...] said Liddy, {{taking her}} hand; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> too much sense to bide away. May I ask what dreadful thing {{it is that}} <b>has</b> {{happened}} between <b>you</b> and him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Clara, that is impossible. Have {{you seen}} him? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen him, because he went by {{from the house}} about an hour since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> Mary {{has told}} me what has passed between you. You may regard me, Mr. Fitzallen, as Mary's best and surest friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You look ill, Mrs Jiniwin; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been {{exciting}} yourself too much--talking perhaps, {{for it is}} your weakness. Go to bed. Do go to bed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How are you, Charlie? I {{am right}} {{glad to see}} you, safe and sound, for they had managed to include you in their pretended plot, and, for aught <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been all this time lying in a cell next mine in Lancaster Castle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{meant to}} be honest, while this man has always {{meant to be}} dishonest. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{intended}} to serve your country, and have wished to work for it. But you cannot expect that it should all be roses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was one of}} Charley's queer jokes. I {{told you}} to beware of him. Flo is married, yes--and very happy.... I'm unutterably happy, too--but I'm not married. Lee Stanton was the lucky bridegroom.... Carley, the moment <b>I</b> saw <b>you</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> come back to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{the power}} to {{restrain}} them, Beatrice. You {{have no right to}} talk of being run away with, as if you were helpless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} have, sir. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a deep fatherly love for him, and {{therefore}} I sent {{to speak to you}} as a dying woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why {{all this}} concealment?" [...] cried Amy. [...] "Why play jokes on us? You look so worried <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not {{told me all}} you know or fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a good idea," [...] said Mr. Wrenn. It had, apparently, been ordained {{that he was}} {{to write}} it. They were now {{settling}} important details. So when Nelly cried, [...] "I think it's just a fine idea; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> lots of imagination," [...] Tom interrupted her with: ...|$|R
60|$|FIFTH CONSP. Parbleu, Mons. le President, <b>I</b> never <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> one.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My poor child, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{not been}} well. They {{do not know}} how to take care of you, Lily, and I shall take you in hand. I am going to order the horses, and we will have a gallop over the Downs, and put a little colour into your cheeks.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> Betty. You {{have done}} wonderfully well {{here in this}} dead place. But tell me, don't be angry, don't you think too much of some one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Go away, you yellow devil. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{come to take}} me to hell, but you are too soon, and if {{my hands}} were loose I would twist your head off your shoulders.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{you wanted}} to warn me? Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know!</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> stood between me and trouble before, but this job was too big. It was not your pluck that failed; you knew my obstinacy----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give me your hand, Gar'ner. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{the clear}} stuff in you, {{and that it}} would make itself seen at the proper moment. I trust that Providence will favour us--it's really a pity to lose as fine a day as this; {{especially}} as the crittur's are coming up on the rocks to bask, something like old times!" ...|$|R
60|$|Not at all. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> {{sent for}} me in that fashion without good cause.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Lena, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a great shock, {{which made}} the more {{impression}} because you were such a child; but you might almost as well forswear riding, as men who have run a few horses, or staked a few thousands. Every young man of fortune has done so in his turn, just by way of experiment--as a social duty as often as not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'The Idylls of the King.' My good man, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a soul {{which would}} be {{considered}} inadequate by a common earthworm but you have surely heard of Tennyson's 'Idylls of the King?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Madge, Madge, it can't be true. I don't believe it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{not done}} this awful thing. No {{daughter}} of mine could {{be guilty of}} such wickedness. I refuse to believe my ears-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Merton groaned. 'I bar the fellow, anyhow,' he said. 'But, in any case, {{now that}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> found me out, I must be going. If only she were as poor as I am!' ...|$|E
6000|$|HESTER. <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> heard it. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> {{would agree}} with me. A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn't she? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{swear to}} you that now, at this instant, I see you {{precisely}} as you are. No one <b>has</b> ever <b>known</b> <b>you</b> as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you....</b> Could <b>you</b> <b>have</b> taken down that book just now if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>known</b> you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Trick. No, I am {{prepared}} for any foolish freak of yours: <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> a qualm, {{when you came}} to settlement.|$|R
