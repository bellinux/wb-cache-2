Brian is now a miserable, single dog, unable even to go back to Lauren, who has dumped him because he gave her worms.|$|E

McEnroe won the first two sets, but Lendl's adjustments of using more topspin lobs and cross-court backhand passing shots, as well as McEnroe's fatigue and temperamental outbursts, resulted in a demoralizing five-set loss. In his autobiography, McEnroe described this as his most bitter defeat and implied that he's never quite <b>gotten</b> <b>over</b> it.|$|E
