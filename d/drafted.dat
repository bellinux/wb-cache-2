The longitudinal force that the <b>draft</b> gear absorbs usually {{leads to the}} failure of its components, especially, the load bearing <b>draft</b> pads. Dynamic behaviour of an individual <b>draft</b> pad and a <b>draft</b> gear is determined and characterized with exciting frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. The effect of compressive prestress load on the dynamic behaviour of an individual <b>draft</b> pad is also determined as the <b>draft</b> pads in assembled state are under constant axial compressive force in the <b>draft</b> gear. The vibration characteristics of individual <b>draft</b> pad are compared with <b>draft</b> pads that are part of <b>draft</b> gear. The modal analysis gives us a basis for subjecting a <b>draft</b> pad to higher frequency loading for determining its fatigue behaviour.|$|R

The <b>draft</b> gear consists of six <b>draft</b> pads which are assembled in series (one above another) and are always under a constant axial compressive prestress in unloaded condition. Prestress influences {{the values of}} the stiffness matrix by causing stress stiffening and affects the response frequencies of the system thus impacting its modal responses [9]. The <b>draft</b> pad consists of a rubber compound/elastomer along with two steel plates. The modal behaviour of <b>draft</b> pad and <b>draft</b> gear assumes significance as it is necessary to identify frequencies at which fatigue failure of <b>draft</b> pads can occur.

The vibration excitation of an individual <b>draft</b> pad has been compared with the dynamics of <b>draft</b> pads in the <b>draft</b> gear for identifying various frequencies for a given mode shape.|$|R
