5|$|After {{taking the}} Family Portrait series of images, which {{included}} Pale Blue Dot, NASA mission managers commanded Voyager 1 to power its cameras down, as the spacecraft was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> near anything else of {{significance for the}} rest of its mission, while other instruments that were still collecting data needed power for the long journey to interstellar space.|$|E
500|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} version of events was that Richardson had contracted flu during the tour and asked Waylon Jennings for his seat on the plane. When Holly learned that Jennings was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly,</b> he said in jest: [...] "Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up." [...] Jennings responded: [...] "Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes", a humorous but ill-fated response that haunted him {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
500|$|The {{first officer}} {{said it was}} [...] "just like we lost lift." [...] As the captain {{attempted}} to level the wings, the crew used right rudder to manoeuvre the aircraft back toward the ground and avoid the water below. The accident report found that [...] "the first officer said that they seemed {{to agree that the}} airplane was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> and that their control inputs were in unison." [...] Rachuba and Majure continued to try to hold the nose up to impact in a flat attitude, although Rachuba later stated that there were no [...] "heavy control inputs." [...] The final report further noted that [...] "first officer stated that he did not touch the power levers." [...] The first officer later told investigators that the flight crew's primary focus was to find a safe place to land.|$|E

5000|$|In flashback, Harry {{remembers how}} he [...] "used {{to take her}} home in his car" [...] and also how they [...] "learned about love {{in the back of a}} Dodge," [...] adding, [...] "The lesson hadn't gone too far." [...] Sue had wanted to be an actress, while Harry was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> (hinting at Chapin's earlier real-life {{experience}} at the United States Air Force Academy). Their relationship ended when Sue [...] "took off to find the footlights" [...] and Harry [...] "took off to find the sky." ...|$|R
25|$|Wardley progressed <b>to</b> jet aircraft, <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, Boeing 727 and Boeing 737 with Ansett Airlines. She {{was one of}} 1,640 {{pilots who}} {{resigned}} en masse following the 1989 Australian pilots' dispute. She briefly returned to teaching and had her first child, Thomas, in January 1991. She published her autobiography in 1992.|$|R
500|$|On April 5, 1967, {{the same}} day the Apollo1 {{investigation}} released its report on the fire, Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Deke Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, [...] "The guys who are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> the first lunar missions are the guys in this room." [...] According to Eugene Cernan, Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module-Command/Service Module combination. After design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), Apollo9 and Apollo8 swapped crews. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong would command Apollo11.|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|About 45 {{minutes after}} the plane {{departed}} Manila with 153 passengers and crew aboard for the final leg of its trip to Saigon, a 24-year-old South Vietnamese native, Nguyen Thai Binh, passed a note to a flight attendant that stated in English, [...] "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> me to Hanoi and this airplane will be destroyed when we get there." [...] Binh, {{who claimed to be}} North Vietnamese, also took another flight attendant hostage. The note was conveyed to the flight's 53-year-old captain, Eugene Vaughn.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, {{to promote}} her latest film Vampires Suck, Anneliese van der Pol {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} that a That's So Raven film had been written but failed to go into production. [...] "The storyline saw us going to France. [...] was going to start a fashion line in France. Eddie and [...] were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> out and meet her. Of course, something tragic happens. We have to rescue the situation." [...] Van der Pol admitted that Raven's schedule at the time was booked solid for a year and the possibility of the film seemed unlikely. [...] "But no, It's not ever happening. If I hear something, I {{will be the first to}} sign on." [...] She also commented on reprising her role of Chelsea Daniels.|$|E
2500|$|One {{peculiar}} attitude reserved {{only to the}} pelican, is the pelican in her piety. The Heraldic pelican, {{one of the few}} female beasts in heraldry, {{is shown}} with a sharp stork-like beak, which it uses to vuln ("pierce or wound") her own breast. This is per the Bestiary myth that a female pelican wounded herself thus to feed her chicks. This symbol of sacrifice carries a particular religious meaning (usually a reference to Christ's sacrifice), and became so popular in heraldry that pelicans rarely exist in heraldry in any other position. A distinction is sometimes observed, however, between a pelican [...] "vulning herself" [...] (alone, piercing her breast) and [...] "in her piety" [...] (surrounded by and feeding her chicks). The Pelican is shown exclusively in profile perched in her nest with her wings either Addorsed and Inverted (because it is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> away) or Overt.|$|E
2500|$|The Eisenhower Administration {{wanted to}} see regime change in Cuba after its {{communist}} revolution in 1959. [...] In the summer of 1960, the CIA obtained fifteen World War II B-26 Invader medium bombers from storage at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona and had them refurbished. [...] To fly these aircraft, Cuban exile pilots needed to be trained in their operations. [...] Searching for B-26 instructors and maintenance personnel, [...] the CIA became aware of an organization that had exactly the people it needed: The Alabama Air National Guard. [...] Specifically, the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron at Birmingham was the last Air National Guard organization to fly the B-26, having retired its old bombers just three years earlier in 1957. [...] Working discreetly through the Alabama Adjutant General's office, the Air Commando Major attached to the CIA (who {{was born and raised}} in Alabama) made arrangements for some Alabama ANG pilots and maintenance crews to train the Cubans in the B-26. [...] In less than two months, eighty American instructors were transported to a secret CIA air base at Puerto Cabezas Airport, Nicaragua, to begin training the Cuban exiles. [...] Both B-26 ground attack missions along with C-46 paratrooper training for the exile's airborne forces were emphasized. [...] The Alabama ANG instructor pilots were told prior to volunteering that their primary mission was to train Cuban exile aircrews; they were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> in combat unless it was a last resort.|$|E

After the two decide to skip out on school {{to go on}} a special surfing expedition with friends for their 18th birthday, the twins are expelled from their high school for truancy. Their father Elton Deedle (Eric Braeden) has become tired of their insolence and lazy lifestyle and thus decides to ship them to a boot camp to straighten them out.

5000|$|The wing is the {{successor}} organization to the World War II Eighth Air Force 303d Bombardment Group. The group {{was one of}} the first VIII Bomber Command B-17 Flying Fortress units in England. The [...] "Hell's Angels" [...] were the first B-17 group to complete 25 combat missions in June 1943, <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> more than 300 combat missions, more than any other group. The 359th BS B-17F 41-24605 [...] "Knock-out Dropper" [...] was the first aircraft in Eighth Air Force to complete 50, then 75 missions.|$|R
2500|$|In 1911, {{he set out}} {{to build}} his first {{airplane}}, an airplane he named [...] "Silverwing". His first design was a monoplane, constructed of spruce and linen and which took the form of an American version of the Bleriot XI. The engine was a modified Elbridge motorboat motor, dubbed the [...] "aero special", which was a 2-stroke, 4-cylinder engine with a maximum of [...] and 1,050rpm. Upon completion, he sought to test the aircraft at the Great Salt Plains (adjacent to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge) in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. His first attempt at flight ended in a ground loop, which required $100 to repair. After repairs, Cessna attempted flight 13 more times, each time ending in some sort of failure. Finally on his 13th attempt, Cessna got a glimpse of hope as his aircraft bounced up into the air for a short time before crashing into the trees as he attempted to turn it. After his crash, Cessna exclaimed in frustration, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> this thing, then I'm going to set it afire and never have another thing to do with aeroplanes!". Finally, in June 1911 Cessna had his first successful flight. The crowds that had scoffed at his failures changed their tone and began calling him a [...] "daring hero" [...] and nicknamed him the [...] "Birdman of Enid". Cessna continued to teach himself how to fly {{over the next several months}} until December 1911, when he made a successful [...] flight and a successful landing at the point of departure. He was the first person to build and fly an airplane in the Heartland of the United States—between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.|$|E

These studies were then parroted back through the devices, further convincing the Elf managers that the devices worked.|$|R
5|$|An early {{plan for}} STS-8, {{released}} in April 1982, had scheduled it for July 1983. It {{was expected to}} be a three-day mission with four crew members, and would launch INSAT-1-B, an Indian satellite, and TDRS-B, a NASA communications relay satellite. However, following problems with the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) used to deploy TDRS-A on the STS-6 mission, it was announced in May 1983 that the TDRS was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>flown.</b> It was replaced in the manifest by the Payload Flight Test Article. After re-development of the IUS, TDRS-B was eventually re-manifested for the STS-51-L mission, and was lost along with the Space Shuttle Challenger and its crew when the launch failed in January 1986.|$|R

60|$|The Chimæra, by this time, {{after losing}} its second head, had {{got into a}} red-hot passion of pain and rampant rage.

At their approach it shot out a tremendous blast of its fiery breath, and enveloped Bellerophon and his steed in a perfect atmosphere of flame, singeing the wings of Pegasus, scorching off one whole side of the young man's golden ringlets, and making them both far hotter than was comfortable, from head to foot.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} playground swings, a Russian swing has steel bars {{instead of}} ropes, and its swinging platform {{is able to}} rotate 360 degrees around the horizontal bar from which it is suspended. Two or more acrobats stand on the swing platform, pumping {{it back and forth}} until it is swinging in high arcs. This motion increases the centrifugal force of the flyer (the acrobat who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> jump). The <b>flyer</b> then lets go of the swing at the peak of its arc, gaining enough altitude to execute one of various aerial flips before landing at a distance from the swing.
