5000|$|<b>Interfacial</b> <b>Seal</b> is an {{elastomeric}} seal for mated connectors {{and their}} individual contacts. [...] "Cork & bottle" [...] seals feature a raised shoulder around each pin contact that compresses into a corresponding {{hole on the}} socket contact insulator.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} {{research}} was to assess if the different stratification techniques could influence the marginal gap in V class restoration. Material and methods: Standard 6  ×  4  ×  4  mm class V cavities were prepared on the buccal side of 24 extracted sound human premolars. Specimens were randomly divided in two groups: (A) Bulk filling technique; (B) Wedge-shape layering technique. The <b>interfacial</b> <b>sealing</b> ability of the stratification techniques was evaluated by scoring the 7 % methylene blue penetration depth through optical microscope observations. The infiltration assessment was performed with a progressive score. Differences in infiltration scores recorded for the tested techniques were evaluated for statistical significance (Mann–Whitney U test, p <  0. 05). Results: The A group showed a mean score of 1. 166  ±  1. 114, registering the higher score of 3; the B group the mean score was 0. 666  ±  0. 778, and a higher score of 2. The two tails Mann–Whitney analysis showed a 0. 270 non-significant result. Conclusion: Considering the limitation related to the technique used for the infiltration analysis in small V class cavities, the infiltration score is not influenced by the different stratification techniques...|$|R

[...] "Environmental" [...] components typically use gaskets, grommets, potting materials or <b>interfacial</b> and O-ring <b>seals</b> to prevent the penetration of foreign substances {{into the body of}} the part.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this work is to {{formulate}} an analytical model of the heat transfer phenomena in deep submergence submarine shaft seals. It is expected that this will prove useful to design engineers in determining materials and. arrangement specifications for these <b>seals.</b> <b>Interfacial</b> temperature data derived from a comprehen-sive experimental Investigation is compared with thermal results computed from a lumped model of the shaft seal. This latter analytical data Is obtained by first defining the model, then calculating the heat source component in-puts, and finally utilizing an IBM 7094 computer to aid in solution of the resulting mathematical entanglements. It {{was found that the}} most significant factor in the overall heat transfer scheme is the quantity of bypass cool...|$|R
