5|$|Development {{began in}} early 2014, and {{prompted}} skepticism from both Square Enix staff and its prospective platform managers, {{who were more}} used to the dominant 2D-based mobile games. One of the problems cited by project leader Naoki Hamaguchi was creating realistic facial expressions equivalent to those used in the 2013 film <b>Frozen.</b> <b>For</b> development, the team used the Unity game engine. The development team built {{a relationship with the}} team at Unity Technologies very early in the development of Unity 5 and this allowed them to have their opinions included in the engine. Despite being dependent on the Unity 5 engine, the team also customised the game editor portion themselves. The team needed to take differences between different phone models into account to allow high performance. To help with development and overcome potential difficulties handling the Unity engine, a special development environment and structure was created. The team used physically based rendering to create realistic lighting and environmental effects. The budget was far lower than graphically equivalent console titles, so the team were reluctant to buy in helping tools and had restrictions on staff numbers: one person was working on all the game's backgrounds, while three were in charge of character designs. Using experience from the development of Final Fantasy XIII, the team were able to create high-end graphics within mobile restrictions.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{preparation}} method pioneered by the Royal Ontario Museum removes all bones {{for a complete}} skeleton while also producing a round skin without bill or legs (called a ROM, though if one set of wing and leg bones remain with the skin the preparation is called a shmoo in North America). Alternatively, the entire bird (or any soft parts associated with preparations described above) may be preserved in alcohol. For any of these methods, several supplemental preparations may be made. For example, a wing may be removed and preserved separately as a spread wing for better study of flight feathers; a tissue sample may be removed and <b>frozen</b> <b>for</b> molecular analyses; or a recording of the bird's song before collection may be archived. Neither molecular samples nor sound recordings require a bird to be collected (killed). Finally, if the bird is too rotten for the skin and feathers to be preserved, {{as is the case}} with some salvaged specimens, the skeleton alone may be preserved. Dried tissue is removed from skeletons by using dermestid beetle larvae (genus Dermestes). Whereas in the past arsenic was routinely added to skins to protect them from destruction by insects, specimens prepared today are generally protected by an initial freezing period to kill insects and their eggs followed by keeping them in high-quality museum cases in a climate-controlled room. Each specimen has data associated with it, and the amount of data available is usually directly correlated with the specimen’s scientific value. Most specimens are of little value for research without accompanying information, such as the time and place the bird was found or collected. This and other important information, such as mass, sex, fat deposition, and degree of skull ossification, is written on a label along with a unique field and museum number. Modern computerized museum databases include all of this information for each specimen, as well as the types of methods used to prepare the bird. Modern collections seek to maximize the utility of each preserved individual, and this includes recording detailed information about it. Most modern specimens also include a tissue sample preserved for genetic study. Online access to collections’ data is becoming increasingly available, and a cross-institutional database covering millions of computerized bird records is in development.|$|E

The comic will often make more use of supporting or minor characters than the series, such as Zapp Brannigan, Cubert Farnsworth, the Robot Devil and Inez Wong.|$|E
25|$|A dozen seas, part of {{the water}} systems of three oceansthe Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacificwashed Soviet shores. More than {{two thirds of the}} borders were seacoast, the world's longest coastal boundary; {{more than two-thirds of the}} coast was well above the Arctic Circle. With the {{important}} exception of Murmansk, which received the warm currents of the Gulf Stream, all the coast north of the Arctic Circle was locked in ice, <b>frozen</b> <b>for</b> up to ten months each year. Access to the world's oceans was both difficult and expensive.|$|E

25|$|Tibetan {{medicine}} {{developed a}} rather sophisticated knowledge of anatomy, acquired from long-standing experience with human dissection. Tibetans had adopted {{the practice of}} sky burial because of the country's hard ground, <b>frozen</b> <b>for</b> most of the year, {{and the lack of}} wood for cremation. A sky burial begins with a ritual dissection of the deceased, and is followed by the feeding of the parts to vultures on the hill tops. Over time, Tibetan anatomical knowledge found its way into Ayurveda {{and to a lesser extent}} into Chinese medicine.|$|E
25|$|Futurama is an American {{animated}} {{science fiction}} comedy series created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series follows {{the adventures of}} a late-20th-century New York City pizza delivery boy, Philip J. Fry, who, after being unwittingly cryogenically <b>frozen</b> <b>for</b> one thousand years, finds employment at Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company in the retro-futuristic 31st century. The series was envisioned by Groening in the mid-1990s while working on The Simpsons; he later brought David X. Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.|$|E

After that, the buttermilk pancake mix is stirred with {{the water in a}} mixing bowl. The oreo cookies are dipped in the mixture, making sure the oreo is fully covered with the batter. The coated oreo cookies are then dropped into hot oil until the cookies turn golden brown. The cookies are removed from the oil and placed on a sheet pan with paper towels for draining the excessive oil. In the meantime, the tops of the fried oreos are dusted with confectioners sugar.|$|E
25|$|Frozen {{water is}} {{found on the}} Earth’s surface {{primarily}} as snow cover, freshwater ice in lakes and rivers, sea ice, glaciers, ice sheets, and frozen ground and permafrost (permanently frozen ground). The residence time of water {{in each of these}} cryospheric sub-systems varies widely. Snow cover and freshwater ice are essentially seasonal, and most sea ice, except for ice in the central Arctic, lasts only a few years if it is not seasonal. A given water particle in glaciers, ice sheets, or ground ice, however, may remain <b>frozen</b> <b>for</b> 10-100,000 years or longer, and deep ice in parts of East Antarctica may have an age approaching 1 million years.|$|E
25|$|This impasse {{continued}} {{for nearly a}} century until the Movellans finally develop a weapon capable of breaking it – a highly virulent biological agent that targets Daleks. In Resurrection of the Daleks (1984), having lost the war, the Daleks rescue Davros from the human prison station where he had been <b>frozen</b> <b>for</b> ninety years and demand that he develop a defence against the disease. This time, it is Davros who double-crosses the Daleks, deciding to take personal command of the Dalek race rather than merely serving it. Davros' continuing influence eventually leads to a schism among the Daleks, with one faction following Davros' leadership and another rejecting their creator to instead follow the Supreme Dalek.|$|E

Luna was a former {{employee}} of the restaurant. In April 2002, the Palatine Police Department matched a DNA sample from Luna {{to a sample of}} saliva from a piece of partially eaten chicken found in the garbage during the crime scene investigation. The chicken was kept in a freezer for most of the time since the crime; testimony at trial indicated it was not <b>frozen</b> <b>for</b> several days after discovery, and was allowed to thaw several times for examination and testing, in the hope of an eventual match via increasingly sophisticated testing methods not available in 1993.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be <b>frozen</b> <b>for</b> up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
25|$|It {{took several}} months to clear the debris. People of all classes were forced to help; {{they were forced to}} provide wagons and horses, and some were {{recruited}} for labour. To speed reconstruction, restrictions were lifted and foreign workers were allowed to come to the city and freely work in reconstruction for a period of two years, although all workers were forbidden to demand higher wages than they had received before the bombardment. The governor ordered free entry into the city of building supplies, and the prices were to be <b>frozen</b> <b>for</b> two years. By opening Brussels to the outside commercially, the guilds' monopoly was renounced and opportunities for profiting of the disaster were reduced, in order to bring the city back to normal as quickly as possible.|$|E
