5|$|In May or June 1820, Anna Cooke, an {{unmarried}} planter's daughter {{in her early}} 30s, claimed that Sharp {{was the father of}} her illegitimate child; Sharp denied her claim. The stillborn child was rumored to have <b>dark</b> <b>skin,</b> and some speculated that it was a mulatto, with a black father. After her father's death and the sale of their plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, Cooke had moved with her mother and siblings to Warren County between 1805 and 1810, when she may have met Sharp. In addition to losing the child, Cooke suffered the deaths of three of her five brothers between 1818 and 1821.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{production}} was tumultuous. Chettiar opposed casting Rajinikanth as the protagonist {{because of his}} <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> and typecasting as a villain at the time, but Mahendran refused to direct the film without the actor and Chettiar capitulated. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, cinematographer Balu Mahendra (a director himself) assisted Mahendran with the screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. The film significantly deviates from the novel, with Mahendran having read {{only a part of}} it. Filming lasted for roughly 30 days, and primarily took place in Sringeri. Chettiar was surprised that the finished film had less dialogue than visuals, which he did not expect from Mahendran.|$|E

5|$|The white lion {{is not a}} {{distinct}} subspecies, but a special morph with a genetic condition, leucism, that causes paler colouration akin {{to that of the}} white tiger; the condition is similar to melanism, which causes <b>dark</b> <b>skin.</b> They are not albinos, but have normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lion individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in captivity, where breeders deliberately select them. The unusual cream colour of their coats is caused by a recessive allele. Reportedly, they have been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a Company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a {{sanctuary}} then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very <b>dark</b> <b>skin,</b> sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> pigmentation {{is believed to}} have begun around 1.2 million years ago, in light-skinned early hominid species after they moved from the equatorial rainforest to the sunny savannas. In the heat of the savannas, better cooling mechanisms were required, which were achieved through the loss of body hair and development of more efficient perspiration. The loss of body hair {{led to the development of}} <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> pigmentation, which acted as a mechanism of natural selection against folate depletion, and to a lesser extent, DNA damage. The primary factor contributing to the {{evolution of}} <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> pigmentation was the breakdown of folate in reaction to ultraviolet radiation; the relationship between folate breakdown induced by ultraviolet radiation and reduced fitness as a failure of normal embryogenesis and spermatogenesis led to the selection of <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> pigmentation. By the time modern Homo sapiens evolved, all humans were dark-skinned.|$|E
25|$|An {{abundance}} of clinical and epidemiological evidence supports that light skin pigmentation developed {{due to the}} importance of maintaining vitamin D3 production in the skin. <b>Dark</b> <b>skin</b> pigmentation was the original condition for the genus Homo and has been maintained for populations in areas of high UV radiation through human evolutionary history. As a consequence, {{there must have been a}} strong selective pressure for the evolution of light skin in areas of low UV radiation. The evidence that <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> evolved as a protection against the effect of UV radiation is overwhelming, and research shows that eumelanin protects against both folate depletion and direct damage to DNA. This accounts for the development of <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> pigmentation of people living near the equator but does not account for the increasingly lighter-skinned people living outside the tropics.|$|E
25|$|The {{resistance}} to cold injury hypothesis claimed that <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> was selected against in cold climates far from the equator and in higher altitudes as <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> was more affected by frostbite. It {{has been found that}} reaction of the skin to extreme cold climates has actually more to do with other aspects, such as the distribution of connective tissue and distribution of fat, and with the responsiveness of peripheral capillaries to differences in temperature, and not with pigmentation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>skin</b> offers great {{protection}} against UVR {{because of its}} eumelanin content, the UVR-absorbing capabilities of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought {{to the surface of}} the skin from the depths of the epidermis. For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. Keratocytes from <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a melanosome distribution pattern characteristic of <b>dark</b> <b>skin.</b> Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly pigmented skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly pigmented skin, it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better {{protection against}} sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. Darkly pigmented skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on Langerhans cells. The stratum corneum of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more cornified cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} {{naturally}} occurring <b>dark</b> <b>skin,</b> the tanning occurs with the dramatic mobilization of melanin upward in the epidermis and continues {{with the increased}} production of melanin. This accounts {{for the fact that}} dark-skinned people get visibly darker after one or two weeks of sun exposure, and then lose their colour after months when they stay out of the sun. Darkly pigmented people tend to exhibit less signs of aging in their skin than the lightly pigmented because their <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> protects them from most photoaging.|$|E

25|$|All {{modern humans}} {{share a common}} {{ancestor}} who lived around 200,000 years ago in Africa. Comparisons between known skin pigmentation genes in chimpanzees and modern Africans show that <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> evolved along {{with the loss of}} body hair about 1.2 million years ago and that this common ancestor had <b>dark</b> <b>skin.</b> Investigations into dark skinned populations in South Asia and Melanesia indicate that skin pigmentation in these populations is due to the preservation of this ancestral state and not due to new variations on a previously lightened population.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to natural}} selection, {{people who lived}} in areas of intense {{sunlight}} developed <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> colouration to protect against ultraviolet light and to protect their body mainly from folate depletion. Evolutionary pigmentation of the skin was caused by Ultraviolet Radiation (UV) of the sun. As hominids gradually lost their fur between 4.5 and 2 million years ago, to allow for better cooling through sweating, their naked and lightly pigmented skin was exposed to sunlight. In the tropics, natural selection favoured dark-skinned human populations as high levels of skin pigmentation protected against the harmful effects of sunlight. Indigenous populations’ skin reflectance (the amount of sunlight the skin reflects) and the actual UV radiation in a particular geographic area is highly correlated, which supports this idea. Genetic evidence also supports this notion, demonstrating that around 1.2 million years ago there was a strong evolutionary pressure which acted on the development of <b>dark</b> <b>skin</b> pigmentation in early members of the genus Homo. The effect of sunlight on folic acid levels has been crucial in the development of <b>dark</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E

25|$|Dark-skinned {{humans have}} high amount of melanin {{found in their}} skin. Melanin is {{derivative}} of the amino acid tyrosine. Eumelanin is the dominant form of melanin found in human skin.
