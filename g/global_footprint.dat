25|$|Ecological {{footprint}} accounting, {{based on}} the biological concept of carrying capacity, tracks the amount of land and water area a human population, needed to produce the resources the population consumes and to absorb its waste, under prevailing technology.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of global value chains on energy {{footprints}}. Energy footprints are consumption-based indicators which record the energy used to produce a country's final demand. In order to disentangle key characteristics of global value chains and their effects on the <b>global</b> energy <b>footprint,</b> we employ structural decomposition analyses (SDA). Furthermore, the analysis combines a retrospective with a prospective SDA approach. After {{an analysis of the}} <b>global</b> energy <b>footprint</b> for the period between 1995 and 2009, we discuss three scenarios of international integration and their implications for energy footprints for the period from 2009 to 2030. Our results show that the <b>global</b> energy <b>footprint</b> has increased by 29. 4 % from 1995 to 2009, and the scenarios indicate that it will increase by another 23. 5 % until 2030. Economic activity is the most important driver for the increase in energy footprints. Rising final demand alone would have increased the <b>global</b> energy <b>footprint</b> by 47. 0 % between 1995 and 2009. The composition of countries from where consumption and investment goods come adds another 12. 6 %. Sectoral energy intensity reductions are the most important decelerator of energy use (- 27. 8 %). There is a substantial contribution of changing global value chains on the rise in the <b>global</b> energy <b>footprint</b> (7. 5 %) : Stronger backward linkages in global value chains increased the <b>global</b> energy <b>footprint</b> by 5. 5 % between 1995 and 2009. Changes in the regional composition of intermediate inputs raised it by another 1. 8 %. The shift of the world economy towards East Asia alone would have increased the <b>global</b> energy <b>footprint</b> by 3. 0 %. The sectoral composition of global value chains, on the other hand, had a negligible effect on energy footprints...|$|R
25|$|A {{large and}} still {{growing number of}} {{attempts}} to create aggregate measures of various aspects of sustainability created a stable of indices that provide a more nuanced perspective on development than economic aggregates such as GDP. Some {{of the most prominent}} of these include the Human Development Index (HDI) of the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP); the Ecological footprint of <b>Global</b> <b>Footprint</b> Network and its partner organizations; the Environmental Sustainability Index(ESI) and the pilot Environmental Performance Index(EPI) reported under the World Economic Forum(WEF); or the Genuine Progress Index(GPI) calculated at the national or sub-national level. Parallel to these initiatives, political interest in producing a green GDP that would take at least the cost of pollution and natural capital depletion into account has grown, even if implementation is held back by the reluctance of policymakers and statistical services arising mostly from a concern about conceptual and technical challenges.|$|E
