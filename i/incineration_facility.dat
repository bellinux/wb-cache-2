25|$|Water, {{natural gas}} and {{electricity}} are provided to the municipalities of the Canton of Geneva by the state-owned Services Industriels de Genève (shortly SIG). Most of the drinkable water (80%) is extracted from the lake; the remaining 20% is provided by groundwater originally formed by infiltration from the Arve. 30% of the Canton's electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three hydroelectric dams on the Rhône (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is made from the heat induced by the burning of waste at the waste <b>incineration</b> <b>facility</b> of Les Cheneviers. The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by renewable methods, and in particular does not use electricity produced using nuclear reactors or fossil fuels.|$|E

40|$|Engineered {{nanomaterials}} (ENMs) {{can potentially}} be released during all waste treatment processes and can accumulate in residual materials, scrap materials, secondary raw materials or composts. Nonetheless, only few studies {{are available on}} the fate and behavior of ENMs during recycling and disposal. In Austria {{more than half of the}} waste produced by households is collected separately and undergoes further treatment as recoverables, biogenic waste, hazardous household waste or as waste electrical and electronic equipment. The remainder is processed either in waste <b>incineration</b> <b>facilities</b> or in mechanical-biological waste treatment facilities. Initial studies in waste <b>incineration</b> <b>facilities</b> show that thermally stable ENMs (metal oxides) accumulate mostly in the solid residues (slag, flue dust). In Austria, these are largely disposed of in residual-waste landfills. ENMs can also be released again during the recycling of products (for example quantum dots from LEDs of waste electrical and electronic equipment or CNTs made of composite materials). During recycling, nanosilver apparently negatively affects the mechanical properties of plastics. ENMs can be disposed of directly as production wastes, as components of “nanoproducts” or as secondary wastes such as ENM-containing sewage sludge or combustion residues. Worldwide, an estimated 60 to 86 % of the most commonly used ENMs end up in landfills. Currently, no generalized statements can be made because ENMs are applied in very diverse sectors and their fates in the environment can differ considerably...|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the war in 1918 the Gasplatz held about 48,000 tonnes of {{chemical}} munitions, several thousand tonnes {{of chemical}}ly-filled captured munitions and 40 tank wagons of unfilled chemicals. These supplies were sunk in the North Sea and the Baltic. During the preparations for this there was a tragic accident on 24 October 1919. A train laden with chemical weapons and munitions exploded. Apart from the Clarkwerk factory and the power station almost the entire facility was destroyed, a total of 42 buildings. Chemical grenades were catapulted for miles around and clouds of poison gas threatened the surrounding villages, some having to be evacuated. Many houses in the surrounding area were badly damaged. In addition to the immediate victims of the explosion there were numerous deaths in the months that followed. The terrain was supposed to be cleared by 1925. Roughly 1,000 workers combed the surface of the land out to a radius of 3 km from the explosion site. There was no detection equipment at that time. A considerable quantity of chemical munitions remained live. In 1921 the Hamburg firm of Stolzenberg took over the work that had been previously carried out by König and Evaporator AG. Stolzenberg established a chemical <b>incineration</b> <b>facility</b> and a site to convert chlorine gas and diphosgene. The latter installation exploded on being taken into service in April 1922. In spite of everything, clearance work was completed in 1925 and the remaining facilities were blown up at the behest of the Allies.|$|E
