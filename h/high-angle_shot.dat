25|$|During his 40-year career Bass {{worked for}} some of Hollywood's most {{prominent}} filmmakers, including Alfred Hitchcock, Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese. Among his most famous title sequences are the animated paper cut-out of a heroin addict's arm for Preminger's The Man with the Golden Arm, the credits racing up and down what eventually becomes a <b>high-angle</b> <b>shot</b> of a skyscraper in Hitchcock's North by Northwest, and the disjointed text that races together and apart in Psycho.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>high-angle</b> <b>shot</b> is a {{cinematic}} technique {{where the}} camera {{looks down on}} the subject from a high angle and the point of focus often gets [...] "swallowed up." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>High-angle</b> <b>shots</b> {{can make}} the subject seem {{vulnerable}} or powerless when applied with the correct mood, setting, and effects. In film, they {{can make the}} scene more dramatic. If there is a person at high elevation who is talking to someone below them, this shot is often used.|$|R
5000|$|An ultra lob wedge is a {{specialization}} of the lob wedge with {{an extremely}} high loft, {{as high as}} 70°. Synonyms are generally marketing terms and include the [...] "flop wedge" [...] and [...] "final wedge". When included in a club set, it generally has the highest loft of the set. It is used for specialized, extremely <b>high-angle</b> <b>shots</b> such as from the [...] "lip" [...] of a bunker. This wedge is generally made by specialty companies, and some argue that their purpose is redundant, as a regular lob wedge can be [...] "opened" [...] for extra loft in situations calling for such a high launch angle. However, these shots are very tricky to make as they require substantial changes to a player's normal swing mechanics.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the camera}} is placed in {{relation}} to the subject can affect the way the viewer perceives the subject. There are a number of camera angles, such as a <b>high-angle</b> <b>shot,</b> a low-angle shot, a bird's-eye view and a worm's-eye view. A Viewpoint is the apparent distance and angle from which the camera views and records the subject.|$|E

50|$|They {{also include}} the {{eye-level}} camera angle and {{the point of view}} shot. A <b>high-angle</b> <b>shot</b> (HA) is a shot in which the camera is physically higher than the subject and is looking down upon the subject. The high angle shot can make the subject look small or weak or vulnerable while a low-angle shot (LA) is taken from below the subject and has the power to make the subject look powerful or threatening. A neutral shot or eye-level (EL) shot has little to no psychological effect on the viewer. This shot is when the camera is level or looking straight on with the subject.|$|E
5000|$|An ultra lob wedge {{is used to}} hit a {{shot with}} higher and shorter {{trajectory}} than a standard lob wedge. This club is labeled [...] "UL" [...] and has a loft of about 64° and has the highest loft of any golf club. It is used for specialized, extremely <b>high-angle</b> <b>shots</b> such as from the [...] "lip" [...] of a bunker. This wedge is generally made by speciality companies and some argue that their purpose is redundant, as other wedges can be [...] "opened" [...] for extra loft in situations calling for such a high launch angle. Furthermore, to get consistent results, this club requires skill - in particular, distance judgement is always key with such a lofted club. It can be noted that different lengths of swing will often yield a similar distance but with varying trajectories and thus roll (on the green).|$|R
2500|$|Gilliam's {{films have}} a {{distinctive}} look, {{not only in}} mise-en-scène but even more so in photography, often recognisable from just a short clip; to create a surreal atmosphere of psychological unrest and a world out of balance, he frequently uses unusual camera angles, particularly low-angle <b>shots,</b> <b>high-angle</b> <b>shots,</b> and Dutch angles. Roger Ebert said that [...] "his world is always hallucinatory in its richness of detail." [...] Most of his movies are shot almost entirely with rectilinear ultra-wide-angle lenses with focal lengths of 28mm or less to achieve a distinctive style defined by extreme perspective distortion and extremely deep focus. Gilliam's long-time director of photography Nicola Pecorini has said, [...] "with Terry and me, a long lens means something between a 40mm and a 65mm." [...] This attitude markedly differs from the common definition in photography, by which 40 to 65mm is the focal length of a normal lens, resembling the natural human field of view, unlike Gilliam's signature style, defined by extreme perspective distortion due to his usual choice of focal length. The 14-mm lens has become informally known as [...] "The Gilliam" [...] among filmmakers because of his frequent use of it at least since Brazil. Gilliam has explained his preference for using wide-angle lenses in his films: ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between photography and architecture as a mutually constitutive one. Besides standing as subjects for the camera, buildings can also extend the photographer’s capability to depict the surrounding landscape. In the interwar period, this interplay was exploited by avant-garde photographers associated with the “New Vision” who used architecture as a viewing platform. Among them was Aleksander Rodchenko, whose experiments with <b>high-angle</b> <b>shots</b> {{were part of the}} wider project to construct a revolutionary visual language for Soviet art. Moscow was the theatre of this visual revolution. Eight decades later, Italian photographer Gabriele Basilico visited the Russian capital and produced a photo-book, Mosca Verticale, that references Rodchenko’s work in more than one way. Atypically, Basilico elevated the vue en plongée to his main framing device as he set out to depict the sprawling city from the Seven Sisters –the monumental high-rise towers built under Stalin between the late 1940 s and the mid 1950 s. Through considering Basilico’s words as well as his pictures, the essay unpacks the multiple layers that constitute Mosca Verticale. It draws connections not only with the work of Rodchenko but also with that of Russian “rooftoppers” who, in recent years, have raised the vertiginous representation of the city to new heights. As a cluster of “supertall” buildings redesigns its skyline, Moscow is once again the European epicentre of a particular type of interaction between photography and architecture, whereby the latter serves as a platform to visualise the dizzying spaces of the metropolis...|$|R
5000|$|The critic David Edelstein's affectionate {{comments}} on Jaws and its editing {{are also a}} good indication of the film's lasting influence 30 years after its release: Jaws {{is still one of}} my favorite movies. I didn't know I could be manipulated like that—so wittily, so teasingly, {{in a way that made}} me laugh at my own fear. (The only Hitchcock film I'd seen in a theater was Frenzy, which was too sick to appreciate in the same vein.) What clinched it was that unbelievably brilliant sequence that begins with a <b>high-angle</b> <b>shot</b> of Roy Scheider dropping fish entrails in the water as shark bait. He was resentful; he said to Shaw and Dreyfuss, [...] "Why don't you guys come down here and shovel some of this shit?" [...] And we started to laugh—he said [...] "shit!" [...] heh-heh—and then the head of the shark appeared in the water (no music, no foreshadowing), and I felt my mind detach from my body and my laugh turn into a shriek and merge into the collective shriek of everyone in that huge theater. I literally shook for the rest of the movie: Every cut by the late Verna Fields had me poised to leap out of my seat. (I really learned to appreciate editing from Jaws.) ...|$|E
30|$|In this section, the {{proposed}} approach {{is used to}} track vehicles on the road. In our experiments, the dataset is composed of video sequences which were obtained from a real surveillance camera. The camera is fixed on a pole in highway and has a <b>high-angle</b> <b>shot</b> {{to one side of}} a driveway. All the experiments were carried out on 640 × 480 pixel sequences with an Intel® Core™ Duo CPU T 7500 2.93 GHz PC. A real-life scenario, including partial occlusion, large-area occlusion in a short time and scale variation, is considered. We verify the performance of our approach via single and multiple vehicle target trackings. In the experiments, the length of each video sequence is 100 frames, and the number of particles is set to 50.|$|E
5000|$|Orson Welles' 1948 Macbeth, in the director's words a [...] "violently sketched {{charcoal}} {{drawing of a}} great play," [...] was filmed in only 23 days and on a budget of just $700,000. These filming conditions allowed only a single abstract set, and eclectic costumes. Dialogue was pre-recorded, enabling the actors to perform very long individual takes, including one of over ten minutes surrounding the death of Duncan. Welles himself played the central character, who dominates the film, measured both by his time on screen, and by physical presence: <b>high-angle</b> and low-angle <b>shots</b> and deep-focus close-ups are used to distort his size in comparison to other characters. Welles retained from his own 1936 stage production {{the image of a}} Voodoo doll controlling the fate of the central character: and at the end it is the doll we see beheaded. The film's allegorical aspect is heightened by Welles' introduction of a non-Shakespearean character, the Holy Father (played by Alan Napier), in opposition to the witches, speaking lines taken from Shakespeare's Ross, Angus and the Old Man. Contemporary reviews were largely negative, particularly criticising Welles' unsympathetic portrayal of the central character. Newsweek commented: [...] "His Macbeth is a static, two-dimensional creature as capable of evil in the first scene as in the final hours of his bloody reign." ...|$|R
