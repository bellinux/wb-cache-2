40|$|Abstract [...] The {{process of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> in the United Arab Emirates has been {{investigated}} in this study using multiple decision-making criteria. The objective {{was to assess the}} current situation and set out recommendations to improve <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> procedure. Inspected mechanical and environmental parameters have been compared among different inspection centers in the country. The assessment included inspection of both light and heavy vehicles as well as vehicles imported through ports. A set of surveys have been designed to collect information about the inspection process, opinion of the inspection technicians, public opinion, and opinion of <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> experts in the country. The study revealed significant differences among the inspection centers in the different Emirates and even within the same Emirate. It has been found that <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> forms are not uniform among the seven Emirates, with no Emirates Standards for vehicles safety and environmental <b>inspection.</b> Additionally, <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> equipments are not unified among the inspection centers and inspection of some important safety issues is not implemented. It was also found that there was no third-party auditing to assure quality control. Moreover, most of the customers did not abide to the rules of <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> and <b>vehicle</b> maintenance...|$|R

50|$|A track {{geometry}} car (also {{known as}} a track recording car) is an automated track <b>inspection</b> <b>vehicle</b> on a rail transport system used to test several geometric parameters of the track without obstructing normal railroad operations. Some of the parameters generally measured include position, curvature, alignment of the track, smoothness, and the crosslevel of the two rails. The cars {{use a variety of}} sensors, measuring systems, and data management systems to create a profile of the track being inspected.|$|E

In April 2010, a test vehicle collided with a rail <b>inspection</b> <b>vehicle,</b> causing it to crash into a station, parts of which collapsed onto the street below. In August 2010, a wheel falling from the vehicle on a test run injured a pedestrian. [...] In May 2012, a current collector fell off the train, although there were no injuries. In 2011, Joongang Daily reported that construction had been indefinitely suspended due to [...] "colossal corruption", and that what had been built was set to be demolished due to [...] "safety issues". [...] It was reported the system was not built to the specifications of the Urbanaut. [...] A technical inspection in May 2013 revealed numerous unresolved safety issues.
