5000|$|The 19th {{century was}} {{an era of}} rapidly {{accelerating}} scientific discovery and invention, with significant developments {{in the fields of}} mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, electricity, and metallurgy that laid the groundwork for the technological advances of the 20th century. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and spread to continental Europe, North America and Japan. [...] The Victorian era was notorious for the employment of young children in factories and mines, as well as strict social norms regarding modesty and gender roles. Japan embarked on a program of rapid modernization following the Meiji Restoration, before defeating China, under the Qing Dynasty, in the First Sino-Japanese War. Advances in medicine and the understanding of human anatomy and disease prevention took place in the 19th century, and were partly responsible for rapidly accelerating population growth in the western world. Europe's population doubled during the 19th century, from approximately 200 million to more than 400 million. The introduction of railroads provided the first major advancement in land transportation for centuries, changing the way people lived and obtained goods, and fuelling major urbanization movements in countries across the globe. Numerous cities worldwide surpassed populations of a million or more during this century. London became the world's largest city and capital of the British Empire. Its population increased from 1 million in 1800 to 6.7 million a century later. The last remaining undiscovered landmasses of Earth, including vast expanses of interior Africa and Asia, were explored during this century, and {{with the exception of the}} <b>extreme</b> <b>zones</b> of the Arctic and Antarctic, accurate and detailed maps of the globe were available by the 1890s.

40|$|Robotic devices can be {{potentially}} used {{to assist}} physical therapy treatments {{in order to}} restore musculoskeletal system malfunctions owing to neurological disorders. Cable actuated parallel robots, despite their obvious benefits such as enhanced workspace, light weight, and flexibility, are not popularly used in ankle rehabilitation treatments, due to their complex mechanism and cable actuation issues. In order to address these issues, it is recommended to carry out robot design optimization. However, design synthesis of the cable actuated parallel ankle robot calls for multi-objective optimization (MOO), since there are multiple and conflicting objectives to achieve. To acquire more choices between actuator forces, overall stiffness of robot (which is crucial for a cable based ankle robot) and other vital design objectives, it is required to explore the extreme ends of the Pareto Front (PF) more carefully. Existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) normally focus on the convergence and may not provide solutions at the extremities of PF. Capitalizing on this improvement opportunity, this paper presents a fuzzy based MOEA, namely, biased fuzzy sorting genetic algorithm (BFSGA) which encourages solutions in the <b>extreme</b> <b>zones</b> of the PF. It is shown in this paper that using proposed method, diversity in the populations is supported {{and in the process}} wider trade-off choices of objectives can be obtained. During ankle robot design optimization, crisp objectives are defined as fuzzy objectives and competing solutions are provided an overall activation score (OAS). Subsequently OAS is used to assign a fuzzy dominance ranking to the design solutions. It is found that the BFSGA approach performs well in exploring the <b>extreme</b> <b>zones</b> of the Pareto front, which are normally overlooked by other MOEA such as NSGA-II due to their inherent mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{innermost}} {{regions of}} radio loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) jets are heavily affected by synchrotron self-absorption, {{due to the}} strong magnetic fields and high particle densities in these <b>extreme</b> <b>zones.</b> The only way to overcome this absorption is to observe at sub-millimeter wavelengths, although polarimetric observations at such frequencies have so far been limited by sensitivity and calibration accuracy. However, new generation instruments such as the Atacama Large mm/sub-mm Array (ALMA) overcome these limitations and are starting to deliver revolutionary results in the observational studies of AGN polarimetry. Here we present an overview of our state-of-the-art interferometric mm/sub-mm polarization observations of AGN jets with ALMA (in particular, the gravitationally-lensed sources PKS 1830 - 211 and B 0218 + 359), which allow us to probe the magneto-ionic conditions at the regions closest to the central black holes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} one {{economically}} important Ramsar wetland system of India, Vembanad wetland system, is studied {{to determine the}} environmental pollution. Six surface sediment samples collected from two <b>extreme</b> <b>zones</b> of the wetland system were analyzed for heavy metals such as Copper, Zinc, Manganese, Cadmium, Lead, Nickel and Mercury. Highest metal concentration was found at industrial zone and lowest concentration was detected at southern upstream of the wetland system.

Comparison of the results with different sediment quality guidelines indicated ultra high degree of contamination in the industrial zone. The numerical value of degree of contamination, pollution load index, sum of toxic units, enrichment factor and geo-accumulation index confirmed the above fact. Based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration guidelines, the health of the ecosystem was seriously impaired with frequent occurring of biological effects in the industrial zone. The percentage of heavy metal calculated with respect to the industrial zone as the base line and the correlation analysis with organic matter indicated that, mobility of the specific metal has higher impact on its concentration at the fresh water region of the wetland...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAttempts to use {{many types}} of biofuel have been tried {{throughout}} the past. Waste cooking oils (WCO) represent attractive alternatives to edible fat and oils {{for the production of}} biodiesel fuel from different points of view: they are inexpensive feedstock for biodiesel production. At the same time, using this kind of feedstock eliminates food versus fuel competition. Finally, Their use supposes an environmentally friendly approach. Internal combustion engines operate correctly {{on a wide range of}} speeds and loads. However, only few studies on biodiesel fueled engines are undertaken for performance mapping. In the present study, the effects of entire operational range of speed/load on engine performance and emission levels of an engine are investigated when neat WCO biodiesel (B 100) and its blends (B 25) and (B 50) are used. The obtained results are compared to those of conventional diesel (B 0). The suitability of WCO biodiesel has been established by many researchers. However their results report a wide disparity on emission levels. Combustion characteristics, performance and emission maps will be performed to give appropriate indications explaining the divergence reported in literature. The map indicates that B 50 and B 25 exhibit similar trends of BSFC to diesel fuel, across the speed variation albeit with difference in response levels. Contrariwise B 100 shows an inverse behavior with speed increase. Results show also that Unburned Hydro-Carbons (UHC) emissions are highly correlated with engine speed. However, CO and PM emissions are extremely correlated with load and they are less sensitive to engine speed. NOx emissions are generally higher with biodiesel except some <b>extreme</b> <b>zones</b> of the map. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a topsoil compaction map, based on real-time measurement of the draught (D) of a compaction sensor provides a quick view of positions of extremely compacted zones. The measured D of a subsoiler, used as a compaction sensor was utilised to draw the two-dimensional spatial variation in soil compaction of a sandy loam field (Arenic Cambisol). On {{the basis of a}} previously developed formula, dry bulk density (rho(d)) indicating soil compaction was estimated {{as a function of the}} measured horizontal force, cutting depth (d) and moisture content (w). This formula was the output of a numerical-statistical hybrid modelling scheme, which aimed to estimate the variation in sensor D as a function of w, d and rho(d). The ARCVIEW 3. 1 GIS software was used to draw the field maps of measurement and model-based rho(d), d, w. The measurement and model-based rho(d) ranged from 1343 to 1750 and from 1271 to 1523 kg m(- 3), respectively. The model-based rho(d) was underestimated by a mean error of 14 %. A comparison of measurement and model-based rho(d) maps indicates a similar tendency of spatial variation in soil compaction, particularly positions of extremely compacted zones. This allows providing the farmer with a compaction map, which illustrates the <b>extreme</b> <b>zones</b> of soil compaction. A correction factor of 14 % in rho(d) is incorporated into the developed numerical-statistical model, which improved the magnitude of the model-based predicted soil compaction. Furthermore, the real-time measurement of w with better control of d might be helpful to improve the magnitude Of rho(d) predicted and spatial distribution of soil compaction. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.
