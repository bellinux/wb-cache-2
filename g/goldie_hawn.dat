Notable American Jewish Buddhists include: Robert Downey, Jr. Allen Ginsberg, <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn</b> and daughter Kate Hudson, Steven Seagal, Adam Yauch of the rap group The Beastie Boys, and Garry Shandling. Film makers the Coen Brothers have been influenced by Buddhism as well for a time.|$|E
25|$|Fisher {{made her}} film debut at age 18 as the precociously seductive {{character}} Lorna Karpf in the Columbia Pictures comedy Shampoo (1975). Lee Grant and Jack Warden {{play the role}} of her parents in the film. Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn</b> also star in the film. In 1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia in George Lucas' science-fiction film Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. At the time, she believed the script for Star Wars was fantastic, but did not expect many people to agree with her. Though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film.|$|E
25|$|After Hawn's Academy Award win, {{her film}} career took off. She starred {{in a string}} of above average and {{successful}} comedies starting with There's a Girl in My Soup (1970), $ (1971), and Butterflies Are Free (1972). She continued proving herself in the dramatic league with the 1974 satirical dramas The Girl from Petrovka and The Sugarland Express, and Shampoo in 1975. She also hosted two television specials: Pure Goldie in 1971 and The <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn</b> Special in 1978. The latter was a sort of comeback for Hawn, who had been out of the spotlight for two years since the 1976 release of The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox, while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, Zemeckis {{directed}} the black comedy Death Becomes Her, starring Meryl Streep, <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn</b> and Bruce Willis. Although his next film {{would have some}} comedic elements, it was Zemeckis's first with dramatic elements, and was also his biggest commercial success to date, Forrest Gump (1994). Starring Tom Hanks in the title role, and borrowing to some extent from Woody Allen's earlier Zelig, Forrest Gump {{tells the story of}} a man with a low I.Q., who unwittingly participates in some of the major events of the twentieth century, falls in love, and interacts with several major historical figures in the process. The film grossed $677 million worldwide and became the top grossing U.S. film of 1994; it won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (for Hanks) and Best Director (for Zemeckis). In 1997, Zemeckis directed Contact, a long-gestating project based on Carl Sagan's 1985 novel of the same name. The film centers on Eleanor Arroway, a scientist played by Jodie Foster, who believes she has made contact with extraterrestrial beings.|$|E
25|$|Her former friends aren't {{doing much}} better: Annie (Diane Keaton), meanwhile, is separated, {{suffering}} extreme self-esteem issues, {{and going through}} therapy with her husband. Brenda (Bette Midler) is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling financially. Elise (<b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn),</b> whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is now an aging alcoholic movie actress who has become a plastic-surgery addict to keep her career afloat. Shortly after Cynthia's funeral, at which the three remaining friends are reunited {{for the first time}} since college, Annie's husband, Aaron (Stephen Collins), leaves her for her younger therapist (Marcia Gay Harden) and asks her for a divorce after spending a night together (and leading Annie to believe it would reconcile them); Brenda has a rather unpleasant encounter at a clothing store with her ex, Morty (Dan Hedaya) and his younger and rather hateful mistress Shelly (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Elise finds out that her soon-to be ex-husband, Bill (Victor Garber), is requesting alimony and half of their marital assets claiming that Elise owes her fame to him. Also, during a meeting with a director for a possible leading lady movie role, she discovers that she is only to play the lead female's mother; she later learns the lead female is Bill's current girlfriend. Shortly thereafter, the three friends receive the letters that Cynthia mailed to them before her suicide. After each one reads her letter from Cynthia, and feeling that they have been taken for granted by their husbands, the women decide to create the First Wives Club, aiming to get revenge on their exes. Annie's lesbian daughter Chris (Jennifer Dundas) also gets in on the plan by asking for a job at her father's advertising agency so she can supply her mother with inside information, as payback for Aaron's unfairness toward Annie.|$|E
500|$|In late 1999, lead vocalist Chris Robinson began a {{relationship}} with Kate Hudson, which would influence subtly the lyrics on Lions. [...] The pair met at a Friday night party in Manhattan, {{which led to a}} Saturday stroll through Central Park and a Sunday move-in. [...] Their wedding at the Aspen, Colorado, ranch of Kurt Russell and Kate's mother, <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn,</b> followed on , 2000.|$|E
500|$|Also in January 1997, an {{open letter}} to then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared, {{published}} as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune, drawing parallels between the [...] "organized oppression" [...] of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies espoused by Germany in the 1930s. The letter was conceived and paid for by Hollywood lawyer Bertram Fields, whose clients have included Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. entertainment industry, including the top executives of MGM, Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal and Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn,</b> director Oliver Stone, writers Mario Puzo and Gore Vidal and talk-show host Larry King. It echoed similar parallels drawn by the Church of Scientology itself, which until then had received scant notice, and was followed by lobbying efforts of Scientology celebrities in Washington.|$|E
500|$|The {{radicals}} use a Spiro Agnew alarm clock, {{which is}} based on a real item. When Mr. Burns drives a tank towards the Simpson house, he is wearing oversized headgear. This is a reference to a public relations stunt by Michael Dukakis in 1988. When Mr. Burns plays a tape of [...] "Ride of the Valkyries", it has been recorded over by Smithers with [...] "Waterloo" [...] by ABBA, a reference to Smithers' implied homosexuality and to the helicopter beach attack scene in Apocalypse Now, in which [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] is famously played. Maggie is shown dancing in her diaper and covered in slogans in a parody of the filler scenes of Laugh-In in which <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn</b> and other female cast members like Ruth Buzzi and Jo Anne Worley danced in a bikini with slogans and drawings painted on their bodies. The two FBI agents are Joe Friday and Bill Gannon from Dragnet. Bill Gannon is voiced by Harry Morgan, the man who played Gannon in the original series.|$|E
500|$|Mansfield, Monroe and Barbara Windsor {{have been}} {{described}} as representations of a historical juncture of sexuality in comedy and popular culture. Academics also added Anita Ekberg and Bettie Page to the list of catalysts of the trend of exaggerated female sexuality, besides Mansfield and Monroe. M. Thomas Inge describes Mansfield, Monroe and Jane Russell as personification of the bad girl in popular culture. Monroe, Mansfield, Judy Holliday and <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn</b> are also identified to have established the stereotype of the [...] "dumb blonde", typified by their combination of overt sexuality and apparent inability to understand everyday life. Instead of the asexualized and virginal [...] "nice girls" [...] of earlier films, the pneumatic blonde bombshells took over the screen in the 1950s to become a cult that has been consistently emulated from that era onward. Social historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg described the 1950s as [...] "an era distinguished by its worship of full-breasted women" [...] and attributes the paradigm shift to Mansfield and Monroe. Patricia Vettel-Becker made that observation more specific by attributing the phenomenon to Playboy and the appearance of Mansfield and Monroe in the magazine.|$|E
500|$|After {{roles in}} the comedy-drama Postcards from the Edge (1990) and the comedy-fantasy Defending Your Life (1991), Streep starred with <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn</b> in farcical black comedy, Death Becomes Her (1992), with Bruce Willis as their co-star. Streep persuaded writer David Koepp to rewrite several of the scenes, {{particularly}} {{the one in which}} her character has an affair with a younger man, which she believed was [...] "unrealistically male" [...] in its conception. The seven-month shoot was the longest of Streep's career, during which she got into character by [...] "thinking about being slightly pissed off all of the time". Due to Streep's allergies to numerous cosmetics, special prosthetics had to be designed to age her by ten years to look 54, although Streep believed that they made her look nearer 70. Longworth considers Death Becomes Her to have been [...] "the most physical performance Streep had yet committed to screen, all broad weeping, smirking, and eye-rolling". Although it was a commercial success, earning $15.1million in just five days, Streep's contribution to comedy was generally not taken well by critics. [...] Times Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep's [...] "wicked-witch routine" [...] but dismissed the film as [...] "She-Devil with a make-over" [...] and one which [...] "hates women".|$|E
500|$|The book {{begins by}} briefly {{introducing}} {{the reader to}} Phillips in 1989, before quickly travelling back to her childhood in 1940s Brooklyn. It then covers her early life and first successes in the film industry: she and Michael earned $100,000 from their debut feature, Steelyard Blues, moved to Malibu, California, and had a daughter, Kate. The most notorious chapters follow as Phillips enjoys her greatest career successes, perhaps most infamously when she recalls the amalgam of drugs she was {{under the influence of}} on the night she won her Oscar ("a diet pill, a small amount of coke, two joints, six halves of Valium, and a glass and a half of wine"). She also reveals the personal peccadillos and vices of the biggest Hollywood A-listers of the day, including Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Richard Dreyfuss, <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn,</b> and David Geffen. Many of these people were pivotal figures in the emergence of New Hollywood in the 1960s and '70s, but Phillips disparagingly refers to them as [...] "a rogues' gallery of nerds". Later episodes in her life, including freebasing, and her abusive relationship with a violent drug addict which caused her to miss her own mother's funeral, are also discussed candidly.|$|E
500|$|After a cameo {{appearance}} in A Day at the Beach (1970), {{and a serious}} role later in 1970 as an ageing businessman who seduces Sinéad Cusack in Hoffman, Sellers starred in Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup opposite <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn.</b> According to The Times, the film was a major commercial success and became the seventh most popular film at the British box office in 1970. Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, considers that although Sellers favoured playing romantic roles, he [...] "was always more successful in parts that sent up his own vanities and pretensions, as with the TV presenter and narcissistic lothario [...] he played in There's a Girl in My Soup". The film {{was seen as a}} small revival of his career. However, Sellers's next films, including Rodney Amateau's Where Does It Hurt? (1972) and Peter Medak's Ghost in the Noonday Sun (1974), were again poorly received, and his acting was viewed as frenetic rather than funny. Despite these setbacks, Sellers won the Best Actor award at the 1973 Tehran Film Festival for his tragi-comedic role as a street performer in Anthony Simmons's The Optimists of Nine Elms. Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan believed that the early 1970s were for Sellers [...] "a period of indifference, and it would appear at one time that his career might have come to a conclusion". This was echoed by Sellers's biographer, Peter Evans, who notes that out of nine films in the period, three were never released and five had flopped, while only There's a Girl in My Soup had been a success. In his private life, he had been seeing the twenty-three-year-old model Miranda Quarry. The couple married on 24 August 1970, despite Sellers's private doubts—expressed to his agent, Dennis Selinger—about his decision to re-marry.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} favorable. Columnist Joan Crosby noted that [...] "This {{is the kind}} of show you don't think you'll laugh at, but you do, mostly because the cast is so good." [...] She noted that Cleavon Little, Joan Van Ark, and Reva Rose were, respectively, [...] "marvelous", [...] "pretty", and [...] "funny", and that Nancy Fox [...] "wins this year's cute-as-a-kitten award". Barbara Holsopple, TV and radio editor for the Pittsburgh Press, noted that [...] "ABC did a gutsy turnabout in taking the heavy drama out of a {{hospital}} and replacing it with comedy. The venture worked well, thanks to excellent performances from the Temperatures Rising cast". She [...] praised Albertson, noted that Whitmore [...] "was little seen", and that the series: [...] "{{is the kind of}} tidy little show that brings chuckles". Win Fanning, a syndicated columnist, stated that: [...] "the comedy writing and performances by a beautifully integrated cast give Temperatures a bright, light quality so seldom achieved in a situation comedy", and that it was: [...] "loaded with one-liners and sight gags, which, if kept on the level of the opener, promise many hours of hilarity". Fanning praised Little as [...] "one of the comedy finds of any TV season", and Fox as [...] "a fresh new face and talent giving promise of a long, successful career ahead". More praise for the series came after the broadcast of its fourth episode. An unidentified reviewer, writing for the Armored Sentinel (of Temple, Texas), stated [...] "If you're suffering from the case of the 'downs,' this series is a sure pick up!" [...] The reviewer went on to note that [...] "the brightest spot of the series is wacky Nancy Fox. Her role applies the wackiness of <b>Goldie</b> <b>Hawn,</b> but in situation comedy form. I'd watch the show just for her! The whole series is wacky and funny; it's downright good. I highly recommend it." ...|$|E
