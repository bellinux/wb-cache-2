In {{additional}} {{to transfer}} the torque safely, the coupling of the diesel generator set should also has the function of compensating the relative offset distance <b>between</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> of the diesel crank shaft and the <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> of the generator rotor axis. In this paper, {{a new type of}} metallic-disc flexible coupling for diesel generator set of 500 kW power was designed. The working principle of the metallic-disc flexible coupling was expounded in detail, and the comprehensive force performances of the metallic-disc were also analyzed. The simulation analysis was carried out to determine the optimal numbers and thickness of the metallic-disc using ANSYS software. So, the needed torque and the coaxiality between the two axes can be guaranteed. The relevant results can provide some guidance for the improvement design of domestic diesel generator set...|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of droplets {{entering a}} microfluidic chamber designed to house microelectrode detectors for real time analysis of clinical microdialysate is described. We have designed an analysis chamber {{to collect the}} droplets produced by multiphase flows of oil and artificial cerebral spinal fluid. The coalescence chamber creates a constant aqueous environment ideal for the placement of microelectrodes avoiding the contamination of the microelectrode surface by oil. A stream of alternating light and dark coloured droplets were filmed as they passed through the chamber using a high speed camera. Image analysis of these videos shows the colour change evolution at each point along the chamber length. The flow in the chamber was simulated using the general solution for Poiseuille flow in a rectangular chamber. It is shown that on the <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> the velocity profile {{is very close to}} parabolic, and an expression is presented for the ratio <b>between</b> this <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> velocity and the mean flow velocity as a function of channel aspect ratio. If this aspect ratio of width/height is 2, the ratio of flow velocities closely matches that of Poiseuille flow in a circular tube, with implications for connections between microfluidic channels and connection tubing. The droplets are well mixed as the surface tension at the interface with the oil dominates the viscous forces. However once the droplet coalesces with the solution held in the chamber, the no-slip condition at the walls allows Poiseuille flow to take over. The meniscus {{at the back of the}} droplet continues to mix the droplet and acts as a piston until the meniscus stops moving. We have found that the no-slip conditions at the walls of the chamber, create a banding effect which records the history of previous drops. The optimal position for sensors is to be placed at the plane of droplet coalescence ideally at the centre of the channel, where there is an abrupt concentration change leading to a response time ? 16 ms, the compressed frame rate of the video.

It is a thick line, and in the NHL must [...] "contain regular {{interval}} markings of a uniform distinctive design, which will readily distinguish it from the two blue lines." [...] When discussing differences in the rules of the game, it is often said that a game is played with no red line. This simply means that there is no [...] two-line pass violation. The <b>centre</b> <b>line</b> is still used to judge icing violations.|$|R
