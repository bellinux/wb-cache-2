5000|$|Steel's user {{interface}} (UI) {{is intended to}} be more [...] "touch friendly" [...] than that of Android's default browser, and thus emphasizes ease of use on a touch screen. Back, <b>forward,</b> <b>zoom,</b> and bookmark-related buttons are all on the bottom toolbar. A URL-entry box is on the top toolbar, and beside it is a refresh/stop button, which displays if a page is fully loaded or still loading, respectively. Both toolbars are only shown if [...] "pulled out" [...] by two semi-transparent handles at {{the top and bottom of}} the display, and after a short period of not being used will hide themselves again. Until 0.0.4, Android's status bar containing system information was only shown when the top toolbar was out. Starting in 0.0.4, it is either visible or not depending on whether the browser is set to run in fullscreen mode.|$|E
5000|$|Burks' voyeuristic camera {{movement}} in the film was more radical than anything he had done previously, alternating between [...] "tightly framed compositions shot with 50mm fixed lenses and striking camera moves, including backward and <b>forward</b> <b>zooms,</b> elaborate tracking shots pans, crane shots, Dutch tiles, and even the combination zoom and dolly shot." [...] These decisions were not superfluous though; despite their extreme nature, the camera {{movement in}} the film was highly calculated and fluid, ultimately reflecting a [...] "highly effective synthesis of narrative development and artistic expression." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Shawn makes a {{realization}} about the case, a dolly zoom is used, {{in which the}} camera moves <b>forwards</b> while <b>zooming</b> out, creating distortion of the picture. This technique was famously used by Hitchcock in Vertigo.|$|R

2500|$|In the {{television}} series, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, the zucchini-shaped rocket {{that appears in}} the episodes [...] "Pac to the Future" [...] and [...] "Cave Pac-Man" [...] share a few functions with the DeLorean time machine. For example, the rocket creates a burst of light {{in front of it}} as <b>zooms</b> <b>forward</b> at high speed, and similarly leaves a trail of yellow smoke when it time travels.|$|R

5000|$|The first seasons opening {{sequence}} {{began with}} a still shot of the suburban Chicago home that the Dixons and Hales shared. The series title appeared over this still as the theme music began. The Getting part of the title then slid off screen to the left, while the By portion slid off to the right, which was followed by animation of the houses multi-paned front window <b>zooming</b> <b>forward</b> {{from the house and}} sliding open. As it slid open, it commensed a single scene in which both mothers were handing their children their bagged lunches, as the kids raced around the kitchen before going off to school. Every cast member received credit as they were seen talking to each other or walking around the kitchen. The theme song was a gentle tune with a traditional Miller/Boyett [...] "inspirational" [...] sound, and was performed by Mark Lennon (who also sang the theme to Going Places). The credit font used in these episodes was the same italicized, orange Bookman Old Style font used on Family Matters.|$|R
