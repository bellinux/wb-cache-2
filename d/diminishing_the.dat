5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by <b>diminishing</b> <b>the</b> ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, <b>diminishing</b> <b>the</b> generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E

5|$|Once {{out of the}} hospital, Johnny Sack's {{daughter}} gets {{married and}} the Soprano family attends. There, Tony is shown very exhausted when taking off his shoes through security. In the process, he collapses to the ground, but is not hurt. Before the wedding, Johnny Sack is approved to leave prison for six hours to see his daughter get married, but {{has to pay for}} the metal detectors and the presence of the U.S. marshals at the event. As his daughter is about to drive away, the SUV that was escorting Johnny to the wedding blocks the car from leaving and an altercation begins in the driveway. In a moment of weakness and despair, Johnny Sack cries as he is put back into handcuffs and driven back to prison, greatly <b>diminishing</b> <b>the</b> respect his crew and Tony's crew have for him.|$|E
5|$|In 683, Emperor Gaozong died. He was {{succeeded by}} Emperor Zhongzong, his eldest {{surviving}} son by Wu. Zhongzong tried to appoint his wife's father as chancellor: after only six {{weeks on the}} throne, he was deposed by Empress Wu in favor of his younger brother, 12-year-old Emperor Ruizong. This provoked a group of Tang princes to rebel in 684; Wu's armies suppressed them within two months. She proclaimed the Tianshou era of Wu Zhou on October 16, 690, and three days later demoted Emperor Ruizong to crown prince. He was also forced {{to give up his}} father's surname Li in favor of the empress's Wu. She then ruled as China's only empress. A palace coup on February 20, 705, forced her to yield her position on February 22. The next day, her son Zhongzong was restored to power; the Tang was formally restored on March 3. She died soon after. To legitimize her rule, she circulated a document known as the Great Cloud Sutra, which predicted that a reincarnation of the Maitreya Buddha would be a female monarch who would dispel illness, worry, and disaster from the world. She even introduced numerous revised written characters to the written language, which reverted to the originals after her death. Arguably {{the most important part of}} her legacy was <b>diminishing</b> <b>the</b> power of the northwest aristocracy, allowing people from other clans and regions of China to become more represented in Chinese politics and government.|$|E

5|$|On 8 May, {{after days}} of heavy aerial bombardment, the final German {{offensive}} in the Kerch Peninsula, Operation Bustard Hunt, began. The 44th Army quickly collapsed, and the 51st Army was forced to fight off frontal attacks while also defending its open left flank. The 390th, in reserve, was sent into battle at Arma-Eli, and its 789th Regiment delayed the German advance, gaining time {{for the rest of}} the division to set up a defensive line in preparation for a counterattack. However, Lvov and his command staff were killed in an airstrike on the army headquarters, and no counterattack took place. Furthermore, on 13 May, division commander Babayan was wounded and evacuated, further <b>diminishing</b> <b>the</b> army leadership. By 14 May the German advance reached the shores of Kerch Bay, cutting off the troops retreating towards Eltigen and Kamysh-Burun. At this point, the 789th Regiment, now commanded by its commissar, S. Sargsyan, launched a counterattack, throwing the German troops back on the slopes of Mount Mithridat. For three days the regiment, suffering heavy casualties, held its positions and delayed the German advance. However, German troops advanced into Kerch from the southwest and the situation became hopeless. Upon orders from the Crimean Front command, from 14 to 20 May, the 51st Army covered the evacuation of the troops. The remnants of the division were among those evacuated across the Kerch Strait, but the fighting left the division nearly destroyed. It was officially disbanded on 14 June 1942, along with other divisions destroyed in Crimea, and its survivors were used to provide the experienced core of new formations.|$|E

30|$|Patil and Kallimath [15] {{implemented}} a cross-layer approach for detecting selfish nodes in MANET. The main {{aim of this}} paper was to enhance the routing in MANET by using on-demand routing protocols such as ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. Kurkure and Chaudhari [16] illustrated a comparative analysis of the selfish node detection methods based on detection time and message overhead. In this paper, a collaborative watchdog method was used to identify the selfish nodes and <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> detection time and message overhead. Nandhini et al. [17] {{implemented a}}n effective ant-based routing algorithm to <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> overhead in a mobile network. The authors proposed a novel approach based on an ant colony algorithm to enhance the efficiency and to <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> overhead. Ciobanu et al.

The aim of this approach was to <b>diminish</b> <b>the</b> issues of having selfish nodes in an opportunistic network.|$|R

25|$|Two {{independent}} studies {{published in}} the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2007, implicated pergolide, along with cabergoline, in causing valvular heart disease. As a result of this, the FDA removed pergolide from the United States market in March 2007. (Since cabergoline is not approved in the United States for Parkinson's Disease, but for hyperprolactinemia, the drug remains on the market. Treatment for hyperprolactinemia requires lower doses than that for Parkinson's Disease, <b>diminishing</b> <b>the</b> risk of valvular heart disease).|$|E
