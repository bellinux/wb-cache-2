40|$|Electromagnetic (RF) plasma-based {{propulsion}} systems have gained increasing interest, as able to yield continuous thrust and controllable and wide-ranging exhaust velocities. An RF plasma thruster essentially features a plasma source, a <b>booster</b> <b>unit</b> and a magnetic nozzle. The usual {{choice for the}} booster is the ion-cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH), a well-established technology in fusion experiments to convey RF powers to magnetized plasmas. To help design the <b>booster</b> <b>unit,</b> TOPICA was extended to deal with magnetized cylindrical inhomogeneous plasmas [1]. The latter required a new module in charge of solving Maxwell's equations within the plasma to obtain the pertinent Green's function in the Fourier domain, i. e. {{the relation between the}} transverse magnetic and electric fields at the air-plasma interface. Calculating the antenna impedance - and hence the plasma loading-relies on an integral-equation formulation and subsequent finite-element weighted-residual scheme to evaluate the current density distribution on the conducting bodies and at the air-plasma interface. In this work the design of an ICRH stage with TOPICA is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The first units {{produced}} for a customer {{were built in}} December 1940 and January 1941 for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and numbered the 100 set. These were the first diesel-electric locomotives ever produced with dynamic braking, a system developed {{at the insistence of}} the railroad and with its assistance. Initially the four-unit, coupler-equipped set featured two <b>booster</b> <b>units</b> between two cab units in the manner of the demonstrator set. The Brotherhoods of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, however, insisted that the two cabs required two crews, so the railway had EMD produce extra boosters, and renumbered its earliest sets into four unit sets with one cab <b>unit</b> and three <b>boosters.</b> Negotiation with the unions soon rectified the situation, but as the road's earliest units were geared for higher speeds than subsequent units, these sets continued to be composed of one FTA cab unit and three FTB boosters. This is why the road had ten more FTB <b>booster</b> <b>units</b> than FTA cab units.|$|R
25|$|The {{control system}} is complex {{due to the}} sheer size of the {{aircraft}} and the need to compensate for aeroelastic deformation of the structure, as well as the very large friction loads of the control rods, levers etc. To keep control forces felt by the pilots to a minimum, the control system is in three distinct phases. Phase one is direct mechanical control from pilot inputs which is fed into phase two. Phase two is the intermediate powered control system with low-powered <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boosters</b> transferring commands to the third phase. Phase three is the high-powered rapid action control actuators at the main gearboxes operating the swashplates directly.|$|R
