40|$|Abstract: A <b>desynaptic</b> mutant of Corchorus fascicularis Lamk. (Family: Tiliaceae) showing {{distinctive}} morphological variations {{than normal}} was identified {{from the natural}} population (1 out of 27 plants scored) of jute species following male meiotic analysis. Self segregation of the <b>desynaptic</b> plant suggested that desynapsis (mutant trait) was monogenic recessive to normal. Compared to normal plants, the spontaneous <b>desynaptic</b> mutant (medium strong type) demonstrated enhanced univalent frequency per cell (4. 05, normal- 0. 31), reduced number of chiasma (6. 67, normal- 7. 28) and bivalent (5. 12, normal- 6. 99) per nucleus, few meiocytes (13. 64 %, normal- 5. 36 %) with unequal separation at AI, cytologically near normal AII (94. 83 %, normal- 100. 00 %) cells and high male fertility (81. 77 %, normal- 92. 06 %). Cytomixis (prophase I / metaphase I) was evident in both normal and mutant plants forming aneuploid (mutant: 2 n<...|$|E

40|$|Maize meiotic mutant <b>desynaptic</b> (dy) {{was tested}} as a {{candidate}} recombination modifier gene because its effect is manifested in prophase I. Recombination rates for <b>desynaptic</b> (dy) and its wild type were compared in two ways: (1) segregation analysis using six linked molecular markers on chromosome 1 L and (2) cytogenetic analysis using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) -aided meiotic configurations observed in metaphase I. Chromosome 1 L map lengths among the six linked markers were 45 - 63 cM for five F 2 dy/dy plants, significantly lower than the wild-type F 2 map distance of 72 cM. Chromosomes 2 and 6 were marked with rDNA FISH probes, and their map lengths were estimated from FISH-adorned meiotic configurations using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Chiasma frequencies for dy/dy plants were significantly reduced for both arms of chromosome 2, for chromosome arm 6 L, and for eight unidentified chromosomes. There was a notable exception for the nucleolus-organizing region-bearing arm chromosome arm 6 S, where dy increased chiasma frequency.

40|$|Synaptic mutants {{are present}} in  Cenchrus ciliaris L This species, {{due to the}} {{presence}} of linear bivalents and occasion­al trivalents and quadrivalents, is an intermediate <b>desynaptic</b> species. In addition, geographical distribution and environmental factors, such as high temperatures and low humidity, could also have had an influence on the desynapsis observed. The disjunction of chromosomes during anaphase I was mostly abnormal in this <b>desynaptic</b> species. Precocious disjunction of chromosomes into chromatids occurred during anaphase I Due to the high incidence of this chromosome abnormality, a mutant gene,  'pc'  responsible for the disjunction of chromosomes, must be present.

The somatic hybrids had a first meiotic division with uni-, bi-, and multivalents like that of tetraploid potatoes, illustrating introgression and dominance over desynapsis. Abnormal spindle orientations at second meiotic division, sporad types with reduced and unreduced cells and viable pollen occurred at various frequencies. Pollen fertility could not be predicted {{on the basis of}} pollen fertility of the fusion partners. Pollen sterility was partially due to abnormal chromosome numbers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to compare the megasporogenesis in a clone of Norway spruce with an ordinary seed set and a clone of a reduced seed set. The early prophase I stages had the same appearance in both clones. During the last part of diplotene there was a separation of the bivalents (i. e. desynapsis occurred) in the clone with the reduced seed set. During metaphase I-anaphase I 97 per cent of the embryo sac mother cells from the <b>desynaptic</b> clone contained at least one univalent. As a consequence of the occurrence of univalents micronuclei and other irregularities were observed during subsequent stages. Frequently the irregularities caused a degeneration of the cells. Thus, it was proved that the desynapsis was responsible for the poor seed set in the <b>desynaptic</b> clone of Norway spruce...|$|E

40|$|Puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidases (PSAs) {{participate}} {{in a variety of}} proteolytic events essential for cell growth and viability, and in fertility in a broad range of organisms. We have identified and characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant (mpa 1) from a pool of T-DNA tagged lines that lacks PSA activity. This line exhibits reduced fertility, producing shorter siliques (fruits) bearing a lower number of seeds compared with wild-type plants. Cytogenetic characterization of meiosis in the mutant line reveals that both male and female meiosis are defective. In mpa 1, early prophase I appears normal, but after pachytene most of the homologous chromosomes are <b>desynaptic,</b> thus, by metaphase I a high level of univalence is observed subsequently leading to abnormal chromosome segregation. Wild-type plants treated with specific inhibitors of PSA show a very similar <b>desynaptic</b> phenotype to that of the mutant line. A fluorescent PSA-specific bioprobe, DAMPAQ- 22, reveals that the protein is maximally expressed in wild-type meiocytes during prophase I and is absent in mpa 1. Immunolocalization of meiotic proteins showed that the meiotic recombination pathway is disrupted in mpa 1. Chromosome pairing and early recombination appears normal, but progression to later stages of recombination and complete synapsis of homologous chromosomes are blocked...|$|E
40|$|Cytological {{investigation}} of EMS (ethyl methane sulphonate) treated population demonstrated enhanced univalent frequency per cell with unequal separation at Anaphase I. In contrast to controlled plants, medium strong type <b>desynaptic</b> plants {{were obtained from}} 0. 6 % EMS treated set, revealing high frequency of univalents at Metaphase I, along with bivalents, which were loosely paired. The univalents remained unpaired {{till the end of}} meiosis, leading to formation of micronuclei and abnormal tetrads. These plants had high pollen inviability and sterile seeds. It might be possible that EMS had acted on some genes responsible for chiasma formation, resulting in early chiasma dissociation, which suggests that EMS can act as a potential tool in the development of male sterile lines.

40|$|SUMMARY The meiotic {{findings}} in four oligochiasmatic males are described. Radiation {{studies on the}} somatic cells ofthree ofthem failed to provide evidence for a reduced facility to repairDNA which might also have accounted for the observed failure of chiasma formation at meiosis. The data {{support the idea that}} the 'low chiasma count ' condition in sterile men is of mixed aetiology. Mutants which drastically modify the normal pattern of behaviour at meiosis have been described for a number of species, both plant and animal (see Baker et al., 1976, for review), although no proven example of a human meiotic mutant has yet been found. Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that asynaptic and <b>desynaptic</b> recessive mutations occur in man, the strongest line of evidence coming from the study of meiosis in infertile men exhibiting spermatogeni (arrest. Several authors have described individual cases of phenotypically and karyotypically normal men whose meiotic chromosomes at metaphase I exhibit reduced chiasma counts and an array of abnormal configurations including univalents, large single chiasma bivalents, multivalents, and fragments in some or all cells (Hulten et al., 1970, 1974 a; Pearso...|$|E
40|$|A {{spontaneous}} <b>desynaptic</b> mutation, affecting only microsporogenesis {{and causing}} pollen sterility, has been detected in BR 97 - 12986 H, {{a line of}} the official Brazilian soybean breeding program. In this male-sterile, female-fertile mutant, up to metaphase II, the meiotic behavior {{was similar to that}} described for the st series of synaptic mutants previously reported in soybean. Besides many univalents, few or total absence of bivalents were recorded in diakinesis. Bivalents presented one or two terminal chiasmata, while univalents retained the sister chromatid cohesion. Bivalents and most univalents congregated at the equatorial metaphase plate, although univalents frequently migrated to the poles prematurely. Laggards resulting from delay in chiasmata terminalization were also recorded. Distinctly different in their behavior from st series soybean mutants, telophase I-originated micronuclei of different sizes organized their own spindle in the second division. This behavior contributed towards an increase in genome fractionation. Several microspores and microcytes of different sizes were recorded at the end of meiosis. Pollen sterility was estimated at 91. 2 %. Segregation ratio for sterility in this line and its progenies reached 3 : 1. Allelism tests with st series of synaptic mutants are in progress. The importance of male-sterile, female-fertile mutations for soybean breeding programs is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{synaptonemal complex}} (SC) is a meiosis-specific {{structure}} essential for synapsis of homologous chromosomes. For {{the first time}} in any non-mammalian vertebrates, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding two structural components of the SC, SYCP 1 and SYCP 3, in the medaka, and investigated their protein expression during gametogenesis. As in the case of mammals, medaka SYCP 1 and SYCP 3 are expressed solely in meiotically dividing cells. In the diplotene stage, SYCP 1 is diminished at <b>desynaptic</b> regions of chromosomes and completely lost on the chromosomes at later stages. SYCP 3 is localized along the arm and centromeric regions of chromosomes at metaphase I, and its existence on the whole chromosomes persists up to anaphase I, a situation different from that reported in the mouse, in which SYCP 3 is confined to the centromeric regions but lost on the arm regions at metaphase I. Thus, the expression patterns of SC components are different in mammals and fish despite the resemblance in morphological structure of the SC, suggesting divergence in the function of the SC in regulation of meiosis-specific chromosomal behavior. Since the antibody against medaka SYCP 3 is cross-reactive to other fishes, it should be generally useful for a meiosis-specific marker in fish germ cells...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via [URL] (Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council. Grant Number: BB/F 020872 / 1) Although meiosis is evolutionarily conserved, many of the underlying mechanisms show species-specific differences. These are poorly understood in large genome plant species such as barley (Hordeum vulgare) where meiotic recombination is very heavily skewed {{to the ends of}} chromosomes. The characterization of mutant lines can help elucidate how recombination is controlled. We used a combination of genetic segregation analysis, cytogenetics, immunocytology and 3 D imaging to genetically map and characterize the barley meiotic mutant <b>DESYNAPTIC</b> 10 (des 10). We identified a spontaneous exonic deletion in the orthologue of MutL-Homolog 3 (HvMlh 3) as the causal lesion. Compared with wild-type, des 10 mutants exhibit reduced recombination and fewer chiasmata, resulting in the loss of obligate crossovers and leading to chromosome mis-segregation. Using 3 D structured illumination microscopy (3 D-SIM), we observed that normal synapsis progression was also disrupted in des 10, a phenotype that was not evident with standard confocal microscopy and that has not been reported with Mlh 3 knockout mutants in Arabidopsis. Our data provide new insights on the interplay between synapsis and recombination in barley and highlight the need for detailed studies of meiosis in nonmodel species. This study also confirms the importance of early stages of prophase I for the control of recombination in large genome cereals. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} (NE) plays {{an essential role}} in meiotic telomere behavior and links the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm during homologous chromosome pairing and recombination in many eukaryotic species. Resident NE proteins including SUN (Sad- 1 /UNC- 84) and KASH (Klarsicht/ANC- 1 /Syne-homology) domain proteins are known to interact forming the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that connects chromatin to the cytoskeleton. To investigate the possible cross-kingdom conservation of SUN protein functions in plant meiosis, we immunolocalized maize SUN 2 using 3 D microscopy of pollen mother cells from maize (Zea mays L.), a large-genome plant model with a canonical NE zygotene-stage telomere bouquet. We detected SUN 2 at the nuclear periphery and found that it exhibited a distinct belt-like structure that transitioned to a half-belt during the zygotene stage and back to a full belt during and beyond the pachytene stage. The zygotene-stage half-belt SUN structure was shown by 3 D immuno-FISH to include the NE-associated telomere cluster that defines the bouquet stage and coincides with homologous chromosome synapsis. Microtubule and filamentous actin staining patterns did not show any obvious belt or a retracted-like structure other than a general enrichment of tubulin staining distributed widely around the nucleus and throughout the cytoplasm. Genetic disruption of the meiotic SUN belt staining patterns with three different meiosis-specific mutants, <b>desynaptic</b> (dy 1), asynaptic 1 (as 1), and divergent spindle 1 (dv 1) provides additional evidence for the role of the {{nuclear envelope}} in meiotic chromosome behavior. Taking into account all of the observations from this study, we propose that the maize SUN belt is directly or indirectly involved in meiotic telomere dynamics, chromosome synapsis, and possibly integration of signals and forces across the meiotic prophase nuclear envelope...|$|E
