5000|$|Buğu kebabı (Turkish for vapour kebab) is a lamb-based dish {{from the}} Turkish cuisine. Despite its name, {{it is not}} a kebab but a stew, like tas kebabı which is also a Turkish stew. Buğu kebabı is made with [...] meat, shallots, tomatoes, <b>fresh</b> <b>oregano,</b> garlic, bay leaves, tomato paste and spices.

5000|$|Menudo is time intensive, taking four {{to seven}} hours to make. Modern {{supermarkets}} who sell beef tripe offer {{a version of}} this meat which has been previously processed by scalding it in very hot water, which significantly reduces cooking time by several hours. In its simplest form, beef tripe is rinsed clean then boiled for two to three hours in a large pot with an onion cut in half, then the tripe is removed from the pot and allowed to cool before being cut into strips or cubes and the onion half is discarded. The water is removed and discarded, then the tripe is then placed back into the pot and <b>fresh</b> water, <b>oregano,</b> red chili paste or powder, lime/lemon juice, and salt are added and boiled over low heat for another hour until the tripe is tender, after which hominy is added then allowed to cook an additional half hour until done.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of diet supplementation with oregano (Lippia graveolens) essential oil (OEO) on meat quality and lipid oxidation in swine. A total of 48 pigs (Landrace × Yorkshire) was randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups during the finishing period. Each group was fed a commercial diet supplemented with either 0 ppm (control), 1000 ppm, 2000 ppm or 3000 ppm OEO. Pigs were killed at 110 kg and meat quality was assessed over a 16 day storage period. With storage time, the water holding capacity of female meat increased (P 0. 05) and the drip loss of both male and female meat decreased (P 0. 001); OEO did not have a significant (P 0. 05) effect on either factor. Lipid oxidation of meat from the 1000 ppm group was lower than that of control samples at any storage period. The addition of 1000 ppm OEO to pig diet could be recommended for the production of meat of good quality and minimum lipid oxidation.

50|$|Puerto Rican-style adobo is a {{seasoned}} salt that is generously sprinkled or rubbed on meats and seafood prior to grilling, sautéing, or frying. Supermarkets sell prepared blends. There {{are two types}} of adobo on the island. The wet rub, adobo mojado, consists of crushed garlic, olive oil, salt, black pepper, dry or <b>fresh</b> <b>orégano</b> brujo, citrus juice or vinegar or a mix of both citrus and vinegar. More widely used on the island is a dry mix, adobo seco. It is easier to prepare and has a long shelf life. Adobo seco consists of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, dry orégano brujo, and sometimes dried citrus zest.|$|E
40|$|Essential oils (EOs) and {{extracts}} (methanol, acetone and diethyl ether) {{of fresh}} and dried oregano (Origanum onites L.) {{were used to}} determine the antifungal effect on Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus (two strains), Aspergillus niger (two strains), Aspergillus parasiticus, Fusarium semitectum, Fusarium oxysporum, Mucor racemosus and Penicillium roqueforti by disk diffusion methods. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of all samples were determined. The antifungal activity of the fresh herb was greater than that of the dried herb. MIC values for fresh and dried methanol extracts were 150 – 950 mg/mL and 750 – 950 mg/mL, respectively. MFC values for methanol extracts were determined between 300 and 1200 mg/mL for <b>fresh</b> <b>oregano</b> and between 750 and 1100 mg/mL for dried oregano. The EOs of fresh and dried oregano totally inhibited test fungi. EOs produced the lowest MIC and MFC values: 8. 5 mg/mL and 9. 0 mg/mL, respec-tively (P < 0. 005). The highest extract activity was exhibited by <b>fresh</b> <b>oregano</b> against A. alternata (24 mm) followed by P. roqueforti (20 mm). The greatest total antifungal effect was observed from methanol extracts. The chemical composition of <b>fresh</b> <b>oregano</b> EO and extracts was examined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Over 80 volatiles were detected, of which 42 were positively identified by matching both MS fragmentatio...|$|E

Choć pozornie wiemy o tych przetworach dużo, w rzeczywistości jest wiele niejasności, które w znaczny sposób utrudniają nam zrozumienie roli przetworów rybnych w diecie, kuchni i medycynie okresu antycznego oraz bizantyńskiego. Although one can venture {{common sense}} {{remarks on the}} subject of fish {{preserve}} consumption, available literary data make any assessment the role of fish preserves in the late antique and Byzantine diet virtually impossible. It can be only inferred that such food was generally considered to be a delicacy and was eaten by the reach. The less affluent could taste it only on special, festive occasions, but such instances were rather far and few between. It appears that fish preserves constituted no staple food whatsoever. moment of their compilation. The Deipnosophists draw on information form the time of Homer on, however, they hardly ever make use of the data chronologically close to the III-rd century AD. Galen relies on Philotimus, Oribasius on Galen or Xenocrates, while Aetius of Amida and Paul of Aegina borrow their doctrines from Oribasius. The data cannot be rectified on the basis of Byzantine lexica due to the dependence of Hesychios and the Book of Suda on ancient tradition, which is, to make it worse, related to the scope of information preserved in, on the one hand, the Deipnosophists, and on the other, the Geoponics. Consequently, the sources represent a fairly homogenous tradition which cannot not be used directly to draw unequivocal conclusions applicable to late Antiquity and Byzantium. The sources give no detailed information on the way fish preserves were produced. Consequently, there is no precise evidence concerning the technology of production. Available information is general and of a limited value. The main source of data are medical treatises. Their authors claim that fish preserves were manufactured mainly from large fish and that it was salt which was made use of to prevent the meat from decoy. There were a number of varieties of fish preserves which differed in their qualities. However, it seems that generally they tended to include some amount of liquid. These characteristics are reflected in numerous descriptions of waterproof containers in which the salt fish products were preserved. Once the salt fish was taken from the brine, it was soaked in water. When salt was removed form the product, the meat could become the main ingredient of a number of dishes. Greek sources testify to all main techniques of preparing the meat. It could be cooked, grilled or stewed. There is no reliable description of the first method. Nonetheless, it can be suggested that the fish was cooked is salty water, which could also contain some extra ingredients, notably, fresh or dry herbs (fennel or leek) and olive oil. Meat was also grilled on the eschara. The meat prepared in the above specified ways was served with mustard, <b>fresh</b> herbs (mainly <b>oregano)</b> or with sauces, the recipes of which have been preserved in the De re coquinaria. Ancient and Byzantine cooks also stewed the meat, usually with some vegetables (for instance, asparagus) or fruit (for instance, wild water melon). All salt fish dishes were accompanied mainly with bread and sometimes with fresh raw vegetable salads or lentil soup. Dieticians considered salt fish a valuable kind of food. It was regarded as relatively nutritious, contributing to digestion, though of a questionable aroma. It tended to dilute thick humours and was characteristic of desiccating qualities. The last two characteristics were discussed at length in medical treatises and widely profited from by ancient and Byzantine medical doctors while prescribing diets and preparing numerous medicines. Salt meat was recommended to prevent results of the existence of unwanted humours in the body and used to cure ulcers, sores and irritations of various kinds. Zadanie pt.
