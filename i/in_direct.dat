40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of {{determining}} strongly connected compo-nents (Sccs) of directed hypergraphs. The main contribution is an algorithm computing the terminal strongly connected components (i. e. Sccs which do not reach any other components than themselves). The time complexity of the algorithm is almost linear, which is a significant improvement over the known methods which are quadratic time. This also proves that the prob-lems of (i) testing strong connectivity, (ii) and determining {{the existence of a}} sink, can be both solved in almost linear time <b>in</b> <b>directed</b> hypergraphs. We also highlight an important discrepancy between the reachability relations <b>in</b> <b>directed</b> hypergraphs and graphs. We establish a superlinear lower bound {{on the size of the}} transitive reduction of the reachability relation <b>in</b> <b>directed</b> hy-pergraphs, showing that it is combinatorially more complex than <b>in</b> <b>directed</b> graphs. We also prove linear time reductions from combinatorial problems on the subset partial order, in particular from the well-studied problem of finding all minimal sets among a given family, to {{the problem of}} computing the Sccs <b>in</b> <b>directed</b> hypergraphs. 1...|$|R
