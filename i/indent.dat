25|$|By 1881 the Volta Associates {{had succeeded}} in {{improving}} an Edison tinfoil phonograph significantly. They filled the groove of its heavy iron cylinder with wax, then instead of wrapping a sheet of foil around it and using a blunt stylus to <b>indent</b> the recording into the foil, as Edison did, they used a chisel-like stylus to engrave the recording into the wax. The result was a clearer recording. Rather than apply for a patent at that time, however, they sealed the machine into a metal box and deposited it at the Smithsonian, specifying {{that it was not}} to be opened without the consent of two of the three men. By 1937 Tainter was the only one of the Associates still living, and the box preserved at the Smithsonian was opened with his permission. For the occasion, descendants of Alexander Graham Bell gathered in Washington, but Tainter, who held a lifelong admiration of Bell, was too ill to attend and remained at home in San Diego.|$|E

Two types of indenters (hemispherical <b>indenter</b> and pyramidal <b>indenter)</b> with dimensions of several nanometres have been modelled. The simulation results have shown that the <b>indenter</b> shape significantly influences the nanoindentation behaviours at such small scale. The indentation force increases with indentation depth during loading for the hemispheri-cal <b>indenter,</b> while the indentation force is low in values for the pyramidal <b>indenter.</b> To validate the MD model nanoindentation experiments have been carried out. The calculated indentation hardness of the hemispherical <b>indenter</b> is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value...|$|R

500|$|The only {{specimen}} of Y. intermedius is [...] that has several cracks surrounding it, {{and areas of}} white [...] "mold" [...] coatings. The <b>indent</b> behind the propodeum (the first abdominal segment) is deep, {{the connection between the}} segment and the thorax is wide and covered in wrinkles of the exoskeleton. The propodeum has an angular appearance with a rounded corner when viewed from the side. [...] This separates the species from both Y. geinitzi and Y. mayrianum. [...] The legs of Y. intermedius are generally free of hairs while the mesosoma and head have only a few sparse hairs on the upper surface. [...] This is different then the much hairier Y. constrictus which always has numerous erect hairs on the body and legs. The high conical propodeum and scape which does not extend to the edge ofhte head capsule isolate Y. intermedius from Y. samlandicus. [...] The right antennae of the type specimen is preserved with the head of a Ctenobethylus goepperti worker ant clamped near the tip, and it seems the two had just fought prior to entombment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Indenter</b> {{size effect}} on the {{incipient}} plasticity of Al (001) surface is studied by using the quasicontinuum simulation method. Two cylindrical indenters with the radii 2. 5 nm and 40 nm are used to penetrate the surface respectively, and in displacement-control in steps of 0. 02 nm. Results show that the plasticity under the small <b>indenter</b> is activated by discrete dislocation nucleation events, while the plasticity under the large <b>indenter</b> is dominated by a collective dislocation activity. Contact pressure calculations reveal that reversible incipient plasticity occurs under the small <b>indenter,</b> i. e. the plastically deformed surface can completely recover upon withdrawal of the <b>indenter,</b> while the incipient plasticity under the large <b>indenter</b> seems to be irreversible...|$|R

40|$|The {{indentation}} {{response of}} a closed-cell Al foam under the flat-end cylindrical <b>indenter</b> was experimentally investigated. The effects of <b>indenter</b> sizes, relative density of Al foam and boundary condition on the mechanical and energy absorption characteristics of indentation were also investigated. Experimental {{results show that}} the indentation load-displacement response obtained using the flat-end cylindrical <b>indenter</b> is similar to that observed under uniaxial compression. Crosssectional views of the <b>indented</b> specimens show that the deformation is confined only to the region directly under the <b>indenter</b> with very little lateral spread, and that the indentation deformation of Al foam is non-uniform. The tear energy and energy absorbing efficiency of Al foam is not related with the <b>indenter</b> diameter and relative density of Al foam. By increasing the <b>indenter</b> diameter or decreasing relative density, the indentation hardness is linearly decreased, but the energy absorbing capability linearly increases with an increase in <b>indenter</b> diameter or an increase in relative density. At a certain indentation depth range, the difference between rigid foundation and the indentation response of Al foam under simply supported conditions can be ignored...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{dimensional}} analysis, {{finite element}} numerical calculation is undertaken on elastic–plastic solids {{to investigate the}} relationship between instrumented indentation nominal hardness Hn and reduced elastic modulus Er for three different apex angle indenters. The half-included angles of axisymetric conical <b>indenter</b> models are 62. 9 °, 70. 3 °and 85. 566 ° which are corresponding to the real indenters of cube corner <b>indenter</b> with 60 ° face angle, Berkovich <b>indenter</b> with 65. 27 ° face angle and cube corner <b>indenter</b> with 85 ° face angle, respectively. The relationship between a nominal hardness/reduced elastic modulus (Hn/Er) and elastic work/total indentation work (We/Wt) is established with a sixth-order polynomial form for each apex angle <b>indenter.</b> For rigid <b>indenter</b> of instrumented indentation model, reduced elastic modulus Er= 1 /[(1 +v 2) /E], where E and v are elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the <b>indented</b> material. Therefore, Hn/Er–We/Wt relationship {{can be used to}} give estimates of E. Accuracy estimation for the each relationship of each half-included angle <b>indenter</b> shows that the large half-included angle of 85. 566 ° gives better Er measurement error of + 11. 56 % for a low yield strength material(e. g., materials for which σy= 100 MPa, n= 0 and E= 200 GPa), while for the smaller half-included angle of 62. 9 ° or 70. 3 ° <b>indenter,</b> the measurement error is> ± 12. 74 %. The research in this paper confirms that Hn/Er–We/Wt relationship of large apex angle <b>indenter</b> such as 85. 566 ° half-included angle is recommended to be used for estimating the elastic modulus E of <b>indented</b> material...|$|R
