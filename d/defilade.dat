5|$|During {{the rainy}} night of 2 January 1968, six men {{dressed in black}} uniforms were seen outside the {{defensive}} wire of the main base by members of a listening post. After failing {{to respond to a}} challenge, they were fired upon and five were killed outright while the sixth, although wounded, escaped. This event prompted Cushman to reinforce Lownds {{with the rest of the}} 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines. This marked the first time that all three battalions of the 26th Marine Regiment had operated together in combat since the invasion of Iwo Jima during the Second World War. To cover a <b>defilade</b> near the Rao Quan River, four companies from 2/26 were immediately sent out to occupy Hill 558, with another manning Hill 861A.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Cong {{were able}} to pick off one South Vietnamese paratrooper after another, some as they descended and others when their parachutes became stuck in the trees. Those paratroopers who reached the ground and survived tried to move forward, but the Viet Cong {{soldiers}} in <b>defilade</b> position fired on the paratroopers exposed in the open rice paddies. Undeterred, the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion launched small-unit attacks, but on each occasion they were repelled, and sporadic fighting continued until sundown. By {{the end of the}} day, the airborne battalion had lost 19 soldiers killed in action and another 33 wounded. American advisers Captain Fletcher Ware and Sergeant Russell Kopti, who had parachuted in with the South Vietnamese, were also wounded. As night fell, Hoang knew that South Vietnamese forces were closing in from three directions. The eastern flank remained open, and he ordered both elements of the 261st and 514th Battalions, exhausted and low on ammunition, to assemble {{at the south end of}} Ap Tan Thoi. They evacuated through the rice fields, taking their dead and wounded comrades.|$|E
5|$|By dawn it {{was clear}} that they had succeeded in {{penetrating}} the perimeter through a gap between the Australian platoons, and they began to engage them with machine-guns from a <b>defilade</b> position covered from fire by a steep dip in the ridgeline, and concealed by thick scrub. In the growing light, 1 and 3 Platoon were soon pinned down and suffered a number of casualties as they attempted to gain better fire positions with which to engage their attackers. At 06:00 a fighting patrol was dispatched to make contact with Company Headquarters, and as the section passed over a false crest on their way down the spur line they encountered the Chinese positions by chance. Attacking immediately, six Chinese were killed for the loss of one Australian, and the threat to A Company was eliminated. O'Dowd then launched a counter-attack with 3 Platoon assaulting the Chinese occupying the original 1 Platoon position. By 07:00 they had regained the feature and the Chinese were forced to withdraw under heavy fire from the Australians on the high ground, who again exacted a heavy toll. The night's fighting had cost A Company dearly however, and among the dead were the two New Zealand forward observers. In total they suffered more than 50 casualties—half their original strength. Meanwhile, on the right flank, D Company—under Captain Norm Gravener—held the summit of Hill 504 and was not heavily engaged during the night, while C Company—commanded by Captain Reg Saunders—was attacked only once.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{brought under}} fire from a machine gun in another opening of the same position, Sgt Gray {{returned}} to the <b>defiladed</b> spot, obtained another charge, returned to the position and this time completely destroyed it. Spotting another emplacement, {{he went through the}} mine field for the seventh and eighth time to get another charge and destroy another enemy stronghold.|$|R
50|$|In addition, if {{the tank}} fails {{to detect the}} {{defending}} antitank weapon while the tank is still <b>defiladed,</b> but advances beyond that position to {{the crest of the}} hill, it may expose the relatively thinner armor of its lower hull or belly to the defender. Early detection and elimination of antitank threats is an important reason that tanks attack with infantry support.|$|R
25|$|The {{battalion}} was {{deployed to}} firebase, {{located in a}} <b>defiladed</b> area, approximately 1500 metres from the Point 4875. Over the two days, on 2 and 3 July, weapons carriers from the 13 JAK Rifles and 28 Rashtriya Rifles dumped ammunition and heavy weapons. During the day of 4 July, the company commanders of 'A' and 'C' Companies, Major S.V. Bhaskar and Major Gurpreet Singh, conducted their final reconnaissance and showed the objectives to their 'O' groups.|$|R
25|$|Position of {{the body}} can have a {{considerable}} influence in protection from blast effects. Lying prone on the ground will often materially lessen direct blast effects because of the protective <b>defilade</b> effects of irregularities in the ground surface. Ground also tends to deflect some of the blast forces upward. Standing close to a wall, even on the side from which the blast is coming, also lessens some of the effect. Orientation {{of the body}} also affects severity {{of the effect of}} blast. Anterior exposure of the body may result in lung injury, lateral position may result in more damage to one ear than the other, while minimal effects are to be anticipated with the posterior surface of the body (feet) toward the source of the blast.|$|E
2500|$|Major Cushman hiked from San Diego to Camp Pendleton {{with his}} unit in September 1942, and {{embarked}} for the Pacific Area in January 1943. That month, Major Cushman was appointed {{commanding officer of}} the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, and in May 1943 was promoted to lieutenant colonel. During the two years he held that post, he led his battalion repeatedly into combat, earning the Bronze Star with Combat “V” on Bougainville, the Navy Cross during the Battle of Guam, and the Legion of Merit with Combat “V” during the Battle of Iwo Jima, where two of his companies were nearly wiped out (10 survivors - 3 from F Co, and 7 from E Co) when they were trapped in a <b>defilade</b> later called [...] "Cushman's Pocket.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The XM813 Bushmaster, also {{produced}} by ATK Defense, {{is based on}} the Mk44 and is offered as an upgrade for M1126 Stryker and M2 Bradley. [...] Improvements include a one-inch longer barrel, integral mount to increase first round hit probability by up to 10 percent, and dual recoil system to enhance accuracy and cope with future hotter propellants. [...] It can have a next-round select, linkless feed system. [...] The 30mm chain gun can fire Mk310 Programmable Air Burst Munition rounds to attack targets in <b>defilade.</b> [...] The United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command helped enhance the XM813 mainly for safety and turret integration. [...] By changing five parts, the gun caliber can be increased to 40mm. [...] As of November 2013, the XM813 was being tested at Aberdeen Proving Ground.|$|E
50|$|Besides regular line infantry, {{there were}} elite troops (royal guards and other {{designated}} elite regiments) {{and the light}} infantry. Light infantry operated in extended order (also known as skirmish formation) {{as opposed to the}} close order (tight formations) used by line infantry. Since the late 18th century, light infantry in most European countries mostly consisted of riflemen (such as the German Jäger), armed with rifled carbines and trained in aimed shooting and use of <b>defilades.</b> Line infantry, whose muskets with bayonets were heavier than carbines, became known as heavy infantry and were used as the main deciding force.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of antitank weapons, and {{especially}} short-range man-portable antitank rockets, <b>defiladed</b> positions behind a hill have several important advantages. This is because the dead space created by the intervening {{crest of the hill}} prevents an approaching tank from using the range of its direct-fire weapons, and neither the attacker nor defender will have a clear shot until the tank is within range of the defending antitank weapon. In such engagements the tank is usually at a further disadvantage because the defender will often be camouflaged while the attacking tank will be silhouetted against the sky, giving the defender an easier shot.|$|R
50|$|Overnight, Meigs issued {{orders to}} his company commanders, notifying {{them that the}} 23rd TB would be leading a task force attacking the Maginot Line north of Rohrbach. He {{returned}} to his tank which led the attack. Moving out from Oberstmuhl on 10 December, the task force hit a mine field and turned south to Sinnesberg. They advanced under heavy fire to the Maginot Line defenses by 1500 hours, but were forced by increased anti-tank fire from concealed positions held by the 11th Panzer Division, and mounting casualties to fall back to a <b>defiladed</b> position overnight. Six tanks {{were lost in the}} engagement.|$|R
60|$|Chakdara {{holds the}} passage of the Swat River--a rapid, broad, and at most seasons of the year an unfordable torrent. It is built on a rocky knoll that rises {{abruptly}} from the plain about a hundred yards from the mountains. Sketches and photographs usually show only the knoll and buildings on it, and any one looking at them will be struck by the picturesque and impregnable aspect of the little fort, without observing that its proportions are dwarfed, and its defences commanded, by the frowning cliffs, under which it stands. In its construction the principles of <b>defilade</b> have been completely ignored. Standing on the mountain ridge, occupied by the signal tower, it is possible to look or fire right into the fort. Every open space is commanded. Every parapet is exposed. Against an enemy unprovided with artillery, however, it could be held indefinitely; but the fact that all interior communications are open to fire, makes its defence painful to the garrison, and might, by gradually weakening their numbers, lead to its capture.|$|E
5000|$|Has {{a curved}} trajectory, {{allowing}} indirect fire against targets in <b>defilade,</b> behind walls and buildings or rooftops ...|$|E
5000|$|A unit or {{position}} is [...] "in defilade" [...] if it uses natural or artificial obstacles to shield or conceal. For an armored fighting vehicle (AFV), <b>defilade</b> {{is synonymous with}} a hull-down or turret-down position.|$|E
50|$|Through a hail {{of enemy}} small arms fire, Sgt Gray cleared {{a path through the}} mine field up to the mouth of one of the fortifications, then {{returned}} to his own lines, where with three volunteers, {{he went back to the}} battalion dump and acquired twelve satchel charges. Placing these in a <b>defiladed</b> area within his platoon that was protected from immediate enemy fire, he took one weighing twenty-four pounds. Under covering fire from the three volunteers, Sgt Gray advanced up the path he had cleared and threw the charge into the enemy position in order to neutralize it.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{striking}} features are the impressive stone ramparts. Those that exist today are {{the work of}} Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, Louis XIV's military engineer. In 1698 he designed a new enclosure and work began in 1699-1700. Several of Vauban's fortifications in France are listed as a combined UNESCO World Heritage Site. Although the fortifications at Toul are not in that list they do follow the general <b>defiladed</b> fortification pattern for which Vauban is known. [...] There {{appears to have been}} a fortified town at this location since the earliest recorded history. Today, the ramparts encircle and define the old town. They are built of dressed white stone, and topped with grass, and in places are over five metres high.|$|R
50|$|There are current {{efforts to}} include dynamic terrain {{capabilities}} in One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF). The OneSAF Environment Runtime Component (ERC) updates {{presented in the}} 2009 OneSAF Users Conference mention that OneSAF 4.0 will include support for terrain deformation such as craters, tank <b>defilades,</b> infantry trenches, and breach holes in walls. OneSAF's dynamic terrain implementation will use a server to resolve dynamic terrain requests. The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC) is sponsoring {{the development of the}} Shared Architecture for Dynamic Environment (SHADE). SHADE will provide a framework to receive events, calculate effects, and transmit dynamic environment changes to participating applications. These efforts will seek to address the dynamic terrain capability gap in modeling and simulation identified by the U.S. Army Training And Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Intelligence Support Activity (TRISA).|$|R
50|$|The USMC is {{currently}} seeking to purchase commercial off-the-shelf bullet-trap or shoot-through rifle-grenades. These grenades will provide individual Marines additional firepower and will allow indirect fire against targets in <b>defilade,</b> behind walls and buildings or rooftops and elevated positions at ranges between 30 and 150 meters.|$|E
50|$|Artificial entrenchments {{can provide}} <b>defilade</b> by {{allowing}} troops to seek shelter behind a raised berm {{that increases the}} effective height of the ground, within an excavation that allows the troops to shelter {{below the surface of}} the ground or a combination of the two. The same principles apply to fighting positions for artillery and armored fighting vehicles.|$|E
50|$|A unit sited in <b>defilade</b> threatens {{an enemy}} that decides to pass it and move forward, because the enemy would be put in an enfiladed {{position}} when moving in a rank. The friendly unit {{would be in a}} position that is shielded by terrain from direct enemy fire, while still being able to fire on the enemy in an effective manner.|$|E
50|$|Within the tercio, {{ranks of}} pikemen arrayed {{themselves}} {{together into a}} hollow pike square (cuadro) with swordsmen - typically equipped with a short sword, a buckler, and javelins - inside; as the firearm rose in prominence, the swordsmen declined and were phased out. The arquebusiers (later, musketeers) were usually split up in several mobile groups called sleeves (mangas) and deployed relative to the cuadro, typically with one manga at each corner. By virtue of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed the staying power of its pike-armed infantry, the ranged firepower of its arquebusiers, {{as well as the}} ability to conduct assaults with sword-and-buckler men. In addition to its inherent ability to repulse cavalry and other units along its front, the long-range firepower of its arquebusiers could also be easily reorganized to the flanks, making it versatile in both offensive and defensive evolutions, as demonstrated by the success of the tercios at the Battle of Pavia (1525).Groups of tercios were typically arrayed in dragon-toothed formation (staggered, with the leading edge of one unit level with the trailing edge of the preceding unit; see the similar hedgehog defense concept). This enabled enfilade lines of fire and somewhat <b>defiladed</b> the army units themselves. Odd units alternated with even units, respectively one forward and one back, providing gaps for an unwary enemy to enter and outflank itself, where it would become subjected to the combined direct and raking cross fire from the guns of three separate tercios. From their inception, tercio formations were meant to co-ordinate their field operations with cavalry.|$|R
50|$|Battery Geary was {{a battery}} of eight 13-ton, 12-inch mortars. <b>Defiladed</b> in a hollow on Corregidor's Southern coast it was fairly well {{protected}} from Japanese shelling. However, on January 6, 1942, {{under the command of}} Capt. Ben Ewing King, a Japanese bomb landed in a makeshift temporary bunker killing 31 of Battery Geary's NCOs and canoneers. Early in the morning of January 26 Battery Geary opened fire on a unit of Japanese soldiers near Longaskawayan Point {{on the west side of}} the Bataan Peninsula. This was the first time fixed coastal artillery had fired at an enemy since the close of the Civil War. Although the fire was considered accurate and effective Col. Bunker decided to replace Capt. King and he was sent to perform the duties of fort XO and to command HQ Battery on Ft. Drum. He was replaced at Battery Geary by Capt. Thomas W. Davis. Later, this battery was pinpointed by the Japanese artillery and was subjected to heavy shelling. One direct hit by a 240-mm shell, which detonated the magazines of this battery in May 2, 1942, proved to be the most crippling shot during the entire siege of Corregidor. This explosion tossed the fifty ton barrel of the mortar around, one to a distance of 150 yd, another was blown through three feet of reinforced concrete wall into the adjoining powder magazine of Battery Crockett. Large chunks of steel were blown as far as the Malinta Tunnel, killing 27 of the battery crew instantly. Also, one mortar still had a live round in its breech, and it was in the process of firing the shell when the magazine was hit. That live round, of anti-personnel type, still lies within the breach of the mortar.|$|R
50|$|M/Sgt. Watkins {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity {{above and beyond}} the call of duty in action against the enemy. When an overwhelming enemy force broke through and isolated 30 men of his unit, he took command, established a perimeter defense and directed action which repelled continuous, fanatical enemy assaults. With his group completely surrounded and cut off, he moved from foxhole to foxhole exposing himself to enemy fire, giving instructions and offering encouragement to his men. Later when the need for ammunition and grenades became critical he shot 2 enemy soldiers 50 yards outside the perimeter and went out alone for their ammunition and weapons. As he picked up their weapons he was attacked by 3 others and wounded. Returning their fire he killed all 3 and gathering up the weapons of the 5 enemy dead returned to his amazed comrades. During a later assault, 6 enemy soldiers gained a <b>defiladed</b> spot and began to throw grenades into the perimeter making it untenable. Realizing the desperate situation and disregarding his wound he rose from his foxhole to engage them with rifle fire. Although immediately hit by a burst from an enemy machine gun he continued to fire until he had killed the grenade throwers. With this threat eliminated he collapsed and despite being paralyzed from the waist down, encouraged his men to hold on. He refused all food, saving it for his comrades, and when it became apparent that help would not arrive in time to hold the position ordered his men to escape to friendly lines. Refusing evacuation as his hopeless condition would burden his comrades, he remained in his position and cheerfully wished them luck. Through his aggressive leadership and intrepid actions, this small force destroyed nearly 500 of the enemy before abandoning their position. M/Sgt. Watkins' sustained personal bravery and noble self-sacrifice reflect the highest glory upon himself and is in keeping with the esteemed traditions of the U.S. Army.|$|R
50|$|Killers Junior and Senior were {{developed}} as {{alternatives to the}} Beehive flechette rounds previously used against nearby enemy troops. The advantage of Killer Junior over beehive is that the airburst projects fragments in all directions, {{and is able to}} wound enemy crawling or lying in <b>defilade,</b> whereas the flechettes of a Beehive round would simply fly harmlessly over a low target.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{blankets}} {{slow the}} rate of heat emission and camouflage nets use a mix of materials with differing thermal properties to operate in the infra-red as well as the visible spectrum. Camouflage attempts to break up the distinctive appearance and silhouette of a tank. Adopting a turret-down or hull-down position reduces the visible silhouette of a tank as well as providing the added protection of a position in <b>defilade.</b>|$|E
50|$|The M9 is {{a highly}} mobile, armored, amphibious tractor, dozer, and scraper. It was finally fielded in 1986, and is capable of {{supporting}} forces in both offensive and defensive operations. It performs critical combat engineer tasks such as digging hull <b>defilade</b> fighting positions for guns, tanks and other battlefield systems to increase their survivability. The ACE breaches berms, prepares anti-tank ditches, prepares combat roads, removes roadblocks and prepares access routes at water obstacles.|$|E
50|$|The first {{production}} units, the Sturmgeschütz III Ausf A, {{arrived in}} 1940 mounted with the 75 mm StuK 37L/24 gun and increased frontal hull armor (from 30 mm to 50 mm). The main armament, {{which had a}} limited lateral traverse, was mounted directly in a casemate-style hull. This created the lowest possible profile {{in order to reduce}} the vehicle's height, making the StuG more difficult to hit and easier to protect in hull <b>defilade.</b>|$|E
50|$|The XM25 Counter <b>Defilade</b> Target Engagement (CDTE) System, {{also known}} as the Punisher and Individual Semiautomatic Air Burst System is an {{airburst}} grenade launcher derived from the XM29 OICW. It was fielded to soldiers serving in the War in Afghanistan in 2010, after which malfunctions and program budget cuts delayed official entry into service, planned for early 2017. In early 2017, the contract with Orbital ATK was cancelled, calling the future of the entire program into question.|$|E
5000|$|Medina Ridge {{was one of}} the few battles during Desert Storm {{in which}} American forces {{encountered}} significant Iraqi resistance and found it extremely difficult to advance. The Iraqi forces were well-deployed such that they could not be seen by American forces advancing until after they had cleared the top of the ridgeline. This <b>defilade</b> (aka reverse slope) position was intended to give the Iraqis protection from the powerful long-range direct fire of the M1 Abrams tanks and the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{armoured}} warfare, hull-down is {{a position}} {{taken up by}} an armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) such that its hull (the {{main part of the}} vehicle) is behind a crest or other raised ground, but its turret (or a superstructure or roof-mounted weapon) is exposed. This allows it to observe and fire upon the ground ahead, while the hull is protected from enemy fire behind hard cover. A hull-down AFV is said to be in <b>defilade.</b> Taking advantage of hull-down positions is an element of tactical movement.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Defilade</b> is {{also used}} to refer to a {{position}} on the reverse slope of a hill or within a depression in level or rolling terrain. Defiladed positions on hilltops are advantageous because [...] "dead space" [...] - a space that cannot be engaged with direct fire - will be created in front of the position. Ideally, this dead space should be covered by the interlocking fields of fire of other nearby positions, and/or by pre-planned indirect fire such as mortars or other forms of artillery.|$|E
50|$|In November 2014, General Dynamics {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with Advanced Material Engineering Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Singapore Technologies Kinetics, to manufacture 40 mm high-velocity airburst ammunition for the U.S. military. The 40 mm airburst grenade uses a programmable, time-based fuse that computes and programs the detonation time into it, which counts down once fired to zero to detonate at the intended target point. The airburst ammunition {{is compatible with the}} Mk 19, which would give it greater effectiveness and lethality, particularly against concealed and <b>defilade</b> targets.|$|E
5000|$|Enfilade and <b>defilade</b> are {{concepts}} in military tactics {{used to describe}} a military formation's exposure to enemy fire. A formation or position is [...] "in enfilade" [...] if weapons fire can be directed along its longest axis. A unit or position is [...] "in defilade" [...] if it uses natural or artificial obstacles to shield or conceal itself from enfilade. The strategies invented by the English use the French [...] ("to put on a string or sling") and [...] ("to slip away or off") which the English nobility used at that time.|$|E
5000|$|On Iwo Jima in 1945, Nishi {{commanded}} the 26th Tank Regiment under the Ogasawara Corps (IJA 109th Division). He would walk about the island wearing his Hermès brand riding boots and carrying his favorite crop. The regimental headquarters, which was {{located near the}} village of Maruman, was moved to {{the eastern part of the}} island when the battle began. Due to the topography of the island, some of the medium Type 97 Chi-Ha and light Type 95 Ha-Go tanks were placed in hull <b>defilade</b> (buried up to their turrets) and used as fortified emplacements, in particular, against the American M4 Shermans.|$|E
50|$|Spanish hilltop entrenchments, while {{typically}} well-concealed, {{were not}} all correctly positioned for plunging fire, which made return {{fire at the}} advancing Americans more difficult. Most of the Spanish fortifications and trench lines were laid out along the geographic crest of the heights instead of the military crest. This meant that the fire from the Spanish troops would have difficulty hitting the advancing enemy when the attacking Americans reached the <b>defilade</b> {{at the foot of}} the heights. Once they began scaling the hill, however, the attackers would be in full view of the defenders, who could engage the Americans with both rifle and artillery fire.|$|E
