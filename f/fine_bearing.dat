Thus the constant skirmishing, and, occasionally, hard fighting that went on, braced them up, and saved them from the moody depression that weighed upon the rest of the army. They had, too, some material advantage from the broken-down waggons and vehicles of all sorts that fell behind.

60|$|We dwelt {{originally}} in the city; but at {{an early}} date we moved to a beautiful house in a green dingle, musical with splashing water, and surrounded on almost every side by twenty miles of poisonous and rocky desert. The city was thirty miles away; there was but one road, which went no farther than my father's door; the rest were bridle-tracks impassable in winter; and we thus dwelt in a solitude inconceivable to the European. Our only neighbour was Dr. Grierson. To my young eyes, after the hair-oiled, chin-bearded elders of the city, and the ill-favoured and mentally stunted women of their harems, there was something agreeable in the correct manner, the <b>fine</b> <b>bearing,</b> the thin white hair and beard, and the piercing looks of the old doctor. Yet, though he was almost our only visitor, I never wholly overcame a sense of fear in his presence; and this disquietude was rather fed by the awful solitude in which he lived and the obscurity that hung about his occupations. His house was but {{a mile or two}} from ours, but very differently placed. It stood overlooking the road on the summit of a steep slope, and planted close against a range of overhanging bluffs. Nature, you would say, had here desired to imitate the works of man; for the slope was even, like the glacis of a fort, and the cliffs of a constant height, like the ramparts of a city. Not even spring could change one feature of that desolate scene; and the windows looked down across a plain, snowy with alkali, to ranges of cold stone sierras on the north. Twice or thrice I remember passing within view of this forbidding residence; and seeing it always shuttered, smokeless, and deserted, I remarked to my parents that some day it would certainly be robbed.|$|E

40|$|A {{pavement}} construction {{designed to}} cope with the different type of traffic loads; it is exposed to {{and at the same time}} it can resist the effect of the climate. A road structure consists of sub- and superstructure which is divided by a boundary known as terrace. During the construction of unbound layers (base course and sub-base course) in the superstructure, it is always ensured that the material meet the requirements for bearing capacity and the degree of compaction. These parameters are controlled by various laboratory tests and control methods. To obtain increased knowledge of the material and improve the quality of the compaction in the field, it is necessary to perform laboratory tests in order to determine material properties. A base course material 0 / 32 mm limestone from Gotland (Hejdeby) was investigated in this study. To determine properties of the material various laboratory tests such as proctor compaction test, Micro-Deval, Los Angeles, and grain distribution curve are conducted. To investigate how grain size distribution affects technical properties of the material, the 0 / 32 mm material was modified with two different samples; grain size distribution of 2 / 32 mm excluding superior material content, and 0 +/ 32 mm with enhanced superior material content. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in material behavior during proctor compaction. Two aspects of changes in material behavior were emphasized in this study; the optimal water content and maximum dry density, as well as changes of both. As a reference for the limestone features, a traditional 0 / 32 mm tonalite material (granite) from Vällstaverket was used relating to proctor investigation. Material's resistance to abrasion and fragmentation was investigated by two methods: Micro-Deval and Los Angeles. The results were compared with other rock materials. Furthermore the bearing capacity of the material was verified by examination of the Young's modulus and degree of compaction, as well as properties of water content and dry density, at three trial areas on Gotland. This is performed with various methods such as static plate loading test, light weight deflectometer, density gauge/SDG 200, and water/sand volume meter measurement test. By comparing results from different methods of measurement, it may indicate a relationship between these. Test area 3 consists of two smaller test areas which have different water content. The bearing capacity (Young's modulus) and the degree of compaction were measured after each roller passage. Different relationships were obtained between the amount of roller overpass, with Young's modulus of material; as well as degree of compaction. It was found in this study that limestone from Gotland (Hejdeby) maintain its position as construction material for the unbound layers of the road. The result from static plate load which indicated high E V 2 values (Young's modulus) was obtained from the field, and it suggests that a <b>fine</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity can be achieved in the use of limestone...|$|E

40|$|Portsmouth Harbor, New Hampshire, is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} testing area for multibeam and sidescan sonars, and is the location of numerous ground-truthing studies. Having the ability to accurately position underwater sensors is {{an important aspect of}} this type of work. However, underwater positioning in Portsmouth Harbor is challenging. It is relatively shallow, approximately one kilometer wide with depths of less than 25 meters. There is mixing between fresh river water and seawater, which is intensified by high currents and strong tides. This causes a very complicated spatial and temporal sound speed structure. Solutions that use the time-of-arrival of an acoustic pulse to estimate range will require very precise knowledge of the travel paths of the signal in order to separate out issues of multipath arrivals. An alternative solution is to use the phase measurements between closely spaced hydrophones to measure the bearing of an acoustic pinger. By using two bearing measurement devices that are widely separated, the intersection of the two bearings can be used to position the pinger. The advantage of this approach is that the sound speed only needs to be known at the location of the phase measurements. Both time-of-arrival and phase difference systems may encounter difficulties arising from horizontal refraction due to spatially varying sound speed. To ascertain which solution would be optimal in Portsmouth Harbor, the time-of-arrival and phase measurement approaches are being examined individually. Initial field tests have been conducted using a 40 kHz signal to look at bearing accuracy. Using hydrophones that are spaced 2 / 3 wavelengths apart, the bearing accuracy was found to be 1. 25 deg for angles up to 20 deg from broadside with signal to noise ratios (SNR) greater than 15 dB. The results from the closely spaced hydrophones were used to resolve phase ambiguities, allowing <b>finer</b> <b>bearing</b> measurements to be made between hydrophones spaced 5 wavelengths apart. The fi- ne bearing measurements resulted in a bearing accuracy of 0. 3 deg for angles up to 20 deg from broadside with SNR greater than 15 dB. Field tests planned for summer 2007 will include a more detailed investigation of how the environmental influences affect each of the measurement types including range, signal to noise ratio, currents, and sound speed structure...|$|R
