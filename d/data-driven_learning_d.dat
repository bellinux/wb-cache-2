40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for learning plausible unification-based natural language grammars. Our framework uses both modelbased and <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> without being committed to any particular configuration of these two learning schemes.

This paper presents work that is still in progress: the model-based learning component has been built but the <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> component has not. Full evaluation of the framework awaits a complete implementation. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Undergeneration An application of learning natural language grammars is the treatment of undergeneration. A grammar undergenerates when it fails to generate some sentence which human informants judge to be grammatical. Undergeneration undermines the successful processing of natural language.

The quantitative results about 48 Chinese college students revealed that the experimental group which used BNCweb performed significantly better in the post-test in terms of writing fluency and accuracy, as compared with the control group which used the search engine Baidu. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of writing complexity. The qualitative results about the interview revealed that learners generally showed a positive attitude toward the use of BNCweb but there were still some problems of using corpora in the writing process, thus the combined use of corpora and other types of reference resource was suggested as a possible way to counter the potential barriers for Chinese learners of English.|$|R

40|$|Undergeneration is {{a problem}} that {{undermines}} successful parsing of unrestricted texts. A popular solution to this problem is automatic grammar correction (or machine learning of grammar). Broadly speaking, grammar correction approaches can be classified as being either data-driven, or modelbased. Data-driven learners use data-intensive methods to acquire grammar. They typically use grammar formalisms unsuited to the needs of practical text processing. That is, data-driven learners acquire grammars that overgenerate and fail to assign linguistically plausible parses. Model-based learners are knowledge-intensive and are reliant for success upon the completeness of a model of grammaticality. But, in practice, the model will be incomplete and so since we deal with undergeneration by learning, we hypothesise that the combined use of <b>data-driven</b> and model-based <b>learning</b> would allow <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> to compensate for model-based learning's incompleteness, whilst model-based l [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Corpora {{can be used}} {{directly}} by language learners in {{what has come to}} be known as <b>data-driven</b> <b>learning</b> (Johns 1990). Twenty years of research shows generally favourable reactions to DDL, though it inevitably does not appeal to all individual learners or learning styles (Boulton 2009). Many studies report at least some negative reactions from some learners to some aspects (e. g. Yoon & Hirvela 2004), often directly relating to the technology involved – a number mention possible “technophobia” among particular learner populations even today (Römer 2010 : 29). The technology is of course only a means to an end, not an end in itself (cf. Mair 2002), hence its incidence on motivation is crucial, the starting point for this study. 43 learners in an architecture college in France were introduced to DDL over ten weeks, in the form of both printed materials and hands-on consultation (see also Boulton 2010; in preparation). Feedback was collected at the start and end of the course, showing a small but significant decrease in overall receptiveness to the approach. Reasons for this are discussed and put in perspective, given the levels of language proficiency and relative lack of motivation for language learning among many students majoring in other areas (Brown 2010). Factors underlying the learners' motivations were analysed using the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (Pintrich et al. 1991). A number of correlations are identified between these motivation scales and learners' receptivity to DDL as well as to their learning outcomes. Most notably, students with high intrinsic goal orientation (i. e. who value a task for its own sake rather than as a means to an end) tend to perceive DDL more favourably overall and are more successful in terms of learning outcomes derived from paper-based materials. However, no significant correlations are found between any of the scales and hands-on concordancing, leaving open the possibility that students with different motivation profiles may derive benefit from working with corpora directly.
