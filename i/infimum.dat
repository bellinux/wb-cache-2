25|$|The infimum/inferior/inner {{limit is}} a set where all of these {{accumulation}} sets meet. That is, it is the intersection {{of all of the}} accumulation sets. When ordering by set inclusion, the <b>infimum</b> limit is the greatest lower bound on the set of accumulation points because it is contained in each of them. Hence, it is the <b>infimum</b> of the limit points.|$|E
25|$|For example, 1 is the <b>infimum</b> of the {{positive}} integers as a subset of integers.|$|E
25|$|If a {{sequence}} of real numbers is decreasing and bounded below, then its <b>infimum</b> is the limit.|$|E
25|$|So {{the limit}} <b>infimum</b> {{contains}} all subsets which are lower bounds for all except finitely many sets of the sequence.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideals of}} a ring, ordered by inclusion. The {{supremum}} {{is given by}} the sum of ideals and the <b>infimum</b> by the intersection.|$|E
25|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of real analysis, the monotone convergence theorem is {{any of a}} number of related theorems proving the convergence of monotonic sequences (sequences that are increasing or decreasing) that are also bounded. Informally, the theorems state that if a sequence is increasing and bounded above by a supremum, then the sequence will converge to the supremum; in the same way, if a sequence is decreasing and is bounded below by an <b>infimum,</b> it will converge to the <b>infimum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{power set}} {{of a given}} set, ordered by inclusion. The {{supremum}} is given by the union and the <b>infimum</b> by the intersection of subsets.|$|E
25|$|A lattice is an {{abstract}} structure {{studied in the}} mathematical subdisciplines of order theory and abstract algebra. It consists of a partially ordered set in which every two elements have a unique supremum (also called a least upper bound or join) and a unique <b>infimum</b> (also called a greatest lower bound or meet). An example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the unique supremum is the least common multiple and the unique <b>infimum</b> is the greatest common divisor.|$|E
25|$|The open sets of a topological space, {{ordered by}} inclusion. The {{supremum}} {{is given by}} the union of open sets and the <b>infimum</b> by {{the interior of the}} intersection.|$|E
25|$|The topologies on a set, {{ordered by}} inclusion. The <b>infimum</b> {{is given by}} the {{intersection}} of topologies, and the supremum by the topology generated by the union of topologies.|$|E
25|$|The convex subsets {{of a real}} or complex vector space, {{ordered by}} inclusion. The <b>infimum</b> is given by the {{intersection}} of convex sets and the supremum by the convex hull of the union.|$|E
25|$|Limit {{inferior}} is {{also called}} <b>infimum</b> limit, liminf, inferior limit, lower limit, or inner limit; limit superior {{is also known}} as supremum limit, limit supremum, limsup, superior limit, upper limit, or outer limit.|$|E
25|$|A {{partially}} {{ordered set}} (L, ≤) is a complete lattice if every subset A of L has both a greatest lower bound (the <b>infimum,</b> also called the meet) and a least upper bound (the supremum, also called the join) in (L, ≤).|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a {{complete}} lattice is a {{partially ordered set}} in which all subsets have both a supremum (join) and an <b>infimum</b> (meet). Complete lattices appear in many applications in mathematics and computer science. Being a special instance of lattices, they are studied both in order theory and universal algebra.|$|E
25|$|The {{main focus}} of {{interval}} arithmetic is {{the simplest way to}} calculate upper and lower endpoints for the range of values of a function in one or more variables. These endpoints are not necessarily the supremum or <b>infimum,</b> since the precise calculation of those values can be difficult or impossible.|$|E
25|$|The {{relation}} ≤ {{defined by}} a ≤ b if these equivalent conditions hold, is a partial order with least element 0 and greatest element 1. The meet a ∧ b and the join a ∨ b of two elements coincide with their <b>infimum</b> and supremum, respectively, with respect to ≤.|$|E
25|$|The numbers A and B {{are called}} the lower and upper frame bounds, respectively. The frame bounds are not unique because numbers less than A and greater than B are also valid frame bounds. The optimal lower bound is the {{supremum}} of all lower bounds and the optimal upper bound is the <b>infimum</b> of all upper bounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{subgroups of}} any given group under inclusion. (While the <b>infimum</b> here is the usual {{set-theoretic}} intersection, the supremum {{of a set of}} subgroups is the subgroup generated by the set-theoretic union of the subgroups, not the set-theoretic union itself.) If e is the identity of G, then the trivial group {e} is the minimum subgroup of G, while the maximum subgroup is the group G itself.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} analysis, limit {{superior and}} limit inferior are important tools for studying sequences of real numbers. Since the supremum and <b>infimum</b> of an unbounded set of real numbers may not exist (the reals {{are not a}} complete lattice), it is convenient to consider sequences in the affinely extended real number system: we add {{the positive and negative}} infinities to the real line to give the complete totally ordered set , which is a complete lattice.|$|E
25|$|Just as order {{relations}} {{are grounded in}} ordered sets, sets closed under pairwise supremum and <b>infimum,</b> equivalence {{relations are}} grounded in partitioned sets, which are sets closed under bijections and preserve partition structure. Since all such bijections map an equivalence class onto itself, such bijections are also known as permutations. Hence permutation groups (also known as transformation groups) and the related notion of orbit {{shed light on the}} mathematical structure of equivalence relations.|$|E
25|$|If σ is real, then μ(σ) {{is defined}} {{to be the}} <b>infimum</b> of all real numbers a such that ζ(σ+iT) = O(T'a). It is trivial to check that μ(σ)=0 for σ>1, and the {{functional}} equation of the zeta function implies that μ(σ) = μ(1σ)σ+1/2. The Phragmen–Lindelöf theorem implies that μ is a convex function. The Lindelöf hypothesis states μ(1/2)=0, which together with the above properties of μ implies that μ(σ) is 0 for σ≥1/2 and 1/2σ for σ≤1/2.|$|E
25|$|The {{power set}} ℘(X) {{of a set}} X is a {{complete}} lattice that is ordered by set inclusion, and so the supremum and <b>infimum</b> of any set of subsets (in terms of set inclusion) always exist. In particular, every subset Y of X is bounded above by X and below by the empty set ∅ because ∅ ⊆ Y ⊆ X. Hence, it is possible (and sometimes useful) to consider superior and inferior limits of sequences in ℘(X) (i.e., sequences of subsets of X).|$|E
25|$|When {{equipped}} with all transitive edges, these graphs in turn are just special categories, where elements are objects and {{each set of}} morphisms between two elements is at most singleton. Functions between orders become functors between categories. Interestingly, many ideas of order theory are just concepts of category theory in small. For example, an <b>infimum</b> is just a categorical product. More generally, one can capture infima and suprema under the abstract notion of a categorical limit (or colimit, respectively). Another place where categorical ideas occur {{is the concept of}} a (monotone) Galois connection, which is just the same as a pair of adjoint functors.|$|E
25|$|A sup (supremum) of X is a least {{upper bound}} on X, namely an upper bound on X that is less or equal to every upper bound on X. Dually an inf (<b>infimum)</b> of X is a {{greatest}} lower bound on X. The sup of x and y always exists in the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a sup and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have a sup and/or an inf; in a power set algebra they always do.|$|E

500|$|The {{first point}} follows from basic {{properties}} of the real numbers: L has a supremum and R has an <b>infimum,</b> which are easily seen to be equal; being a real number it either lies in R or in L, but not both since L and R {{are supposed to be}} disjoint. The second point generalizes the 0.999.../1.000... pair obtained for p1="0", p2="1". In fact one need not use the same alphabet for all positions (so that for instance mixed radix systems can be included) or consider the full collection of possible strings; the only important points are that at each position a finite set of symbols (which may even depend on the previous symbols) can be chosen from (this is needed to ensure maximal and minimal choices), and that making a valid choice for any position should result in a valid infinite string (so one should not allow [...] "9" [...] in each position while forbidding an infinite succession of [...] "9"s). Under these assumptions, the above argument shows that an order preserving map from the collection of strings to an interval of the real numbers cannot be a bijection: either some numbers do not correspond to any string, or some of them correspond to more than one string.|$|E

2500|$|The non-negative integers, {{ordered by}} divisibility. The least element of this lattice {{is the number}} 1, since it divides any other number. Perhaps surprisingly, the {{greatest}} element is 0, {{because it can be}} divided by any other number. The supremum of finite sets is given by the least common multiple and the <b>infimum</b> by the greatest common divisor. For infinite sets, the supremum will always be 0 while the <b>infimum</b> can well be greater than 1. For example, the set of all even numbers has 2 as the greatest common divisor.
