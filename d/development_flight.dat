5|$|The orbiter {{carried the}} <b>Development</b> <b>Flight</b> Instrumentation (DFI) pallet in its forward payload bay; this had {{previously}} flown on Columbia to carry test equipment. The pallet was not outfitted with any flight instrumentation, but {{was used to}} mount two experiments. The first studied the interaction of ambient atomic oxygen with the structural materials of the orbiter and payload, while the second tested {{the performance of a}} heat pipe designed for use in the heat rejection systems of future spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|At speeds {{below the}} intake {{starting}} speed, or on aircraft with external compression intakes, engine surge {{can cause a}} hammershock. Hammershocks have caused damage to intakes. For example, the North American F-107 during flight at high speed experienced an engine surge which bent the intake ramps. Concorde, during <b>development</b> <b>flight</b> testing, experienced significant damage to one nacelle after both engines surged.|$|E
25|$|The Valkyrie flew for {{the first}} time around June 1926 in the hands of Frank Courtney and went to Air Ministry trials in the late spring of 1927 where the overall {{assessment}} was unenthusiastic. Nonetheless, in August the Valkyrie joined a Scandinavian tour, organised by the Flying Boat <b>Development</b> <b>Flight,</b> together with Blackburn Iris, Short Singapore and Supermarine Southampton flying boats. This tour helped the Air Ministry to decide that the future of flying boats was with metal, rather than wooden hulls with their water absorbing properties. The sole Valkyrie was broken up in 1929.|$|E

In August, the Flight, comprising the Cromarty, two Felixstowe F.5s and a Phoenix Cork, set out on trials of operating large flying boats away from support facilities for extended periods of time. Arriving at St Mary's, Isles of Scilly on 21 August, the Cromarty successfully weathered a storm, but was taxied onto a reef, holing the hull. The damage was declared uneconomic to repair and the Cromarty was scrapped in place.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 No. 41 Squadron was {{selected}} {{to be one of}} just five squadrons in the permanent post-war RNZAF. At this time No. 41 Squadron and No. 14 Squadron were the only active RNZAF units, and the three other squadrons existed as cadres. Also in 1948 a temporary Research and <b>Development</b> <b>Flight</b> was established as part of No. 41 Squadron to conduct experimental aerial topdressing flights using Grumman Avenger aircraft. In mid-1948 three No. 41 Squadron Dakota crews (each comprising a pilot, a navigator and a radio operator) were dispatched to Europe to operate with the Royal Air Force as New Zealand's contribution to the Berlin Airlift. The crews were based at Lübeck and conducted two flights into Berlin each day they were on duty. Following the end of the Soviet blockade of Berlin, the detachment returned to New Zealand in August 1949. At this time {{the main body of the}} squadron in New Zealand had been forced to reduce its flying hours due to a shortage of technicians to service the Dakotas. Between September 1949 and 1951, No. 41 Squadron's A Flight was based in Singapore, from where it made regular flights to Hong Kong and dropped supplies to Commonwealth forces in Malaya using three Dakotas. Due to the deployments to Germany and Singapore, at one stage of 1949 the squadron had only a single trained Dakota crew in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 May 2016, it was {{reported}} that the program would face a further delay of at least six months, due to [...] "technical and supply chain problems". This might require the program to be re-structured or for funding to be cut, either by Congress or the Pentagon. At this time, Boeing has only completed 20% of the <b>development</b> <b>flight</b> tests. A report from The Senate Appropriations Committee on the fiscal 2017 defense spending bill, issued on the same day, expressed concerns about the aircraft's future. The initial 18 aircraft are to be equipped with the refueling boom and centerline drogue, but not the wing-mounted wing-aerial refueling pods (WARP). The WARP systems, which are required to complete full contractual Required Assets Available (RAA), will be delivered separately in October 2018. Boeing stated [...] "The underlying production system remains on track, and Boeing will have more than 18 aircraft through the factory line and in various stages of final change incorporation and certification by August 2017." ...|$|E
