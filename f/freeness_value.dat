40|$|The {{effect of}} {{laboratory}} refining on de-inking potential of inkjet printed handsheets was investigated. Pulp samples containing 80 % short fiber and 20 % long fiber were beaten in a PFI mill to reach four predetermined freeness levels of 650 (unrefined), 550, 430, and 340 mL CSF, and then handsheets were made. Handsheets were identically inkjet printed and then de-inked. Results revealed that, at lower <b>freeness</b> <b>value,</b> {{the brightness of}} de-inked pulps was higher, but the opacity decreased. The surface roughness of handsheets produced using different refined pulp before de-inking was reduced. Our results showed that refining will impart {{a positive effect on}} handsheets’ de-inking potential, and de-inking printed papers produced from pulps refined to lower freeness generated the highest brightness. The results revealed that both tensile and tear strength indices of de-inked pulp were lower. However, the tear strength index of unrefined sample and the tensile strength index of pulp refined to 430 ml CSF were higher than for undeinked samples...|$|E
40|$|Samples of {{bleached}} kraft pine cellulosic pulp, either treated with an enzyme preparation (a Thermomyces lanuginosus xylanase, an Aspergillus sp. cellulase, and a multienzyme preparation NS- 22086 containing both these activities) or untreated, were refined {{in a laboratory}} PFI mill. The treatment with cellulases contained {{in the last two}} preparations significantly improved the pulp's susceptibility to refining (the target <b>freeness</b> <b>value</b> of 30 °SR was achieved in a significantly shorter time), increased water retention value (WRV) and fines contents while the weighted average fiber length was significantly reduced. These changes of pulp parameters caused deterioration of paper strength properties. The treatment with the xylanase, which partially hydrolyzed xylan, small amounts of which are associated with cellulose fibers, only slightly loosened the structure of fibers. These subtle changes positively affected the susceptibility of the pulp to refining (refining energy was significantly reduced) and improved the static strength properties of paper. Thus, the treatment of kraft pulps with xylanases may lead to substantial savings of refining energy without negative effects on paper characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of using acid hydrogen peroxide for lowering the electrical energy consumption during production of Black spruce (Picea mariana) thermomechanical pulp (TMP) was investigated. The chemical system, {{which consisted of}} ferrous sulphate, hydrogen peroxide and optionally an enhancer [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (sodium salt), 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl (veratryl) alcohol or oxalic acid/sodium oxalate], was evaluated as an inter-stage treatment where the primary refiner {{was used as a}} mixer. The approach has the advantage of minimising the capital investment needed for implementation, thus being directly applicable in a thermomechanical pulping process consisting of two or more refiners in series. The results obtained in a pilot plant trial revealed that is was possible to significantly reduce the specific energy consumption by approximately 20 -and 35 % to a <b>freeness</b> <b>value</b> of 100 ml CSF by using 1 and 2 % hydrogen peroxide, respectively. The energy reduction could be obtained without any substantial change in fibre length, fractional composition of the pulp or tensile strength of the paper. The tear strength was slightly reduced however, as was the pulp yield. The major drawback with the acid hydrogen peroxide system was a reduction in brightness by at least 6 brightness units. The addition level of ferrous sulphate was too high and the possibility to reducing the discoloration should be considerable when the chemical system is optimized.  Mechanical Pulp Industrial Research Colleg...|$|E
40|$|Egyptian cotton stalks were pulped in a blender, using cold {{soda and}} {{alkaline}} peroxide chemimechanical (APMP) processes. Overall yields for both processes were low, but comparable to values found for semichemical pulping in the literature. Strength values {{were lower than}} for chemical pulping but comparable to literature values for semichemical pulping. For the cold soda process, the alkali concentration during soaking decreased the yield for both the soaking and refining stages, but it {{had little effect on}} fiber development during and sheet properties after secondary refining. A similar effect was found for soaking time. Higher soaking temperature increased the freeness level at a given secondary refining time and improved tear strength, but it had no effect on tensile or burst strength. An increase in primary refining time caused a decrease in tear strength. Pulps produced from the APMP process were 50 % brighter and slightly weaker than for the cold soda process, and they required significantly less secondary refining to reach a given freeness level. An increase in the concentration of alkali and peroxide caused a decrease in both soaked and refined yields. Increased chemical concentration slightly reduced the secondary refining time required to reach a given freeness level, but it had no effect on strength at a given freeness. An increase in the alkali/peroxide ratio during soaking caused a decrease in screened rejects and an increase in screened yield. Higher ratios resulted in slightly higher <b>freeness</b> <b>values</b> at a given secondary refining time, and they also produced slightly higher tensile and moderately lower tear strength. Brightness was decreased as the ratio increased...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns the mechanical pulping process {{and the effects of}} wood source and pretreatment conditions on the pulp properties. In the first part, the deformation of Norway spruce (Picea abies) wood samples was investigated under shear and torsional loading at different temperatures (20 - 95 °C) and sulfonation conditions. The shear strength and maximum torque decreased with increased temperature. The fiber separation was found to be of the transwall type when the deformation was performed at low temperatures (20 - 60 °C). When high temperatures were combined with sulfonation, the fracture plane was transferred to the compound middle lamella region of the fiber wall, thus exposing a smoother wood surface. The effect of pretreating of wood chips intended for CTMP production was studied in a pilot plant equipped with a plug screw press. Sulfonation before mechanical deformation of the chips in the screw press gave a more selective initial fiber separation in the deformed chips compared with the case where chips were allowed to pass through the screw press without prior sulfonation. The long fiber content and the energy consumption required to reach comparable <b>freeness</b> <b>values</b> were higher for the pulp produced from chips that were sulfonated before mechanical deformation in the screw press. The tear strength at constant energy consumption was also higher for this pulp, whereas the tensile strength was lower. Sulfonation of fibers, followed by polyelectrolyte adsorption analysis, was found to be an excellent method for determining surface lignin concentration. The wood raw material was shown to have an influence on the thermomechanical pulp quality: pulps from forest grown loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) (+ 30 years old) had a slightly lower bonded area at a given total surface area than pulps prepared from plantation grown loblolly pine (15 years old) containing a higher percentage of juvenile wood. This was consistent with the higher surface lignin concentration found for the pulps prepared from the forest grown wood...|$|R
40|$|To make paper {{products}} water repelling, a hydrophobic chemical, known as size, {{is added to}} the pulp slurry in the wet end of the paper machine. It can be shown that size prevents water from penetrating the fiber structure, by measuring the contact angle between a droplet of water and a sized paper surface. More sizing will result in higher contact angle and thus less penetration. The traditional view on the penetration of water based inks, is that the ink behaves as water in terms of penetration. Thus, it is considered that sizing has the effect of preventing water based inks from penetrating paper. However, studies made by Viet Hoang and Huy Ly at the Australian Pulp and Paper Institute, APPI, revealed that normal sizing had no effect on the penetration of water based inks. The present work was an extended study of the effect of sizing on the ink penetration profile of water based inks. It was decided to study the effect of four levels of sizing on the penetration depth of two water-based inks. As the effect of refining and pressing was also believed to {{have an effect on the}} penetration depth, three levels of each were included in the study. Pulp provided by the Australian Paper’s Maryvale mill was beaten in the Valley Beater to three different Canadian standard <b>freeness</b> <b>values.</b> Unsized and sized hand sheets were made in the Moving Belt Drainage Former and were wet pressed to three different levels. The measured paper properties were contact angle, grammage and thickness. Sheets from different refining and pressing groups were then printed in full tone with yellow Hewlett-Packard and magenta Epson inks. The ink penetration profile was then analyzed using the confocal microscope. The results show that when printing with water-based yellow and magenta inks the effect of sizing on the penetration depth was generally insignificant. This shows that water-based inks do not behave as water when penetrating the paper sheet. Thus, sizing can not be applied to prevent ink from penetrating paper. The only cases where a clear decrease in penetration, due to sizing, could be seen, was for sheets made from pulp with a low level of refining and for highly wet pressed sheets.

40|$|This paper reviews several {{empirical}} studies which highlight the using of kenaf for pulp production (beating, fractionation, and recycled fiber). Kenaf   is a non-wood pulp source that is alreadly used {{in parts of}} the world. Review studies showed that being a dicotyledonous plant, kenaf stem consists of bast and core fibers that are significantly different in chemical and morphological properties. Fiber properties directly influence pulping conditions applied in pulp and papermaking production. Kenaf fibers due to different nature and structure exhibit different behavior during pulping and papermaking. Core pulp due to presence of components with a high surface area coming from pith has low freeness and enhance susceptibility to refining action and pulp rapidly attains <b>freeness</b> <b>value</b> that are quite prohibitive for practical purposes. These short comings restrict the use of core pulp, which probably better used as unrefined. On the contrary, bast pulp refines easily and develops its strength. Due to difference in the quality of bast and core fiber, some researchers have proposed to fiber separation and pulping of each fraction separately and using each pulp lonely or blending refined bast pulp and unrefined core based on final product properties. These review results showed that, there is promised to use of kenaf as whole stem (bast and core together) for technical and economical advantages.   </p...|$|E
40|$|Current deinking {{processes}} use potentially environmentally damaging {{chemicals in}} large quantities. The use of enzymes {{could be an}} attractive alternative to certain other chemicals used in deinking. In this research, the effects of different HLB (hydrophile-lipophile balance) values and enzymatic treatments on the deinking of old newspaper pulp (ONP) was studied, and optical properties and mechanical strengths of deinked pulps (DIP) were determined. Enzymatic treatments of old newspaper pulps were performed at two temperatures, 20 °C and 50 °C. Nonionic surfactants with different HLB values were used as the flotation agent. The flotation was conducted for pulps with and without enzymatic treatment. The results showed that brightness values for the floated pulp without enzyme treatment were slightly greater than for the enzyme-treated deinked pulp. Also, dirt count for treated pulps with commercial cellulase and floated with ethoxylated fatty alcohol of HLB 12 at 50 °C was {{lower than that of}} other pulps. The mechanical strengths of the enzymatically deinked pulps, in terms of burst, tensile, folding endurance, E-MOD, and elongation, were increased, but tear strength for the floated pulps with ethoxylated fatty alcohol of HLB 12 was increased at 50 °C without enzymatic treatment. Also, the deinking efficiency of handsheets made from treated pulps with commercial cellulase and ethoxylated fatty alcohol of HLB 12 was highest. The treated pulps with enzyme only, with a combination of commercial cellulase and lipase at 50 °C, showed the lowest <b>freeness</b> <b>value</b> in comparison with other pulps...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of using acid hydrogen peroxide under Fenton conditions {{to lower the}} electrical energy consumed during the production of Black spruce (Picea mariana) thermomechanical pulp (TMP) was investigated. The chemical system, which consisted of ferrous sulphate, hydrogen peroxide and optionally an enhancer (3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl alcohol, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or oxalic acid/sodium oxalate), was evaluated as an inter-stage treatment where the primary refiner {{was used as a}} mixer. The produced TMPs were thoroughly characterised in order to explain the effect of the chemical system on fibre development {{and to be able to}} propose a mechanism for the impact on refining energy reduction. The possibility to improve the optical properties by washing, chelating and sodium dithionite or hydrogen peroxide bleaching the treated pulps was evaluated.   The results obtained in a pilot plant trial show that it is possible to significantly reduce the comparative specific energy consumption by approximately 20 % and 35 % at a <b>freeness</b> <b>value</b> of 100 ml CSF or a tensile index of 45 Nm/g by using 1 % and 2 % hydrogen peroxide respectively. The energy reduction is obtained without any substantial change in the fractional composition of the pulp, though tear strength is slightly reduced, as are brightness and pulp yield. No major differences between the reference pulp and the chemically treated pulps were found with respect to fibre length, width or cross-sectional dimensions. However, the acid hydrogen peroxide-treated pulps tend to have more collapsed fibres, higher flexibility, a larger specific surface area and a lower coarseness value. The yield loss accompanying the treatment is mainly a consequence of degraded hemicelluloses. It was also found that the total charge of the chemically treated pulps is higher compared to the reference pulps, something that may have influenced the softening behaviour of the fibre wall.   A washing or chelating procedure can reduce the metal ion content of the chemically treated TMPs considerably. The amount of iron can be further reduced to a level similar to that of untreated pulps by performing a reducing agent-assisted chelating stage (QY) with dithionite. The discoloration cannot, however, be completely eliminated. The brightness decrease of the treated pulps is thus not only caused by higher iron content in the pulp, but is also dependent on the type of iron compound and/or other coloured compounds connected with the acid hydrogen peroxide treatment. Oxidative bleaching with hydrogen peroxide (P) is more effective than reductive bleaching with sodium dithionite in regaining the brightness lost during the energy reductive treatment. Using a QY P sequence, a hydrogen peroxide charge of 3. 8 % was needed to reach an ISO brightness of 75 % for the chemically treated pulps. The corresponding hydrogen peroxide charge for the untreated TMP reference was 2. 5 %.   The radicals generated in the Fenton reaction will probably attack and weaken/soften the available outer fibre wall layers. This could facilitate fibre development and consequently lower the electrical energy demand for a certain degree of refinement...|$|E
30|$|Unfortunately, {{these efforts}} {{did not have}} a broader {{influence}} on the societal, scientific, and philosophical understanding of science. The neglect of the notion of problem can also be seen {{as a consequence of the}} implicit predominance of analytical philosophy of science. 16 Analytical philosophers of science have always been reluctant to consider normative aspects within science’s core; they more or less still parade the value-free view of sciences. Accompanied by the notion of problem, normativity is nevertheless existent. Framing knowledge production from the angle of “problem” may contribute to the critique of the self-stylization of science as a value-free enterprise. Those who talk about problem-oriented ID cannot talk at the same time about <b>value</b> <b>freeness.</b> Therefore, the notion of problem can be regarded as a reflexive term that calls for an explication of who is considering what as a problem and why. In fact, problems can be considered as a kind of epistemology-ethics hybrid that carries a call-to-action: Problems are seen as negative, as indicating a deficit state that needs to be addressed; problems have to be eliminated.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. Due to the {{opportunity}} for afforestation in South Africa being severely limited, extensive research is being carried out on obtaining more wood per given area, improving the quality and value of the wood and on gaining {{a better understanding of}} how wood properties influence the characteristics of the pulp it produces. The last mentioned is the main focus of this study. If the variations in pulp, due to variations in wood properties, are better understood, then the existing fibre resource could be more efficiently managed and utilised to maximise its value. The main objective of this study was to determine how variation in physical and chemical properties, from the existing P. patula resource drives variation in pulp strength properties. It is well known that differences in tree age and site index lead to major sources of variation of various wood properties. These two easily measured variables were used in this study to capture a significant amount of variation in the wood of the aforementioned genus that enters a mill. Samples were obtained from two extremes in site quality, as measured by site index, (viz. good and poor sites) and three age ranges (viz. 9 - 10 years, 13 - 14 years and 20 - 21 years) from the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Wood chips from each of the six sites were pulped for various lengths of time, using the Kraft pulping method and under the same pulping conditions. A wide range of anatomical and chemical properties of wood and pulp were measured to characterise these samples as extensively as possible. All pulp samples were beaten in a PFI mill, at four different levels. The <b>freeness</b> <b>values</b> of the beaten samples were measured. The physical properties measured on handsheets made from the pulp included sheet density, burst index, tear index, tensile index, tensile energy absorbed, stretch and zero-span tensile strength. Regression models were developed to quantify the impact of the measured variables on each of the strength properties. Principal component analysis was performed on the wood characteristics measured and indicated that tree age is a more critical source of variation in wood properties than site index. The predictions of whole tree wood properties from the properties measured at breast height were excellent. Pulping studies showed that pulp yield, at kappa 20 - 30, increased with tree age. Wood cellulose proved to be a very good predictor of pulp yield. Xylose and mannose appeared to be most resistant to degradation during pulping. The low yield pulps were easier to refine than those with high yield. This has important implications when considering high yield pulping processes. With regard to pulp strength, the younger material could not achieve the high tear strengths obtained by the older material. However, the tear strengths achieved by these younger sites were comparable with, if not higher than, that obtained by hardwood species. The implications of this is that younger P. patula trees could be used for grades of paper where very high tear strength is not essential, but tensile is (e. g. tissue paper) and that older material can be better used for the purpose of providing the high tear strength needed by certain paper grades (e. g. linerboard and sackkraft). The maximum tensile strength achieved by the younger material was higher than that of the older material. When compared at constant freeness or sheet density, longer cooking times had a deleterious effect on strength properties. Strong predictions of pulp strength from basic wood properties were obtained when strength results were compared at constant freeness and sheet density. Because of the great influence of fibre morphology and chemistry on refining rates and on the resultant strength properties, the results of the study suggest that fibres of greatly different chemical and anatomical characteristics should not be refined together, if beating energy and pulp strength are to be optimised. However, further work is required to evaluate if the separation of fibre resources, to improve pulp quality, would be economically viable...|$|R
