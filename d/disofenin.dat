40|$|If {{conventional}} treatment modalities {{have failed in}} hepatoblastoma patients and no distant metastases can be demonstrated therapy with radionuclide agents can be considered. In 6 patients diagnostic technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) -disofenin and two iodine- 131 (131 I) -rose bengal scans were made. 2 patients demonstrated specific uptake of <b>disofenin.</b> One of these had a positive scintigram with radiolabelled rose bengal. This patient was subsequently treated with 1. 1 GBq 131 I-rose bengal. No toxicity was observed. A clear decrease {{in the level of}} alpha-fetoprotein indicated a response and demonstrated that this radiopharmaceutical can be used for tumour targeted radiation therapy in selected patients with therapy resistant tumour...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} technique {{known as}} deconvolutional {{analysis was used}} to provide a critical and previously missing element in the computations required to quantitate hepatic function scintigraphically. This computer-assisted technique allowed for the determination of the time required, in minutes, of a labeled bilirubin analog (99 mTc-disofenin) to enter the liver via blood and exit via bile. This interval was referred to as the mean transit time (MTT). The critical process provided for by deconvolution is the mathematical simulation of a bolus injection of tracer directly into the afferent blood supply of the liver. The raw data required for this simulation are obtained from the intravenous injection of labeled <b>disofenin,</b> a member of the HIDA family of radiopharmaceuticals. In this study, we perform experiments which document that the simulation process itself is accurate. We then calculate the MTT under a variety of experimental conditions involving progressive hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury and correlate these results with the results of simultaneously performed BSP determinations and hepatic histology. The experimental group with the most pronounced histologic findings (necrosis, vacuolization, disorganization of hepatic cords) also have the most prolonged MTT and BSP half-life. However, both quantitative imaging and BSP testing are able to identify milder degrees of hepatic ischemic injury not reflected in the histologic evaluation. Quantitative imaging with deconvolutional analysis is a technique easily adaptable to the standard nuclear medicine minicomputer. It provides rapid results and appears to be a sensitive monitor of hepatic functional disturbances resulting from ischemia and reperfusion...|$|E
