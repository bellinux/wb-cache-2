Two flights to California {{took place on}} the first day of evacuation, carrying a total of 154people. Thousands of residents were also brought to Wake Island for shelter. Military Air Transport Service planes from the United States mainland, Japan, the Philippines, and Hawaii were called in for the operation. On November16, residents were warned of a possible typhoid epidemic and urged to get inoculations for the disease. Over a three-day span, roughly 30,000people were given preventative shots for the disease. In contrast to their previous ban on alien workers, the Government of Guam requested 1,500carpenters, masons, and other building workers from the Philippines. By November21, the Navy Supply Depot planned to have enough supplies for the entire populous shipped until replenishment arrived. In order to shelter homeless, the United States Navy set up tent villages across the island. Military kitchens were also established to provide food.

5|$|When Metternich {{returned}} to Vienna in October 1810, {{he was no}} longer as popular. His influence was limited to foreign affairs, and his attempts to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> Council of State reintroduced had failed. Convinced that a much weakened Austria should avoid another invasion by France, he rejected the advances of Tsar Alexander and instead concluded an alliance with Napoleon on 14 March 1812. He also supported a period of moderate censorship, aimed at preventing provocation of the French. Requiring that only 30,000 Austrian troops fight alongside the French, the alliance treaty was more generous than the one Prussia had signed a month earlier; this allowed Metternich to give both Britain and Russia assurances that Austria remained committed to curbing Napoleonic ambitions. He accompanied his sovereign for a final meeting with Napoleon at Dresden in May 1812 before Napoleon embarked upon the French invasion of Russia.|$|E
25|$|Second, {{the school}} was to be apolitical. The {{education}} was not designed to encourage African Americans to challenge the status quo. African Americans were offered a basic education that enabled them {{to return to their}} communities and support themselves within the system. Washington feared that if a colored school challenged the politics of the day, white citizens might refuse to allow it to open or would later shut it down. This was not the classical type of education offered to many white students in the north. Highly educated African Americans such as W. E. B. Du Bois thought the Tuskegee model was too limited and did not support it. Born in Massachusetts and educated in the North, including a doctorate at Harvard University, he argued for ensuring that the most talented students could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> academic education, to advance the race.|$|E

500|$|After its {{appearance}} at the 2014 Paris Games Week, Tabata announced that XVs release window was [...] "roughly decided", with the company recruiting new staff {{to work on the}} game's master build. While it did not show at E3 2015, it did appear at that year's Gamescom, which Tabata said was the beginning of its official marketing campaign leading up to further announcements. As part of the marketing, the game was distanced from the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, as it would have placed symbolic limits upon their target audience. The game's minimal showing at the event caused a negative reaction from fans, with Tabata stating that Square Enix underestimated the importance of the event. Between May and November 2015, the publicity was deliberately kept low-key so staff could focus on completing the pre-beta version of the game. Once done, XV became playable in its entirety, enabling developers to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> view of the product for the final stages of development and testing. Production on the beta version and progression to the debugging phase began in 2016. The master version, the version of the game that would be played at release, was completed in August, although further technical polishing took place after this.|$|E
500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then.
