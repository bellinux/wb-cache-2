Chassis clearances also required the use of the more compact cylinder head design that was shared with the 748 Superbike and Monster S4.

50|$|The first {{automotive}} {{direct injection}} system {{used to run}} on gasoline was developed by Bosch, and was introduced by Goliath for their Goliath GP700 automobile, and Gutbrod in 1952. This was basically a high-pressure diesel direct-injection pump with an <b>intake</b> <b>throttle</b> valve. (Diesels only change the amount of fuel injected to vary output; there is no throttle.) This system used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven injection pump, which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 Formula 1 racing car engine used Bosch direct injection derived from wartime aircraft engines. Following this racetrack success, the 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL, the first production sports car to use fuel injection, used direct injection. The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SLR, in which Stirling Moss drove to victory in the 1955 Mille Miglia and Pierre Levegh crashed and died in the 1955 Le Mans disaster, had an engine developed from the W196 engine. The Bosch fuel injectors were placed into the bores on the cylinder wall used by the spark plugs in other Mercedes-Benz six-cylinder engines (the spark plugs were relocated to the cylinder head). Later, more mainstream applications of fuel injection favored the less-expensive indirect injection methods.|$|E
50|$|The first {{automotive}} {{direct injection}} system {{used to run}} on gasoline was developed under Hans Scherenberg’s leadership, and was introduced by Goliath and Gutbrod in 1952 to power some of their two-stroke cars.

(Diesels only change the amount of fuel injected to vary output; there is no throttle.) It used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven injection pump, which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The two-stroke vehicles showed very good performance and up to 30% less fuel consumption over the carburetor version, primarily under low engine loads. The cars enjoyed an extra benefit as the injection system also metered lubricant into the engine from a dedicated oil tank, obviating the need for owners to mix their own two-stroke fuel blend. A portion of the oil was combined with fuel in the injection pump to lubricate the cylinders and piston rings, the rest was ported to the air intake to lubricate the crankcase. But the cars were expensive and difficult to start when the engine was warm due to vapor locks. Also, very few people knew about direct injection, and the injection pumps needed frequent adjustment. Branded repair shops and Bosch services became overloaded, and many cars were converted to carburetor. These two-stroke engines were soon superseded by four-strokes.|$|E

The EGR is often cooled {{in order to}} increase the effectiveness of the strategy, even though this leads to a further undesired impact on particulate matter and hydrocarbons.

40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{engines are}} one of the most {{promising}} engine technologies for the future of energy conversion from clean, efficient combustion. HCCI engines allow high efficiency and lower CO 2 emission through the use of high compression ratios and the removal of <b>intake</b> <b>throttle</b> valves (like Diesel), and allow very low levels of urban pollutants like nitric oxide and soot (like Otto). These engines, however, are not without their challenges, such as low power density compared with other engine technologies, and a difficulty in controlling combustion timing. This dissertation first addresses the power output limits. The particular strategies for enabling high power output investigated in this dissertation focus on avoiding five critical limits that either damage an engine, drastically reduce efficiency, or drastically increase emissions: 1) ringing limits, 2) peak in-cylinder pressure limits, 3) misfire limits, 4) low intake temperature limits, and 5) excessive emissions limits. The research shows that the key factors that enable high power output, sufficient for passenger vehicles, while simultaneously avoiding the five limits defined above are the use of: 1) high intake air pressures allowing improved power output, 2) highly delayed combustion timing to avoid ringing limits, and 3) using the highest possible equivalence ratio before encountering ringing limits. These results are revealed by conducting extensive experiments spanning a wide range of operating conditions on a multi-cylinder HCCI engine. Second, this dissertation discusses strategies for effectively sensing combustion characteristics on a HCCI engine. For effective feedback control of HCCI combustion timing, a sensor is required to quantify when combustion occurs. Many laboratory engines use in-cylinder pressure sensors but these sensors are currently prohibitively expensive for wide-scale commercialization. Instead, ion sensors made from inexpensive sparkplugs are proposed for sensing combustion timing. Ion sensing, however, is unreliable under certain HCCI conditions. The dissertation presents two strategies for improving the usefulness of ion sensors in HCCI engines: 1) the use of tiny fractions of metal-acetate fuel additives that expand the useful range of ion sensors, and 2) the use of ion sensors for detecting excessive ringing that must be avoided in HCCI engines. These two innovative research efforts make ion sensors viable for sensing combustion characteristics across the full range of HCCI operation, making them effective for use in engine control systems. In summary, this Ph. D dissertation addresses two important technical challenges facing HCCI engines: power output limits, and difficulty in sensing combustion characteristics for control applications. The strategies proposed in this dissertation research bring HCCI engines closer to widespread commercialization allowing vehicles to operate with significantly higher efficiency and with cleaner emissions...|$|E

The {{early years of}} the project focused on reducing the fuel penalty associated with lean NOx trap (LNT), also known as NOx adsorber catalyst regeneration and desulfation. While Navistar pursued engine-based (in-cylinder) approaches to LNT regeneration, complementary experiments at ORNL focused on in-exhaust fuel injection. ORNL developed a PC-based controller for transient electronic control of EGR valve position, <b>intake</b> <b>throttle</b> position, and actuation of fuel injectors in the exhaust system of a Navistar engine installed at Oak Ridge. Aftertreatment systems consisting of different diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) in conjunction with a diesel particle filter and LNT were evaluated under quasi-steady-state conditions. Hydrocarbon (HC) species were measured at multiple locations in the exhaust system with Gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Under full-load, rated speed conditions, injection of fuel upstream of the DOC reduced the fuel penalty for a given level of NOx reduction by 10 - 20 %. GC-MS showed that fuel compounds were 'cracked' into smaller hydrocarbon species over the DOC, particularly light alkenes. GC-MS analysis of HC species entering and exiting the LNT showed high utilization of light alkenes, followed by mono-aromatics; branched alkanes passed through the LNT largely unreacted. Follow-on experiments at a 'road load' condition were conducted, revealing that the NOx reduction was better without the DOC at lower temperatures. The improved performance was attributed to the large swings in the NOx adsorber core temperature. Split-injection experiments were conducted with ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel and three pure HC compounds: 1 -pentene, toluene, and iso-octane. The pure compound experiments confirmed the previous results regarding hydrocarbon reactivity: 1 -pentene was the most efficient LNT reductant, followed by toluene. Injection location had minimal impact on the reactivity of these two compounds. Iso-octane was an ineffective LNT reductant, requiring high doses (resulting in high HC emissions) to achieve reasonable NOx conversions. Diesel fuel reactivity was sensitive to injection location, with the best performance achieved through fuel injection downstream of the DOC. This configuration generated large LNT temperature excursions, which probably improved the efficiency of the NOx storage/reduction process, but also resulted in very high HC emissions. The ORNL team demonstrated an LNT desulfation under 'road load' conditions using throttling, EGR, and in-pipe injection of diesel fuel. Flow reactor characterization of core samples cut from the front and rear of the engine-aged LNT revealed complex spatially dependent degradation mechanisms. The front of the catalyst contained residual sulfates, which impacted NOx storage and conversion efficiencies at high temperatures. The rear of the catalyst showed significant sintering of the washcoat and precious metal particles, resulting in lower NOx conversion efficiencies at low temperatures. Further flow reactor characterization of engine-aged LNT core samples established that low temperature performance was limited by slow release and reduction of stored NOx during regeneration. Carbon monoxide was only effective at regenerating the LNT at temperatures above 200 C; propene was unreactive even at 250 C. Low temperature operation also resulted in unselective NOx reduction, resulting in high emissions of both N{sub 2 }O and NH{sub 3 }. During the latter years of the CRADA, the focus was shifted from LNTs to other aftertreatment devices. Two years of the CRADA were spent developing detailed ammonia SCR device models with sufficient accuracy and computational efficiency to be used in development of model-based ammonia injection control algorithms.

40|$|Current {{emphasis}} on decreasing vehicle fuel consumption {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) emission from the automotive sector directs many research efforts towards two gasoline engine technologies, namely, the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines, and the downsized TurboCharged (TC) Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) engines with variable valve timing (VVT). In the HCCI category, many actuation strategies have been proposed with the more popular being the dual-fuel strategies and the high residual recycling. In this thesis, a heat recycling strategy is considered, specifically, a heated-air inlet HCCI engine with two <b>intake</b> <b>throttles</b> that control the cold and hot air streams. To facilitate the control analysis and development, a physics-based crank-angle resolved and a mean-value models are developed for feedback controller design. We discover that the combustion duration defined as the duration between the crank angle of 10 % and 90 % fuel burned, provides a universal set point for all speeds and loads for both combustion stability and fuel efficiency. Based on a novel allocation of two actuators, the hot and cold throttles, a feedback controller is designed and simulated to regulate the combustion duration at a desired value during load changes. In the category of the TC SIDI engines, we address the important problem of reducing the calibration complexity when these engines are intended to run on gasoline (E 0) and/or a blend of up to 85 % ethanol (E 85). Typically, there is variability in the optimal VVT and spark values for every blend of gasoline-ethanol. This variability burdens the calibration task for these engines with many degrees of freedom (throttle, VVT, wastegate, fuel injection timing and duration, and spark timing). We first address the transient coupling between throttle and VVT in controlling the air charge. A model-based valve compensator is designed to improve the transient behavior of cylinder charge and torque during tip-ins and tip-outs with the VVT system transitions from set-points. An extremum seeking (ES) controller tuned based on the engine model demonstrates the convergence of both spark timing and VVT to the optimal values to achieve the best fuel efficiency...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{an effort}} to reduce {{dependence}} on petroleum-based fuels and increase engine efficiency, fuel-flexible engines with advanced technologies, including variable valve timing, are being developed. Fuel-flexible spark-ignition engines permit the increased use of ethanol-gasoline blends. Ethanol, an alternative to petroleum-based gasoline, is a renewable fuel, which has the added advantage of improving performance in operating regions that are typically knock limited due to the higher octane rating of ethanol. Furthermore, many modern engines are also being equipped with variable valve timing, a technology that can increase engine efficiency by reducing pumping losses. Through control of valve timings, particularly the amount of positive valve overlap, the quantity of burned gas in the engine cylinder can be altered, eliminating the need for <b>intake</b> <b>throttling</b> at many operating points. However, the presence of elevated levels of in-cylinder burned gas and ethanol fuel can {{have a significant impact on}} the combustion timing, such that capturing these effects is essential if the combustion phasing is to be properly controlled. This paper outlines a physically based model capable of capturing the impact of the ethanol blend ratio, burned gas fraction, spark timing and operating conditions on combustion timing. Since efficiency is typically tied to an optimal CA 50 (crank angle when 50 % of fuel is burned), this model is designed to provide accurate estimates of CA 50 that can be used for real-time control efforts - allowing the CA 50 to be adjusted to its optimal value despite changes in ethanol blend and burned gas fraction, as well as the variations in engine thermodynamic conditions that may occur during transients. The proposed control-oriented model was extensively validated at over 500 points across the engine operating range for four blends of gasoline and ethanol. Furthermore, the model was utilized to determine the impact of ethanol blend and burned gas fraction on the CA 50, as well as their impact on the optimal spark timing. This study indicated that the burned gas fraction could change the optimal spark timing by over 20 ° at some operating conditions and that ethanol content could further affect the optimal spark timing by up to 6 °. Leveraging the model in this manner provides direct evidence that accounting for the impact of these two inputs is critical for proper spark-ignition timing control...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work {{was to develop a}} basic control system for an advancedexperimental engine from scratch. The engine this work revolves around is a Saabvariable compression engine. A new control system is developed based on the naked engine, stripped of theoriginal control system. Experiments form the basis that the control system isbuilt upon. Controllers for <b>throttles,</b> <b>intake</b> manifold pressure for pressures lessthan ambient pressure and exhaust gas oxygen ratio are developed and validated. They were found to be satisfactory. The lambda controller is tested with severalparameter sets, and the best set is picked to be implemented in the engine. Modelsnecessary for the development and validation of the controllers are developed. These models include models for the volumetric efficiency, the pressure dynamicsof the intake manifold, the fuel injectors and wall wetting...|$|R
40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) is an advanced low-temperature combustion technology {{being considered for}} internal combustion engines due to its potential for high fuel conversion efficiency and extremely low emissions of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). In its simplest form, HCCI combustion involves the auto-ignition of a homogeneous mixture of fuel, air, and diluents at low to moderate temperatures and high pressure. Previous {{research has indicated that}} fuel chemistry has a strong impact on HCCI combustion. This paper reports the preliminary results of an experimental and modeling study of HCCI combustion using n-heptane, a volatile hydrocarbon with well known fuel chemistry. A Co-operative Fuel Research (CFR) engine was modified by the addition of a port fuel injection system to produce a homogeneous fuel-air mixture in the intake manifold, which contributed to a stable and repeatable HCCI combustion process. Detailed experiments were performed to explore the effects of critical engine parameters such as intake temperature, compression ratio, air/fuel ratio, engine speed, turbocharging, and <b>intake</b> mixture <b>throttling</b> on HCCI combustion. The influence of these parameters on the phasing of the low-temperature reaction, main combustion stage, and negative temperature coefficient delay period are presented and discussed. A single-zone numerical simulation with detailed fuel chemistry was developed and validated. The simulations show good agreement with the experimental data and capture important combustion phase trends as engine parameters are varied. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
2500|$|Several {{problems}} were encountered during the conversion. The newly lengthened landing gear required more hydraulic fluid, which required a larger reservoir to hold it, a pump {{to move it}} quickly enough through the system, and so on through the hydraulic system. Retaining the relatively simple intakes but only {{on the bottom of}} the wing presented the issue that the airflow into the engine was from below, as opposed to the entire compressor face, so the ducts were extended above the wing to split the airflow evenly; this produced a noticeable bulge on the upper surface of the wing. No attempt was made to fit variable <b>intakes.</b> At high <b>throttle</b> settings, considerable suction into the inlets was generated; in the event of a sudden down-throttle motion by the pilot would result in air [...] "spilling" [...] out of the intakes, which was a concern because it could flow above the wing and disrupt the vortex. Small lips were added to the intakes to help prevent this, but this proved to cause intake buzzing. Changes to the ducts, assisted by Rolls-Royce, addressed this issue.|$|R
