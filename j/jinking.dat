5|$|The normal {{reaction}} of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding, falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, {{according to the}} animal's capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, {{making it difficult for}} the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, ptarmigan and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or <b>jinking</b> flight. In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding. Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} game of the 2010–11 season, McCourt scored the only goal of the game against newly {{promoted}} Inverness Caledonian Thistle with a now-typical solo run and shot, beating three defenders and then netting from the edge of the box. He scored his second goal of the season, his first at Celtic Park in Celtic's 3–0 victory over Hearts on 11 September 2010, beating three players before chipping the goalkeeper. On 6 November 2010, McCourt netted the final goal of Celtic's 9–0 demolition of Aberdeen. Later that month, he scored Celtic's 600th home SPL goal in a 2–2 draw with Inverness at Celtic Park, with another <b>jinking</b> run and precise finish. On 29 December 2010, McCourt scored the winning goal in a 1–0 win over Motherwell. On 26 January 2011, McCourt added another SPL goal in a 4–0 win over Hearts. He came on as a substitute in the 2011 Scottish Cup Final on 21 May 2011, a 3–0 win over Motherwell, to win his first silverware in Scotland. On 15 August 2011, it was reported that several English clubs, including Liverpool, were interested in signing McCourt.|$|E
500|$|Kinkladze's {{position}} {{was as a}} playmaking midfielder, typically playing further forward {{than the rest of}} the midfield. The main aim of the role is to create goalscoring chances, suiting a creative player like Kinkladze. Dribbling ability was generally viewed as one of Kinkladze's strongest attributes, and his <b>jinking</b> runs with the ball resulted in some spectacular goals, most notably his [...] "Goal of the Month" [...] against Southampton. Set piece ability was another of Kinkladze's strengths; he regularly took corners and free kicks. He also took penalties; seven of his Manchester City goals were scored from the spot, though he stopped taking penalties for the club following two consecutive misses in the 1997–98 season. Two of his nine goals for Georgia were also penalties.|$|E

500|$|Freelancers {{graphics}} software was of older technology, {{but it did}} not detract from FiringSquad's praise of the game's artistic quality. [...] The beautiful and realistic depictions of the universe impressed other reviewers, such as GameCritics.com and the Stratos Group. [...] IGN, in particular, was enamored with the game's graphics, describing them as [...] "simply gorgeous" [...] with the best explosions and enormous ships. [...] The mouse-and-keyboard flight control was praised by the industry. [...] Several reviewers found it easy to shoot down enemy ships with the intuitive controls, but others pointed out that aerobatic maneuvers, such as <b>jinking</b> or barrel rolls, cannot be performed, reducing dogfights to overly simplistic and repetitive [...] "chase or be chased" [...] sequences that pale in comparison to the action in other spaceflight simulators.|$|E
500|$|Kinkladze {{missed the}} start of the 2000–01 season due to a hernia operation, to the {{disappointment}} of Smith, who expected him to become a leading figure at the club. He returned to the side as a substitute against Middlesbrough on 6 September 2000. With Derby 3–0 down, Kinkladze and Malcolm Christie were introduced in a double substitution. The pair then proved influential as Derby came back to draw the match 3–3. During the next four months, Kinkladze was sometimes a starter and sometimes a substitute, rotating with Stefano Eranio, until a groin injury sustained in the return match with Middlesbrough kept Kinkladze out for two months. Over the season, Kinkladze [...] "showed little of the brilliance he was bought in to deliver" [...] and was named Derby's biggest disappointment of the season by The Guardian. The match against Leeds United on 23 September 2000 was a rare success for him. He came on as a substitute with 17 minutes remaining and levelled the game 1–1 with a solo goal two minutes later, <b>jinking</b> between two defenders before curling a left-foot shot beyond the goalkeeper. Derby struggled for most of the season, but avoided relegation. Kinkladze stayed at the club, since his injuries and inability to prove himself led to a lack of serious offers. Around this time, he married Louise Tai, a [...] Louise then {{became a member of the}} Orthodox Church and was christened in Tbilisi, receiving a new name – Mariam.

Belliarti forbids <b>Jinks</b> to see Aurelia again. Aurelia returns from her triumphant debut in La traviata too distressed to attend the party given in her honor. <b>Jinks</b> appears, explains what has happened, and begs forgiveness. A policeman arrives looking for <b>Jinks,</b> who has missed his trial.

6000|$|Let muffs, therefore, {{learn to}} swim, to leap, and to run. Let them wrestle with boys bigger than themselves, {{regardless}} of being thrown. Let them practise [...] "jinking" [...] with their companions, {{so that if}} even they be chased by a mad bull, they will, if unable {{to get out of}} his way by running, escape perhaps by <b>jinking.</b> Let them learn to leap off considerable heights into deep water, so that, if ever called on to leap off the end of a pier or the side of a ship to save a fellow-creature, they may do so with confidence and promptitude. Let them even put on [...] "the gloves," [...] and become regardless of a swelled nose, in order that {{they may be able to}} defend themselves or others from sudden assault. So doing they will become sensible fellows, whose character I have thus to some extent described. Of course, I speak of sensible fellows only with reference to this one subject of training the nerves and muscles.

50|$|Equally unorthodox in appearance, {{the sight}} of the later Renwick, bald and moustached, {{slightly}} rotund, with his head-nodding as he ran, <b>jinking</b> and weaving and breaking into open space, was one of the more peculiar joys of international rugby.
