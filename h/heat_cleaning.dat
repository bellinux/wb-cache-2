40|$|Creating an atomically clean {{semiconductor}} {{surface is}} an essential step in preparing negative electron affinity (NEA) photoemission cathodes. While bulk GaAs can be satisfactorily cleaned by chemical etching and in situ <b>heat</b> <b>cleaning,</b> many high polarization electron source materials are either much too thin, or have oxides and carbides which are too tightly bound, to be cleaned by these methods.

Atomic hydrogen cleaning should eliminate the chemical etching step, and might reduce the temperature and/or temperature-time product presently used in forming NEA cathodes.

40|$|DC and AC vacuum arc {{evaporation}} comprise {{two techniques}} currently implemented for thin film deposition, each with specific technical aspects {{with regard to}} the discharge systems and their application fields. The DC arc discharge at several 10 A up to 300 A is a well-established PVD technique to deposit hard coatings for a variety of applications. Examples of applications benefiting from this technique are cutting and forming tools. The primary function of hard coatings in this instance is to reduce friction and wear, and the standard coating materials employed are TiN, CrN, TiCN and AlTiN. In today s manufacturing industries, machines are designed to be fully automated to simplify the coating process which contains several steps like <b>heating,</b> <b>cleaning</b> and deposition.

Yet another useful property is the increase of plasma ionization compared to DC discharges. Applications like hard-amorphous carbon deposition and metal-interconnect deposition schemes in the semiconductor industry benefit from these superior plasma conditions.
