The City accepted the <b>garage</b> <b>parking</b> <b>areas</b> in November 1974; the Park Plaza in May 1976; and the building in December 1977. The cost of design and construction of the building, the Park Plaza and the garage was over $70 million. Controversies arose over cost overruns (the original estimated cost was $42.2 million) and aesthetic issues (was the building too avant-garde?), though most problems were addressed and work moved on to completion.|$|R

In the area to its west and south (north of Sullivans Creek and east of Challis Street, including the Woolley St area), 21 metre (six storey) high buildings are permitted. It is planned to build new Coles and Aldi supermarkets, 150 apartments and a 500-space <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> on the <b>parking</b> <b>area</b> north of the current shops.|$|R

5000|$|Planning for the coliseum {{began in}} 1985, when a city-sponsored study {{determined}} that the city could support a venue seating 10,000-plus people. In October of that year, the McNair Realty and Development company of Greenville, South Carolina, who owned the 400-acre Centre Pointe development tract, donated 30 acres of that land valued at approximately $100,000 an acre to the city for construction of the coliseum. The coliseum was originally planned {{to be part of}} a redevelopment dubbed [...] "City Center," [...] which was to include the coliseum, a convention center, a performing arts center, a transportation hub, a library, an art gallery and museum, an arts school, <b>parking</b> <b>garages,</b> and scenic <b>park</b> <b>areas,</b> and was to have been completed by 2000. As of June 2011, only the coliseum, convention center, and performing arts center have been completed.|$|R

Though Tagliabue and the NFL officials were pleased with the concept, they were daunted by the cost which included $225 million for <b>parking</b> <b>garages,</b> especially since neither Los Angeles nor the State of California was willing to commit the necessary funds. At this point, Tagliabue expressed his frustration with Los Angeles’ inability to get a plan together, and the next month he advised McNair to resume his discussions with the expansion committee.|$|R

In the second-best optimum where curbside parking is underpriced, cruising for parking occurs only when both curbside and <b>garage</b> <b>parking</b> are both present.

40|$|Although {{the growing}} {{economics}} of parking literature almost exclusively {{focuses on the}} drivers' choice between curb and <b>garage</b> <b>parking</b> (and the consequences of non-optimal pricing), we {{are not aware of}} a substantial literature of revealed-preference studies which examines this choice. As a result, we currently have little or no knowledge to what extent differences between on-street and <b>garage</b> <b>parking</b> prices affect this choice. We introduce and apply an easy-to-implement methodology to estimate drivers' willingness to pay for curb <b>parking</b> (relative to <b>garage</b> <b>parking),</b> using information from administrative data about parking choice and parking duration for one particular city. This kind of administrative data is widely available in many other cities around the world. So, {{one of the advantages of}} our methodology is that it easily be reapplied in other cities. In essence, we estimate the effect of parking prices on parking choice (i. e. street or garage), given information about parking durations. Our methodology is based on the observation that the differences in prices for on-street and <b>garage</b> <b>parking</b> depends on parking duration. So, conditional on (anticipated) parking duration, drivers face different pricing schemes. The endogeneity of parking duration is acknowledged in the estimation procedure. We show that drivers' willingness to pay for curb <b>parking</b> (relative to <b>garage</b> <b>parking)</b> is positive and about 2 ̆ 0 ac 0. 35 - 0. 58. When we assume a car drivers' value of time of 2 ̆ 0 ac 5. 00 per hour, our results imply that drivers save about 4 - 7 minutes when parking on-street. This seems a reasonable result. Our results also imply that car drivers are rather sensitive to small price differences between street and <b>garage</b> <b>parking,</b> which makes sense as both are close substitutes. For example, if curb parking were only 33 percent cheaper than <b>garage</b> <b>parking,</b> the on-street stock of cars would increase threefold. Our estimates strongly suggest that a parking regime including curb prices that are (slightly) higher than garage prices is welfare improving, in particular because drivers with longer parking durations are induced to use <b>garage</b> <b>parking.</b> : Curb <b>parking,</b> <b>garage</b> <b>parking,</b> parking policy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—As {{the numbers}} of {{vehicles}} on the road are increasing day by day parking problems are bound to exist. Problems which arise due to insufficient parking space are traffic congestion, driver frustration and air pollution. The price for expanding <b>parking</b> <b>area</b> is extremely high. So researchers are recently turned to applying technologies for management of <b>parking</b> <b>area.</b> It is realized that this simple invention {{could be applied to}} monitor and manage vehicles in a <b>parking</b> <b>garage.</b> The system can then inform drivers about the number of available parking spaces and in which area should they be directed to. This kind of system helps to minimize traffic congestion problems and driver’s frustration while finding a vacant space in a crowded <b>parking</b> <b>garage.</b> This paper describes the work to modify the original WSN and use of RFID and zigbee technology and its result are obtained when it is applied to <b>parking</b> <b>garages...</b>|$|R

40|$|Arnott and Inci [Arnott, R. and Inci, E., 2006. An {{integrated}} model of downtown parking and traffic congestion. Journal of Urban Economics 60, 418 - 442] developed an {{integrated model}} of curbside parking and traffic congestion {{in a downtown}} <b>area.</b> Curbside <b>parking</b> is exogenously priced below its social opportunity cost, and the stock of cars cruising for parking, which contributes to traffic congestion, adjusts to clear the market for curbside parking spaces. Denser downtown areas have garage as well as curbside parking. Because of economies of scale in garage construction, garages are discretely spaced. The friction of space confers market power on <b>parking</b> <b>garages.</b> Spatial competition between <b>parking</b> <b>garages,</b> as modeled in Arnott [Arnott, R., 2006. Spatial competition between downtown <b>parking</b> <b>garages</b> and downtown <b>parking</b> policy. Transport Policy 13, 458 - 469], determines the equilibrium <b>garage</b> <b>parking</b> fee and spacing between <b>parking</b> <b>garages.</b> Also, the stock of cars cruising for parking adjusts to equalize the full prices of curbside and <b>garage</b> <b>parking.</b> This paper combines the ingredients of these two models, hence presenting an integrated model of curbside <b>parking,</b> <b>garage</b> <b>parking,</b> and traffic congestion, and examines curbside parking policy in this context through a numerical example with parameters representative of a medium-sized US city. The central result is that raising the curbside parking fee {{appears to be a}} very attractive policy since it generates efficiency gains that may be several times as large as the increased revenue raised.
