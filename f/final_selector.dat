2500|$|As in the divided-multiple {{telephone}} switchboard arrangements {{with which it}} served until it replaced them, the panel system consisted of an originating section and a terminating section, connected by a line circuit. A subscriber's line had two appearances in a local office, one on the originating side, {{and one on the}} terminating side. The line circuit consisted of a line relay on the originating side to indicate that a customer had gone off-hook, and a cutoff relay to keep the line relay from interfering with an established connection. [...] The cutoff relay was controlled by a sleeve lead that, as with the multiple switchboard, could be activated by either the incoming section or the outgoing. [...] The <b>final</b> <b>selector</b> performed a sleeve test to detect a busy line when a subscriber was called.|$|E
5000|$|The {{commercial}} {{version of}} the Strowger switch, as developed by the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company, used a rotary dial for signalling to the exchange. The original <b>final</b> <b>selector</b> (connector) switch which connected to 100 customers was supplemented by preceding group selector stages, as the [...] "cascading" [...] enabled connection to many more customers, and to customers at other exchanges. Another requirement for commercial systems was a circuit to detect a busy connection (line) and return a busy signal to the calling subscriber.|$|E
50|$|The Rotary {{system used}} 1st and 2nd linefinders; when a {{customer}} {{picked up the}} phone all free linefinders in the group drove until one picked that customer line. Calls were switched over two, three or four group selection stages followed by a <b>final</b> <b>selector.</b> An office could start with two group selection stages for local calls (a first group level would serve 2000 lines), and be expanded to three group selection stages if it outgrew say 2000 or 4000 lines, depending on the number of first group levels required for other offices in a multi-exchange area.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} to save space 200-outlet <b>final</b> <b>selectors</b> were almost always used in preference to 100-outlet; the selectors {{switched to the}} alternate wipers, or not as appropriate, depending on which preceding selector stage seized them. This allowed a PBX group to have up to 20 lines without the need of 11-and-over PBX <b>final</b> <b>selectors.</b> Moreover, if these selectors were used, the PBX group could have up to 200 lines, and the <b>final</b> <b>selectors</b> in the group were arranged so that different selectors searched over the lines in a different order to reduce waiting times for callers.|$|R
50|$|Before {{a manual}} {{exchange}} was converted to automatic, changes to allocated numbers to facilitate PBX hunting groups were required. In SXS automatic exchanges only some number groups have PBX hunting facility, and within those number groups the main and other numbers in a hunting group {{have to be}} in a certain order. If TUDor 2725 (say) was to be the listed (main) number subsequent numbers must be 2726, 2727, 2728 2729 & 2720; and the PBX hunting group on 2725 is limited to a maximum of 6 incoming lines (although the PBX could also have additional outgoing-only lines to the exchange). A PBX group with 10 PBX-hunting lines would commence with 2721 (say) to 2720, and PBX hunting groups requiring more than 10 incoming lines would be served by special 11-and-over PBX <b>final</b> <b>selectors</b> which could search over several (10-line) levels in succession.|$|R

5000|$|This type had two {{stepping}} coils with pawls and ratchets, one {{to raise}} the wipers to the desired banks of contacts, and one to rotate the wipers into the banks. These were commonly used in telephone switching with ten banks of ten contacts. The coils were typically driven by the electrical pulses derived from a rotary telephone dial. On a two-motion selector, as a digit was dialed, the wipers would step up the banks, then automatically rotate (self-step) into the selected bank until they found an [...] "unused" [...] outlet to the next switch stage. The last two digits dialed would operate the connector switch (<b>final</b> <b>selector</b> in Britain). The second to last digit would cause the wipers to move up and the last digit would cause them to rotate into the bank to the called customer's line outlet. If the line was idle then ringing voltage would {{be applied to the}} called line and ringing tone was sent to the calling line.|$|E
50|$|Each local {{exchange}} incorporated {{up to eight}} groups of directors which translated the first three digits (ABC digits) comprising the exchange name into a pulse train of one to six digits, as required for each exchange and unique to that exchange. The translated digits {{were sent to the}} code selectors, and then the four numeric digits were sent to three switching stages in the terminating exchange (two group selectors and a <b>final</b> <b>selector).</b> Hence local calls within the exchange and busy direct junction routes to exchanges with high traffic from that exchange could be trunked via one code selection stage, which reduced both the setting-up time and the total numbers of selectors required in the network. Distant exchanges which did not justify direct junction routes could be called via one or more tandem exchanges; being routed via one, two or three local code selectors in the originating exchange, one or more selectors in the tandem exchange(s), and finally the numeric selection stages in the terminating exchange for the last four digits, which were stored and forwarded without translation.|$|E

Using concepts of direct torque control, a fuzzy controller has been designed with a cascaded <b>final</b> state <b>selector,</b> which reduced rule base and gave birth to a new control technique of induction motor. Details and performance of the fuzzy controller has been discussed in the paper...|$|R
50|$|The Dons {{sustained}} numerous {{injuries in}} the preliminary <b>final</b> and the <b>selectors</b> sprang a surprise on grand final day by naming the officially retired Dick Reynolds as 20th man.

40|$|Function (PUF) is {{one kind}} of the delay-based PUFs that use the time {{difference}} of two delay-line signals. One of the previous work suggests that Arbiter PUFs implemented on Xilinx Virtex- 5 FPGAs generate responses with almost no difference, i. e. with low uniqueness. In order to overcome this problem, Double Arbiter PUF was proposed, {{which is based on}} a novel technique for generating responses with high uniqueness from duplicated Arbiter PUFs on FPGAs. It needs the same costs as 2 -XOR Arbiter PUF that XORs outputs of two Arbiter PUFs. Double Arbiter PUF is different from 2 -XOR Arbiter PUF in terms of mode of operation for Arbiter PUF: the wire assignment between an arbiter and output signals from the <b>final</b> <b>selectors</b> located just before the arbiter. In this paper, we evaluate these PUFs as for uniqueness, randomness, and steadiness. We consider finding a new mode of operation for Arbiter PUF that can be realized on FPGA. In order to improve the uniqueness of responses, we propose 3 - 1 Double Arbiter PUF that has another duplicated Arbiter PUF, i. e. having 3 Arbiter PUFs and output 1 -bit response. We compare 3 - 1 Double Arbiter PUF to 3 -XOR Arbiter PUF according to the uniqueness, randomness, and steadiness, and show the difference between these PUFs by considering the mode of operation for Arbiter PUF. From our experimental results, the uniqueness of responses from 3 - 1 Double Arbiter PUF is approximately 50 %, which is better than that from 3 -XOR Arbiter PUF. We show that we can improve the uniqueness by using a new mode of operation for Arbiter PUF. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} {{plight of}} the 1970 s often limits the librarian, who should be the <b>final</b> <b>selector,</b> to insufficient funds for acquiring essential publications. The librarian, in addition to making every effort to acquire the best possible collection, must provide access from other libraries, within and outside one's parent institution, to materials not acquired; for this purpose, an effective document delivery network has proved more significant than formal plans for shared acquisitions. Too much is published, but the choices become more manageable with selection criteria that include limiting subject scope and keeping within the English language. In regard to journals, new titles should be added only reluctantly; cancellation lists compiled {{with the help of}} selective lists, the librarians' judgment, and users' responses; and newsletters and state journals pruned to a mimimum. As to books, selective lists should be consulted; congress proceedings generally ignored; and reprinted collections, multiple copies, and gifts considered with care. Book reviews are more useful selection aids now that lack of funds causes delays in purchasing than when new titles were acquired promptly with less discrimination. Audiovisual media, although widely pushed, do not replace printed materials, are not of central importance to many faculties, are expensive, and thus comprise a bandwagon which the impoverished library cannot afford to board without extra funding. The less money there is, the more need for a librarian's selection skills...|$|E
40|$|We present two {{novel and}} {{contrasting}} Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures for extractive summarization of documents. The Classifier based architecture sequentially accepts or rejects each {{sentence in the}} original document order for its membership in the <b>final</b> summary. The <b>Selector</b> architecture, on the other hand, is free to pick one sentence {{at a time in}} any arbitrary order to piece together the summary. Our models under both architectures jointly capture the notions of salience and redundancy of sentences. In addition, these models have the advantage of being very interpretable, since they allow visualization of their predictions broken up by abstract features such as information content, salience and redundancy. We show that our models reach or outperform state-of-the-art supervised models on two different corpora. We also recommend the conditions under which one architecture is superior to the other based on experimental evidence. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1611. 0423...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research has been the study of device properties for emerging wide-bandgap cubic-phase semiconductors. Though the wide-bandgap semiconductors have great potential as high-power microwave devices, many gaps remain in the knowledge about their properties. The simulations in this work are designed to give insight into the performance of microwave high-power devices constructed from the materials in question. The simulation are performed using a Monte Carlo simulator which was designed {{from the ground up}} to include accurate, numerical band structures derived from an empirical pseudo-potential model. Improvements that have been made to the simulator include the generalized device structure simulation, the fully numerical <b>final</b> state <b>selector,</b> and the inclusion of the overlap integrals in the final-state selection. The first comparison that is made among the materials is direct-current breakdown. The DC voltage at which breakdown occurs is a good indication of how much power a transistor can provide. It is found that GaAs has the smallest DC breakdown, with 3 C-SiC and ZB-GaN being over 3 times higher. This follows what is expected and is discussed in detail in the work. The second comparison made is the radio-frequency breakdown of the transistors. When devices are used in high-frequency applications it is possible to operate them beyond DC breakdown levels. This phenomenon is caused by the reaction time of the carriers in the device. It is important to understand this effect if these materials are used in a high-frequency application, since this effect can cause a change in the ability of a material to produce high-power devices. MESFETs made from these materials are compared and the results are discussed in detail. Ph. D. Committee Chair: W. Russell Callen; Committee Co-Chair: Kevin F. Brennan; Committee Member: Albert B.

50|$|Dean {{started playing}} the game seriously while {{studying}} at Swinburne Technical School, and so determined was he {{to play in the}} VFL with Richmond, he eschewed all other sports. After leaving school, Dean joined junior team Richmond Scouts for two years, before trying out with Richmond's fourths team in 1956. The following year, aged 17, Dean completed the most meteoric rise in the history of elite Australian football. Commencing the year in the fourths, Dean was quickly promoted to the thirds (under 19s) to play half a season under ex-Melbourne premiership player Len Dockett. Impressed with Dean's potential, Dockett recommended the youngster for promotion to the reserves team. As Richmond was having a poor finish to the season and were out of contention to play in the <b>finals,</b> the club's <b>selectors</b> decided to blood Dean in the final game of the season against the league leaders Melbourne, at the MCG. Although a number of players have completed the rise from the thirds to the senior team in one year, no player ever matched Dean's feat of coming from the fourths. (nb. during the AFL era, the under 19 competition was abolished in 1991 and the reserves disbanded after the 1999 season).|$|R
40|$|Digital {{frequency}} selector filter is {{the simplest}} application of digital signal processing, in which process only passing signal with specific desired frequency or band frequency. Digital frequency selector filter {{can be implemented}} as software or hardware. In this <b>final</b> project, frequency <b>selector</b> filter is implemented as hardware using DSK (Digital Signal Processor Starter Kit) TMS 320 C 6713. In this final project, designed three type of frequency selector filter : Low Pass Filter (LPF), High Pass Filter (HPF), and Band Pass Filter (BPF) with filter length (N) and cut-off frequency (Fc) variation. Filter coefficient is the final product of design stage. FDATool Matlab is used to help filter design and filter coefficient calculation. Then, this filter coefficient is implemented as digital filter in DSK TMS 320 C 6713 using CCS (Code Composer Studio) v. 3. 1. In CCS, it is also arranged some source code to initialize internal peripheral device on DSK TMS 320 C 6713 (Codec, McBSP, etc), initialize interrupt mode, and initialize memory mapping. Based on experiment’s result, it’s known that the implemented’s magnitude response approriate with FDATool’s magnitude response (frequency selector filter algorithm was successfully implemented in DSK TMS 320 C 6713). However, gain’s value at pass band region is not exactly 0 dB because resistance losses from cables and the low precision of measurement device. Based on experiment’s result, it’s also known that filter with higher filter length produces better magnitude response characteristics, especially narrower transition width characteristic.
