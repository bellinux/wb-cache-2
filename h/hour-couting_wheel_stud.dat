50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>studs</b> can {{be either}} factory {{equipment}} or aftermarket add-ons.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>studs</b> are the {{threaded}} fasteners that {{hold on the}} wheels of many automobiles. They are semi-permanently mounted directly to the vehicle hub, usually through the brake drum or brake disk. Lug nuts are fastened onto the <b>wheel</b> <b>stud</b> to secure the wheel. When a wheel is removed for tire changes etc., the stud remains in the hub.|$|R
50|$|Aftermarket <b>wheel</b> <b>studs</b> {{offer the}} ability to mount a wheel that is not factory {{supplied}} to that vehicle. Screw-in studs with a larger than original threaded diameter portion permit mounting of wheels with larger diameter holes. <b>Wheel</b> <b>studs</b> of longer length allow the use of wheel spacers to move a wheel further out to compensate for rubbing or backspacing issues or to make the wheel look like it is larger than factory standard.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>studs</b> are {{replaceable}} {{and come}} in two basic kinds: press-in and screw-in. Welded-in studs are possible but unlikely to be encountered.|$|R
50|$|Some {{minor changes}} were {{introduced}} in January 15, 2015. The New Hino Ranger Series now has a new look with a refreshed upside-down trapezoidal shape front grill with dark grey color, new headlamp, semi-floating suspension, and revised chassis. Besides that, there is a minor upgrade on the axles - all of the New Hino Ranger Series now uses 10 <b>wheel</b> <b>studs</b> instead of the usually found 8 <b>wheel</b> <b>studs</b> in previous generations. This 10-wheel-stud design is not new to Hino because some heavy-duty series Hino Ranger, usually the cement mixer truck, had already used this design several years before. However, since 2015, the 10-wheel-stud design is now a standard feature for all Hino Ranger Series.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year's Can Am sports car, the Lotus 30, {{switched from}} <b>wheel</b> <b>studs</b> to centre-lock <b>wheels.</b> This was mostly {{due to the}} far greater torque of its large V8 engine, but it also avoided this situation re-occurring, as the 30 also carried a single spare wheel.|$|R
50|$|The Swinger 340, Dart's {{performance}} model, {{was replaced}} by the Demon 340 with optional hood scoops and blackout hood treatment. In 1971, Chrysler abandoned their longstanding corporate practice of installing left-hand-threaded <b>wheel</b> <b>studs</b> {{on the left side of}} the vehicle; all-wheel studs on the Dart thenceforth used conventional right-hand threads.|$|R

50|$|The {{device is}} usually {{composed}} of a fork or two push arm assemblies fitted {{to the front of}} a tank hull, with two banks of rollers that can be lowered in front of the tank's tracks. Each roller bank has several heavy <b>wheels</b> <b>studded</b> with short projecting steel girders, which apply a higher ground pressure than the tank's tracks. This ensures the explosion of pressure-fused anti-tank mines, which would otherwise explode under the track itself.|$|R
50|$|A lug nut is a nut {{with one}} rounded or conical (tapered) end, used on steel and most {{aluminum}} wheels. A set of lug nuts are typically used {{to secure a}} wheel to threaded <b>wheel</b> <b>studs</b> and thereby to a vehicle's axles.Some designs (BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Volkswagen) use lug bolts instead of nuts, which screw into a tapped (threaded) hole in the wheel's hub or drum brake or disc. This configuration {{is commonly known as}} a bolted joint.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand VKs were similar, but had slight {{differences}} to their Australian sold counterparts, notably smoke-tinted taillights, {{the lack of}} emissions gear, and that a Holden Starfire powered 4-cylinder model was also available, utilizing 13-inch wheels which had a slightly smaller <b>wheel</b> <b>stud</b> pattern. The 4-cylinder was considered an economic car; however, from its lack of power it tended to use more fuel than a six-cylinder model when laden down. It was however remarkably successful in this market, unlike Australia.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a new automotive wheel requires extensive testing and possible design changes. The wheel investigated had three major changes during development. These three designs were subjected to a stress analysis, by experimental methods, to allow a comparison to be made between each design. The experimental program tested the wheels under conditions designed to simulate the loading of the front wheels whilst cornering. A loading frame was built for this purpose and all testing was performed statically by multiple loading for different directions of bending moment. Brittle lacquer coatings were used on each wheel to highlight high strain areas and indicate optimum locations for the placement of strain gauges. The strain gauges were then used to evaluate the strains. <b>Wheel</b> <b>stud</b> loads were also monitored via strain gauges applied to two of the <b>wheel</b> <b>studs.</b> All data was stored on magnetic tapes and the stress analysis performed by means of a minicomputer. The results of the stress analysis showed quantitatively the improvement in design from the first to the third wheel design. The analysis of the stud loads and their variation during loading indicated the optimum wheel mounting face geometry to ensure nut loosening would not occur in service...|$|R

50|$|Lug nuts may {{be removed}} using a lug, socket or impact wrench. If the wheel {{is to be}} removed then an {{automotive}} jack to raise the vehicle and some wheel chocks would be used as well. Wheels that have hubcaps or hub covers need these removed beforehand, typically with a screwdriver, flatbar, or prybar. Lug nuts {{can be difficult to}} remove, as they may become frozen to the <b>wheel</b> <b>stud.</b> In such cases a breaker bar or repeated blows from an impact wrench can be used to free them. Alternating between tightening and loosening can free especially stubborn lug nuts.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of <b>wheel</b> <b>studs</b> over <b>wheel</b> bolts is greater ease for tire changes by creating {{the ability to}} lift both the wheel and tire onto the studs creating the ability to hold and locate the assembly during tire changes {{rather than trying to}} hold up the wheel and tire while lining up the holes to insert a bolt. Many wheels that use bolts also have one or more small locator pins to assist this: the wheel is lifted onto the pins, then the bolts inserted. Once the bolts are tightened and the wheel is fully installed, the pins have no further function whilst the vehicle is being driven.|$|R
50|$|The first {{design was}} {{produced}} from 1973 to 1984. The first design remained unchanged until 1986. This design had drums that were held {{on by the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>studs</b> and had a smaller diameter pinion bearing than the second design. The second design was produced from 1986 to present. One change {{that occurred in the}} second design was that on some models the brake drum could be removed without having to remove the hub and axle shaft. Additionally, the pinion received a larger diameter bearing while the pinion stayed the same diameter, which increased the durability of the pinion. All these axle are full floating.|$|R
50|$|Wheels must {{be fitted}} {{with the correct}} type of lug nuts on <b>wheel</b> <b>studs,</b> or bolts. Lug nuts (aka wheel nuts in British English) are usually either flat, tapered (generally at 60 degrees and {{referred}} to as conical seat), or ball seats, meaning the mounting surfaces are flat, tapered, or spherical respectively.Most Mercedes have ball lug seats from the factory while most aftermarket wheels have a tapered lug design. Wrong lug nuts for the wheel will not properly center it and cause wobble. Some manufacturers (e.g. Toyota and Lexus) have used taper lug nuts for steel wheels and flat seated lug nuts for alloy wheels.|$|R
5000|$|During the race, NASCAR ordered Chad Knaus {{and members}} of Hendrick Motorsports {{to report to the}} NASCAR hauler after the race. Knaus will not face any {{penalties}} for putting in a wheel spacer. [...] “It’s really not a big deal,’’ Robin Pemberton said. “We were trying to clairfy what went on. I’m {{not going to get into}} the weeds on (the rule), but sometimes if you thought you had an issue with a <b>wheel</b> <b>stud</b> or something mechanical like that, you may need to put a spacer on to get some clean threads for the lug nuts. I have no idea (why they wanted it on), that’s not our question. It really is such a minute deal. It’s fine. Everything is good.’’ ...|$|R
5000|$|The Treasury Casino {{offers a}} number of {{gambling}} games including: Blackjack, Treasury 21 (a variant of Spanish 21), mini Baccarat (card game), Treasury Wheel (Australian Big Six <b>wheel),</b> Caribbean <b>Stud</b> Poker, Roulette, Craps, 3-Card Poker, Sic Bo, and Slot Machines. In addition, {{there is also a}} poker room offering Texas hold'em poker and Omaha cash games along with regular poker tournaments.|$|R
50|$|Production Hathi used single steel disk <b>wheels</b> with 8 <b>studs.</b> The tyres were narrow {{by modern}} {{standards}} for an off-road vehicle {{and did not}} have the exaggerated tread pattern now common, or the bar grip pattern used during the WWII period.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} sub-models of the C50, {{starting}} with the base C50, which has wire wheels. The C50T adds a touring package consisting of a windshield, white wall tires, studded seats, studded passenger backrest, and studded saddlebags. The C50SE Special Edition has cast <b>wheels</b> and <b>studded</b> seats and a flowing or tribal flame paint job, depending on the model year. For 2014, Suzuki added the C50 B.O.S.S. (Blacked-Out Suzuki Special) edition, substituting black for {{nearly all of the}} standard chrome parts, and black cast wheels.|$|R
50|$|With {{the race}} {{set to be}} held in very hot {{conditions}} the race was shortened from 400 kilometres to 313. The shorter race led the Walker team to consider running the race without stopping for tyres. The car's four <b>stud</b> <b>wheels</b> would take almost two laps to complete a tyre change, much slower than their Ferrari and Maserati rivals. Moss and his team began a deception, complaining about the tyre situation and how much time they would lose changing tyres.|$|R
50|$|Larger {{than the}} 1971 RV-1, some {{sources say the}} RV-2 {{was based on the}} Mark II while others say it was based on the Crown. Both the Mark II and the Crown shared major {{mechanical}} parts with the RV-2 (4M engine, transmission, suspension), so either could be true. The RV-2 uses <b>wheels</b> with 5 <b>studs,</b> just like the Crown and unlike the 4 <b>stud</b> Mark II <b>wheels</b> but these parts are easy to swap between the cars. The 2600 cc 4M engine was uprated to include SU carburettors to give 190 km/h.|$|R
50|$|For 1992, a {{turbocharged}} 2.0 litre 16 {{valve engine}} (150 kW/204 bhp C20LET, the turbocharged {{version of the}} C20XE) {{was added to the}} range. With four wheel drive, a six speed Getrag manual transmission (F28/6) and a claimed top speed of 245 km/h (152 mph), this flagship model finally gave the Calibra the dynamics to match its looks. The Turbo model was also notable for the five <b>stud</b> <b>wheel</b> hubs and the extreme negative camber (inward lean) of its rear wheels, which is apparent even from a cursory visual inspection. However, it was not a strong seller.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} an 841 cc two-stroke, three-cylinder engine with one Solex {{carburetor}} per cylinder, giving [...] The engine was lubricated via a separate tank for two-stroke oil, allowing {{the use of}} ordinary petrol. The gearbox had four gears. In order to overcome the problems of overrun for the two-stroke engine, a freewheel device was fitted. The car also used disc brakes at the front, something that was unusual at the time, and the <b>wheels</b> had four <b>studs</b> instead of the five used on the 96 and were of a stronger build, to withstand the extra workload.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} list was generally sparse, with budget models having drivers airbag, seat belt pre-tensioners, cassette player, heated rear screen and tinted windows, and early MK1s with keypad immobilisers and a clock {{in place of}} a tachometer and 3 <b>stud</b> <b>wheels,</b> much like the AX. Further up the list sunroofs, PAS, Electric windows, ultrasonic alarm, passenger airbag, CD player, tachometer, front fog lights, bodykits, colour-coded mirror caps and alloy wheels were added, to name a few. Although MK2 Saxos were generally better equipped than their older counterparts, the interiors were still dated in comparison to other small hatchbacks of the time, such as the Vauxhall Corsa, with many of the center console controls originating from the older Citroën AX model.|$|R
6000|$|... "THEY" [...] One view {{called me}} to another; one hill top to its fellow, half across the county, and since I could answer at no more trouble than the {{snapping}} forward of a lever, I let the country flow under my <b>wheels.</b> The orchid- <b>studded</b> flats of the East {{gave way to the}} thyme, ilex, and grey grass of the Downs; these again to the rich cornland and fig-trees of the lower coast, where you carry the beat of the tide on your left hand for fifteen level miles; and when at last I turned inland through a huddle of rounded hills and woods I had run myself clean out of my known marks. Beyond that precise hamlet which stands godmother to the capital of the United States, I found hidden villages where bees, the only things awake, boomed in eighty-foot lindens that overhung grey Norman churches; miraculous brooks diving under stone bridges built for heavier traffic than would ever vex them again; tithe-barns larger than their churches, and an old smithy that cried out aloud how it had once been a hall of the Knights of the Temple. Gipsies I found on a common where the gorse, bracken, and heath fought it out together up a mile of Roman road; and a little farther on I disturbed a red fox rolling dog-fashion in the naked sunlight.|$|R
