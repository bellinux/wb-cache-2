25|$|With the {{affirmation}} of the Romanian nation, {{in the context of}} the European revolutions of 1848, was explicitly questioned the issue on university in national language. At the <b>express</b> <b>request</b> of the Romanians, in 1870, József Eötvös, then Minister of Education, proposes the creation in Cluj of a university teaching in Hungarian, Romanian and German, idea also welcomed by the Romanian elite. Meanwhile, Eötvös dies, and in 1872, Franz Joseph I legislates the establishment of the Hungarian Royal University of Kolozsvár in Hungarian only, which caused dissatisfaction among Romanians. After the oath, on 20 December 1872, 258 students start courses. There were created four distinct faculties: Faculty of Law and State Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Philosophy, Letters and History, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. The faculties were equal to each other and enjoyed internal autonomy. The first rector was Professor Áron Berde from the Faculty of Law, specialist in economics and finance. Besides the four faculties is created a Pedagogical Institute, for training secondary school teachers. From 1895 the girls had the right to learn at university.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{describing}} the form and the function of utterances. The data are children utterances {{in the form of}} sentence that are taken from children films manuscript, titled Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret. In collecting the data, the writer uses documentation method by selecting the children sentence utterances, which can be found in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret films manuscript. To achieve these objectives, she classifies the data based on sentence types to formulate the forms, and then she applies the speech act theory to judge the function. After analysing the data, the writer found the forms of children sentence uterances are declarative, interrogative, and imperative. Based on the form of declarative sentence, it can be classified into four (4) : simple sentence, compound sentence, complex sentence, and compound-complex sentence. From each imperative sentence, she finds that not all imperatives are initiated by predicate. There are imperatives which is marked by the marker Let and Don’t. Based on the interrogative sentence, she finds most of them are initiated by question words like what, who, where, and how. Besides that the writer also finds that interrogative does not always intiated by auxiliary, modal, or question words but also a subject in the innitial position of sentence Related with the function, she found declarative not only has function as informing, interrogative as asking, and imperative as commanding. The variant function of declarative are exclamation, commanding, warning, requesting, and offering, interrogative has variant function to <b>express</b> <b>requesting,</b> and imperative has variant function to <b>express</b> <b>requesting</b> and warning...|$|R

Nevertheless, they mostly utilized conventionally indirect (hearer-oriented condition) strategies in the form of ability/willingness/ permission. Regarding direct request, they employed obligatory, performative and imperative requests. It was also found that the more familiar the interlocutors the more direct they will make requests.
