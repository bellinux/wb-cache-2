5000|$|A <b>funeral</b> <b>procession</b> {{occurs during}} a state funeral on Pennsylvania or Constitution Avenue {{en route to}} the United States Capitol. Every <b>funeral</b> <b>procession</b> is led by a {{civilian}} police escort, usually by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. Next, the formal, ceremonial aspects of a procession are organized. A <b>funeral</b> <b>procession</b> uses a four-wheeled caisson to transport the flag-draped casket, which was originally intended to carry a 75 mm cannon when it was built in 1918. The caissons is drawn by a draft-mix of six same colored horses with three riders and a section chief mounted on a separate horse from the United States Army Caisson Platoon of the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment [...] "The Old Guard". In addition, two sets of four body bearers (eight total) will march on foot alongside both sides of the caissons transporting the flag-draped casket. The entire <b>funeral</b> <b>procession</b> is composed of three march units consisting of National Guard, reserve, active-duty, and academy personnel that represent the five branches of the United States Armed Forces. Moving at 3 miles per hour, the <b>funeral</b> <b>procession</b> begins in sight of the White House and travels to the United States Capitol. For former presidents, the casket is unloaded from a hearse and transferred to a caissons at 16th Street and Constitution Avenue in view of the South Lawn. The <b>funeral</b> <b>procession</b> then proceeds down Constitution Avenue. For sitting presidents, the casket is transferred at the North Portico entrance of the White House. Thereafter, the <b>funeral</b> <b>procession</b> proceeds down Pennsylvania Avenue. One rare exception for this <b>funeral</b> <b>procession</b> was during the state funeral of Gerald Ford on December 30, 2006. Respecting Ford's personal wishes of not having a <b>funeral</b> <b>procession</b> using a horse-drawn caissons, his casket was transported in a hearse to the United States Capitol and en route, stopped at the National World War II Memorial in order to pay tribute to his service in the United States Navy during World War II.|$|R
