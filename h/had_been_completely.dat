5|$|By {{this time}} the ship's age and {{limitations}} became increasingly apparent and she was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. The ship was paid off in April 1945 and, berthed at Loch Striven, {{was used to evaluate}} the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. Furious was sold in 1948 for scrap, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> broken up in Troon by 1954.|$|E
5|$|Constantinople and {{neighboring}} provinces also suffered extensive damage. Initially, {{it was thought}} that Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed. A letter from Petrovaradin described particular devastation in the Galata district, Topkapı Palace, the Hagia Sophia and the Edirne bazaar. The main shock and subsequent aftershocks lasted up to 30 minutes.|$|E

5|$|FEMA had {{announced}} that, {{in conjunction with}} Greyhound, the National Guard, and Houston Metro, the 25,000people at the Superdome would be relocated across state lines to the Houston Astrodome. Roughly 475 buses were promised by FEMA to ferry evacuees with the entire evacuation expected to take two days. By September 4, the Superdome <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> evacuated.|$|E
5|$|The {{fabric of}} the palace <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> {{neglected}} during the years in which the Grimaldi had been exiled from Monaco. Such was the state of disrepair {{that part of the}} east wing had to be demolished along with Honoré II's bathing pavilion, which stood on the site occupied today by the Napoleon Museum and the building housing the palace archives.|$|E
5|$|Construction began for Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D in September 2011. By April 2012, the {{previous}} ride <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> cleared, with {{the availability of}} an empty show building to accommodate the new ride. In June 2012, Warner Bros. Movie World released some images from inside the attraction, mid-way through its construction. On 3 September 2012, the park unveiled the Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D's Hall of Justice façade, which replaced the Wayne Manor façade from the former Batman attraction.|$|E

5|$|In spring 1537, Montejo sent {{reinforcements}} to Cáceres, who {{was still}} in the fertile Valley of Comayagua. By late spring or early summer, the valley <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> conquered. In December 1537, under orders from Montejo, Alonso de Cáceres founded the town of Santa María de Comayagua; it was sited in a strategic position half-way between the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. Cáceres then distributed the Indian settlements in encomienda. He collected reinforcements from Gracias a Dios, then returned immediately to Comayagua, and began to push eastwards towards Olancho.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland; {{two days}} later, Britain and France {{declared}} war on Germany, launching the Second World War. Within three weeks, the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the eastern regions of Poland in fulfilment of the secret Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Germany. A British Expeditionary Force (BEF) {{was sent to the}} Franco-Belgian border, but Britain and France did not take any direct action in support of the Poles. By 1 October, Poland <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> overrun.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of 5th Mounted Brigade decided to retire towards the Suez Canal, {{and the two}} squadrons from Romani joined him, abandoning much equipment to ride overnight to Bir el Nuss. Wiggin arrived at Dueidar at 09:00 on 24 April with two squadrons. The 5th Mounted Brigade <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> surprised; its commander and his important reserve force {{had been out of}} position at a critical time following false intelligence, and could not support his regiments. The three and a half squadrons at Oghratina and Katia were decimated—almost all were killed, wounded or captured.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} {{designed}} for a pre-school audience, featuring five performers who educate and entertain through music, movement and play. Music {{is an integral part}} of the series with the band's pop appeal resonating in the program. The segments of the show are based on an educational model. The original cast was composed of Kellie Crawford, Kathleen de Leon Jones, Nathan Foley, Tim Harding and Charli Robinson. This line-up <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> phased out by the end of 2008 and were replaced with a new line-up of performers. Hi-5 received three Logie Television Awards for Most Outstanding Children's Program.|$|E
5|$|Albert Bouchard <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> {{excluded}} from the retooling of the album for contractual reasons, but hoped to have his long work rewarded with a credit as co-producer, and to be paid accordingly. After the disbandment of Blue Öyster Cult, he contacted the other band members {{in an attempt to}} organize a 1987 reunion tour, with the original line-up, to promote Imaginos. His economic and membership requests were both rejected, due to resistances within the label and within the band, so he filed a lawsuit in 1989 against the management of Blue Öyster Cult and Columbia Records to receive payment for his work. The lawsuit was settled out of court, but his resentment towards Sandy Pearlman for what he felt was a theft of his work never eased, eliminating any chance of future collaborations for the completion of the Imaginos saga.|$|E
5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only {{managed to find}} {{a small number of}} top secret {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In the Maylands {{industrial}} area the worst affected buildings were the Northgate Information Solutions headquarters and the Fujifilm building. These buildings were so badly damaged they were rendered completely unusable. Demolition of the Fujifilm building began soon afterwards, and by June 2006 it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> {{removed from the}} site. Although the Northgate and Fujifilm buildings were closest to the blast, the surrounding Catherine House (to the north), Keystone Distribution building (to the west), 3Com Corporation and RO buildings (to the south), were also extensively damaged. In all, six buildings were designated for demolition and 30 more required major repairs before they could be reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at the June 1942 Battle of Midway, the IJN ordered the ship's unfinished hull converted into an aircraft carrier. Her hull was only 45 percent complete by that time, with structural work complete {{up to the}} lower deck and most of her machinery installed. The main deck, lower side armor, and upper side armor around the ship's magazines <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> installed, and the forward barbettes for the main guns were also nearly finished. The navy decided that Shinano would become a heavily armored support carrier—carrying reserve aircraft, fuel and ordnance in support of other carriers—rather than a fleet carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of Saborsko continued and both {{churches in the}} village were demolished by mid-December. By 1995, the entire village <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed except for two Serb-owned houses, which were badly damaged. After its capture, the village was renamed Ravna Gora by the SAO Krajina authorities. Croatian forces subsequently lost control of Slunj on 16 November {{and the rest of}} the pocket fell to the TG-2 when it captured Cetingrad on 29 November. The Saborsko Independent Company, which unsuccessfully defended Saborsko, was subsequently attached to Ogulin Home Guard Battalion, which was in turn amalgamated with other HV units to form the 143rd Home Guard Regiment.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the fire that {{destroyed}} the priory in 1289 {{can be seen in}} scorched paving between the surviving pillars. It was thought the church <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> rebuilt, but excavations in the 1980s show that a substantial amount of the less damaged west end was reused which resulted in a distinct inconsistency between the two ends, which were constructed in different architectural styles. Rebuilding was a major task that took several generations and was probably not completed {{until the end of the}} 14th century. It is unclear how much of the second priory survived the fire. Where the priory was rebuilt, its builders reused as much as possible; the core of the surviving eastern gable wall is full of fragments from the destroyed second priory.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{members were}} Kellie Crawford, Kathleen de Leon Jones, Nathan Foley, Tim Harding and Charli Robinson. Four of their albums reached the top10 on the ARIA Albums Chart, It's a Party (No.4, July 2000), Boom Boom Beat (No.3, August 2001), It's a Hi-5 Christmas (No.4, December 2001) and Hi-5 Hits (No.10, July 2003). This line-up <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> phased {{out by the}} end of 2008, following de Leon Jones, who left on maternity leave in 2006. The membership has since changed several times. The brand has produced numerous television series, music albums, worldwide tours and merchandise. The appeal of the group overseas has led to international versions. The television series features puppet characters Chatterbox and Jup Jup, who are popular associates of the group and are included in the live stage shows.|$|E
5|$|The works {{was shut}} down on 25 June 2007, after the Don burst its banks, and the entire site was engulfed by several feet of water. It {{remained}} submerged for over a week, {{with much of the}} equipment suffering catastrophic damage. Once the water subsided, imaginative ways had to be found to return it to operation within a reasonable time. The analyser which measures emissions from the incinerator plant <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed, and in order to mitigate a 16-week delivery time, the manufacturers removed one from a training centre at Telford, and it was hired by Yorkshire Water until a new unit could be supplied. The plant was recommissioned and operational just 18 days after its inundation.|$|E
