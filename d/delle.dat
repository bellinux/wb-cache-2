5|$|For {{the third}} {{consecutive}} year UConn successfully recruited the top ranked high school player in Elena <b>Delle</b> Donne, but shortly before enrolling at UConn <b>Delle</b> Donne requested a release from her scholarship, giving up basketball {{in order to stay}} closer to home and play volleyball at the University of Delaware; <b>Delle</b> Donne would eventually play basketball at Delaware, having a great college career that culminated in the #2 pick at 2013 WNBA draft. Despite losing <b>Delle</b> Donne the Huskies were ranked #1 in the preseason polls, having returned 10 players from the 2008 Final Four team (including All-Americans Maya Moore, Renee Montgomery and Tina Charles), in addition to Kalana Greene who recovered from her knee injury.|$|E
5|$|The concerto <b>delle</b> donne {{transformed}} the musica secreta. In the past, {{members of the}} audience would perform, and performers would become audience members. During the ascendancy of the concerto <b>delle</b> donne the roles within the musica secreta became fixed, as did the roster of those who performed for the Duke's pleasure every night.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{dissolution}} of the court in 1597, the musical style which was inspired by the concerto <b>delle</b> donne spread throughout Europe, and remained prominent for almost fifty years. The concerto <b>delle</b> donne was so influential and often imitated that it became a cliché of northern Italian courts. The concerto brought Alfonso and his court international prestige, as the ladies' reputation spread throughout Italy and southern Germany. It functioned as a powerful tool of propaganda, projecting an image of strength and affluence.|$|E
5|$|Filippo Paulucci <b>delle</b> Roncole died in Nice on 25 January 1849, and {{was later}} buried in Mirandola, near Modena, in the church of Saints James and Philip.|$|E
5|$|The concerto <b>delle</b> donne {{revolutionized}} {{the role of}} women in professional music, and continued the tradition of the Este court as a musical center. Word of the ladies' ensemble spread across Italy, inspiring imitations in the powerful courts of the Medici and Orsini. The founding of the concerto <b>delle</b> donne was the most important event in secular Italian music in the late sixteenth century; the musical innovations established in the court were important in the development of the madrigal, and eventually the seconda pratica.|$|E
5|$|At home to Juventus, Arsenal won 2–0 with goals from Fàbregas and Henry; {{the match}} was {{overshadowed by the}} return of former captain Vieira. A goalless draw at the Stadio <b>delle</b> Alpi meant the club progressed into the semi-finals against Villarreal.|$|E
5|$|From 1990 {{until the}} 2005–06 season, the Torinese side contested their home matches at Stadio <b>delle</b> Alpi, {{built for the}} 1990 FIFA World Cup, {{although}} in very rare circumstances the club played some home games in other stadia such as Renzo Barbera at Palermo, Dino Manuzzi at Cesena and the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza at Milan.|$|E
5|$|Having {{seen the}} concerto <b>delle</b> donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group {{made up of}} his family and a pupil. This {{ensemble}} was sponsored by the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing {{in the style of the}} concerto <b>delle</b> donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto <b>delle</b> donne performed. This group was formed by Alfonso's sister Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia's lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.|$|E
5|$|Room of Castagnoli: {{named after}} the painter of the ceiling frescoes. In this room are exposed Portraits of the Medici and Lorraine ruling families, and the Table of the Muses, a masterwork of stone-inlaid table {{realized}} by the Opificio <b>delle</b> Pietre Dure between 1837 and 1851.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentation}} of the various phrases of the construction {{makes no mention of}} anyone other than Bernardino <b>delle</b> Croci, {{but it is not clear}} if he really had the skills the create a sculptural structure of this type. A reappraisal of Brescian art of the period, as well as the clear evidence of the style, have led critics to assign to Cairano the execution of the stone parts of the monument, limiting <b>delle</b> Croci's involvement only to the bronze inserts. The jeweller, consequently, assumed the entire Martinengo commission but entrusted the parts outside his competence, most of the monument in fact, to the Cairano studio.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} musical innovation of the concerto <b>delle</b> donne was the multiplication of the ornamented upper voices, {{from one}} voice singing diminutions above an instrumental accompaniment {{to two or}} three voices singing varying diminutions at once. This practice, which listeners found remarkable, was imitated by many composers, including Carlo Gesualdo, Luca Marenzio and Claudio Monteverdi.|$|E
5|$|Zita of Bourbon-Parma (Zita Maria <b>delle</b> Grazie Adelgonda Micaela Raffaela Gabriella Giuseppina Antonia Luisa Agnese; 9 May 1892 – 14 March 1989) was {{the wife}} of Emperor Charles of Austria-Hungary. As such, she was the last Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, and many others (see Grand title of the Empress of Austria).|$|E
5|$|De Mauro {{was kidnapped}} {{on the evening}} of September 16, 1970, while coming back home from work, in the via <b>delle</b> Magnolie in Palermo. Thousands of police and Carabinieri with {{helicopters}} and dogs combed Sicily in vain in search of the reporter. De Mauro’s body has never been found, a victim of the so-called lupara bianca, despite intensive search efforts by Palermo police assisted by top-level forces from Rome and even a special investigative committee of the Italian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In {{an alley}} {{connecting}} Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore {{is the church}} of Santa Maria <b>delle</b> Scale. This church is interesting, though badly damaged in the earthquake. Only half the church was rebuilt in Baroque style, while the surviving half was kept in the original Norman (with Gothic features), thus demonstrating in one piece the evolution of Sicilian Baroque.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} Parchevich's efforts, {{conditions}} {{would not be}} favourable to a Bulgarian anti-Ottoman uprising until well after his death. While on a diplomatic mission to Pope Clement X, he died of illness in Rome {{in the summer of}} 1674 and was buried at the Sant'Andrea <b>delle</b> Fratte basilica in the city. Parchevich's letters and reports have been preserved and are an important source of information regarding his activities.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{questions}} on the later years of Cairano's career {{is that of the}} completion of the Martinengo mausoleum, the largest funereal monument of the Brescian renaissance. The commission to the jeweller and sculptor Bernardino <b>delle</b> Croci by the brothers Francesco and Antonio Il Martinengo of Padernello dated to 1503, with a term of three years for completion. The tomb was to house the remains of Bernardino Martinengo, the father of the two, who had left a bequest towards the work on his death in 1501 or 1502. However, it was still unfinished in 1516, when <b>delle</b> Croci was commissioned per a new contract to finish it by January 1518. The causes for the delay appear to have been, firstly, a commercial dispute between the jeweller and the clients, and secondly the war of 1512, which surely slowed the work, even if not entirely stopping it. It was not until 1516, following the reconquest of Brescia by the Venetian republic, that a new definitive agreement was made. The documents are incomplete but in fact the monument was completed and installed within the Corpus Christi church, probably within the terms of the contract.|$|E
5|$|The Vatican City State Railway {{branches}} {{off from}} the Rome to Viterbo railway line at the Roma San Pietro railway station and crosses Gelsomino valley via a 143.12 metre long masonry viaduct of eight 15.30 metre arches (bearing the Fasces and the Savoy Coat of Arms), which crosses Viale Vaticano (which it interrupts) and Via Aurelia. The Via <b>delle</b> Cave and the Via del Gelsomino are also interrupted by the viaduct and thus merge with the Via Aurelia.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Xgħajra {{features}} a heraldic representation of Santa Maria <b>delle</b> Grazie Tower, a now-demolished Wignacourt tower. In addition, De Redin towers are featured on the coats of arms of the Armed Forces of Malta (as well as its Air Wing), the Malta Stock Exchange, {{and the town of}} Pembroke. The coat of arms of Mtarfa feature a representation of Mtarfa Barracks, reflecting the role of the British military in the founding of the town.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{ensemble}} lay in an amateur group of high-placed courtiers who performed for each other {{within the context of}} the Duke's informal musica secreta in the 1570s. The ensemble evolved into an all-female group of professional musicians, the concerto <b>delle</b> donne, who performed formal concerts for members of the inner circle of the court and important visitors. Their signature style of florid, highly ornamented singing brought prestige to Ferrara and inspired composers of the time.|$|E
5|$|The singers of {{the second}} era of the concerto <b>delle</b> donne were officially ladies-in-waiting of Duchess Margherita Gonzaga d'Este, but were hired {{primarily}} as singers. Peverara's musical abilities prompted the Duke to specifically ask his wife Margherita to bring Peverara from Mantua {{as part of her}} retinue. The new singers played instruments, including the lute, harp, and viol, but focused their energies on developing vocal virtuosity. This skill became highly prized in the mid-sixteenth century, beginning with basses like Brancaccio, {{but by the end of}} the century virtuosic bass singing went out of style, and higher voices came into vogue. The ladies' musical duties included performing with the duchess' balletto <b>delle</b> donne, a group of female dancers who frequently crossdressed. Despite their upper-class background, the singers would not have been welcomed into the court's inner circle had they not been such skilled performers. D'Arco belonged to the nobility, but a minor family only. Peverara was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and Molza came from a prominent family of artists.|$|E
5|$|The {{world premiere}} of Dialogues des Carmélites (in Italian, as Dialoghi <b>delle</b> Carmelitane) was {{recorded}} and has been released on CD. The first studio recording was soon after the French premiere, and since then there {{have been at least}} ten live or studio recordings on CD or DVD, most of them in French but one in German and one in English.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification. Points were awarded for reaching {{the top of a}} climb towards the front of the race. Each climb will be categorized as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awards more points than the other first-category climbs. At , the Cima Coppi for the 2015 Giro d'Italia was the unpaved Colle <b>delle</b> Finestre.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} changed their name to Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli on 25 June 1964 {{they began to}} rise up again, gaining {{promotion}} in 1964–65. Under the management of former player Bruno Pesaola, they won the Coppa <b>delle</b> Alpi and were back amongst the elite in Serie A, with consistent top-five finishes. Napoli {{came very close to}} winning the league in 1967–68, finishing just behind Milan in second place. Some of the most popular players from this period were Dino Zoff, José Altafini, Omar Sívori and hometown midfielder Antonio Juliano. Juliano would eventually break the appearance records, which still stands today.|$|E
5|$|At {{the court}} in Ferrara, a {{collection}} of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, {{which led to the}} formation of the concerto <b>delle</b> donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to {{the court in}} 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers.|$|E
5|$|In 1606 Vincenzo's heir Francesco {{commissioned}} from Monteverdi {{the opera}} L'Orfeo, to a libretto by Alessandro Striggio, for the Carnival season of 1607. It was given two performances in February and March 1607; the singers included, {{in the title}} role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of Euridice witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600. This was followed in 1608 by the opera L'Arianna (libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini), intended for {{the celebration of the}} marriage of Francesco to Margherita of Savoy. All the music for this opera is lost apart from Ariadne's Lament, which became extremely popular. To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment Il ballo <b>delle</b> ingrate.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, Juventus {{returned}} {{to play in}} the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of <b>delle</b> Alpi. Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The capacity is 41,507. Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{worked in}} Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was {{commissioned}} {{to paint the}} Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The Last Supper for the monastery of Santa Maria <b>delle</b> Grazie. In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary on behalf of Ludovico to meet Matthias Corvinus, for whom he {{is believed to have}} painted a Holy Family. Between 1493 and 1495, Leonardo listed a woman called Caterina among his dependents in his taxation documents. When she died in 1495, the list of funeral expenditures suggests that she was his mother.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1990, England played West Germany in a World Cup semi-final {{match at}} Juventus's Stadio <b>delle</b> Alpi in Turin. Gascoigne, having already {{received}} a yellow card during England's 1–0 victory over Belgium {{in the second}} round, was booked for a foul on Thomas Berthold, which meant {{that he would be}} suspended for the final if England won the match. Television cameras showed that he had tears in his eyes following the yellow card and made Gascoigne a highly popular figure with the sympathetic British public. The match culminated in a penalty shoot-out, which the Germans won after Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle missed their penalties.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, Luigi Russolo, the Italian Futurist {{painter and}} composer, {{wrote of the}} {{possibilities}} of new music in his 1913 manifestoes The Art of Noises and Musica Futurista. He also invented and built instruments such as the intonarumori, mostly percussion, which were used in a precursor to the style known as musique concrète. One {{of the most influential}} events in early 20th century music was the return of Alfredo Casella from France in 1915; Casella founded the Società Italiana di Musica Moderna, which promoted several composers in disparate styles, ranging from experimental to traditional. After a dispute over the value of experimental music in 1923, Casella formed the Corporazione <b>delle</b> Nuove Musiche to promote modern experimental music.|$|E
5|$|The women {{performed}} up to {{six hours}} a day, either singing their own florid repertoire from memory, sight-reading from partbooks, or participating in the balletti as singers and dancers. Thomasin LaMay posits that {{the women of the}} concerti <b>delle</b> donne provided sexual favors for members of the court, but there is no evidence for this, and the circumstances of their marriages and dowries argues against this interpretation. The women were paid salaries and received other benefits, such as dowries and apartments in the ducal palace. Peverara received 300 scudi a year and lodging in the ducal palace for herself, her husband, and her mother - as well as a dowry of 10,000 scudi upon her marriage.|$|E
5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino <b>delle</b> Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E
5|$|At the Stadio <b>delle</b> Alpi, Filippo Inzaghi scored {{twice in}} the first 11 minutes to give Juve a 3–1 {{aggregate}} lead. Team captain Roy Keane, however, who was shown a yellow card preventing him from playing the final, headed in a Beckham cross. Dwight Yorke added a second to level the match just before the break. In the second half, Cole put United ahead {{for the first time}} in the match and the tie. Yorke was brought down by the Juve keeper in the area as he went round him, but the referee played the advantage and Cole tapped in from an acute angle. United held on for their first victory in Italy and booked their place in the Camp Nou for the final, against group opponents Bayern Munich.|$|E
5|$|At the palace, Nero tells Agrippina of his {{troubles}} {{and decides to}} renounce love for political ambition ("Come nube che fugge dal vento"). But Pallas and Narcissus have by now revealed Agrippina's original plot to Claudius, so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield the throne to Nero, he accuses her of treachery. She then claims that her efforts to secure the throne for Nero had all along been a ruse to safeguard the throne for Claudius ("Se vuoi pace"). Claudius believes her; nevertheless, when Poppaea, Otho, and Nero arrive, Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry, and that Otho shall have the throne. No one is satisfied with this arrangement, as their desires have all changed, so Claudius {{in a spirit of}} reconciliation reverses his judgement, giving Poppaea to Otho and the throne to Nero. He then summons the goddess Juno, who descends to pronounce a general blessing ("V'accendano le tede i raggi <b>delle</b> stelle").|$|E
5|$|Luzzaschi's book of madrigals for one, two, {{and three}} sopranos with {{keyboard}} accompaniment, published in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music {{may have been}} kept back from publication {{in order to maintain}} the secrecy of Alfonso's musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding to requests from Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto <b>delle</b> donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both that male singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means of filling in the counterpoint.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} final {{contract}} with <b>delle</b> Croci was in 1516 whereas Cairano was definitively dead in 1517: if Cairano indeed worked on the monument, it can be deduced from the documents {{that he would not}} have had sufficient time to finish it completely within the period, and consequently a large part of it must have been done before this date. This means admitting Cairano's involvement prior to 1516, which is not attested in the documents. Indeed, the same contract of 1516 asserts that the work was incomplete when installed in the church; it is unknown what its condition was at the time; and the remains of Bernardino Martinengo were already housed in it from the previous year. The implication is that the progress on the monument may have been near completion, at least in the structure and architectural components. The incompleteness alluded to in the documents of 1516 likely refer to the decorative inserts of various types, including the bronzes definitively due to della Croci.|$|E
5|$|Sport England {{wished to}} avoid {{creating}} a white elephant, so they {{insisted that the}} City Council agree to undertake and fund extensive work to convert CoMS from a track and field arena to a football stadium, thereby ensuring its long-term financial viability. Sport England hoped either Manchester City Council or Manchester City F.C. would provide the extra £50 million required to convert the stadium to a 65,000 seater athletics and footballing venue with movable seating. However, Manchester City Council {{did not have the}} money to facilitate movable seating and Manchester City were lukewarm about the idea. Stadium architects Arup Sport believed history demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football – and cited examples such as the Stadio <b>delle</b> Alpi and the Olympic Stadium with both Juventus and Bayern Munich moving to new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them.|$|E
