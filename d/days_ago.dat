5|$|To {{convince}} {{the rest of}} the colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a piece of mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be supposedly born {{when it was time to}} leave.

Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to {{convince the}} colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, whose eyes are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated on global warming and the dangers of staying in their colony.|$|E

40|$|Bites from brown recluse spiders (Loxosceles reclusa) {{result in}} several {{clinical}} manifestations, causing painful, disfiguring necrotic ulcers and, uncommonly, severe systemic effects. We report two cases reports with necrotic arachnidism from Turkey. A 21 -year-old man {{was admitted to}} our clinic with the complaints of pruritis, redness on his neck. He {{had a history of}} spider bite one <b>day</b> <b>ago.</b> A 52 -year-old woman had a cellulitis with hemorrhagic lesion and superficial necrosis on her arm and had a history of spider bite one <b>day</b> <b>ago.</b> Based on these clinical and epidemiological findings, a diagnosis of necrotic arachnidism was suspected, and the diagnosis of necrotic arachnidism was confirmed with these typical skin lesions and spiders bites in histories of patients. The outcome of our patients were good after antihistaminic, antibiotic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory treatments. The brown recluse spider is notorious for its necrosisinducing bite. Its venom contains a rare toxin, sphingomyelinase D, which activates the vascular endothelium and initiates a cascade of activation of neutrophils and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, resulting in tissue destruction. In many cases, diagnosis of spider bite is very difficult. Therefore, clinical and epidemiological findings, as well as a detailed history, may establish the diagnosis...|$|R

Now, they failed to chase down 233 set by the Scottish Saltires, after Jonathan Beukes smashed 92 and Yasir Arafat {{supplied}} with a 20-ball 32 including two sixes. It started well enough for Somerset, Graeme Smith continuing his fine form with 74, leading his team to 158 for 4. But then, the wheels fell off. Paul Hoffmann snared the important wicket of James Hildreth for 49, the lower order rolled over meekly to Arafat (who got 3-33), and with Jon Francis injured, the Sabres managed to lose the match by 15 runs as they were all out for 218.|$|E
25|$|Returning from Champion's League play, Lyon faced Rennes, who was {{responsible}} for the champions first loss of the season. The match remained even until the 66th minute when Kim Källström scored following a gifted pass from the youngster Miralem Pjanić. The scoreline remained until injury time when Rennes striker Jimmy Briand scored after receiving a nice through-ball which caught Lyon defender Cris off guard. Briand proceeded to get a shot on the ball off balance, which got past the charging Hugo Lloris to tie the match 1–1, the eventual final scoreline. Lyon followed this draw with a defeat taking on Lille, whom they had just contested three <b>days</b> <b>ago</b> in a Coupe de France tie. With the match being played at the Stade de France and the clubs entertaining a record crowd, Lyon fielded a pretty strong, yet questionable side with players Mathieu Bodmer and François Clerc returning from a long absence and also having the task of defeating Barcelona in Spain in the second leg of their Champion's League clash. In the match, Lyon failed constantly to get on the scoreboard with the former mastiff Kader Keïta missing on numerous opportunities. Lille made sure they made good on their chances with Róbert Vittek scoring the opening goal in the 60th minute and Michel Bastos finishing off Lyon, scoring the second goal in the 88th minute to pick up a 0–2 victory.|$|E
