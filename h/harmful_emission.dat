For example, France can obtain significant emission benefits from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by nuclear power plants; California, where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear plants can also secure substantial emission benefits. The U.K. also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as natural gas plants dominate the generation mix. On the other hand, emission benefits in Germany, China, India, and the central regions of the United States are limited or non-existent because most electricity is generated from coal.

50|$|In May 2007, Kerr-McGee Corp spent $18 {{million on}} {{pollution}} controls {{in the first}} comprehensive settlement under the Clean Air Act that reduced <b>harmful</b> <b>emission</b> and conserved natural gas at production facilities across Utah and Colorado. The settlement addressed violations discovered at several of Kerr-McGee's natural gas compressor stations located on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation near Vernal, Utah, and in the Denver Julesburg Basin near Weld County, Colorado. In addition to implementing pollution controls, the agreement required Kerr-McGee to pay a $200,000 penalty, and spend $250,000 on environmental projects to benefit {{the areas in which}} violations occurred. In July 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) settled with Kerr McGee Chemical in Henderson, Nevada that required the company to pay $55,392 penalty to resolve air permitting violations at its facility that began in 1993. The EPA cited Kerr-McGee for failing to install carbon monoxide emissions controls required under the Clean Air Act when it installed a new open hearth furnace in 1993. The company spent $4.8 million to install proper pollution controls at the facility reducing total carbon monoxide emission by 115 tons per year, an 80% reduction from previous levels.|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the debate}} over global climate change {{involves}} estimates of the direct costs of global climate change mitigation. Recently this debate has included the issue of ancillary benefits. These benefits consist mainly of health improvements. Although it is generally acknowledged that air pollution affects respiratory health, and that valuations of these impacts make up a significant proportion of the damage costs of air pollution, these impacts are often neglected when evaluating the costs of climate policy. Since reducing greenhouse gases has the effect of also reducing other pollutants affecting human health and labour productivity these effects should be taken into consideration. The analysis incorporates a linkage between air pollution and health effects into a general equilibrium model for Sweden through a theoretical consistent framework. Results from recent Swedish concentration-response and contingent valuation studies are used to model direct disutility and indirect health effects that negatively affects the productivity of labour. The costs of feedback effects on health and productivity are compared in three different scenarios for attaining the Swedish carbon dioxide target with alternative projected emission levels in the baseline scenario as well as alternative <b>harmful</b> <b>emission</b> levels. Results show that not including feedback effects could mean overstating the costs of climate policy.

40|$|AbstractThe {{extensive}} use of fossil fuels is depleting its reserve and produces <b>harmful</b> <b>emission</b> causing environmental issues. Hence, considerable {{attention has been given}} to alternative sources such as biodiesel. Currently, biodiesel is mainly produced from conventionally grown edible oil plants thus leading to a competition of usage of food versus fuel. The increasing criticism of the sustainability of first generation biodiesels (those derived from edible oils) has raised attention to the use of so-called second and third generation biodiesels. The second generation biodiesel includes non-edible vegetable oils, waste cooking oils as well as animal fats. These are considered as promising substitute for traditional edible food crops as they neither compete with food crops nor lead to land-clearing. This study introduces second generation biodiesel to be used as biodiesel feedstocks. Several aspects of these feedstocks are reviewed and discussed in this paper. These aspects include different sources of biodiesel feedstocks, biodiesel conversion technology and performance and emission characteristics of second generation biodiesel...|$|E
