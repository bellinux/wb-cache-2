5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated <b>herpes</b> <b>zoster.</b> The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Epigen&# 174; (Laboratorios Cheminova International) {{represents}} an up-to-date preparation {{the development of}} which resulted from the experience obtained {{in the field of}} traditional medicine. Its excellent antiviral properties have been repeatedly proven by many studies. The indications of and methods: 55 patient are as follows: herpes simplex-labialis, genitalis (vulvovaginitis herpetica, balanopostitis herpetica), <b>herpes</b> simplexrecidivans, <b>zoster,</b> HPV infections - verrucae, condylomata acuminata. Material and methods: 55 patients diagnosed with herpes simplex-labialis, genitalis (vulvovaginitis herpetica, balanopostitis herpetica), <b>herpes</b> simplexrecidivans, <b>zoster</b> and condylomata acuminata were being observed at six departments of dermatovenereology as part of an international multicentre study. The series of patients consisted of 26 men (with the average age of 38. 5) and 29 women (with the average age of 40. 5). The youngest patient was a 12 -year-old boy with herpes simplex, the oldest patient was a 78 -year-old woman with zosterfacialis. The most numerous group of patients consisted of individuals with herpes simplex and herpes simplex recidivans amountmg to the total of 24 patients. Results: 11 relapses were recorded. The tolerability of the preparation Epigen&# 174; was very good in all patients, none of the patients had to discontinue the therapy and no adverse effects were recorded. Even patients with disease relapses spontaneously decided to continue with the application of Epigen&# 174; after the termination of the study. The application of Epigen&# 174; has significantly accelerated the healing process in local manifestations. The application of Epigen&# 174; spray or cream in patients with herpetic infections was followed by desiccation of vesicles without crust formation, which significantly reduced the abuse of analgesics. The effect was excellent in minor manifestations of condylomata acuminata. The treatment of more extensive condylomata manifestations requires a combination of Epigen&# 174; application and cryotherapy. Conclusions: Epigen&# 174; cream and spray is a clear contribution to the portfolio of topically employed dermatologie agents...|$|R
30|$|Even though HIV {{infected}} {{individuals are}} at a very great risk for systemic TB, ocular TB is relatively rare. Ocular TB may cause features of anterior or posterior uveitis, amongst which tubercle granuloma is the commonest presentation [1, 2]. ATT is often initiated along with ART to treat the disease, following {{which most of the}} patients improve, but some patients may develop paradoxical reactions to therapy [3]. This occurs as the body is able to restore its capacity to mount an inflammatory response against either infectious or non-infectious antigens. The infectious agents implicated are mycobacteria, varicella <b>zoster,</b> <b>herpes</b> viruses, and cytomegalovirus [4].|$|R

30|$|The {{etiology}} of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease remains unclear. Suggested causative agents {{which have been}} isolated from lymph nodes exhibiting the disease include Ebstein-Barr virus, HIV, human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1, human herpesvirus type 6 and 8, hepatitis B virus, parvovirus B 19, <b>herpes</b> simplex, varicella <b>zoster,</b> cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Brucella, Yersinia enterolitica and parainfluenza virus (Kucukardali et al. 2007; Bosch et al. 2004; Bosch and Guilabert 2006). It has been proposed that these agents activate CD 8 -positive T cells leading to T-cell proliferation and apoptosis mediated by the Fas and perforin pathways. Engulfment of the apoptotic debris by macrophages would then give rise to the typical histological features. However, there is no conclusive evidence {{that any of these}} agents are the cause of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.

40|$|Background: To {{study the}} value and safety of aqueous humor {{polymerase}} chain reaction (PCR) analysis for <b>Herpes</b> simplex, varicella <b>zoster,</b> cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and Toxoplasma gondii in patients with uveitis. Methods: Records of 45 consecutive patients with anterior and posterior uveitis who underwent AC paracentesis with PCR were reviewed. The main outcome measure was frequency of PCR positivity. Secondary outcomes were alteration of treatment, safety of paracentesis, and correlation of keratitic precipitates with PCR positivity, Results: The overall PCR positivity was 48. 9 % (22 / 45). Therapy was changed because of the PCR results in 14 / 45 patients (37. 7 %). One patient experienced a paracentesis related complication (1 / 45, 2. 2 %) without long-term sequelae. Conclusion: Aqueous PCR altered the diagnosis and treatment in {{over a third of}} our patients and was relatively safe.

40|$|Fifty renal {{transplant}} {{patients were}} randomized to receive either 800 mg acyclovir by mouth four times daily or identical placebo tablets for prophylaxis of herpes simplex infection. Patients were followed weekly to assess reactivation of <b>herpes</b> simplex, varicella <b>zoster</b> virus, Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. The patients received standard immunosuppressive regimens including cyclosporine A. Acyclovir suppressed secretion of {{herpes simplex virus}} in treated patients (P= 0. 001). Three episodes of mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus occurred in placebo recipients and one in a noncompliant acyclovir recipient. A clinically important difference in graft survival was demonstrated, but because of sample size failed to reach statistical significance (P= 0. 11). No reactivation of varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus or CMV infection was detected in either group. Toxicity was limited to central nervous irritability.

40|$|The current {{repertoire}} of approved anti-herpesviral drugs consists primarily of nucleoside analogues that inhibit viral replication by targeting the virus-encoded DNA polymerase. This class of agents {{has been critical}} in controlling infections by <b>herpes</b> simplex, varicella <b>zoster,</b> and cytomegalovirus. However, because nucleoside analogues share a similar mechanism of action, treatment options are limited once resistance develops. This becomes an important medical issue {{with respect to the}} treatment of disease caused by resistant viral strains, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Furthermore, several of the currently available therapies can result in mild to severe side effects making the discovery of less toxic drugs desirable. Efforts over the last decade have focused on the identification and development of improved therapies including less toxic compounds with novel mechanisms of action. Here we review the progress that has been made in targeting the DNA packaging and encapsidation process as a novel target for chemotherapy. Several recently identified compounds may warrant further development as a medically important group of herpesviral encapsidation inhibitors...|$|R
