2500|$|Following {{the death}} of Simon van der Stel in 1712 the estate was divided into three parts – Groot (Great) Constantia, Klein (Little) Constantia and Bergvliet. Under the {{ownership}} of Johannes Colijn Klein Constantia {{continued to be a}} standard bearer for Cape wine. In the 1770s, Groot Constantia was sold to a businessman from Stellenbosch named Hendrik Cloete, who replanted the vineyards and rebuilt the cellars in an attempt to revive the reputation of the estate. He employed nearly 100 slaves and stationed them throughout the vineyard, charged with ensuring that not a single insect landed on the vines. It was Cloete's dedication (and later that of his son, also named Hendrik) that raised the prestige of the estate and led to its prompt discovery by the invading British. In his 1816 work, Topographie de Tous les Vignobles Connus, the French oenologist André Jullien included the wines of Constantia in the highest category of his <b>expansive</b> quality <b>classification</b> of the world's wine. Ranking it just below the wines of Tokay, Jullien described the dessert wine of Constantia as [...] "...among the finest liqueur wines of the world...".|$|R

5000|$|Brief {{historical}} {{record of the}} development of the modern library and classification systems by Charles Ammi Cutter (Cutter <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification</b> system, which was the basis for the top categories of the Library of Congress classification) as well Colon classification developed by S. R. Ranganathan, an example of a faceted classification system and perhaps the most prominent classification system in the Western world, the Dewey Decimal System created by Melvil Dewey ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1880 Cutter {{introduced}} an avant-garde and divergent system of cataloging he termed the Cutter <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification.</b> This system incorporated seven levels of classification {{with the most}} basic libraries operating at the first level and the grandest, most distinguished institutions utilizing the seventh level, and it was Cutter's aspiration to orchestrate a classification system for every type of library. The classification system utilized an alpha-numeric methodology used to abbreviate authors' names and generate unique call numbers known as ("Cutter numbers" [...] or [...] "Cutter codes"). These are still used today in libraries. It was this classification which {{laid the foundation for}} the Library of Congress Subject Headings and the Sear's List of subject Headings. Interestingly, when Cutter began to delegate a new system for the library he initially chose the Dewey Decimal Classification, however determined it was more beneficial to assign a more distinct adaptation for the collection. Even though Cutter's <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification</b> was recognized as a significant contribution to libraries and to the burgeoning field of library science, Cutter himself did not champion its success nor did he anticipate future editions of his system.|$|E
50|$|Many {{libraries}} {{found this}} system too detailed and complex for their needs, and Cutter received many requests from librarians at small libraries {{who wanted the}} classification adapted for their collections. He devised the <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification</b> in response, {{to meet the needs}} of growing libraries, and to address some of the complaints of his critics. Cutter completed and published an introduction and schedules for the first six classifications of his new system (Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications), but his work on the seventh was interrupted by his death in 1903.|$|E
50|$|The Code was {{intended}} as an improvement of existing schemes such as Dewey Decimal Classification, Cutter <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification</b> and James Duff Brown's Subject Classification. Merrill contrasted the art of classifying from the science of classification, and categorized himself as a practical classifier; his interest was the practice of library classification. The 1928 Code includes 300 rules that Merrill had used for classifying materials in the Newberry Library. There are two sections of such rules, for “The One-topic book” and “The Two-topic book.” In the 1939 edition, this had increased to 365 rules.|$|E
50|$|The {{classification}} {{was invented}} by Herbert Putnam in 1897, just before he assumed the librarianship of Congress. With advice from Charles Ammi Cutter, it was influenced by his Cutter <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification,</b> the Dewey Decimal System, and the Putnam Classification System (developed while Putnam was head librarian at the Minneapolis Public Library). It was designed specifically for the purposes and collection of the Library of Congress to replace the fixed location system developed by Thomas Jefferson. By the time Putnam departed from his post in 1939, all the classes except K (Law) and parts of B (Philosophy and Religion) were well developed.|$|E
50|$|It was in Council Bluffs that Martel {{would finally}} find his career. While in Council Bluffs, Martel {{heard of the}} Newberry Library in Chicago and by 1892 had gained {{employment}} there as an assistant cataloguer under the esteemed librarians Dr. William F. Poole and James C.M. Hanson (1864-1943), who he would learn from and team up with at the Library of Congress. While at Newberry, Martel was first introduced to Charles Ammi Cutter’s Cutter <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification</b> system (EC) for cataloguing and classifying library resources. In 1893 James Hanson had left but the friendship developed in that single year of working together would be a boon {{for both of them}} in the years to come.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Ammi Cutter became {{librarian}} in 1869, succeeding William Frederick Poole. Until this point, {{work had}} been uninspired on the comprehensive catalog of the library’s holdings. The Athenæum’s exhibition area opened up when the Museum of Fine Arts moved the collections into their own space overlooking Copley Square. Cutter {{took advantage of the}} space, using it to spread out the collections and to revise and complete the five-volume catalog. He created his own classification system, known as <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification,</b> in order to revise and finish the five-volume catalog. Later, the Cutter system became the basis for the Library of Congress classification system; the sections of call number used to alphabetically designate authors’ names are still known as [...] "Cutter numbers" [...] in the Library of Congress system.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 1876 by Melvil Dewey, Library Journal {{originally}} declared {{itself to}} be the [...] "official organ of the library associations of America and of the United Kingdom." [...] Indeed, the journal's original title was American Library Journal, though [...] "American" [...] {{was removed from the}} title after the first year. Its early issues focused on the growth and development of libraries, with feature articles by such prominent authors as R. R. Bowker, Charles Cutter, and Melvil Dewey, and focusing on cataloging, indexing, and lending schemes. In its early issues, Bowker discussed cataloging principles; Cutter, creator of the Cutter <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification</b> system, developed his ideas; and managing editor Dewey made recommendations for early library circulation systems. Initially, Library Journal did not review books unless they related to librarians' professional interests, but then, like now, the journal ran articles on collection development and ads from publishers recommending their forthcoming books for libraries to purchase.|$|E
50|$|In 1893, Cutter {{submitted}} {{a letter to}} the trustees that he would not seek to renew his contract {{at the end of the}} year. Fortunately for him, there was an opportunity in Northampton, Massachusetts. Judge Charles E. Forbes left a considerable amount of money to the town to start a library. This was Cutter’s chance to institute his ideas from the ground up. He developed a cataloging system called the <b>expansive</b> <b>classification</b> system. It was to have seven levels of classification, each with increasing specificity. Thus small libraries who did not like having to deal with unnecessarily long classification numbers could use lower levels and still be specific enough for their purpose. Larger libraries could use the more specific tables since they needed to be more specific to keep subjects separate. Unfortunately, he died in 1903 before he could finish. At Forbes, Cutter set up the art and music department and encouraged children of nearby schools to exhibit their art. He also established branch libraries and instituted a traveling library system much like the bookmobile. Today, Charles Ammi Cutter might be surprised to see his own portrait hanging over the reference librarians' desk in the Forbes Library in Northampton. His roll top desk is also in the office currently occupied by the recently elected director of the library.|$|E
5000|$|In 1881, an {{addition}} was built, which doubled the library's capacity. This also allowed more space for federal documents, since Judge Daniel Clark declared the library a federal depository site in 1884. Early catalogs were {{compiled by the}} trustees as books, after which they switched to a dictionary card catalog in 1894. These cards contained the author, title, subject, and form of the books, and were listed in alphabetical order. Books {{were placed on the}} shelves in a [...] "fixed location" [...] which was indicated on its card, {{as well as a number}} on the shelf, but they were not grouped by subject. As a result, if they were moved to another shelf, the numbers became useless. Eventually, that same year, the library was rearranged and classified by the Cutter <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification</b> system, which grouped the books together by subject, and the number assigned to each remained permanent. Staff began using Library of Congress cards in 1902. The first children's card catalog was created in 1906, but it wasn't until 1907 that the age limit restricting children from officially using the library was abolished. However, there was still no dedicated Children's Room at that point. Last, but not least, one of the most troublesome issues faced occurred in 1908, when there was an infestation of termites in many books, documents, and even the oak posts of the building. Once cement floors were put down, however, the problem was eradicated.|$|E
50|$|Work on {{classifying}} the library’s immense {{collection of}} books began in 1899 with Martel becoming {{a member of a}} committee formed and headed by Herbert Putnam, the new Head Librarian, following the death of John Young and William Parker Cutter. Putnam sent Martel and Hanson to libraries located across the nation to find a classification system that would work with the collection. In 1899, the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system was the most popular system in the libraries and it was a natural choice for the classifiers, but in an effort to look at all available options, Cutter’s <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification</b> and one developed by the German theologian Otto Hartwig were also examined. Martel quickly ruled out Hartwig’s system because it emphasized religion too much, but couldn’t decide between Dewey’s system and Cutter’s. Both systems needed major adjustments in order to be adapted to the Library of Congress’ special needs and it ultimately became a matter of who would allow those changes to be made. By the end of 1899, Martel rejected Dewey’s system because Melvil Dewey was unwilling to allow the library to make the necessary changes. This began a two-year-long controversy between the two giants of the library as each criticized the other over perceived slights in the decisions about changes needed to adapt the DDC. In the end the only real winner was Charles Ammi Cutter, who agreed to allow Martel and Hanson to make whatever changes they needed to his EC. Unfortunately, Cutter died in 1903 while finishing the final stage of the EC and thus Martel was forced to finish the system as he worked through the library’s collection.|$|E

40|$|Why are art {{and craft}} so widely {{separated}} in the Library of Congress Classification (LC) System? All classification systems give insight into worldviews prevalent {{at the time they}} were created, and library systems are especially illustrative of the cultures and cultural moments which shaped them. The separation of {{art and craft}} in LC, in N and TT respectively, compared to their collocation in LC’s contemporaries, Dewey Decimal Classification and Cutter’s <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification,</b> suggests divergent views of the arts within librarianship, illuminating American views on the relative definitions of art and craft from the mid-nineteenth through the early twentieth centuries...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the variety}} of {{approaches}} to mapping the universe of knowledge that have been presented and discussed in the literature, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to systematize their main principles and their applications in the major general modern library classification schemes. We conducted an analysis of the literature on classification and the main classification systems, namely Dewey/Universal Decimal Classification, Cutter’s <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification,</b> Subject Classification of J. D. Brown, Colon Classification, Library of Congress Classification, Bibliographic Classification, Rider’s International Classification, Bibliothecal Bibliographic Klassification (BBK), and Broad System of Ordering (BSO). We conclude that the arrangement of the main classes can be done following four principles that are not mutually exclusive: ideological principle, social purpose principle, scientific order, and division by discipline. The paper provides examples and analysis of each system. We also conclude that as knowledge is ever-changing, classifications also change and present a different structure of knowledge depending upon the society and time of their design...|$|E
40|$|Libraries {{deal with}} {{recorded}} knowledge. Classification systems play a fundamental {{role in the}} organization, display, retrieval and access of the knowledge and materials in libraries. During the last one and a half century, formal classification systems and standards have been developed to replace the previous generic categorization. Such the systems are very famous, known and used by the libraries internationally. Some of these international standard systems include: Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC); Charles Ammi Cutter’s <b>Expansive</b> <b>Classification</b> (EC); The Subject Classification of James Duff Brown (SC); American Library of Congress Classification (LCC); Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) : Henry E. Bliss’ Bibliographic Classification (BC); and S. R. Ranganathan’s Colon Classification (CC). These systems have served the purpose adequately in many of the knowledge areas and disciplines. Nevertheless, there are some of the areas which lack proper intention and treatment in these fit-for-all standard classification systems. The background and context of the devisers has been a strong reason behind this problem. Islamic knowledge is also among the areas, which has not been properly addressed by these systems. This paper examines this problem and presents a potential solution for the problem...|$|E

Therefore, libraries with rich collections on Islam face the problem of classification. In response of this problem, different libraries have adopted different types of practices and systems. This trend has created problems of access and retrieval for the users of these collections. This study was conducted to address this problem. Scholars in library and information science and scholars in Islamic studies were selected as participants.
