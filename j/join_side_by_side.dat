5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then <b>join</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side,</b> in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E

50|$|Manufactured bamboo {{floors are}} {{typically}} made available in planks with either vertical- or horizontal-grain orientation. In vertical bamboo floors, the component pieces are stood vertically on their narrowest edge and then press laminated side to side. The {{effect is a}} lined, almost uniform look {{to the surface of}} the finished floor plank. In horizontal bamboo floors, the slats are arranged in a horizontal direction, on their widest edge, and then <b>joined</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> with adjacent pieces using a high-pressure laminate system. The characteristic nodes of the bamboo are visible on the finished horizontal surface.|$|R
50|$|After seeing Panhard's Daimler-designed V-twin engine {{demonstrated}} at the Paris Exposition of 1889 and inquiring {{into the}} engine's weight and power, Armand Peugeot stated {{his interest in}} a lightweight motor vehicle powered by the engine. This was communicated to Daimler, who worked with Wilhelm Maybach to develop the vehicle. The tubular steel frame resembled two bicycles <b>joined</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> and was made <b>by</b> bicycle manufacturer Neckarsulmer Stahlfabriken, which would later become part of NSU Motorenwerke. The cooling water for the engine was run through the frame tubes.|$|R
5000|$|Papyrus [...] is a {{material}} similar to thick paper {{that was used}} in ancient times as writing surface. It was made from the pith of the papyrus plant, Cyperus papyrus, a wetland sedge. Papyrus (plural: papyri) can also refer to a document written on sheets of such material, <b>joined</b> together <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> and rolled up into a scroll, an early form of a book.|$|R
50|$|Lockers {{are usually}} {{physically}} <b>joined</b> together <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> in banks, and are commonly made from steel, although wood, laminate, and plastic are other materials sometimes found. Steel lockers which are banked together share side walls, and are constructed by {{starting with a}} complete locker; further lockers may then be adding by constructing the floor, roof, rear wall, door, and just one extra side wall, the existing side wall of the previous locker serving as the other side wall of the new one. The walls, floors, and roof of lockers may be either riveted together (the more traditional method) or, more recently, welded together.|$|R
6000|$|That red {{capsicum}} is {{the foot}} of the animal contained in the cockleshell. By its aid it crawls, leaps, and burrows in the sand, where it lies drinking in the salt water through one of its siphons, and discharging it again through the other. Put the shell into a rock pool, or a basin of water, and you will see the siphons clearly. The valves gape apart some three-quarters of an inch. [...] The semi-pellucid orange [...] "mantle" [...] fills the intermediate space. [...] Through that mantle, at the end from which the foot curves, the siphons protrude; two thick short tubes <b>joined</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side,</b> their lips fringed with pearly cirri, or fringes; and very beautiful they are. The larger is always open, taking in the water, which is at once the animal's food and air, and which, flowing over the delicate inner surface of the mantle, at once oxygenates its blood, and fills its stomach with minute particles of decayed organized matter. The smaller is shut. Wait a minute, and it will open suddenly and discharge a jet of clear water, which has been robbed, I suppose, of its oxygen and its organic matter. But, I suppose, your eyes will be rather attracted by that same scarlet and orange foot, which is being drawn in and thrust out to a length of nearly four inches, striking with its point against any opposing object, and sending the whole shell backwards with a jerk. The point, you see, is sharp and tongue-like; only flattened, not horizontally, like a tongue, but perpendicularly, so as to form, as it was intended, a perfect sand-plough, by which the animal can move at will, either above or {{below the surface of the}} sand.

50|$|One of {{the famous}} myths of Pan {{involves}} the origin of his pan flute, fashioned from lengths of hollow reed. Syrinx was a lovely wood-nymph of Arcadia, daughter of Landon, the river-god. As she was returning from the hunt one day, Pan met her. To escape from his importunities, the fair nymph ran away and didn't stop to hear his compliments. He pursued from Mount Lycaeum until she came to her sisters who immediately changed her into a reed. When the air blew through the reeds, it produced a plaintive melody. The god, still infatuated, took some of the reeds, {{because he could not}} identify which reed she became, and cut seven pieces (or according to some versions, nine), <b>joined</b> them <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> in gradually decreasing lengths, and formed the musical instrument bearing the name of his beloved Syrinx. Henceforth Pan was seldom seen without it.|$|R
40|$|A {{microprocessor-controlled}} {{lighting system}} generates brief, precisely timed, high-intensity {{flashes of light}} for scientific imaging at frame rates up to about 1 kHz. The system includes an array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that are driven in synchronism with an externally generated timing signal (for example, a timing signal generated by a video camera). The light output can be varied in peak intensity, pulse duration, pulse delay, and pulse rate, all depending on the timing signal and associated externally generated control signals. The array of LEDs comprises as many as 16 LED panels that can be attached together. Each LED panel is a module consisting of a rectangular subarray of 10 by 20 LEDs of advanced design on a printed-circuit board in a mounting frame with a power/control connector. The LED panels are controlled by an LED control module that contains an AC-to-DC power supply, a control board, and 8 LED-panel driver boards. In prior LED panels, the LEDs are packaged at less than maximum areal densities in bulky metal housings that reduce effective active areas. In contrast, in the present LED panels, the LEDs are packed at maximum areal density so as to afford 100 -percent active area and so that when panels are <b>joined</b> <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> to form the array, there are no visible seams {{between them and the}} proportion of active area is still 100 percent. Each panel produces an illuminance of. 5 x 10 (exp 4) lux at a distance of 5. 8 in. (approx. 1. 6 cm). The LEDs are driven according to a pulse-width-modulation control scheme that makes it safe to drive the LEDs beyond their rated steady-state currents in order to generate additional light during short periods. The drive current and the pulse-width modulation for each LED panel can be controlled independently of those of the other 15 panels. The maximum allowable duration of each pulse of drive current {{is a function of the}} amount of overdrive, the total time to be spent in overdrive operation, and the limitations of the LEDs. The system is configured to limit the overdrive according to values specific to each type of LED in the array. These values are coded into firmware to prevent inadvertent damage to the LED panels...|$|R
50|$|Noel, Noel was {{the first}} concert of the season. It was {{presented}} at Carnegie Hall for two performances on December 21 and 22, 1988. A newly commissioned work, Good Cheer, by composer Gregg Smith was given its world premiere at this concert. The spring concert was {{a celebration of the}} music of Stephen Sondheim. Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center was the setting for Sondheim Tonight! presented on April 2, 1989. There were performances from many Broadway actors who had appeared in Mr. Sondheim's musicals. Among the guests were Dean Butler, Nancy Dussault, Joy Franz, Ann Harada, James Judy, Larry Kert, Sharon McNight, Ron Raines, Debbie Shapiro, Elaine Stritch, Julie Wilson and BD Wong. At the conclusion of the evening, All guests <b>joined</b> in <b>Side</b> <b>By</b> <b>Side</b> for the finale when Mr. Sondheim ran from the seats to join the cast for the final bow. Once again the pride concert was presented at Alice Tully Hall for three performances on June 21, 23, and 24. Each night featured a different guest. Former Chorus member Michael Callen was featured at the performance on the 21st. The Stonewall Chorale was the guest for the performance on June 23, and the subgroups of the Chorus, the Chamber Choir and Uptown Express, were the guests for the final performance on June 24, 1989.|$|R

Filtration tests were conducted by using clear water by varying the pressure head on the system with no head media with head media for the purpose to identify the performance of Bengkulu coastal sand as capillary-gravitational SSF media. Result of test showed that with no head media, there was no water flow through the system, whenever pressure head applied lower than the pressure head level. With head media, on the other hand; the flow would take place eventhough the pressure head much less then the pressure head level. Characteristic of capillary flow was also identified...|$|R
