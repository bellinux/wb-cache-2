40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>enemies</b> (pathogens and herbivores) {{have been}} {{hypothesized}} to maintain plant species diversity by causing greater impacts on common species than rare species thus preventing competitive exclusion. While {{the role of}} <b>plant</b> <b>enemies</b> in producing distance-or density dependent mortality in seeds and seedlings is well-documented, the exclusive focus on these effects provides limited understanding {{of the effects of}} <b>enemies</b> on <b>plant</b> communities. Understanding the role of <b>plant</b> <b>enemies</b> in maintaining diversity requires a broader approach that considers how abundance of a plant species determines the composition of the community of enemies that attack it as well as relates the demographic effects of enemies on the growth of their host plant populations to the diversity of the entire plant community. The accumulation of <b>plant</b> <b>enemies</b> is hypothesized to be a passive, sampling process which predicts more common plant species, i. e. larger in individual size and more wide-spread, are attacked by more enemy species than smaller-statured and more geographically-restricted species. I test this hypothesis in a comparative analysis of 490 plant species and find that, as predicted, the richness of fungal pathogens infecting a plant species increases with plant species’ individual size and geographic distribution. To test the hypothesis that <b>plant</b> <b>enemies</b> maintain <b>plant</b> diversity by limiting the growth of populations of competitively superior plant species through density-dependent disease or herbivory, I investigated the interactions between the host-specific fungal pathogen, Puccinia podophyllii and its host Mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum) as well as the effects of this interaction upon the species abundance and composition of the entire plant community in the forests of Washtenaw County, Michigan. I find that Mayapple is strong competitor reducing plant species seedling survival and the diversity of the plant community. Next, I find that the pathogen decreases host population growth by causing strong distance-dependent seedling survival and by reducing growth and reproductive rates. Furthermore, I show that rates of disease transmission and levels of disease severity increase with Mayapple density. The results strongly support the hypothesis that <b>plant</b> <b>enemies</b> maintain <b>plant</b> species diversity and provide the most complete demonstration, to date, of their diversity-enhancing role...|$|R

40|$|Human {{activities}} are triggering {{some of the}} most rapid losses of biodiversity in the history of life on Earth. Eutrophication, overexploitation, habitat destruction and fragmentation are the main drivers of this decrease in species richness. There is increasing evidence that this reduction of diversity will have dramatic impacts on the functioning of the natural ecosystems of the world, and on their ability to provide society with a variety of essential ecosystem services. It is therefore urgent to understand the causal mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of diversity and their potential use for restoration to develop effective conservation policies. In this thesis, I examine several potential mechanisms for the maintenance or loss of plant diversity.

40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} general and {{specific}} defense mechanisms {{to protect themselves}} from diverse enemies, including herbivores and pathogens. To maintain fitness in the presence of <b>enemies,</b> <b>plant</b> defense mechanisms are aimed at inducing systemic resistance: in response to the attack of pathogens or herbivores, plants initiate extensive changes in gene expression to activate “systemic acquired resistance” against pathogens and “indirect defense” against herbivores. Recent work revealed that leaf infestation by whiteflies, stimulated systemic defenses against both an airborne pathogen and a soil-borne pathogen, which was confirmed by the detection of the systemic expression of pathogenesis-related genes in response to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid-signaling pathway activation. Further investigation revealed that plants use self protection mechanisms against subsequent herbivore attacks by recruiting beneficial microorganisms called plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria/fungi, which are capable of reducing whitefly populations.

We focus on above-ground and below-ground interactions of <b>plants,</b> <b>enemies</b> and symbionts, on plant defences, and on nutrient cycling. Conclusions: Range-expansion by plants may result in above-ground and below-ground enemy release. This enemy release can {{be due to the}} higher dispersal capacity of plants than of natural <b>enemies.</b> Moreover, lower-latitudinal <b>plants</b> can have higher defence levels than plants from temperate regions, making them better defended against herbivory.

Leaf chemical composition, leaf nitrogen and potassium contents, trichome density, canopy height, plant age, predators, parasitoids, total rainfall and median temperature were evaluated and their relationships with whitefly on okra were determined.

Plants senescence and natural enemies, mainly Encarsia sp., Chrysoperla spp. and Coccinellidae, were some of the factors that most contributed to whitefly reduction. The second okra plantation, 50 m apart from the first, was strongly attacked by whitefly, probably because of the insect migration from the first to the second plantation.

40|$|Among other {{consequences}} in plants, hybridization {{may influence the}} expression and evolution of resistance to natural <b>enemies.</b> <b>Plant</b> resistance to parasites, including both microbial pathogens and herbivores, is often mediated by the composition of second-ary metabolites expressed by the plant. Here, we focus on pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), a class of secondary metabolites that exhibits high structural diversity among species within the plant genus Senecio. We examine PA composition in Senecio jacobaea, S. aquaticus, artificially generated F 1 hybrids, and also later gener-ation natural hybrids between these two species. We test the hypothesis that hybridization may contribute to PA diversity with-in plants, by comparing PA expression in hybrids to that in parents {{across a range of}} water and nutrient treatments. We report that hybrids produce a putatively novel PA, and that this PA is con-served in natural hybrids, which are highly backcrossed to S. jacobaea. Also, the range of PA concentration and diversity is more extreme in the roots and shoots of artificial hybrids over var-ious environmental conditions, and high ranges are preserved in the shoots of natural hybrids. These results suggest that hybridiza-tion may partially explain the diversity of PAs found within the Senecio genus. Also, hybridization may increase the variation upon which selection can act in hybrid populations, such that some hybrids have the potential to be more resistant to natural enemies than parental individuals...|$|R

Using a quantitative food web approach we evaluated the impacts of an invasive plant on plant-herbivore-parasitoid communities, asking specifically how diet breadth influences the propagation of such impacts. Measuring the impact of the alien plant at the plant level seriously underestimated the community-level effect of this weed as it also caused changes in the abundance of native herbivores and parasitoids, along with a decrease in parasitoid species richness. The invading plant affected specialist and generalist subsets of communities differently, having significant and strong negative impacts on the abundance of all specialists with no negative effect on generalist consumers. Specialist consumer decline led to further disruptions of top-down regulatory mechanisms, releasing generalist species from competition via shared natural <b>enemies.</b> <b>Plant</b> invasion also significantly increased the evenness of species abundance of all trophic levels in the food webs, as well as the evenness of species interaction frequency.
