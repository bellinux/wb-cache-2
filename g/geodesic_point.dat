40|$|The {{notion of}} partial {{geodesic}} {{was introduced by}} Jamshidpey et al. in "Sets of medians in the non-geodesic pseudometric space of unsigned genomes with breakpoints", 2014. In this paper, we study the density of points on non-trivial partial geodesics between two permutations ξ_ 1 ^(n) and ξ_ 2 ^(n) chosen uniformly and independently at random from the symmetric group S_n, where S_n is endowed with the breakpoint distance. For a permutation π := π_ 1 [...] . π_n, any unordered pair {π_i, π_i+ 1 }, for i= 1, [...] ., n- 1, is called an adjacency of π. The set of all adjacencies of π is denoted by A_π. Denote by id^(n) the identity permutation, and let I_n be an arbitrary subset of A_id^(n). We classify the set of all adjacencies of a permutation π∈ S_n into four types, with respect to I_n. Then for a permutation ξ^(n) chosen uniformly at random from S_n, we derive a convergence theorem for the normalized number (after dividing by n) of adjacencies of each type in ξ^(n) with respect to I_n (for some random or deterministic choices of I_n), as n→∞. We also see an application of this convergence theorem to find the appropriate choices of I_n. A <b>geodesic</b> <b>point</b> of u and v in a pseudometric space (S,ρ) is a point w of the space that ρ(u,w) +ρ(w,v) =ρ(u,v). We find an upper bound {{for the number of}} permutations x∈ S_n for which there exists at least one non-trivial <b>geodesic</b> <b>point</b> between id^(n) and x, far from both. This partially verifies the conjecture of Haghighi and Sankoff stated in "Medians seek the corners, and other conjectures", 2012, namely we prove that, with high probability, there is no breakpoint median of two permutations ξ_ 1 ^(n) and ξ_ 2 ^(n) chosen uniformly and independently at random from S_n, far from both of them...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for finding a meaningful vertex-to-vertex correspondence between two triangle meshes, {{which is designed}} to handle general non-rigid transformations. Our algorithm operates on embeddings of the two shapes in the spectral domain so as to normalize them with respect to uniform scaling and rigid-body transformation. Invariance to shape bending is achieved by relying on approximate <b>geodesic</b> <b>point</b> proximities on a mesh to capture its shape. To deal with moderate stretching, we first raise the issue of “eigenmode switching ” and discuss heuristics to bring the eigenmodes to alignment. For additional non-rigid discrepancies in the spectral embeddings, we propose to use non-rigid alignment via thin-plate splines. This is combined with a refinement step based on geodesic proximities to improve dense correspondence. We show empirically that our algorithm outperforms previous spectral methods, as well as schemes that compute correspondence in the spatial domain via non-rigid iterative closest points or the use of local shape descriptors, e. g., 3 D shape context. Finally, to speed up our algorithm, we examine the effect of using subsampling and Nyström method...|$|E

We give explicit expressions for this universal threepoint function both in the grand-canonical and canonical ensembles. Various limiting regimes are studied {{when some of the}} distances become large or small. By considering the case where the marked vertices are aligned, we also obtain the probability law for the number of <b>geodesic</b> <b>points,</b> namely vertices that lie on a geodesic path between two given vertices, and at prescribed distances from these vertices. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} isometric immersions {{of complete}} connected Riemannian manifolds into space forms of nonzero constant curvature. We prove that if such an immersion is compact and has semi-definite second fundamental form, {{then it is}} an embedding with codimension one, its image bounds a convex set, and it is rigid. This result generalizes previous ones by M. do Carmo and E. Lima, {{as well as by}} M. do Carmo and F. Warner. It also settles affirmatively a conjecture by do Carmo and Warner. We establish a similar result for complete isometric immersions satisfying a stronger condition on the second fundamental form. We extend to the context of isometric immersions in space forms a classical theorem for Euclidean hypersurfaces due to Hadamard. In this same context, we prove an existence theorem of hypersurfaces with prescribed boundary and vanishing Gauss-Kronecker curvature.
