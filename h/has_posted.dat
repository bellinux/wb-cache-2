5|$|The 2000s saw {{formation}} of several pioneering Oriental metal bands from the Arab world, the best-known {{of which is}} Myrath from Tunisia. They have released four albums (three internationally) and have toured in Europe with Orphaned Land. Their sound combined progressive metal (in the vein of Dream Theater, et al.) with specifically Arab & North African melodies and themes. The Kordz from Lebanon straddle the line between hard rock and progressive metal, and again draw on local folk melodies (produced mainly via keyboards) to broaden the sonic palette. Hard rock band Lazywall from Morocco frequently makes use of oud and djembe in their music, producing something analogous to Oriental metal (though generally no heavier than Alice in Chains). North Africa has had a growing metal scene for some time, {{and a few of}} those bands have ventured into folk-metal, notably Andaz Azzul from Algeria, which blends Berber melodies & themes with violin and metal. And Egypt's truly path-breaking female-fronted Oriental metal band Massive Scar Era has recently broken through and <b>has</b> <b>posted</b> official videos on YouTube, though they continue to face considerable discrimination at home, with frontwoman Sherine reporting harassment on account of her participation. Their sound has broadened to include the heavy use of violin (in effect making them a folk-metal band, rather than simply another of the growing profusion of heavy metal bands in the Middle East).|$|E
