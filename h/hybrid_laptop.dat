50|$|Microsoft {{announced}} {{the next generation}} Surface Pro 4 and the all new Surface Book, a <b>hybrid</b> <b>laptop,</b> at Microsoft October 2015 Event in New York on October 10, 2015. Microsoft began shipping Surface Hub devices on March 25, 2016. In June 2016, Microsoft confirmed production of the Surface 3 would stop in December of that year. No replacement product has been announced. Reports suggest {{this may be a}} consequence of Intel discontinuing the Broxton iteration of the Atom processor. On October 26, 2016 at Microsoft's event, a Surface Studio and Surface Book with Performance Base was announced. A wheel accessory, the Surface Dial, was announced as well, and became available on 10 November 2016.|$|E
40|$|While {{the number}} of {{traditional}} laptops and computers sold has dipped slightly year over year, manufacturers have developed new hybrid laptops with touch screens {{to build on the}} tactile trend. This market is moving quickly to make touch the rule rather than the exception and the sales of these devices have tripled since the launch of Windows 8 in 2012, to reach more than sixty million units sold in 2015. Unlike tablets, that benefit from easy-to-use applications specially designed for tactile interactions, hybrid laptops are intended to be used with regular user-interfaces. Hence, one could ask whether tactile interactions are suited for every task and activity performed with such interfaces. Since hybrid laptops are increasingly used in educational situations, this study focuses on information search tasks which are commonly performed for learning purposes. It is hypothesized that tasks that require complex and/or less common gestures will increase user's cognitive load and impair task performance in terms of efficacy and efficiency. A study was carried out in a usability laboratory with 30 participants for whom prior experience with tactile devices has been controlled. They were asked to perform information search tasks on an online encyclopaedia by using only the touch screen of and <b>hybrid</b> <b>laptop.</b> Tasks were selected with respect to their level of cognitive demand (amount of information that had to be maintained in working memory) and the complexity of gestures needed (left and/or right clicks, zoom, text selection and/or input.), and grouped into 4 sets accordingly. Task performance was measured by {{the number of}} tasks succeeded (efficacy) and time spent on each task (efficiency). Perceived cognitive load was assessed thanks to a questionnaire given after each set of tasks. An eye tracking device was used to monitor users' attention allocation and to provide objective cognitive load measures based on pupil dilation and the Index of Cognitive Activity. Each experimental run took approximately one hour. The results of this within-subjects design indicate that tasks involving complex gestures led to a lower efficacy, especially when the tasks were cognitively demanding. Regarding efficacy, there is no significant differences between sets of tasks excepted for tasks with low cognitive demand and complex gestures that required more time to be achieved. Surprisingly, users that declared the biggest experience with tactile devices spent more time than less frequent users. Cognitive load measures indicate that participants reported having devoted more mental effort in the interaction when they had to use complex gestures. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
50|$|Microsoft Surface Pro-series {{devices and}} Surface Book are {{examples}} of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas Lenovo Yoga-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older Surface RT and Surface 2 have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of ARM processors and Windows RT do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets. Similarly, a number of <b>hybrid</b> <b>laptops</b> run a mobile operating system, such as Android. These include Asus's Transformer Pad devices, examples of hybrids with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall {{in the category of}} 2-in-1s.|$|R

40|$|This report {{outlines}} the 2013 {{results of the}} TELA Laptops Scheme School Survey, which was a program funded by the New Zealand government to lease laptops to principals and teachers. Background During November 2013 a total sample of n= 1, 000 schools who are currently on the TELA Scheme were invited to complete the survey; at least one user in n= 752 schools did so 1. This represents a school participation rate of 75 percent.   In total, across the n= 752 participating schools, n= 1, 130 TELA laptop users and in-school TELA contact persons participated in the survey. Main findings Are the current products offered by the TELA Scheme meeting user needs? 	Responding teachers and principals, in both primary and secondary schools, stated they used their TELA laptop {{for a range of}} different uses to assist them with their teaching and/or management of their school. For example, primary school teachers stated they use their laptop to complete internet searchers (99 percent), send and receive emails (98 percent), prepare student reports/assessments (98 percent), plan lessons (95 percent), etc. Over onehalf of users also said they used their laptop for personal use (between 55 percent and 65 percent). 	The large majority of responding teachers and principals with a TELA laptop, in both primary and secondary schools, rated the reliability and ease of use of their TELA laptop very high (between 86 percent and 96 percent). In fact, over two-thirds gave their TELA laptop the highest possible rating for reliability and ease of use (i. e., a rating of 5 on the five-point rating scale). 	As a result, the large majority of responding teachers and principals, in both primary and secondary schools, also rated their overall satisfaction with their TELA laptop in positive terms (between 84 percent and 89 percent). Fifty-percent or more gave the highest possible rating of satisfaction (rating of 5 on the five-point rating scale). 	The positive view of users of TELA laptops were, in turn, reflected in the positive opinions of TELA support staff within schools. 	Against this background, {{it should be noted that}} the majority of responding teachers and principals in both primary and secondary schools stated they supplemented the use of their TELA laptop with non-TELA devices. In this regard, tablets were the device most frequently 	mentioned.   For example, 64 percent of those teachers and principals with an Apple TELA laptop also used a tablet. This most probably reflects the compatibility of the devices, rather than the fact that the Apple TELA laptop is deficient in some respect. 	As a result, when responding teachers and principals were asked whether tablets and <b>hybrid</b> <b>laptops</b> should be made available through the TELA Scheme, significant percentages of respondents in both primary and secondary schools (between 36 percent and 44 percent) stated that tablets ‘to a large extent’ would improve the work that they do. This was less likely to be the case with regard to <b>hybrid</b> <b>laptops.</b> 	There is also an expectation amongst responding teachers and principals in both primary and secondary schools that their TELA needs will change as a result of Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) and the Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI). In fact, between 24 percent and 39 percent of 	teachers and principals expected their needs would change. Most of these respondents expect their school will need to upgrade their ICT equipment and update their devices in order to take full advantage of the enhanced connectivity UFB and the RBI will provide. 	Related to this is the fact that when responding teachers and principals were asked what the biggest teaching challenges in relation to digital technology were, a large percentage of principals stated it was cost, while teachers and principals were likely to say it was the challenge of up skilling staff...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, multi-touch devices can {{be found}} {{everywhere}} and are used for many kinds of activities (e. g. work or leisure activities). They create new ways for interacting with technology and often lead users to adopt new usage patterns. Despite this interest and the new features offered it seems that those devices cannot fully replace desktop and laptop computers. The use of gesture on touch sensitive screens imposes {{a certain number of}} constraints. Nevertheless, even if specific applications have been developed for devices like tablets and smartphones, the difficulties due to the use of gestures are not always taken into account. Today, computer models (e. g. <b>hybrid</b> <b>laptops)</b> incorporating a touch sensitive screen with a classical environment (operating system and software) made for keyboard/mouse pointing devices are proposed to consumers. These models raise new issues. If one could assume that the use of touch-screen rather than and mouse and keyboard is the easiest way to perform a task with specific applications, we postulate that in a traditional environment it could impair user’s performance. The complexity to generate an accurate fingers gesture and the split attention it requires may lead to a cognitive burden that decreases enjoyment and the mental resources available to perform a task. The experiment was conducted with 70 university students (62 women and 8 men) in a usability laboratory where they were asked to perform several information search tasks on an online encyclopaedia. The tasks had been created in order to require the most commonly used actions (e. g. right click, left click, zooming, scrolling, encoding). Participants were randomly assigned between two conditions: (1) multi-touch sensitive screen use (tablet condition), and (2) keyboard and mouse use (classical computer condition). Task performance, level of experience, satisfaction and enjoyment, as well as cognitive absorption indicators were collected by the use of a questionnaire. Cognitive load was also measured throughout the experiment by the use of an eye-tracking system. Finally, our results suggest that task performance, level of satisfaction and enjoyment are linked to the level of experience and to the cognitive indicators. They bring some interesting insights into the user experience and clarify the added value of multi-touch sensitive screens to computers and some of the psychological impacts of such a usage. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{interest}} in “green computing” has motivated research into energy-saving techniques for enterprise systems, from network proxies and virtual machine migration to the return of thin clients. This paper tries to answer a possibly contentious question: would we {{be better served by}} the embarrassingly simple approach of replacing every desktop with a laptop? To answer this question, we use power and utilization data collected from more than 100 devices over durations up to 15 months. We find that choosing the right computing systems – laptops – would save more energy than stateof-the-art power management software or thin clients. Furthermore, the marginal savings of applying software techniques on top of laptops is so small that it is probably not worth the trouble. When selecting computers, there are many other considerations than just energy, such as computational resources, and price. We find that these factors generally do not reduce the attractiveness of a laptop-based enterprise. We discuss current trends in enterprises today, and how our conclusions might affect their directions, sketching a future of how a cost-efficient enterprise might become a <b>hybrid</b> system entwining <b>laptops</b> and tablets with a computing cloud. ...|$|R
