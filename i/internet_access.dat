5|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Hyderabad {{began in}} 1974 with {{the launch of}} Doordarshan, the Government of India's public service broadcaster, which transmits two free-to-air terrestrial television channels and one satellite channel. Private satellite channels started in July 1992 with the launch of Star TV. Satellite TV channels are accessible via cable subscription, direct-broadcast satellite services or internet-based television. Hyderabad's first dial-up <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> became available in the early 1990s and was limited to software development companies. The first public <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> service began in 1995, with the first private sector internet service provider (ISP) starting operations in 1998.

5|$|The City of Ashland {{moved to}} improve local {{broadband}} <b>Internet</b> <b>access</b> {{in the late}} 1990s by creating the Ashland Fiber Network (AFN) and building a fiber optic ring inside the city boundaries. However, by 2006 the city faced difficulties servicing AFN's debt load, which was approaching $15.5million. The city hired a new AFN director, Joe Franell, who suggested scrapping cable television service while retaining the more profitable high-speed <b>Internet</b> <b>access.</b> In October 2006, the cable television service was transferred to a local company, Ashland Home Net, while the City retained both the infrastructure and the wholesale Internet business.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of <b>Internet</b> <b>access,</b> roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with <b>Internet</b> <b>access.</b> From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E

The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was {{launched}} in October 2013 and Microsoft {{was part of the}} coalition of public and private organizations that also included Facebook, Intel and Google. Led by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make <b>Internet</b> <b>access</b> more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease <b>Internet</b> <b>access</b> prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income. In line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions by function: Operating System, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. All previous divisions were diluted into new divisions without any workforce cuts.|$|E

5|$|The {{firewall}} {{makes all}} decisions by itself {{to lessen the}} chance of being weakened by a misinformed decision. Applications known to be safe are allowed <b>Internet</b> <b>access,</b> and vice versa for malicious applications. Unknown ones are analyzed and blocked if they exhibit malicious behavior. In both PC Magazine and PC Pro testing, the firewall did not incorrectly block any safe applications from <b>Internet</b> <b>access.</b> All malware was blocked by the firewall. PC Magazine testing reflected the same results. The firewall also stealthed all ports. Exploits were blocked by the intrusion prevention system, which prevents threats from leveraging vulnerabilities. The system is updated whenever a vulnerability is identified for Windows-based computers. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful; registry changes, process termination, and simulated mouse clicks all failed. Disabling Windows services {{had no effect on}} the firewall since it works at the kernel driver level. This version automatically adjusts configuration for different networks based on the physical address of the gateway rather than IP addresses.|$|E
