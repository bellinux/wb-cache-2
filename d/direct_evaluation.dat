40|$|Although it is {{suggested}} that linguistic alignment can be influenced by speakers' relationship with their listener, previous studies provide inconsistent results. We tested whether speakers' desire to be liked affects syntactic alignment, and simultaneously assessed whether alignment affects perceived likeability. Primed participants (PPs) were therefore primed by another naive participant (Evaluator). PP and Evaluator took turns describing photographs with active/passive sentences. Unknown to PP, we controlled Evaluator's syntax by having them read out sentences. PPs' desire to be liked was manipulated by assigning pairs to a Control (secret evaluation by Evaluator), Evaluation (PPs were aware of <b>evaluation),</b> or <b>Directed</b> <b>Evaluation</b> (PPs knew about the evaluation and were instructed to make a positive impression) condition. PPs showed significant syntactic alignment (more passives produced after passive primes). However, there was no interaction with condition: PPs did not align more in the (<b>Directed)</b> <b>Evaluation</b> than in the Control condition. Our results thus do not support the conclusion that speakers' desire to be liked affects syntactic alignment. Furthermore, there was no reliable relationship between syntactic alignment and how likeable PPs appeared to their Evaluator: there was a negative effect in the Control and Evaluation conditions, but no relationship in the <b>Directed</b> <b>Evaluation</b> condition...|$|R

50|$|The {{evaluation}} of vibronic couplings also requires correct description {{of at least}} two electronic states in regions where they are strongly coupled. This requires the use of multi-reference methods such as MCSCF and MRCI, which are very expensive and delicate methods. This is further {{complicated by the fact that}} definition of vibronic couplings requires electronic wavefunctions. Unfortunately, wavefunction based methods are usually too expensive for larger systems and popular methods for larger systems such as density functional theory and molecular mechanics cannot generate wave function information.

The point to switch methods is indicated by large dots, and is larger for larger c&ensp;-values.

Whereas previous studies have started to {{explore the influence of}} social goals on syntactic alignment, in the current study, we additionally investigated whether syntactic alignment effectively influences conversation partners' perception of the speaker. To this end, we developed a novel paradigm in which we can measure the effect of social goals on the strength of syntactic alignment for one participant (primed participant), while simultaneously obtaining usable social opinions about them from their conversation partner (the evaluator). In Study 1, participants' desire to be rated favorably by their partner was manipulated by assigning pairs to a Control (i. e., primed participants did not know they were being evaluated) or Evaluation context (i. e., primed participants knew they were being evaluated). Surprisingly, results showed {{no significant difference in the}} strength with which primed participants aligned their syntactic choices with their partners' choices.

However, again, there was no evidence supporting the hypothesis that participants' desire to impress their partner influences syntactic alignment. With respect to the influence of syntactic alignment on perceived likeability by the evaluator, a negative relationship was reported in Study 1 : the more primed participants aligned their syntactic choices with their partner, the more that partner decreased their likeability rating after the experiment. However, this effect was not replicated in the <b>Directed</b> <b>Evaluation</b> context of Study 2. In other words, our results do not support the conclusion that speakers' desire to be liked affects how much they align their syntactic choices with their partner, nor is there convincing evidence that there is a reliable relationship between syntactic alignment and perceived likeability...|$|R
