40|$|Models for {{piezoelectric}} {{beams and}} structures with piezoelectric patches generally ignore magnetic effects. This {{is because the}} magnetic energy has a relatively small effect on the overall dynamics. Piezoelectric beam models {{are known to be}} exactly observable and can be exponentially stabilized in the energy space by using a mechanical feedback controller. In this paper, a variational approach is used to derive a model for a piezoelectric beam that includes magnetic effects. It is proved that the partial differential equation model is well-posed. Magnetic effects have a strong effect on the stabilizability of the control system. For almost all system parameters the piezoelectric beam can be strongly stabilized, but it is not exponentially stabilizable in the energy space. Strong stabilization is achieved using only <b>electrical</b> <b>feedback.</b> Furthermore, using the same <b>electrical</b> <b>feedback,</b> an exponentially stable closed-loop system can be obtained for a set of system parameters of zero Lebesgue measure.

40|$|Development of {{high-performance}} {{and durable}} solidoxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and a SOFC power-generating system requires {{knowledge of the}} feedback effects from the power-conditioning electronics and from application-electrical-power circuits that may pass through or excite the power-electronics subsystem (PES). Therefore, {{it is important to}} develop analytical models and methodologies, which can be used to investigate and mitigate the effects of the <b>electrical</b> <b>feedbacks</b> from the PES and the application loads (ALs) on the reliability and performance of SOFC systems for stationary and non-stationary applications. However, any such attempt to resolve the electrical impacts of the PES on the SOFC would be incomplete unless one utilizes a comprehensive analysis, which takes into account the interactions of SOFC, PES, balance-of-plant system (BOPS), and ALs as a whole. SOFCs respond quickly to changes in load and exhibit high part- and full-load efficiencies due to its rapid electrochemistry, which is not true for the thermal and mechanical time constants of the BOPS, where load-following time constants are, typically, several orders of magnitude higher. This dichotomy can affect the lifetime and durability of the SOFCSs and limit the applicability of SOFC systems for load-varying stationary and transportation applications. Furthermore, without validated analytical models and investigative design and optimization methodologies, realizations of cost-effective, reliable, and optimal PESs (and power-management controls), in particular, and SOFC systems, in general, are difficult. On the whole, the research effort can lead to (a) cost-constrained optimal PES design for high-performance SOFCS and high energy efficiency and power density, (b) effective SOFC power-system design, analyses, and optimization, and (c) controllers and modulation schemes for mitigation of electrical impacts and wider-stability margin and enhanced system efficiency...|$|R

Neuro-prosthetic devices seeking to modulate or restore CNS function need to interact with the information flow at the level of neural modules electrically, bi-directionally and in real-time. A set of freely available generic tools is presented that allow computationally demanding multi-channel short-latency bi-directional interactions to be realized in in vivo and in vitro preparations using standard PC data acquisition and processing hardware and software (Mathworks Matlab and Simulink).

40|$|Methods for the {{manipulation}} of single magnetic particles have become very interesting, in particular for in vitro biological studies. Most of these studies require an external microscope to provide the operator with feedback for controlling the particle motion, thus preventing the use of magnetic particles in high-throughput experiments. In this paper, a simple and compact system with integrated <b>electrical</b> <b>feedback</b> is presented, implementing in the very same device both {{the manipulation}} and detection of the transit of single particles. The proposed platform is based on zig-zag shaped magnetic nanostructures, where transverse magnetic domain walls are pinned at the corners and attract magnetic particles in suspension. By applying suitable external magnetic fields, the domain walls move to the nearest corner, thus causing the step by step displacement of the particles along the nanostructure. The very same structure is also employed for detecting the bead transit. Indeed, {{the presence of the}} magnetic particle in suspension over the domain wall affects the depinning field required for its displacement. This characteristic field can be monitored through anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements, thus implementing an integrated <b>electrical</b> <b>feedback</b> of the bead transit.

30|$|With the {{development}} of MEMS technology, {{researchers have found that}} the chemical solution etching technique can be used to fabricate silicon nanopore with controlled positions and numbers [27, 28, 40]. Park et al. [27] firstly used the solid-state nanopore fabricated by chemical solution etching technology for DNA sequencing. Firstly, they used photolithography and RIE to etch silicon nitride films {{on both sides of the}} silicon wafer and obtain silicon windows with different areas on. Next, the silicon wafer is placed in KOH solution for etching, and an inverted pyramid and trapezoidal structure were obtained in small and large windows respectively. Thirdly, the silicon wafer is mounted on the feedback etching system, and the KCl salt solution and the KOH etching solution are isolated by a silicon wafer (Fig.  3 b). When the KOH solution pierces the silicon wafer obtaining the nanopore, the solution on both sides of the silicon wafer passes through the nanopore and conducts the Pt electrodes obtaining a <b>feedback</b> <b>electrical</b> signal. Finally, they remove the silicon wafer obtaining silicon nanopore. Due to the limitations of lithography mask fabrication and photolithographic errors, the small patterned silicon window cannot be an absolute square, so the etched solid-state nanopores are approximate rectangles and require subsequent processing such as annealing to improve the morphology of the pores. Pedone et al. [28] developed a small window using electron beam lithography based on the former, which avoided the mask manufacturing and lithography error. At the same time, when the <b>electrical</b> signal <b>feedback</b> was added in the intelligent control system, the approximately perfect nanopore was obtained (Fig.  3 c). In similar way, Liu et al. [41] used a combination of dry and wet etching methods to fabricate silicon nanopore with the minimum diameter of 30  nm. Not difficult to find, in addition to Rant groups, other groups just can fabricate silicon nanopore with larger diameter. At the same time, it is difficult to characterize the diameter of the nanopore, which attributes the limited field of TEM.|$|R

40|$|Commercially used {{prostheses}} {{are essentially}} open-loop devices and provide {{little or no}} feedback to the amputee {{as to how much}} force they exerting with the terminal device, despite numerous attempts to provide closed loop control in prosthetics [1]. Providing pressure feedback clearly has great value for function of the prosthesis—the goal is for the amputee to ‘feel’ what they are holding. Indirect pressure feedback has been attempted by methods including vibration [2] and functional electrical stimulation [3, 4]. The information contained in these forms of feedback is not in the same modality as that which they sense. As a result, while providing information to the user, it is likely that it comes at the cost of increased mental load and low level of information transfer [5]. Patterson and Katz [6] have obtained better qualitative feedback with pressure to pressure feedback than with pressure to vibratory or <b>electrical</b> stimulation <b>feedback,</b> offering support for this suggestion. An adaptive process is still involved since the subject must learn to associate pressure in one area with pressure in another area. Ideally, the sensory nerve endings of the amputated area need to be stimulated in direct correlation to the function of the prosthesis. The recent work of Kuiken [7] has made this concept feasible by the use of targeted reinnervation. The potential thus exists for the subject to feel as if touch, pressure and even hot or cold temperatures are being exerted on their hand.

40|$|Agonist-induced {{vasoconstriction}} {{triggers a}} negative feedback response whereby movement of charged ions through gap junctions and/or release of endothelium-derived (NO) limit further reductions in diameter, a mechanism termed myoendothelial feedback. Recent {{studies indicate that}} <b>electrical</b> myoendothelial <b>feedback</b> can {{be accounted for by}} flux of inositol trisphosphate (IP 3) through myoendothelial gap junctions resulting in localized increases in endothelial Ca 2 + to activate intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium (IKCa) channels, the resultant hyperpolarization then conducting back to the smooth muscle to attenuate agonist-induced depolarization and tone. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that activation of IKCa channels underlies NO-mediated myoendothelial feedback. Functional experiments showed that block of IP 3 receptors, IKCa channels, gap junctions and transient receptor potential canonical type- 3 (TRPC 3) channels caused endothelium-dependent potentiation of agonist-induced increase in tone which was not additive with that caused by inhibition of NO synthase supporting a role for these proteins in NO-mediated myoendothelial feedback. Localized densities of IKCa and TRPC 3 channels occurred at the internal elastic lamina/endothelial-smooth muscle interface in rat basilar arteries, potential communication sites between the two cell layers. Smooth muscle depolarization to contractile agonists was accompanied by IKCa channel-mediated endothelial hyperpolarization providing the first demonstration of IKCa channel-mediated hyperpolarization of the endothelium in response to contractile agonists. Inhibition of IKCa channels, gap junctions, TRPC 3 channels or NO synthase potentiated smooth muscle depolarization to agonists in a non-additive manner. Together these data indicate that rather being distinct pathways for the modulation of smooth muscle tone, NO and endothelial IKCa channels are involved in an integrated mechanism for the regulation of agonist-induced vasoconstriction...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is the investigation of compliant membranes {{for the development of}} a MicroElectrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS) microphone using the Sandia Ultraplanar, Multilevel MEMS Technology (SUMMiT V) fabrication process. The microphone is a dual-backplate capacitive microphone utilizing electrostatic force feedback. The microphone consists of a diaphragm and two porous backplates, one on either side of the diaphragm. This forms a capacitor between the diaphragm and each backplate. As the incident pressure deflects the diaphragm, the value of each capacitor will change, thus resulting in an <b>electrical</b> output. <b>Feedback</b> may be used in this device by applying a voltage between the diaphragm and the backplates to balance the incident pressure keeping the diaphragm stationary. The SUMMiT V fabrication process is unique in that it can meet the fabrication requirements of this project. All five layers of polysilicon are used in the fabrication of this device. The SUMMiT V process has been optimized to provide low-stress mechanical layers that are ideal for the construction of the microphone's diaphragm. The use of chemical mechanical polishing in the SUMMiT V process results in extremely flat structural layers and uniform spacing between the layers, both of which are critical to the successful fabrication of the MEMS microphone. The MEMS capacitive microphone was fabricated at Sandia National Laboratories and post-processed, packaged, and tested at the University of Florida.
