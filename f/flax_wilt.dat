50|$|Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lini is a fungal plant pathogen. Among the {{diseases}} it causes is <b>flax</b> <b>wilt.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1890, Bolley {{was one of}} {{the first}} three faculty members hired at the newly founded North Dakota Agricultural College (NDAC), later North Dakota State University. In his first year at NDAC, he {{isolated}} the organism responsible for potato scab and developed an effective treatment. In 1893, he discovered a method of treating smut with formaldehyde. Much of his work, however, focused on the causes of <b>flax</b> <b>wilt.</b> At the time, it was believed that wilt was caused by [...] "flax-sick" [...] or deficient soil. Bolley established that wilt was in fact the result of the soilborne fungus fusarium oxysporum. His breeding work led to the development of the resistant strain [...] "Bison Flax", which was planted widely and made North Dakota one of the world's major flax-producing regions.|$|E
5000|$|Research Plot 30, is a {{historic}} agriculture site on the North Dakota State University campus in Fargo, North Dakota. When the pioneers broke up the grass prairie sod, flax was usually {{one of the first}} crops sown. If flax was sown continuously or with short rotations between subsequent flax crops, the flax became diseased and was called [...] "flax sick" [...] by farmers. The symptoms were wilting and dying flax plants during the growing season. The site is located near Centennial Avenue and 18th Street North. Flax was first planted at the site in 1894 by Professor Henry L. Bolley, a noted researcher in flax botany. By 1900, the flax plants were dead or dying. Bolley identified flax pathogens introduced by the plants themselves as the cause, and further identified resistant plants. Flax breeding programs {{from all over the world}} have sent material to NDSU to be tested for resistance to <b>flax</b> <b>wilt</b> in Plot 30.|$|E
40|$|<b>Flax</b> <b>wilt</b> {{is caused}} by the soil-borne fungal {{pathogen}} Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini (Fol). The best control method is to develop resistant cultivars to be grown in the field. The objectives of this study were to develop a controlled environment phenotyping method to test flax lines for reaction to <b>flax</b> <b>wilt</b> and screen a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population for reaction to <b>flax</b> <b>wilt</b> under a controlled environment and compare the observations with field evaluations at wilt nurseries. Finally, the inheritance of <b>flax</b> <b>wilt</b> resistance of the RIL population was assessed using phenotypic data from the controlled environment and field test. Four flax cultivars: Bison and Aurore (wilt resistant) and Novelty and Oliver (wilt susceptible), were inoculated with 17 Fol isolates under controlled conditions. Plants were assessed on the degree of yellowing, browning and wilting. Disease severity (DS) at 21 and 28 days after inoculation (dai) and the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) were used to group the isolates. Isolates 65, 81 and 131 were the moderately aggressive and selected to phenotype a RIL population developed by crossing Aurore and Oliver (AO). For all isolates gradual increase in DS and AUDPC among RILs was observed. Similar observations were made in each wilt nursery. Moderate correlations were observed between controlled conditions and wilt field nursery experiments, signifying the importance of controlled condition experimental data as predictors of <b>flax</b> <b>wilt</b> resistance in the field. Inheritance of <b>flax</b> <b>wilt</b> resistance was observed to segregate in a 3 : 1 ratio, of susceptible to resistant. Thus, this suggested that two independent, recessive genes conferred wilt resistance to the AO RIL population. However, the phenotypic observations indicated the additive effect of minor genes. This study indicated the significance of identifying the inheritance pattern of wilt resistance in flax populations and highlights the need to locate resistance genes within the genome. This would assist in marker assisted selections (MAS) in flax breeding to reduce time and labour, and also to incorporate wilt resistant genes to develop flax cultivars resilient to Fol pathotypes...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{health has}} been {{associated}} with internal cycling of nutrients, microbial activity and diversity as well as root disease suppression, which are frequently greater in organically than in conventionally managed soils. Resistance and resilience, measured as amplitude and frequency of oscillations in bacterial communities after a disturbance, were suggested as integral indicators of soil health, but until now there is little proof for this hypothesis. In this study, resistance and resilience of microbial communities and 24 soil chemical and biological parameters were analyzed and correlated to suppression of <b>flax</b> <b>wilt</b> (caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini) in three experiments. Soil samples were collected on three different dates from a recently converted organic greenhouse and a similar, neighboring greenhouse under conventional management. The dynamics of copiotrophic and oligotrophic bacteria after a disturbance were monitored, and the resistance and resilience were calculated. The organic soil showed significantly higher water-holding capacity, organic matter content, total C and N contents, C: N ratio of the small particulate organic matter fraction, microbial biomass carbon, oxygen uptake rate, copiotrophic and oligotrophic bacterial communities and suppression of <b>flax</b> <b>wilt</b> incidence. After incorporation of a grass-clover mixture in both soils, the densities of copiotrophic and oligotrophic bacteria oscillated over time. The relative amplitudes of the oscillations (in grass-clover amended over non- amended soil) and the frequencies of the oscillations of both trophic groups were lower for the organic soil, indicating that the resistance and resilience of the microbial community were greater in this soil. These results support the hypothesis that the bacterial response to a disturbance can serve as an integral indicator for soil health, including disease suppressiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In {{the thesis}} aspects have been {{described}} of the flax and linseed interaction to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini, the causal agent of <b>flax</b> <b>wilt.</b> Two in vitro tests were established to screen for resistance, to investigate race specificity and to study infection and colonization patterns in a resistant and a susceptible cultivar. The fungus appeared to colonize the cortex, causing root rot initially, followed by colonization of the protoxylem vessels. Several aspects of quantitative screening for resistance were investigated by visual disease screening, physiologic parameters, and ergosterol measurements. The results indicated that symptoms are related to resistance rather than tolerance. Race specificity was studied in vitro, and in an international field experiment performed at six locations in Europe and three in North America. Although significant genotype * isolate interaction and significant genotype * environment interaction was observed, possible races of the fungus could not be identified. No indication was obtained for race-specific resistance in flax and linseed...|$|E
