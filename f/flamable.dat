Curtis confesses to him that shortly after boarding the train, the tail passengers resorted to cannibalism to survive, and he is haunted by his part in it. He was nearly ready to kill infant Edgar when Gilliam offered his own arm instead. After years of disdain for Wilford, Curtis seeks to learn what Wilford's intentions were. Franco is revealed to have survived and makes his way toward the engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{cutaneous}} {{burn and}} the problem of effective therapy, especially in the more extensive ones, is profound and interest in it dates back many decades. In this paper, we are presenting the problem of cellular injury resulting from the application of heat to living tissue, otherwise known as a "thermal burn". There are numerous varieties of thermal burns aptly named according to the physical nature of the heat emitting agent. Amongst these are electrical burns resulting from contact with a “live electric current”, flash burns secondary to intense radiant energy, flame burns produced by contact with flames from any <b>flamable</b> agent, and scald burns resulting from contact with high temperature liquids to mention only a few...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey is}} given on health {{problems}} at welding. Potential hazard from nitrous oxides, ozone, carbon monoxyde, fumes of lead, zinc and cadmium and the fumes containing iron oxides, amorphous silica and oxides of calcium and manganese arc described. The irritative effect of fumes at arc welding with basic (low hydrogen) electrodes {{is believed to}} be due to the content of fluorine in the fumes. The maximum allowable concentration of arc welding fumes have been proposed to 20 mg/m 3, at are welding with basic electrodes 10 mg/m 3. The welders 2 ̆ 7 flash and its prevention are discussed. X-ray or radioactive isotopes used to control welds may also create a health hazard. It is pointed out that the most important accident risk at welding is the hazard of explosion at welding on drums, barrels etc. containing explosive or <b>flamable</b> material. The role of the Commission on Hygiene and Safety of the International Institute of Welding is described. Zdravstveni problemi kod svarivanj...|$|E
40|$|To address {{high fire}} risks of <b>flamable</b> {{cellulosic}} materials, that can trigger easy combustion, flame propagation, and release of toxic gases, we report a new fire-retardant approach using synergetic actions combining unique properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and hydrated-sodium metaborates (SMB). The single-step treatment {{of cellulosic materials}} by a composite suspension of rGO/SMB was developed to create a barrier layer on sawdust surface providing highly effective fire retardant protection with multiple modes of action. These performances are designed considering synergy between properties of hydrated-SMB crystals working as chemical heat-sink {{to slow down the}} thermal degradation of the cellulosic particles and gas impermeable rGO layers that prevents access of oxygen and the release of toxic volatiles. The rGO outer layer also creates a thermal and physical barrier by donating carbon between the flame and unburnt wood particles. The fire-retardant performance of developed graphene-borate composite and mechanism of fire protection are demonstrated by testing of different forms of cellulosic materials such as pine sawdust, particle-board, and fiber-based structures. Results revealed their outstanding self-extinguishing behavior with significant resistance to release of toxic and flammable volatiles suggesting rGO/SMB to be suitable alternative to the conventional toxic halogenated flame-retardant materials.

40|$|LPG {{dependence}} {{from people}} {{is very high}} and hard to separate it, since the government wise to convert from cerosine to LPG was started. But in the time reseve of the petroleum become less and less include the increasing value of petroleum in the world, than stimulate economical life become more expensive than before especially for ordinary people. The target from this research {{is to get the}} design and equipment for bioetanol stove using vacum bottle and low pressure box principe, hopfully with this research can help people which is difficult to buy an elpiji stove because the cost is more expensive than bioetanol stove. Using bioetanol stove is more easier than cerosine stove because this stove not using fuse, but using direct burning because bioetanol fluid is <b>flamable,</b> not dangerous and more safely than elpiji. This fluid have a chemical formula’s to called C 2 H 5 OH. This stove using double burner which the dimension is 10 cm for diameter in the bottom and 3 cm for high, this is using for reactor at the first time, and from this burner can be using for medium level cooking. And the top burner have dimension 8 cm for diameter and 1 cm for high with center diameter is 3, 5 cm and have 25 point, 0, 2 mm diameter around the top of burner. The purpose from top burner is to get a big fire...|$|E
40|$|El transporte de sustancias peligrosas tiene que ser profesional, {{responsable}} y cuidadoso. Dentro de estas sustancias se encuentra el metanol, el cual es un alcohol tóxico e inflamable que debe ser transportado con todas las precauciones, desafortunadamente, en la actualidad existe un gran desconocimiento sobre el manejo y tratamiento que se le debe dar a este tipo de sustancias, por ello es posible encontrar vehículos que no cuentan con las etiquetas o marcas adecuadas, además de conductores realizando maniobras inapropiadas durante el transporte de dicho producto. En Colombia, el Decreto 1609, estable los requisitos técnicos y de seguridad que se deben tener cuando se transportan sustancias peligrosas. Igualmente existen diferentes normas técnicas que reglamentan este transporte. Por esta razón en este artículo se busca resaltar que condiciones debe cumplir el transporte de metanol para ofrecer un servicio de calidad. The {{transport of}} dangerous substance should be professional, responsible and careful One of these substances is Methanol, {{which is an}} alcohol very toxic and <b>flamable,</b> for that reason must be transport with all precautions, unfortunately at the present we are ignorants about the proper handling {{of this kind of}} substance, for that reason is possible to find some vehicles without the proper mark o label of dangerous substances, or some drivers do not handle the vehicle in don´t the right way making dangerous operation of the truck. In Colombia there are some laws and restrictions for the transport of dangerous substances, such as the Decree 1609 which explain the requirements for the transport of hazardous substances. Besides, is possible to find some other techical standards that regulate this transport. Finally, with this article I wish to identify conditions are required to offer what a good quality in the transport of Methanol...|$|E
