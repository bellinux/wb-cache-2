5|$|According to {{the later}} Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle {{occurred}} by accident: When Bolesław decided {{to throw a}} feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav's archers and scouts decided to create trouble for the Polish servants who were <b>gutting</b> the animals and preparing them near the river. However, they only annoyed them enough that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav's surprised troops, who had been guarding the river. Bolesław learned of the skirmish sooner than Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav.|$|E
5|$|Portland City Hall is the {{headquarters}} of city government of Portland, Oregon, United States. The four-story Italian Renaissance-style building houses {{the offices of the}} City Council, which consists of the mayor and four commissioners, and several other offices. City Hall is also home to the City Council chambers, located in the rotunda {{on the east side of}} the structure. Completed in 1895, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 1974. City Hall has gone through several renovations, with the most recent overhaul <b>gutting</b> the interior to upgrade it to modern seismic and safety standards. The original was built for $600,000, while the 1996 to 1998 renovation cost $29million.|$|E

For instance South <b>Gut</b> and North <b>Gut</b> at {{the settlement of}} South <b>Gut</b> St. Anns, Nova Scotia are just inlets, while Brewery <b>Gut</b> in England and The <b>Gut</b> in Ontario are fast-flowing stretches of river, Jigsaw Rock <b>Gut</b> in Antarctica is a gully, and Gardner's <b>Gut</b> in New Zealand is a cave system. Conversely, some <b>guts</b> are not so named, such as The Rip, a <b>gut</b> in Australia, where the term [...] "gut" [...] is not used.|$|R
5|$|Stone and Judy {{convinced}} {{the managers of}} two bars in Seattle, Washington, to set up Donkey Kong machines. The managers initially showed reluctance, but when they saw sales of $30 a day—or 120 plays—for a week straight, they requested more units. In their Redmond headquarters, a skeleton crew composed of Arakawa, his wife Yoko, James, Judy, Phillips and Stone set about <b>gutting</b> 2,000 surplus Radar Scope machines and converting them with Donkey Kong motherboards and power supplies from Japan. The game officially went on sale in July 1981. Actor Harris Shore created the first live-action Mario in the television commercials for Colecovision's hand-held Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong, Junior video games.|$|E
5|$|The {{background}} {{to the development}} of the Dorchester Hotel is complicated. Sir Malcolm McAlpine, a partner in the building company, Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons, and Sir Frances Towle, the managing director of Gordon Hotels Ltd., shared a vision of creating the 'perfect hotel': ultramodern and ultra-efficient, with all the conveniences modern technology could supply. The two companies purchased Hertford House in 1929 and quickly demolished it. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had also shown an interest in purchasing it and had almost done so prior to the McAlpine acquisition, but instead they turned their attention to Foley House. The purchase and destruction of Hertford House was part of significant redevelopment which took place on Park Lane during this period; it followed the <b>gutting</b> of Grosvenor House and the building of the Grosvenor House Hotel, which was completed in 1929.|$|E

5|$|The lower Exchange {{and area}} {{immediately}} {{to the south of}} it contains some other notable buildings, including several of Dunedin's more notable former and current public houses. Among these are Wain's Hotel, the Provincial Hotel (at the foot of Stafford Street), the Empire Tavern, and the former Prince of Wales Hotel. Wain's Hotel, immediately opposite the former Post Office building, is an imposing Italianate structure built in 1878 from designs by Mason and Wales. The Empire Tavern also has a long history, and claims to be Dunedin's oldest pub, having been continuously licensed since 1858. Its recent past is closely tied with the Dunedin Sound music scene of the 1980s, of which it was a principal venue. Prior to its <b>gutting</b> by fire in the 1980s, the Prince of Wales Hotel, a block further down Princes Street, was noted for an unusual gimmick, in that the upstairs restaurant facilities were extensively themed on old railway carriages, and included in their decor several original vintage pieces of rolling stock. The Prince of Wales was later (1992–2010) the location of one of the city's top restaurants, Bell Pepper Blues.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} shows that <b>gut</b> microbiota composition is related to changes of <b>gut</b> barrier function including <b>gut</b> permeability and immune function. <b>Gut</b> microbiota is different in obese compared to lean subjects, suggesting that <b>gut</b> microbes are also involved in energy metabolism and subsequent nutritional state. While research on <b>gut</b> microbiota and <b>gut</b> barrier has presently mostly focused on intestinal inflammatory bowel diseases and more recently on obesity and type 2 diabetes, this review aims at summarizing the present knowledge regarding the impact, in vivo, of depleted nutritional states on structure and function of the <b>gut</b> epithelium, the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), the <b>gut</b> microbiota and the enteric nervous system.

Each antibiotic significantly reduced the firebrat's <b>gut</b> micro-flora. Nystatin reduced the firebrat's viable <b>gut</b> fungi by 89 %. Tetracycline and the antibiotic cocktail reduced the firebrat's viable <b>gut</b> bacteria by 81 % and 67 %, respectively, and metronidazole, streptomycin, tetracycline, and the antibiotic cocktail reduced the firebrat's total <b>gut</b> flora by 35 %, 32 %, 55 %, and 64 %, respectively. Although antibiotics significantly reduced the firebrat's viable and total <b>gut</b> flora, <b>gut</b> cellulase levels in firebrats fed antibiotics were not significantly different from those in firebrats on an antibiotic-free diet. Furthermore, microbial populations in the firebrat's <b>gut</b> decreased significantly over time, even in firebrats feeding on the antibiotic-free diet, without corresponding decreases in <b>gut</b> cellulase levels.

25|$|In {{the initial}} weeks {{following}} the storm, only emergency personnel and contractors {{were permitted to}} use the bridge. The bridge reopened to traffic in mid-September as decreasing water levels on the East Bank of Orleans Parish allowed Interstate 10 to reopen and residents to return, but then was temporarily closed to regular traffic again when another evacuation was declared due to Hurricane Rita, with the bridge again reopening in late September. Toll collection resumed on October 10 after a six-week suspension, as the revenue was needed to maintain operations. Long lines at the toll booth lanes during non-rush times became common, due to a shortage of toll collectors and electronic toll tags, combined with heavy usage of the bridge due to the many New Orleanians staying with friends and relatives on the Westbank while they worked on <b>gutting</b> and repairing their flooded Eastbank homes.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} updated {{information about the}} <b>gut</b> microbiota-brain axis. Data Sources: All articles about <b>gut</b> microbiota-brain axis published up to July 18, 2016, were identified through a literature search on PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science, with the keywords of “gut microbiota”, “gut-brain axis”, and “neuroscience”. Study Selection: All relevant articles on <b>gut</b> microbiota and gut-brain axis were included and carefully reviewed, with no limitation of study design. Results: It is well-recognized that <b>gut</b> microbiota affects the brain's physiological, behavioral, and cognitive functions although its precise mechanism {{has not yet been}} fully understood. <b>Gut</b> microbiota-brain axis may include <b>gut</b> microbiota and their metabolic products, enteric nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic branches within the autonomic nervous system, neural-immune system, neuroendocrine system, and central nervous system. Moreover, there may be five communication routes between <b>gut</b> microbiota and brain, including the gut-brain's neural network, neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, <b>gut</b> immune system, some neurotransmitters and neural regulators synthesized by <b>gut</b> bacteria, and barrier paths including intestinal mucosal barrier and blood-brain barrier. The microbiome is used to define the composition and functional characteristics of <b>gut</b> microbiota, and metagenomics is an appropriate technique to characterize <b>gut</b> microbiota. Conclusions: <b>Gut</b> microbiota-brain axis refers to a bidirectional information network between the <b>gut</b> microbiota and the brain, which may provide a new way to protect the brain in the near future...|$|R
