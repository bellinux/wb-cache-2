5|$|After a directors' special run between Ayr (north of the river, at Newton-on-Ayr) and Irvine on 19 July 1839, {{the line}} {{opened to the}} public between those points on 5 August 1839. This was an {{enormous}} success and that limited section of the line made a surplus of £500 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the year. The section between Irvine and Kilwinning opened on 23 March 1840.|$|E

5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused {{the battle to}} begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for Pickett's Charge.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the year, Johnson was subject to {{interest}} from First Division club Nottingham Forest. An initial £2.5million bid was turned down on 4 January 2001, but Forest came back with an improved bid of £3.5million, and the transfer was completed on 12 January 2001. He made his debut two days later in a 3–0 home defeat to Crystal Palace. He scored just two goals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the season, the first against Grimsby Town on 24 February 2001, and the second against Sheffield United on 10 March.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle {{was seized}} by Parliamentary forces {{at the start of}} the first English Civil War between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament, resulting in the dismissal of Byng as a suspected Royalist, and his replacement by Colonel Rainsborough, a vice-admiral. The castle did not play a significant role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the initial conflict. After the few years of unsteady peace after 1645, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by their Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Walmer and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was under way across Kent.|$|E

5|$|Hunt was one {{of eight}} Broncos players {{selected}} for the Australian team {{for the end of}} year Tri-Nations series. With the absence of injured rival Anthony Minichiello, Hunt retained his fullback position for the first Tri-Nations match, scoring two tries in a man of the match performance. He played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the Tri-Nations series, which Australia won, Hunt scoring a total of three tries. The Tri-Nations win ended a good year for Hunt, who made his debut for Australia and Queensland before being a part of the premiership-winning Broncos team.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the value}} of foreign {{currency}} bonds which matured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> 2008 was only $600 million, and foreign currency debt service in 2009 was only $215 million, well within the government's ability to pay. However the agencies believed {{that the government would}} have to issue more foreign currency bonds, both to cover losses as the banks' overseas operations are liquidated and also to stimulate demand in the domestic economy as Iceland goes into recession.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the season, Bosanquet {{never took}} more than three wickets in an innings, {{although}} he scored a century against Essex and three other fifties. He played for the Gentlemen against the Players scoring 38 and 19 but did not take a wicket in the 17 overs he bowled. In 20 first-class matches, Bosanquet scored 1,198 runs (average 37.43) and took 63 wickets (average 27.77). After this season, he rarely bowled and later stated {{that he did not}} bowl the googly after 1905, particularly after one embarrassing attempt to do so in a match at Harrow. In another eight seasons of first-class cricket, he took only 22 wickets. However, his batting seemed to improve in this time.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the season, Crawford scored 232 against Somerset, his highest {{first-class}} score, {{as well as}} centuries against Derbyshire and Hampshire. The increased {{strength and}} variety of Surrey's bowling attack restricted his opportunities; he was used less as a strike bowler and bowled fewer overs {{than in the previous}} season. Contemporary reports suggested that his performances tailed off as the season progressed, possibly through tiredness from having played too much cricket, and that he became a less accurate bowler through trying too hard to spin the ball. The Surrey captaincy remained unsettled; Crawford led the team on several occasions, including Surrey's final game of the season, when his brother Vivian captained Leicestershire, their opponents.|$|E
5|$|M-83 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan primarily {{serving as a}} link between Interstate75/US Highway23 (I-75/US23) in Birch Run, including a short east–west section with M-54, and the Bavarian-themed town of Frankenmuth. M-83 is primarily a north–south trunkline that passes by such landmarks as Bronner's Christmas Wonderland, Zehnder's and the Bavarian Inn before leaving town. The landscape <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the area is composed of farm fields between Frankenmuth and the northern terminus at M-15 near Richville.|$|E

In total he made 18 appearances, Forest finishing eighth in the First Division. He started 1986–87 only making substitute appearances, but from mid October 1986 onwards he started matches frequently. He made 33 appearances, scoring one goal, with Forest again ranking eighth in the First Division.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota drove 71 {{yards on}} its first possession, scored the game's first points on a 27-yard field goal by Adam Bailey and led 3–0 after one quarter. After the opening drive, Michigan's defense shut down the Golden Gophers, {{allowing}} only 33 yards of total offense <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the game. Minnesota was held to 10 yards of total offense in the entire second half, as Michigan extended its fourth-quarter shutout to 8 games. Michigan also held its opponent without a touchdown {{for the fifth time}} in 8 games and shut down Minnesota so effectively that Michigan started four drives in Minnesota territory in the first half.|$|E
5|$|The first British {{furnaces}} {{outside the}} Weald {{appeared during the}} 1550s, and many were built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> that century and the following ones. The output of the industry probably peaked about 1620, and {{was followed by a}} slow decline until the early 18th century. This was apparently because it was more economic to import iron from Sweden and elsewhere than to make it in some more remote British locations. Charcoal that was economically available to the industry was probably being consumed as fast as the wood to make it grew. The Backbarrow blast furnace built in Cumbria in 1711 has been described as the first efficient example.|$|E
5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor has two constitutional functions. The primary {{function is to}} serve as the President of the Indiana Senate. In the Senate the {{lieutenant governor}} is permitted to debate on legislation, introduce legislation, and vote on matters to break ties. As presiding officer in the Senate, lieutenant governors also have partial control over what legislation will be considered, and influence on the legislative calendar. Unless a special session is called by the governor, the Senate meets for no more than 91 days in any two years period, leaving the lieutenant governor free from his or her senatorial duties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the year.|$|E

5|$|Trautmann's {{convalescence}} {{took several}} months, resulting in him missing {{a large part}} of the 1956–57 season. Jack Savage deputised during his absence. At the start of December, Trautmann played two reserve matches, but lacked confidence. He was restored to the first team on 15 December for a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers, but conceded three goals. He struggled to regain his form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> <b>of</b> the season, leading to calls from some fans and media for him to retire. Others criticised the club, believing that Trautmann had been forced to play while still not fully recovered from injury.|$|E
