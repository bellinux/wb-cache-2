40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{intensive}} research is {{being carried out}} towards the development of “green” electrochemical sensors. Bismuth, antimony and tin electrodes have been proposed as potential substitutes of mercury electrodes in <b>electrochemical</b> <b>stripping</b> analysis of trace metals. The main advantage of these metals as electrode materials is their lower toxicity compared to mercury. Among the different configuration of bismuth, antimony and tin electrodes, {{one of the most}} attractive involves the modification of a support material with a bismuth, antimony or tin precursor compound (oxide, hydroxide or sparingly soluble salt). When the electrode is polarized to a sufficiently cathodic potential, the metal precursor is reduced to the respective metal which forms a thin “film” {{on the surface of the}} support material. The present article is an overview of the existing state–of–the–art in the field of bismuth, antimony and tin precursor–modified sensors.

The immunosensor was constructed through covalently immobilizing capture antibody at a carbon nanotube (CNT) modified screen-printed carbon electrode. The gold nanoprobe was prepared by loading signal antibody and high-content glucose oxidase (GOD) on the nanocarrier of gold nanorod (Au NR). After sandwich immunoreaction, the GOD-Au NR nanoprobe could be quantitatively captured onto the immunosensor surface and then induce the deposition of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) via the enzymatically catalytic reaction. Based on the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>stripping</b> analysis of the Au NR nanocarriers and the enzymatically produced Au NPs, sensitive electrochemical signal was obtained for the immunoassay.

Using carcinoembryonic antigen as a model analyte, excellent analytical performance including a wide linear range from 0. 01 to 100 ng/mL and a detection limit down to 4. 2 pg/mL was obtained. In addition, this immunosensor showed high specificity and satisfactory reproducibility, stability and reliability.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} paper we study the {{reactivity}} of model Pt nanoparticles supported on glassy carbon. The particle size effect is rationalized for CO monolayer oxidation exploring <b>electrochemical</b> methods (<b>stripping</b> voltammetry and chronoamperometry) and modelling. Significant size effects are observed in the particle size interval from ca. 1 to 4 nm, including the positive shift of the CO stripping peak with decreasing particle size and a pronounced asymmetry of the current transients at constant potential. The latter go through a maximum at low CO ads conversion and exhibit tailing, which is the longer the smaller the particle size. Neither mean field nor nucleation & growth models give a coherent explanation of these experimental findings. We, therefore, suggest a basic model employing the active site concept. With a number of reasonable simplifications a full analytical solution is obtained, which allows a straightforward comparison of the theory with the experimental data. A good correspondence between experiment and theory is demonstrated. The model suggests restricted CO ads mobility at Pt nanoparticles below ca. 2 nm size, with the diffusion coefficient strongly dependent on the particle size, and indicates a transition towards fast diffusion when the particle size exceeds ca. 3 nm.
