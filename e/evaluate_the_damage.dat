The National Science Foundation, which is the final authority on all flights and assumes all financial responsibility for the flights, denied the request for medevac, saying the weather was still too hazardous. Plans were made to evacuate Douceur on the first flight available. Douceur and her niece, believing Douceur's condition to be grave and believing an earlier medevac flight possible, contacted Senator Jeanne Shaheen for assistance; as the NSF continued to state Douceur's condition did not qualify for a medevac attempt and conditions at the base would not permit an earlier flight, Douceur and her supporters brought the situation to media attention.|$|E
25|$|Cyclone Bebe caused {{severe damage}} to Funafuti during the 1972–73 South Pacific cyclone season. Funafuti’s Tepuka Vili Vili islet was devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979, {{with all its}} {{vegetation}} {{and most of its}} sand swept away during the cyclone. Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997, and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996-97 cyclone season with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season. Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu in late January and early February 1990. On Vaitupu Island around 85 percent of residential homes, trees and food crops were destroyed, while residential homes were also destroyed on the islands of Niutao, Nui and Nukulaelae. The majority of the islands in Tuvalu reported damage to vegetation and crops especially bananas, coconuts and breadfruit, with the extent of damage ranging from 10 to 40 percent. In Funafuti sea waves flattened the Hurricane Bebe bank {{at the southern end of}} the airstrip, which caused sea flooding and prompted the evacuation of several families from their homes. In Nui and Niulakita there was a minor loss of the landscape because of sea flooding while there were no lives lost. Soon after the systems had impacted Tuvalu, a Disaster Rehabilitation Sub-Committee was appointed to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> caused and make recommendations to the National Disaster Committee and to the Cabinet of Tuvalu, on what should be done to help rehabilitate the affected areas.|$|E

50|$|After transiting Balabac Strait on 22 September, Bonefish {{continued}} {{on to her}} patrol area in {{the central part of}} the South China Sea. Three days later, the submarine attacked a convoy of eight ships, scoring three hits on a freighter before the escorts forced her to go deep to avoid a depth charge attack. Bonefish encountered another convoy on 27 September and launched four torpedoes at the lead ship, the largest of the five, and sank the 9,908 ton transport Kashima Maru and damaged the Chihaya Maru. The escort ships pursued Bonefish, but she was able to dive and elude her attackers. On 6 October, the boat approached a third convoy and scored hits on two heavily laden cargo vessels. Again forced to go deep to avoid the counterattack, she failed to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> that her torpedoes had done to the targets. On 10 October, in her last action of the patrol, Bonefish fired a spread of four torpedoes at two ships of a convoy off Indochina, sending both the 4,212 ton cargo ship Isuzugawa and the 10,086 ton transport Teibi Maru to the bottom. On 14 October the Bonefish sank a Japanese sailing vessel in the Makassar Strait. Bonefish concluded her first war patrol back at Fremantle, Western Australia on 21 October.|$|E
50|$|Triton {{was then}} ordered {{to patrol the}} Truk-Rabaul-New Guinea {{shipping}} lanes, north and northwest of New Ireland, arriving on 30 December 1942. On 10 January 1943, Triton stalked an unidentified vessel but withheld her attack upon observing it was marked as a hospital ship. Three days later, she launched four torpedoes at a tanker and scored one hit. When the enemy began firing at her periscope, she went deep to begin an end around. About 20 minutes later, the submarine returned to periscope depth and launched a spread of four torpedoes. Two geysers of water rose amidships {{as high as the}} target's bridge, but no explosions followed. The next day, Triton attempted to attack a freighter, but an escort forced her down where she was subjected to a two-hour depth charge attack.

30|$|First of all, {{the peaks}} of the {{measured}} FRFs contain significant information of the metal-composite bonded joints, such as natural frequencies, damping and, {{it may be possible}} to identify damage. In order to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> potentialities and limitations of SHM system, which uses vibration-based damage identification, three case studies were investigated by using the experimental models shown previously. In the first case study (Case Study 1), it was not only investigated the vibration feature of the metal-composite bonded joint, but also the influence of the PZT transducer in the dynamic structural response. Hence, in this study, it was used the Model 1 and the Model 3. In the second case study (Case Study 2), it was <b>evaluated</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> model by using accelerometer (without PZT transducer). Thus, it was used the Model 1 and the Model 2. Finally, the third case study (Case Study 3) consists of <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> model by using PZT transducer. Therefore, it was analyzed the Model 3 and the Model 4. It is worth to mention that once the frequency increases with the presence of PZT transducer, the FRF response becomes more dependent on the structure in the neighborhood of the sensors.|$|R

50|$|The Galician coast was an {{extremely}} vital {{source of income for}} Spain and the fishermen. Popular catch was crab, lobster, salmon farming, and their main profit came from their production of shellfish. Soon after the oil spill, Spain ordered a study of the ecosystem in order to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> done to the benthic fauna in the region, and muddy sediments. This study was enforced {{due to the fact that}} an earlier oil spill had occurred in the same area; on May 12, 1976, the supertanker Urquiola scraped the bottom of the channel entrance in A Coruña, causing the ship to spill its cargo of 107,000 tons of oil. This, in turn, affected sea life as well as subtidal sediments, but the surviving sea life developed a defense mechanism which allowed them to survive such a crisis. The sea life in A Coruña seemed normal, but a second spilled occurred on December 3, 1993, this being Aegean Sea, which affected sea life once again. To determine the damage done to the sea life, a study was designed by determining the species richness, abundance, and biomass. Scientist analyzed the change from December 1992 to November 1996, and realized that the macrobenthic communities living in the coast of the affected areas displayed a similar trend as the original organisms in Urquiolas oil spill. Amphipods seemed to be affected the hardest by the oil spill, and experienced a high mortality rate up to the spring of 1995; also, a low abundance rate was experienced throughout this time Soon after, the species seemed to recover until the end of 1996. towards the end of the study, a trend was discovered in which resistant species dominated the ecosystem. A third oil spill occurred around the same area in A Coruña in which a tanker, Prestige, carrying 77,000 tons of oil crack into two and spilled its cargo. 10,000 tons of oil was spilled but the sunken hull of Prestige is still leaking oil from her tanks to this day.|$|E
