Based on the piezoresistive <b>function</b> <b>character</b> and the {{conductivity}} {{of carbon}} fiber smart layer (CFSL), a novel electrical resistance tomography (ERT) system of spherical and cylindrical CFSL {{has been developed}} for global health monitoring. Based on {{the background of the}} third generation nuclear containment vessel, CFSL is stuck {{on the surface of the}} structure, and the effectiveness of the ERT system is verified by virtual experiment. The image reconstruction results show that CFSL on two-dimensional curved surface has good sensing characteristics in the complex strain state. Compared with structural volumetric strain in the monitoring area, it indicates that the high electrical resistance of CFSL is distributed in the high strain area of structures, and the low electrical resistance of CFSL is just distributed in the low strain area of structures. Therefore the resistivity’s distribution of CFSL can reflect qualitatively the structural volumetric strain field...|$|E

It has been used in two ways: on one hand it has been used to represent some aspects of the loop quantization in a simpler context, and, on the other, it has been applied to each of the infinite mechanical modes of other systems. Indeed, this polymer approach was recently implemented for the free scalar field propagator. In this work we compute the polymer propagators of the free particle and a particle in a box; amusingly, just as in the non polymeric case, the one of the particle in a box may be computed also from that of the free particle using the method of images. We verify the propagators hereby obtained satisfy standard properties such as: consistency with initial conditions, composition and Green’s <b>function</b> <b>character.</b> Furthermore they are also shown to reduce to the usual Schrödinger propagators in the limit of small parameter µ 0, the length scale introduced in the polymer dynamics and which plays a role analog of that of Planck length in Quantum Gravity. ...|$|E

The paper resumes a series of presentations of this topic, for Part I, II, III, IV, see IMW 483, IMW 498, IMW 500, IMW 534. The framework has been outlined previously. The coalitional function is generated by r+ 1 "production factors" (non atomic measures). r factors are given by orthogonal probabilities ("cornered" production factors) establishing {{the core of the}} game. Factor r+ 1 (the "central" production factor) is represented by a nonantomic measure with carrier "across the corners" of the market. I. e., this factor is available in excess and the representing measure is no element of the core of the game. Generalizing our set-up, we assume now that the "central" production factor is represented by an arbitrary measure not necessarily of step <b>function</b> <b>character.</b> Then the existence theorem is achieved by an approximation procedure. Again it turns out that there is a (not necessarily unique) imputation outside of the core which, together with the core generates the vNM-Stable Set as the convex hull. Significantly, this additional imputation {{can be seen as a}} truncation of the "central" distribution, i. e., the r+ 1 st production factor. Hence, there is a remarkable similarity mutatis mutandis regarding the Characterization Theorem that holds true for the "purely orthogonal case" Rosenm and Shitoviz (2000). This justifies to use the term "Standard vNM-Stable Set" in the presence of a central production factor...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the effect of}} the strain which is present in a lattice {{mismatched}} quantum well (QW) on the properties of the device is investigated. The k. p method is used within the envelope function framework to obtain the bandstructure and the wave functions of bound and unbound states in both lattice matched and strained quantum wells. The model includes spin and interband mixing effects. We show that the mixing of wave <b>function</b> <b>character</b> between adjacent subbands which occurs in a QW can be reduced in a strained structure, and that this can result in the ground state subband having a reduced effective mass. The effect of the reduction in mixing on the optical matrix elements for transitions between the conduction and valence bands is also investigated. A model is developed which enables the calculation of the gain and spontaneous emission spectra and threshold properties of a multiple quantum well (MQW) laser device. The model includes a full description of the non- parabolic subband dispersion and the variation of the optical matrix elements along the subbands, together with an energy dependent lifetime broadening of the spectrum. The model is used to compare the performance of strained and unstrained InGaAs/InP MQW devices operating at 1. 3 /µm and 1. 55 µm. The reduced valence band edge effective mass of the strained devices is shown to lead to a reduced threshold current, temperature dependence and linewidth enhancement factor and an enhanced gains lope. The unbound states of the well are used to investigate the bound- unbound intervalence band absorption rate in the above devices. The absorption coefficient for this process is found to be small (< 2 cm(^ 1)) in all the cases considered...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} {{aesthetic}} dimension {{of language and}} thought that Gilles Deleuze affirms in his work. I argue that this dimension remains irreducible to the explanatory power of the concept and thus renders problematic any univocal understanding of the conceptual claims of his philosophy. While the material quality of language {{is essential to the}} communication of philosophical ideas, there is a paradoxical relationship between this materiality and Deleuze’s various arguments on the status of fiction, the power of the false and the aesthetic conditions of existence. By investigating Deleuze’s self-positioning in relation to key declarations by Friedrich Nietzsche on the value of art and sensibility against ‘erroneous’ conceptions of truth as a form of transcendence, I propose that Deleuze’s work manifests a contradiction between the conceptual arguments it advances and the excess of meaning that is conveyed through the material dimension of language within which these arguments are necessarily made. I explore the difficulties of the aesthetic dimension of Deleuze’s thought by analysing his method of portraying Nietzsche’s philosophy and the <b>function,</b> <b>character</b> and meaning he imparts to the proper name of ‘Nietzsche’ – especially as Deleuze situates this conceptual persona agonistically against the proper names of ‘Hegel’ and ‘Plato. ’ In my reading of Deleuze, I engage with recent interpretations of his work – most notably those provided by Jacques Rancière and Alain Badiou – that illuminate different facets of the complex question surrounding the aesthetic conditions of philosophy. While Rancière highlights an aporia between the ‘ontological’ and ‘aesthetic’ principles that guide Deleuze in his approach towards the work of art, Badiou attempts to undermine Deleuze’s aesthetic gestures as he reformulates the conditions and proper operation of philosophical truth. With reference to these interpretations of Deleuze, I maintain that the relationship between the philosophical concept and its material form of presentation remains an open and fertile problem for future critical inquiry into Deleuze’s work...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Similar morphologies between species may derive due to shared ancestry, convergent evolution, or chance. I studied morphological similarity, trait evolution, and functional significance of ecologically relevant traits in two stream-dwelling natricine snakes, Thamnophis rufipunctatus and Nerodia harteri. Both species live in shallow riffles in streams and forage visually for fish. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences for the ND 4 gene from these species and four other natricines provided an independent phylogenetic framework for character mapping of traits and statistical analyses of the influence of phylogeny on the relationships between morphology, performance, and trait <b>function.</b> <b>Character</b> mapping of snout length and head width indicated the long snout morphology evolved independently in T. rufipunctatus and N. harteri. Head morphology was not correlated with locomotor performance (e. g., swimming in a current) in these snakes. However the long snout resulted in reduced hydrodynamic drag on the snakes' heads when in a swift current, compared to other species lacking the long snout trait. The long snout morphology also resulted in reduced degree of binocular vision field in these snakes. Independent contrast analysis showed the correlations between snout length and hydrodynamic drag and binocular vision field were not explained by relatedness. Reduced binocular vision field was contrary to the hypothesis that visually oriented snakes should exhibit relatively greater binocular vision. Reduced binocular vision field should be either neutral, or effect negatively, a visually oriented predator. I suggest that reduced binocular vision field is neither an advantage nor disadvantage to these snakes and is merely a consequence of the narrow head and long snout morphology. Conversely, reduced hydrodynamic drag is an ecologically relevant function of head shape in these snakes that forage in swift water and strike for prey. The independent, repeated, evolution of the long snout in T. rufipunctatus and N. harteri and its resulting function of reducing hydrodynamic drag is consistent with the hypothesis that the long snout is an adaptation for reduced hydrodynamic drag when foraging for prey in a swift current...|$|E
40|$|Goniothalamus {{is one of}} {{the largest}} genera in the pantropical {{angiosperm}} family Annonaceae. It includes c. 130 species of trees, distributed in tropical lowland and submontane forests in tropical Asia, Australia and Melanesia. Previous studies have indicated that Goniothalamus shows a significantly higher diversification rate in comparison to closely related taxa and that its species diversity is the result of a relatively recent radiation. The phylogenetic framework necessary for testing this hypothesis, including the investigation of potential intrinsic and environmental correlates of this putative radiation, and additional biogeographical and evolutionary studies, has not previously been available. Data from nine chloroplast DNA markers (11, 214 aligned characters) and 67 ingroup accessions (c. 50 % of the species diversity) of Goniothalamus are used for parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions. The results confirm the monophyly of Goniothalamus, indicate several strongly supported major subclades, and show that most previously described infrageneric taxa are para- or polyphyletic. Morphological character evolution in Goniothalamus is investigated using ancestral character state reconstructions and phylogenetic analysis of variance. The evolutionary patterns of 19 morphological characters for which a significant phylogenetic signal was identified are discussed in relation to <b>function.</b> <b>Character</b> correlations indicate two main fruit types: small monocarps (average diameter c. 1 cm) with glabrous seeds borne on young growth, which are hypothesized to be predominantly bird-dispersed, and larger (average diameter 1. 5 cm) monocarps with hairy seeds borne on older twigs, the trunk or close to the ground, hypothesized to be predominantly mammal dispersed. Synapomorphies of several subclades of the Goniothalamus phylogeny are identified based on the ancestral character reconstructions of 11 categorical characters. Molecular dating is performed using two fossil calibrations, an uncorrelated rates relaxed molecular clock model, and the most comprehensive Annonaceae dataset to date (738 ingroup and 5 outgroup accessions, nine chloroplast markers), with the aim of investigating the historical biogeography of Goniothalamus. Mean divergence time estimates indicate a Goniothalamus crown group age of 23 Ma. Biogeographical analyses infer an ancestral area in western Southeast Asia, two dispersal events from western Southeast Asia to India, and multiple dispersal events from western Southeast Asia eastwards to the Philippines, New Guinea and Australia in the early to late Miocene. Diversification analyses corroborate previous studies which indicated that early Annonaceae diversification was characterized by a low net diversification rate and high relative extinction rate. The results of the present study, however, also indicate that the diversification rate peaked between 9. 9 and 0. 8 Ma, associated with a low relative extinction rate. Temporally coinciding environmental (tectonic and climatic) factors which may underlie this diversification peak are discussed. In contrast to previous studies, the results do not suggest that the species diversity in Goniothalamus is the result of a rapid, recent radiation. Significant rate shifts are not indicated when using methods that accommodate incomplete taxon sampling. Previously inferred rate shifts are probably artefacts because of inadequate taxon sampling. Significantly high diversification rates are identified in the present study in several small to medium-sized Asian genera such as Polyalthia s. str. and Monoon. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Diamond is a radiation-hard {{material}} {{with a wide}} band-gap which is typically electrically insulating. A wide range of diamond-based material is available, including natural gemstones and synthetic diamondmanufactured by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and {{high pressure and temperature}} (HPHT) techniques. The wide band-gap and electrical insulation properties mean that defects introduced by irradiation and plastic deformation, during growth or otherwise, may exist in more than one charge and/or electronic-spin state. Of these, defects with unpaired electrons give rise to characteristic spectroscopic signatures in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments. In favourable situations these spectra provide chemical specificity, defect symmetry, effective spin-state, and wave <b>function</b> <b>character</b> (such as sp hybridisation), and when combined with temperature effects can yield data relating to thermal stability (for example binding and migration energies) and temperature dependent symmetry effects. Recent advances in quantum chemical simulation allow for reasonable accuracy in simulated hyperfine interaction (HFI) tensors (electron-spin and nuclear-spin interactions). Indeed, many assignments for EPR centres are tentative in nature. Where the proposed model yields calculated hyperfine values that differ substantially from those measured, in addition to refuting the current model, an examination {{of a wide range of}} candidate defects may lead to more realistic models. Defects observed in natural and synthetic diamonds provide a finger-print of their differing growth conditions, as well as the thermal and mechanical processes they have experienced. A challenge that has existed for decades in the effort to produce diamond suitable for electronics is in overcoming the difficulty in production of low resistivity n-type material. N, a dopant one might naively assume would be effective, undergoes a significant structural relaxation, rendering it a very deep donor at around Ec − 1. 7 eV. Phosphorus is a better candidate since the substantial difference in atomic radius relative to the host suppresses large structural relaxations associated with nitrogen. However, with a donor level at around 0. 6 eV below the conduction band, it has a low ionisation fraction at room temperature. This thesis presents the results of calculations performed with the ab initio modelling (AIMPRO) code. The initial stages studied the stability, defect symmetry, Kohn Sham orbitals and the hyperfine interaction of di-nitrogen substitutionals diamond. Analysis was then conducted of nitrogen pair defects relating to published theoretical and experimental models of W 24, N 1, W 7, M 2, N 4 and M 3 electron-paramagnetic-resonance centres in diamond in which pairs of nitrogen donors are separated by different numbers of intervening host sites, both in ionised S = 1 / 2 and neutral S = 1 forms. Using density functional techniques, these models are confirmed, but in order to do so for the N 4 centre, for example, it is shown to be essential that extremely low energy reorientation takes place. Charge exchange and chemical re-bonding effects also provide an explanation for the distinct forms of the S = 1 neutral configurations observed. Other proposed models were then considered, including a detailed analysis of the hyperfine interactions formuoniumcentres, including the effects of vibration. This was combined with the experimental examination of N-containing diamond, where muon-spin relaxation experiments suggest a strong interaction between N-aggregates and the implanted muon. Structures made from two arrangements of pairs of substitutional nitrogen and oxygen showed no direct evidence for the involvement of the oxygen. The proposed model for N 3 broadly agreed with experimental results but not for the OK 1 centre. Despite its high ionisation energy, the n-type dopant of choice in diamond is currently phosphorus. Chemical vapour deposited diamond can be grown with high concentrations of P, and the substitutional donor has been characterised via a number of experimental techniques including electron paramagnetic resonance. Substitutional P undergoes a Jahn-Teller distortion at low temperature, where the EPR tensors reflect a tetragonal symmetry. Other P-containing EPR centres have also been detected but their structure remains uncertain. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
