He was put to death at the same penitentiary where he had committed the murder nearly nine years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{somewhere on}} the eastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, Nór had either <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> the way up and around the Gulf, or skied across; it was winter, and the gulf might have been frozen.

25|$|This {{race for}} the {{nomination}} was the most recent occasion that a major party presidential nomination has <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> {{the way to the}} convention. Mondale was later defeated in a landslide by the incumbent Reagan, winning only his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. Many felt that Hart and other similar candidates, younger and more independent-minded, represented the future of the party. Hart had refused to take money from Political Action Committees (PACs), and as a result he mortgaged his house to self-finance his campaign, and was more than $1 million in debt {{at the end of the}} campaign.|$|E
25|$|The loss is {{irreparable}} {{in every}} point of view: {{with him is}} <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> true philosophy, all publick virtue; {{there is nothing left}} but factious schemes and time-serving manoeuvres, contending one with the other, which shall do most mischief—not one English sentiment, not one statesmanlike idea—this is the publick loss. the private one is of everything that was warm, zealous, partial, where once he had placed his affections; for my own part, I feel it is the loss, not of a friend, but of a father; of one to whom I looked up for advice and instruction; and who gave them with the interest and fidelity of a parent.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the ancient}} {{religions}} {{of the world have}} a tradition of using some type of prayer beads as tools in devotional meditation. Most prayer beads and Christian rosaries consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread. The Roman Catholic rosary is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. Each set of ten is separated by another bead. The Hindu japa mala has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance, as well as those used in Jainism and Buddhist prayer beads. Each bead is counted once as a person recites a mantra until the person has <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> the way around the mala. The Muslim misbaha has 99 beads. Specific meditations of each religion may be different.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, when a {{brokerage}} firm {{had tried to}} compel arbitration with an investor alleging his broker left him holding the bag in a pump and dump scheme, the case had <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> {{the way to the}} Supreme Court. In 1953 it had held in Wilko v. Swan that three provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (or, the 1933 Act), which regulates the primary market in which securities issuers sell directly to buyers, were controlling, allowing investors to take their claims to court regardless of what contracts and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) said. It found that the language in the 1933 Act voiding any waiver of any provision of the statute was broad enough to cover arbitration clauses, and deduced congressional preference for the courts in language that allowed a special cause of action where the burden of proof was on the seller of the security to show that they were unaware of the dubious nature of the security sold, and allowed buyers to sue in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction.|$|E

A song on the album previously known as [...] "Kiss Me", presumably re-titled [...] "No You Girls", uses a human skeleton for percussion, to which The Guardian jokingly, in response, asked [...] "Have Glasgow's finest <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> goth on us?

Amsterdam city spokesman, Stephan van der Hoek said: [...] "It's a bit embarrassing, because we do keep good track of them, but it's <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> right". He promised to install a new bench within weeks. Just a week later, Entertainment Weekly said the Amsterdam film office had tweeted a photograph taken during the re-installation of the stolen bench; Amsterdam film commissioner Simon Brester said it was the same bench, not a replacement.|$|E

500|$|Taking Back Sunday {{released}} its debut album, Tell All Your Friends, in March 2002 and {{spent most of}} the year and 2003 touring. Guitarist John Nolan left the band, citing exhaustion from touring, and bassist Shaun Cooper followed shortly afterwards. According to vocalist Adam Lazzara, Nolan and Cooper were, [...] "having trouble because everything was happening so fast. Going from being home... to being <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> the time and having your whole life consumed and almost defined by the band that you’re in is a lot to handle." [...] The group briefly considered breaking up. Guitarist Eddie Reyes contacted his friend, Breaking Pangaea frontman Fred Mascherino, who auditioned for Nolan's spot; bassist Matt Rubano, who grew up with drummer Mark O'Connell, then joined the group. They joined {{just in time for the}} band's fall 2003 tour.|$|E
500|$|In January 2003, Taking Back Sunday toured {{with the}} Used and the Blood Brothers. They headlined the Takeover Tour in March and April, {{with support from}} From Autumn to Ashes and Recover. The group was due to tour the UK with Brand New in May and June, however, all of the shows were {{cancelled}} amongst rumours of the band breaking up. In early May, the group issued a statement, explaining that [...] "There have {{been a series of}} personal events with members of the band ... We need very much {{to take a step back}} at this time". Around this time, Nolan (citing exhaustion from touring) left the band, and Cooper followed shortly afterwards. According to Lazzara, Nolan and Cooper were [...] "having trouble because everything was happening so fast. Going from being home ... to being <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> the time and having your whole life consumed and almost defined by the band that you’re in is a lot to handle". The band briefly considered breaking up. Nolan and Cooper formed Straylight Run with Nolan's sister, Michelle, and Breaking Pangaea drummer Will Noon.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} leaked online on July 1, 2009. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said the music video was her weakest since [...] "Gimme More" [...] and {{highlighted}} the comparisons with [...] "Take a Bow", saying, [...] "while Madonna dressed {{the role of}} a distressed aristocratic senorita in the stands, Spears’ wardrobe and giant hat mirror the elite at the Kentucky Derby". He also said the idea was unoriginal and compared it to Spears' fragances commercials. [...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun said, [...] "forget PVC catsuits and teeny weeny air hostess outfits. Britney Spears has <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> sophisticated on us" [...] and positively commented on the fashion, saying [...] "Britney dons a hat more suited to Ascot than a music video". Peter Gicas of E! commented that the video was a nice departure from her recent more choreographed videos, such as [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "If U Seek Amy". He commended it for its [...] "more straightforward approach in telling a so-called story", but felt it was [...] "a bit too much like one of those overly dramatic fragrance commercials". OK! said the video was [...] "" [...] and also noted the difference from her recent videos.|$|E

500|$|The final credits {{movie that}} was in the PlayStation 2 version of the game was removed from the Wii version, much to Kamiya's regret as it removed the omoi—"a {{combination}} of thoughts, emotions, and messages" [...] — from the game: [...] " [...] the omoi of everyone who worked on the project, put together in a moment of bliss held out just for those who completed the journey. It was a special staff roll for a special moment. And now it is <b>gone.</b> <b>All</b> of it. ...It's incredibly disappointing and sad." [...] A Capcom representative stated that the credits, a pre-rendered movie, had the Clover Studio logo within it, and they had [...] "no legal right to use the Clover logo in a game they were not involved with directly". Since they also lacked the source to the credits, they opted to remove them entirely from the game. Ready at Dawn's co-founder Didier Malenfant also claimed that the Wii version of Ōkami took up much more space on the game media than the PlayStation 2 version, and that the movie was cut in order to fit everything on a single game disk, however despite these claims, the credit sequence was restored in the Japanese release of the Wii version and revealed that the port was co-developed by Tose, having provided additional planners, designers, programmers and test players. The images from the credits, although not the credits themselves, are still available as unlockable art.|$|E
500|$|In a 1991 Canadian {{television}} interview, Love {{commented on}} the album's coarse musical structure. She said that since the band was from Los Angeles, the [...] "metal capital of the US", {{they thought they were}} making a [...] "pop record with an edge", and were surprised by people's reactions when they were told it was violent and extreme. Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E
500|$|Awaking {{from his}} nap, Brian decides {{to drink a}} bottle of scotch that he had stored in his safety deposit box. He offers Stewie a sip, and they both become so drunk that Brian agrees to pierce Stewie's ear with a pin from his sweater, leaving Stewie with a bloody ear {{for the rest of}} the episode. Stewie and Brian discuss The Dog Whisperer and Cesar Millan, and Brian {{explains}} that he is inspired by the philosophy about dogs' instinctive ability to live in the present and with purpose. Stewie, however, points out that Brian himself does not appear to live with any specific purpose. Angered at the implication, Brian begins insulting Stewie, who bitterly retaliates by revealing that he could have <b>gone</b> <b>all</b> day without having his diaper changed, and only thinks of Brian as a passing amusement and [...] "the best of a bad situation". Stewie dares Brian to shoot him with the revolver in the deposit, which Brian earlier said to be bullet-free. It is revealed that Brian lied, and he attempts to shoot Stewie. The two then find a security camera hanging on a wall of the vault. Brian tries to use it to call for help, but Stewie points out if there was someone out there, they would have been saved. Brian then realizes that the camera has recorded him cleaning Stewie, which amuses the infant, but Brian is upset about gaining a laughingstock reputation. Stewie then prematurely causes the gun to discharge, causing the bullet to randomly ricochet off the vault walls, smashing Stewie's already-broken phone and the bottle of Scotch, and forcing the two under the table.|$|E
