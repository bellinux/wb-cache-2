5|$|Betelguese, a Trip Through <b>Hell</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} by Connoisseur's Press in Jersey City, New Jersey on July 1, 1908.

For the publishing company, Betelguese was considered its first work of distinction {{after several years of}} modest publications.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s Adkins {{had gained}} a cult {{following}} and began touring regularly, receiving offers from more record labels. In 1994 Miles Copeland III of I.R.S. Records purchased {{the rights to}} Adkins' recordings, and although an album was planned for release, it never materialized. Frustrated, Adkins soon gained back rights {{to some of his}} songs after a deal with Mississippi blues label Fat Possum, who recorded and released 1999's What The <b>Hell</b> <b>Was</b> I Thinking? and booked him a tour alongside T-Model Ford and Elmo Williams.|$|E

5000|$|Writing in the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia, Joseph Hontheim {{said that}} [...] "theologians {{generally}} accept {{the opinion that}} <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> really within the earth. The Church has decided nothing on this subject; hence we may say <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> a definite place; but where it is, we do not know." [...] He cited the view of Saint Augustine of Hippo that <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> under the earth and that of Saint Gregory the Great that <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> either on the earth or under it. On the other hand, Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905-1988) said that [...] "we must see that <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> not an object that is 'full' or 'empty' of human individuals, but a possibility that is not 'created' by God {{but in any case}} by the free individuals who choose it". The Catholic Faith Handbook for Youth, with imprimatur of 2007, also says that [...] "more accurately" [...] heaven and <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> not places but states. Capuchin theologian Berard A. Marthaler also says that [...] "hell is not 'a place'".|$|R
25|$|Heaven and <b>Hell</b> <b>are</b> each {{divided into}} seven {{different}} levels, with occupants {{assigned to each}} depending on their actions—good or bad—during their lifetimes. The gate of <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> guarded by Maalik, who {{is the leader of}} the angels assigned as the guards of hell, also known as Zabaaniyah. While <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> usually described as hot, there is one pit (Zamhareer) characterized in Islamic tradition as unbearably cold, with blizzards, ice, and snow.|$|R

5|$|At Hell, there arose a {{disagreement}} {{about where the}} Hell–Sunnan Line should branch from the Meråker Line. Initial proposals were to place the branch from a location before Hell Station, thus forcing trains to back up from Hell Station before continuing northwards. The station building at <b>Hell</b> <b>was</b> also {{too small for the}} increased traffic, so it was moved to Sunnan Station and a new station building, with capacity for 25 employees, was built at Hell. In Skatval, there was a controversy as to whether the station should be built at Mæhre or Alstad. Mæhre (later Skatval) had support from the municipal council and was closer to the larger share of the area's population. However, the military wanted Alstad, as it was a rally point for the military in case of a Swedish invasion, and gave easy waterway access from Frosta. The station was placed at Mæhre, while a passing loop was built at Alstad.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, {{following}} the squadron's transfer to Columbia Army Air Base in January, Farrow volunteered {{to participate in}} the Doolittle Raid, an attempt to retaliate against the Japanese {{as a result of their}} attack on Pearl Harbor. At the time, however, the mission was secret and its target unknown to the volunteers. On 1 April 1942, after training in various places around the United States, the crews and their respective aircraft departed from San Francisco aboard the USS Hornet (CV-8). The mission took place on 18 April. The B-25 which Farrow piloted, named Bat out of <b>Hell,</b> <b>was</b> the sixteenth and final aircraft to depart from the Hornet. After the aircraft's targets in Nagoya, which included an oil tank and aircraft factory, had been bombed, Farrow intended to land in Chuchow. However, the Japanese had deactivated the beacon that Farrow was using for direction.|$|E
50|$|In some aspects, {{the problem}} of <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> similar to {{the problem of}} evil, {{assuming}} the suffering of <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> caused by free will and something God could have prevented. The discussion regarding the problem of evil may thus also be of interest for the problem of Hell. The problem of <b>Hell</b> can <b>be</b> viewed as the worst and most intractable instance of the problem of evil.|$|R

5|$|The {{chapter house}} has 40sedilia lining its walls, {{and may have}} {{originally}} provided seating for more when it was the meeting room for the abbey community. In 1714 it was refurbished to become a library, and its floor was raised by about 1m (3ft). Its east end was damaged in the Bristol riots of 1831, requiring considerable restoration, {{and at that time}} or later the library furnishings were removed. In 1832, when the floor was lowered again, a Saxon stone panel depicting the Harrowing of <b>Hell</b> <b>was</b> found underneath. The discovery of the stone provides strong evidence that there was a church or shrine on the site before Robert Fitzharding founded the Abbey in 1140.|$|E

5000|$|In the DC Universe, <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> an {{alternate}} plane of reality, traditionally {{accessible only by}} those of demonic heritage, beings {{of a higher order}} and those whose souls have been barred from entering the Silver City. DC Comics' <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> a debased reflection of Earth, so as Earth became more technologically or socially advanced so did Hell, due to an effect not unlike time dilation: [...] "a day in <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> equal to a minute's passage on Earth". All denizens of DC's Comics' infernal region known as <b>Hell</b> <b>are</b> all capable of using some form of maleficium; the most powerful infernal magic users are the ruling gentry of Hell and their enforcers the Necro-Mages, Forges, Exegesis Guild, Renderers, Howlers, Incendiaries and Rhyming Demons. Every building, every piece of furniture, weapon, piece of armor, article of clothing, serving of food, etc. in <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> made from the bodies of the damned. The damned are put through a process called rendering by the Exegesis Guild and their servants the Renderers in order to manufacture the raw materials of Hell.|$|R

25|$|Elements of the Protocols were plagiarized from Joly's fictional Dialogue in Hell, {{a thinly}} veiled {{attack on the}} {{political}} ambitions of Napoleon III, who, represented by the non-Jewish character Machiavelli, plots to rule the world.
