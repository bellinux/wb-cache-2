500|$|Following the good-time fun of [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35", the Chicago blues-influenced [...] "Pledging My Time" [...] {{sets the}} somber tone {{that runs through}} the album. It draws on several {{traditional}} blues songs, including Elmore James' recording of [...] "It Hurts Me Too". For critic Michael Gray, the lines [...] "Somebody <b>got</b> <b>lucky</b> but it was an accident" [...] echo the lines [...] "Some joker <b>got</b> <b>lucky,</b> stole her back again" [...] from Robert Johnson's [...] "Come On in My Kitchen", which is itself an echo of the Skip James 1931 recording [...] "Devil Got My Woman". Gray suggests that [...] "the gulping movements of the melodic phrases" [...] derive from the melody of [...] "Sitting on Top of the World", recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930. The couplet {{at the end of each}} verse expresses the theme: a pledge made to a prospective lover in hopes she [...] "will come through, too". Besides Dylan's vocals and improvised harmonica breaks, the song's sound is defined by Robbie Robertson's guitar, Hargus [...] "Pig" [...] Robbins's blues piano and Ken Buttrey's snare drum rolls. The song was released in edited form as the B-side of [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" [...] in March.|$|E
