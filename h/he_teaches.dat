One notable exception was the Factor 10 Visions study ‘Towards Sustainable Higher Education’, which offered an exemplar methodology for conducting an environmental impact audit/assessment of HE courses/modules. Building on this, the SusTEACH project examined the transformative effect of ICTs on <b>HE</b> <b>teaching</b> models, and developed a methodology to assess the main carbon-based environmental impacts of HE courses/modules, and to provide estimations of the energy and carbon impacts associated with different <b>HE</b> <b>teaching</b> models. This methodology as outlined here has supported the SusTEACH project research analysis of over thirty HE courses and modules, and the SusTEACH toolkit available from OpenLearn Module: The environmental impact of teaching and learning...|$|R
