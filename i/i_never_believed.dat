500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E
2500|$|They are {{not based}} on direct {{experience}} of mine; but owe, I suppose, a good deal to the goblin tradition ... especially as it appears in George MacDonald, except for the soft feet which <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> in.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reaching}} 10,000 test runs milestone, he said,"It's a proud {{moment for}} sure. For me, growing up, I dreamt of playing for India. When I look back, I probably exceeded my expectations with what I have {{done over the}} last 10 to 12 years. I never had an ambition {{to do it because}} <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> – it is just a reflection of my longevity in the game." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{warfare and}} the inner value of the Russian opponent, the dull mass had two kinds of [...] "ideas": the tsar and God. Today, there is neither. Bolshevism has taken their place. I {{consider}} {{that to be a}} weakness since <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> that this idea means anything to the bulk of the Russian people. That is why I {{do not believe that the}} people will be carried away by Bolshevism. They will soon be indifferent and fatalistic.|$|E
2500|$|Tracey Ullman {{was born}} Trace Ullman in Slough, Buckinghamshire, the younger of two daughters, to Dorin (...) and Antony John Ullman. Her mother was British, with Roma ancestry, {{and her father}} was a Roman Catholic Pole. On the subject of the {{spelling}} of her name: [...] "My real name is Trace Ullman, but I added the 'y.' My mother said it was spelled the American way, but I don't think she can spell! I always wanted a middle name. My mum used to tell me it was Mary but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> her. I looked on my birth certificate and I didn't have one, just Trace Ullman." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shenandoah National Park {{was finally}} {{established}} on December 26, 1935, and soon construction {{began on the}} Blue Ridge Parkway that Byrd wanted. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt formally opened Shenandoah National Park on July 3, 1936. Eventually, about 40 people (on the [...] "Ickes list") were allowed to live out their lives on land that became the park. One of them was George Freeman Pollock, whose residence Killahevlin was later listed on the National Register, and whose Skyland Resort reopened under a concessionaire in 1937. Carson also donated significant land; a mountain in the park is now named in his honor and signs acknowledge his contributions. The last grandmothered resident was Annie Lee Bradley Shenk. NPS employees had watched and cared for her since 1950; she died in 1979 at age 92. Most others left quietly. 85-year-old Hezekiah Lam explained, [...] "I ain't so crazy about leavin' these hills but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> in bein' ag'in (against) the Government. I signed everythin' they asked me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, my dear. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>believe</b> {{stories of}} this kind. When I hear that a young {{man is going to}} be married to a young lady, then I believe that they are in love with each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where are you hiding, or yachting, you {{wandering}} man? I can [...] {{hear nothing}} of you from anyone--nothing good, and you [...] know <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>believe</b> anything else. Do {{come and see}} me, at [...] the old Bunhouse here, and tell me about yourself" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{no great}} matter; a few flying rumors, perhaps; but as <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>believe</b> them when awake, it's onreasonable to suppose a body would believe 'em when asleep. Yes, Jaaf stopped {{a minute to}} water his horse this morning, and I foresaw from that moment my dream would come to be true, though <b>I</b> <b>never</b> {{exchanged}} a word with the nigger." ...|$|R
2500|$|A little-known fact is that, {{while some}} {{families}} were removed by force, {{a few others}} (who mostly had also become difficult to deal with) were allowed to stay after their properties were acquired, living in the park until nature took its course and they gradually died. The last to die was Annie Lee Bradley Shenk who died in 1979 at age 92. Most of the people displaced left their homes quietly. According to the Virginia Historical Society, 85-year-old Hezekiah Lam explained, [...] "I ain't so crazy about leavin' these hills but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>believed</b> in bein' ag'in the Government. I signed everythin' they asked me.". [...] Small family cemeteries were allowed {{to remain on the}} parkland, however. The lost communities and homes were a price paid for one of the country's most beautiful National Parks and scenic roadways. Seven new communities were created for the dislocated mountain people of the northern Blue Ridge. The Library of Virginia and Shenandoah National Park each have created exhibits that chronicle these mountain people and their lost homes.|$|E
