5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E

25|$|In {{broad and}} {{everyday}} terms, {{a person is}} insolvent when {{he is unable to}} pay his debts. In legal terms, however, the test for insolvency <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the debtor’s liabilities, fairly estimated, exceed his assets, fairly valued. Inability to pay debts is, at most, merely evidence, and in itself, of insolvency.|$|E
25|$|The main {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} 'Two Layer' hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the evolutionary process truly involved the Australo-Melanesians. Archaeologists such as Matsumura suggest Southern Chinese people comprised the initial population of Southeast Asia, rather than Australo-Melanesians while researchers such as Turner argue that prehistoric Southeast Asians did not mix with either racial group.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{statistically}} significant contributors to a lasting peace <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> military victory was achieved by one side. According to Fortna's research, civil wars in which one side wins, resulting in a cease-fire or truce, have an approximately 85%-90% lower chance of renewed war. Moreover, peace treaties further reduce the risk by 60%-70%.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{subjects}} discussed in the literature <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> extreme weather events {{can be attributed to}} human activities. Seneviratne et al. (2012) stated that attributing individual extreme weather events to human activities was challenging. They were, however, more confident over attributing changes in long-term trends of extreme weather. For example, Seneviratne et al. (2012) concluded that human activities had likely led to a warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale.|$|E

25|$|The 42-year-old tram {{driver was}} arrested by the British Transport Police on {{suspicion}} of manslaughter. After questioning, he was released on bail until May 2017. According to The Metro, {{one aspect of the}} police investigation <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the tram driver fell asleep; and The Guardian reports that some passengers said the driver had blacked out at the controls. In November 2017, it was reported that a file was being prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service, who would decide whether or not a trial would take place.|$|E
25|$|If {{the bond}} angles, bond lengths and torsion angles of the {{components}} are not modified at any stage of complex generation, it is known as rigid body docking. A subject of speculation <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> rigid-body docking is sufficiently good for most docking. When substantial conformational change occurs within the components {{at the time of}} complex formation, rigid-body docking is inadequate. However, scoring all possible conformational changes is prohibitively expensive in computer time. Docking procedures which permit conformational change, or flexible docking procedures, must intelligently select small subset of possible conformational changes for consideration.|$|E
25|$|Georgia has {{indicated}} {{that the need for}} fresh water to use for human consumption is its primary concern in the issue. Experts in the metro Atlanta area assert that the people of metro Atlanta require and can safely extract 705 million gallons of fresh water per day from a number of reservoir and water basins around northern Georgia until the year 2030. Georgia states the water from Lake Allatoona and the Etowah River in North Georgia could sustain the water needs of the metro Atlanta area. Georgia's main concern <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> they have the capability to supply over 5.6 million people in the metro Atlanta area with potable water.|$|E

25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when end-use {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{used for}} {{colorectal}} cancer may include {{some combination of}} surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within {{the wall of the}} colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms. Five year survival rates in the United States are around 65%. This, however, depends on how advanced the cancer <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health. Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer making up about 10% of all cases. In 2012, there were 1.4 million new cases and 694,000 deaths from the disease. It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found. It is less common in women than men.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} distinction made by any staging system <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the cancer is still {{confined to the}} prostate. In the TNM system, clinical T1 and T2 cancers are found only in the prostate, while T3 and T4 cancers have spread elsewhere. Several tests {{can be used to}} look for evidence of spread. Medical specialty professional organizations recommend against the use of PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans when a physician stages early prostate cancer with low risk for metastasis. Those tests would be appropriate in such cases as when a CT scan evaluates spread within the pelvis, a bone scan look for spread to the bones, and endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging to closely evaluate the prostatic capsule and the seminal vesicles. Bone scans should reveal osteoblastic appearance due to increased bone density in the areas of bone metastasis—opposite to what is found in many other cancers that metastasize.|$|E

50|$|In Capitalism and Social Democracy Przeworski {{argues that}} European socialist {{parties in the}} first half of the 20th century faced a {{sequence}} of electoral dilemmas. The first dilemma <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to participate in bourgeois elections, when universal suffrage was progressively established in Europe. The question <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> participation would contribute to the struggle for socialism or strengthen the capitalist order. According to Przeworski, most socialist parties have opted to get involved in elections, since it was a means to advance some of the interests of workers in the short run and, as references to Friedrich Engels and Eduard Bernstein illustrate in Przeworski’s book, to move toward socialism.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} sexual {{partners}} people have had in their lifetimes varies widely within a population. A 2007 nationwide survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean significantly higher than the median, or all of the above (see Pareto principle). About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes. Studies of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases consistently demonstrate {{a small percentage of the}} studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> these groups copulate mostly at random (with sexual partners from throughout a population) or within their social groups (assortative mixing).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} with same sex marriage <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the children of these families will grow up positively and have similar lives compared to children with heterosexual parents. The {{purpose of this article}} was to understand how undergraduate students perceived and understood the idea of same-sex families. Each student was given a scenario of a family birthday party, except the couple in one scenario was same sex oriented while the other was not. The scenarios depicted that there was a fight between the parents and grandparents, and gave little information about what the fight was about. The experiment resulted in students believing that the fight was related to the sexual orientation of the same-sex couple. All in all, the conductors of the experiment found no correlation between specific variables conducted in the study such as relationships between family and peers. The conductors of the experiment also found in their results that the children of same sex families grow into adulthood just as happy and optimistic as children with heterosexual parents do. This study depicts a positive response regarding the concern of the well being of same sex families.|$|E
500|$|The {{conventional}} view of modern-archaeologists is {{to reckon}} the counting {{of these four}} gates (e.g. 1, 2, 3 and 4) from left to right, as one would count in Western societies, making Robinson's Arch the fourth and last in a row, counting from left to right. The question, however, which arises <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> Josephus, a Hebrew who was accustomed to reckon numbered objects while counting them from right to left, intended that this gate should, in fact, be the first gate mentioned in {{his description of the}} gates leading into the Temple Mount enclosure on its western side.|$|E
