25|$|Besides {{recourse}} to biblical language, Leo also describes his own {{special relationship with}} St Peter in terms derived from Roman law. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> the (unworthy) heir and deputy (vicarius) of Peter, having received his apostolic authority and being obliged to follow his example. On the one hand, Peter stands before him with a claim on how Leo is to exercise his office; on the other hand, Leo, as the Roman bishop, represents the Apostle, whose authority he holds. Christ, however, always comes out {{as the source of}} all grace and authority, and Leo is responsible to him for how he fulfills his duties (sermon 1). Peter is indeed the example for Leo's relationship to Christ. Thus, the office of the Roman bishop, with its universal significance, is grounded on the special relationship between Christ and St Peter, a relationship that cannot be repeated per se; therefore, Leo depends on St Peter's mediation, his assistance and his example {{in order to be able}} to adequately fulfill his role and exercise his authority as the Bishop of Rome, both in the city and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Since Korellian law forbids Foundation missionaries {{to be on}} {{the planet}} under penalty of death, the crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (as <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>himself)</b> had been {{captured}} by the Korellians but managed to escape before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the Far Star, and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered in the middle of nowhere? And how were they able to pinpoint the location of the Far Star and surround it so promptly after Parma boarded the ship? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them (and to certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor ("First Citizen Of The State") Asper Argo, indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow Scientism on Korell, and Mallow agrees not to encourage missionary work in the Republic.|$|E

500|$|Boortz creates {{controversy}} among conservatives for {{his support}} of abortion rights (on which Boortz does not allow calls), for his refusal to condemn homosexuality or gay marriage, and for his negative comments regarding Baptists and the biblical story of creation. Although <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> a Christian, he keeps his religious views private.

500|$|On his coins, Arsaces I is {{depicted}} in apparel similar to Achaemenid satraps. According to A. Shahbazi, Arsaces [...] "deliberately diverges from Seleucid coins to emphasize his nationalistic and royal aspirations, and <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> Kārny/Karny (Greek: Autocratos), a title already borne by Achaemenid supreme generals, such as Cyrus the Younger." [...] In line with Achaemenid traditions, rock-relief images of Arsacid rulers were carved at Mount Behistun, where Darius I of Persia (r. 522–486 BC) made royal inscriptions. Moreover, the Arsacids claimed familial descent from Artaxerxes II of Persia (r.404–358 BC) {{as a means to}} bolster their legitimacy in ruling over former Achaemenid territories, i.e. as being [...] "legitimate successors of glorious kings" [...] of ancient Iran. Artabanus III named one of his sons Darius and laid claim to Cyrus' heritage. The Arsacid kings chose typical Zoroastrian names for themselves and some from the [...] "heroic background" [...] of the Avesta, according to V.G. Lukonin. The Parthians also adopted the use of the Babylonian calendar with names from the Achaemenid Iranian calendar, replacing the Macedonian calendar of the Seleucids.|$|E
500|$|Whitman {{paid for}} the {{publication}} of the first edition of Leaves of Grass himself and had it printed at a local print shop during their breaks from commercial jobs. A total of 795 copies were printed. No name is given as author; instead, facing the title page was an engraved portrait done by Samuel Hollyer, but 500 lines into the body of the text <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshly, and sensual, no sentimentalist, no stander above men or women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest". The inaugural volume of poetry was preceded by a prose preface of 827 lines. [...] The succeeding untitled twelve poems totaled 2315 lines—1336 lines belonging to the first untitled poem, later called [...] "Song of Myself". The book received its strongest praise from Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote a flattering five-page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends. The first edition of Leaves of Grass was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest, in part due to Emerson's approval, but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly [...] "obscene" [...] nature of the poetry. Geologist John Peter Lesley wrote to Emerson, calling the book [...] "trashy, profane & obscene" [...] and the author [...] "a pretentious ass". On July 11, 1855, a few days after Leaves of Grass was published, [...] Whitman's father {{died at the age of}} 65.|$|E

2500|$|Death's Head is {{a fictional}} {{character}} appearing in British comics and American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

The character was created by writer Simon Furman and artist Geoff Senior for the company's Marvel UK imprint. Furman decided to use Death's Head in his Transformers stories, but believed that characters appearing in Transformers [...] "were prone to be absorbed into that title's catchall copyright" [...] (allowing Hasbro to contest their ownership) {{and led to a}} one-page strip titled [...] "High Noon Tex" [...] (which was subsequently published in various Marvel UK titles) being hastily created to establish Marvel's ownership of the character.

2500|$|Immediately afterward, Phoenix III reappears and Excalibur {{journeys}} {{into the}} future {{to save the world}} from the Sentinels. On the way back, Brian is lost in the time-stream. Eventually, his body parts start reappearing in the same space as Rachel's - first his arms, then his chest - for brief flickers. Eventually, a rift is opened in which Brian and Rachel switch places. Rachel is flung to the far future to become the Mother Askani and Brian returns home. He is flooded, however, with memories of the far future and remains disconnected from the real world. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "Britannic" [...] for some time, but eventually re-acclimates himself to his old life. It changes slightly, as Excalibur moves to Muir Island and new members join the team. Brian has a prophetic vision concerning the London Branch of the Hellfire Club's plan to take over the United Kingdom. Brian infiltrates the Club by claiming his father's position as Black Rook and, again with Excalibur's help, thwarts its efforts at domination.|$|E
