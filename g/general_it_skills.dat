We also hypothesize that three constructs of IT influence on enterprise resource planning (ERP) success and one construct of ERP success influences on SCI. To clarify the relationships among the constructs, structural equation model (SEM) is conducted to examine the model fit and seven hypotheses. The data was collected from three Iranian firms through questionnaire with 23 questions adopted by past researches. The results confirmed that top management support of IT and employees’ <b>general</b> <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> factors of IT enhance ERP success, and ERP success positively influences on Supply Chain Integration, so these two IT factors influence Supply Chain Integration through ERP success.

40|$|Implementing an Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a sociotechnical process. End-users' {{expectations}} and attitudes {{need to be}} monitored during {{the implementation of a}} new EHR. It is not clear what end-users consider the most important determinants (both barriers and enablers for a successful EHR implementation) during this process. Based on the concept mapping method and a literature search we developed a questionnaire to investigate which determinants (future) end-users of an EHR consider important. Additionally we analysed whether there are differences between a centre working with a legacy EHR and one with paper-based patient records before implementation. We identified the following determinants: usability of EHR, availability of facilities, alignment with work processes, support during implementation, training on new EHR, support after implementation, practice with new EHR, internal communication, learning from other centres, reuse of patient data, <b>general</b> <b>IT</b> <b>skills,</b> and patient involvement in decision making. All determinants were perceived important by end-users to successfully work with an EHR directly after its go-live. The only two significant differences between centres were knowledge about the effect of the EHR on work processes, and importance of patient involvement in decision makin...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This doctoral thesis represents an investigation into financial fraud in online banking and card payment systems in the UK and China, involving network security, online financial transactions, internet fraud, card payment systems and individuals’ perception of and behaviours towards electronic environments. In contrast to previous studies, the research questions were tackled by survey questionnaires both in the UK and China, with a particular interest in fraud and attempted fraud. The main findings from the UK respondents were that those with higher <b>IT</b> <b>skill</b> and younger respondents {{are more likely to}} be defrauded on the internet. Certain types of online activities are associated with higher risks of fraud, these being internet banking; online shopping and media downloading. Furthermore, four predictors (internet banking, online education services, downloading media and length of debit card usage) provided significant effects in the logistic regression model to explain fraud occurrence in the UK. Based on the data collected in China, younger respondents were more likely to have higher <b>general</b> <b>IT</b> <b>skill</b> and higher educational qualifications. However, online shopping was the only online activity which was significantly correlated to fraud occurrence. Finally, two predictors (frequency of usage of online shopping and number of debit cards) were selected in the logistic regression model to explain fraud occurrence in China...|$|R

Then, our approach is illustrated by a grading system for the case of assessing Word processing skills. The automated assessment system, we describe in this paper, is a part of a framework to assess Office skills that we currently design and develop. In the “Related work” section, we present the related work both for automated assessment in <b>general</b> and for <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> in particular. “The novel e-assessment approach” section outlines our approach for automated assessment of <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> and how <b>it</b> can be generalized to assess other skills and in other domains of knowledge. The prototype implementation details and experiments are summarized and reported in “Evaluation framework” section.

40|$|The {{number of}} girls {{choosing}} IT {{as a career}} remains very low and is a trend {{that is likely to}} continue at least in the near future. Research has indicated that it is in the middle years of secondary school where many girls become disinterested in technology. They engage with technologies such as Facebook, as tools for communication but do not see this as related to a future career. Some Australian schools have sought to address this problem through activities such as girls' only computer clubs. For many the motivation for establishing a girls' only computer club was the observation that girls were not engaging with technology to the same extent as the boys and were less confident. Previous research identified schools from across Australia who had implemented initiatives to support or encourage girls to continue with IT. From this work we identified a number of schools where girls only computer clubs were operating. Clubs are run independently of each other and rely heavily on the enthusiasm and commitment of a single individual. The purpose of the research therefore, was to find out what is happening, understand the difficulties and explore if such activities are successful. Some therefore, are more successful than the others. Seven people involved in these clubs, from different schools agreed to be interviewed and provided us with details about their club activity. The research found a range of different activities offered from invited speakers to producing videos. Many of our interviewees said that the clubs they had established had been successful. Success was defined as seeing a growing confidence girls had interacting with IT, girls being more prepared to experiment with technology, an increasing numbers of girls wishing to participate in the activities and more girls enrolling in IT subjects. The research identified a number of issues {{that need to be addressed}} if girls' only computer clubs are to continue and continue to be successful. A more coordinated approach is needed, teachers need to be supported not just with funding but general support including access to suitable materials and the <b>general</b> <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> of teachers needs to be improved...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} was to identify what features of games {{can be used to}} improve motivation and learning in a training situation. In order to determine if the use of games as an intervention in a training situation would have any influence, a small scale experiment was set up to test this hypothesis. The experiment consisted of providing one random sample group of trainees with the facility to play a commercially available video game which would allow them to use skills and knowledge associated with the operation of an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) in a virtual but safe environment. Another random sample group was provided with a Web Based Training input which detailed the specific objectives and task manoeuvres required to operate an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV). In each case, the training interventions formed part of an overall training programme which was intended to achieve the desired result of training, assessment and certification licensing of ATV operators for ESB Networks. A third sample group of game players was surveyed to determine the most and least satisfactory aspects of computer and video games. The methodology selected was primarily research of relevant literature, the use of a semistructured interview schedule to gather information on the personal profiles, <b>general</b> <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> and exposure to computer and video games, surveys from a game player sample group, the recording of test results and the observation of the course participants during practice sessions. The information gathered was both specific and measurable as the questions posed during the semi-structured interviews and surveys as well as the assessment items observed during practice sessions were constructed in a manner so as to provide both qualitative and quantitative data for this research dissertation. The software application Statistical Analysis for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to input and analyses the data. Findings from the research and from the use of both the Video Game and Web Based Training input in the ATV Operator's Training Course indicated that there are less faults recorded in the observation and control skills areas demonstrated during practice by the sample group that played the video game, but that the results were not statistically significant. However, analysis has shown that there is {{a significant difference in the}} level of motivational effect displayed as a result of each intervention on the sample groups, with the video game having a much more positive influence on the motivation levels of the ATV Operator Training Course participants. The findings of this dissertation would indicate a positive role for the use of games as part of the training intervention and that their use can clearly influence both the motivation and learning outcomes for course participants...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{changing}} nature of a range of information technology (<b>IT)</b> application <b>skills</b> that students declare on entering an accounting degree over the period from 1996 to 2006. Accounting educators {{need to be aware of}} the <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> students bring with them to university because of the implications this has for learning and teaching within the discipline and the importance of both <b>general</b> and specific <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> within the practice and craft of accounting. Additionally, <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> constitute a significant element within the portfolio of employability skills that are increasingly demanded by employers and emphasized within the overall Higher Education (HE) agenda. The analysis of students' reported <b>IT</b> application <b>skills</b> on entry to university, across a range of the most relevant areas of IT use in accounting, suggest that their skills have continued to improve over time. However, there are significant differential patterns of change through the years and within cohorts. The paper addresses the generalizability of these findings and discusses the implications of these factors for accounting educators, including the importance of recognising the differences that are potentially masked by the general increase in skills; the need for further research into the changing nature, and implications, of the gender gap in entrants' IT application skills; and the low levels of entrants' spreadsheet and database skills that are a cause for concern.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the optimal {{level of training}} investment when trained workers are mobile, wage contracts are time-consistent, and training comprises both specific and <b>general</b> <b>skills.</b> <b>It</b> is shown that, {{in the absence of}} a social planner, the firm has ex-post monopsonistic power that drives trained workers' wages below the socially-optimal level. The emergence of trade union bargaining at the firm level can increase social welfare, however, by counterbalancing the firm's ex-post monopsonistic power in wage determination. Local union-firm wage bargaining ensures that the post-training wage is set sufficiently high to deter at least some quits, so that the number of workers the firm trains is nearer the socially-optimal number. The paper therefore sheds some light on the stylized facts that unions are associated with fewer quits and more firm-provided training...|$|R

40|$|Current {{claims by}} government, major IT {{companies}} and educational {{institutions in the}} UK that <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> offer enhanced inclusion into the new economy, are attracting women {{to the field of}} information systems. The needs of one social group – lone women parents – that <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> initiatives seek to include will be analyzed in the light of another policy trend, the ‘work life balance’.

40|$|Abstract This study aims {{to address}} a gap in {{knowledge}} about Further Education college flexible learning centres and their contribution to lifelong learning. Flexible learning centres were established {{as a response to}} the lifelong learning agenda of the 1990 s and are now in the front line in responding to government initiatives to improve employability and foster social inclusion. Their tutors work in a contested area where the boundaries between teaching and supporting learning are blurred and the learning achieved may be undervalued by the Inspectorate and college authorities. This study adopts a qualitative approach of narrative inquiry to analyse the learning culture of the Flexible Learning Centre (FLC) of Hollypark College, focusing on 15 learners’ and 2 tutors’ narratives elicited by episodic interviews. The narratives of learning biographies and work biographies of learners and tutors are explored, supplemented by quantitative data from College databases. The study evaluates the ways in which the pedagogical approach of selfdirected study with tutor support appears to be successful for predominantly mature learners wishing to acquire mainly Information Technology (<b>IT)</b> <b>skills</b> which may enhance their chances of employment or benefit them in other ways. Building on recent work on learning cultures, social capital, well-being and identity theories, the study gives a voice to these learners who are so far unheard and despite the demographic population shift to increasing numbers of older people, are not the focus of current government policy initiatives. Focus on employability which is equated with acquiring skills is seen as too narrow to encompass the wider needs met and benefits accrued by attending the FLC. The findings are that this FLC’s approach is particularly effective for older learners in <b>general</b> in acquiring <b>IT</b> <b>skills.</b> Those made redundant, the retired, those in work and carers who may have been out of the workforce for some time may flourish in this learning environment where mainstream courses cannot offer equivalent flexibility and opportunities to structure their own learning. The learning culture of the Flexible Learning Centre provides a space where such learners may not only acquire <b>IT</b> <b>skills</b> but may also increase their social and cultural capital while opening up new horizons for their future. Tutor/learner relationships are of key importance and the learning taking place should be re-evaluated by the Inspectorate and government alike...|$|R
