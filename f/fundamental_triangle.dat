40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{traces the}} evolution of Whitman's democratic thinking across the first four editions of Leaves of Grass, covering the auspicious years 1855, 1856, 1860 and 1867. While democracy is the master political term within Whitman's later editions, it was nearly devoid from the original one, in which republican political concepts were still regnant. The argument put forth {{is that in the}} space of twelve years, Whitman's relationship to democracy went through a strikingly classic dialectic trajectory: emergence, consolidation and fissure. The immediate engine driving this progression was the Civil War, but behind this immediate cause was the slower, broader motor of modernization, particularly modernization's expansion of markets, for in the market's circulation and interconnection of people and commodities Whitman saw a model for an expansive and integrative democratic collectivity. The first chapter explores the importance to Whitman of the physical print room as a uniquely hybrid site in the course of modernization, for while {{it was one of the}} first to exploit the expanding industrial market, it also maintained pre-industrial forms of artisanal labor late into that progression. The print room thus became a site where the industrial market's reach and pre-industrial labor's affective relationship to the product and its consumers could be combined, and the print room therefore plays a central role, in ways both subtle and profound, in Whitman's poetry, in his understanding of the emerging democratic nation, and in his own literary productive practice. The second chapter turns from an investigation of democratic social space to an investigation of democratic time, noting how a nearly forgotten event, a loan between Whitman and James Parton, ended the "afflatus" under which the early editions were produced and prompted Whitman to revamp Leaves' relationship to history. Whitman's experience of personal debt failure led him to reconsider the ways in which his political project was susceptible to similar collapse, for the circuits of affective connection upon which his democratic project was based depended not only on their reach through space but on their forward projection through time, particularly the continual recycling of death into life, what Whitman called the "perpetual payment of the perpetual loan. " Whitman sought to reduce this contingency by abstracting the political project of the work from his immediate social world (America) to a political philosophy (democracy) which stood above and outside of time. The 1860 edition thus marked the emergence of democracy as the book's central political philosophy. Yet this strategy proved insufficient when Whitman confronted the one barrier to affective exchange that his verse could not bridge: the dead bodies of the Union soldiers. This unbridgeable difference reverberated outward through the circuits of Whitman's poetry, dismantling the political and affective structures he had been building up to 1860. A text which previously declared the absence of both the past and death - "the greatest poet [...] . places himself where the future becomes present," "the smallest sprout shows there is really no death" - now becomes doubly haunted by ghosts, once by the dead bodies of Union soldiers which, as much as Whitman declares he "will henceforth forget," he cannot, and again by the strange emergence of new "Phantoms, gigantic, superb. " These phantoms represent for Whitman the inversion of democracy's promise, democracy become nightmarish and zombie-like, and his <b>fundamental</b> <b>triangle</b> is haunted by its inverse: a melancholic Whitman; the overmastering re-emergence of the "bards of the past" and explicitly antiquated poetic forms; and a threatening, sovereign federal power autonomous from the people. The revisions Whitman introduced to the post-war edition of 1867 tell the story of a crisis in democratic confidence on behalf of democracy's former champion. Taken all together, the first four editions of Leaves form a chronicle of the archetypal democratic poet's struggle with democracy during U. S. democracy's most critical decade. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|In many societies, deep {{conflicts}} arise around religious matters, {{and around}} equality. Often, religious collectives demand {{the right to}} self-determination of issues considered - by them - to be their own, and these demands collide with individual rights to, again, religious freedom. These are thus conflicts of religion v. religion. Then, collective religious freedom tends to become an obligation {{for all those who}} are defined as belonging to the collective, which carries the problem that mostly elites define its meaning and they silence dissent. Usually, such obligations are also unequal relating to gender, with different regimes for women and for men, and transgender identities fail to be recognized entirely. Examples include not only the Muslim headscarf, Jewish yarmulke or Sikh turban cases, but also the cases around swimming lessons or litigation for prayer time at school which I use as focal points in this paper. And, at present, such conflicts surface in surprising numbers. Therefore, I will place them in discussions of constitutionalism, secularism, multi-level regulation, and, of course, religious freedom and equality. With this multi-layered analysis, I propose to seek a deeper understanding of these struggles, eyond a portrayal of them as mere clashes of rights. Such an understanding needs the tools of discourse analysis, in that it should uncover which rights are claimed by whom with which effect on whom. We need to acknowledge that rights are often an issue, since human rights are a point of reference both for moral claims as well as for political suppositions, used as illustrations in many academic fields way beyond legal studies. But often, turning to rights does not do justice to the law. Instead, we need to understand law 2 ̆ 7 s specificities, as regulation, and decentre law, 2 ̆ 7 simultaneously. Then, any doctrinal response to conflicts of religion and equality may be grounded in what is usually called a socio-legal analysis, and what I would call a reflexive understanding of the law. Based on this, I propose to search for solutions to the conflicts by relying on individual and not on collective fundamental rights read in the light of each other, with substantive equality as one corner of a <b>fundamental</b> rights <b>triangle...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Most of the {{familiar}} protocols use single server for storing all the needed information to authenticate a user. Maintenance of security is of primary importance in any computing environment. Safe and effective authentication mechanism and evaluation methods of the entity are of utmost importance for the grid users to facilitate legitimate utilization of resources. It improves the legal user's credit rating and shields the system from illegal users. However {{the efficiency of the}} grid systems still requires improvement as exchanging certificates and verifying validity are compulsory. These systems are also infested by masquerade attacks. In this paper, we propose a resilient Authentication Architecture for Security, where authentication is based on strengthening parameters like variance and product. When a single server is compromised, a large number of user passwords, will be exposed. Our proposed approach uses an authentication protocol in order to improve the security in grid environment. The protocol utilizes <b>fundamental</b> concepts of <b>triangle.</b> Based on the parameters of the triangle the user authentication will be performed. In the proposed protocol, the password is interpreted and alienated into more than two units and these units are stored in two different servers. The privilege of accessing the requested resources is obtained by the user only when the combined authentication scheme from both the servers authenticates the user. The main advantage of utilizing the authentication protocol in computing is that an adversary user cannot attain the access privilege by compromising a single consolidated server {{because of the fact that}} split password is stored in two different servers. For flexibility and reusability this authentication mechanism is hosted as service in grid environment. Keywords-Two – Server Authentication, grid security, Attacks. I...|$|R
