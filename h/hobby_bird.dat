50|$|Commercial {{radio-controlled}} designs {{stem from}} Percival Spencer's engine-powered Seagulls, developed circa 1958, and Sean Kinkade's {{work in the}} late 1990s to present day. The wings are usually driven by an electric motor. Many hobbyists enjoy experimenting with their own new wing designs and mechanisms. The opportunity to interact with real birds in their own domain also adds great enjoyment to this <b>hobby.</b> <b>Birds</b> are often curious and will follow or investigate the model while it is flying. In a few cases, RC birds have been attacked by birds of prey, crows, and even cats. More recent cheaper models such as the Dragonfly from WowWee have extended the market from dedicated hobbyists to the general toy market.|$|R

50|$|The Mendixur area is {{place where}} the surface water zone is impressive. It has 70 ha of {{extension}} and it is commonly frequented by people who like nature {{and would like to}} know more about the ecosystem of this place. Moreover, the animal that abound are the birds and depending on the season the type of birds go changing. It is a part of the net Natura 2000. In Euskal Herria, this passion for the birds has led to a new <b>hobby</b> called <b>birding,</b> which is popular in some other countries of Europe.|$|R
5000|$|As {{described}} by Frank Graham, Jr. {{in his review}} of Olivia Gentile's biography of Snetsinger, Life List, her earlier <b>hobby</b> before <b>bird</b> watching was writing poetry, which Graham, Jr. describes in this way: [...] "Inwardly, Snetsinger was consumed by boredom, frustration, and gloomy musings, which she expressed only in secret fits of poetry writing," [...] feelings which he describes as being more thoroughly addressed by her later developing aspiration to document species of birds. At {{the time of her}} death, Snetsinger was a resident of Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.|$|R
40|$|This RSPB-endorsed book answers {{all those}} burning {{questions}} about birds that beginners and experts alike may ask {{themselves as they}} go about their birding. How do ducks keep their feet from freezing in winter? Why don't swallows stay in Africa? Are birds really dinosaurs, or were dinosaurs really birds? And do birds have knees? Taking a 'questions and answers' approach, each specific question leads to an answer which expands the theme under discussion, so that all aspects of bird life and the <b>hobby</b> of <b>birding</b> are covered. The scientifically rigorous answers together form an impressive and fascinating body of bird-related information...|$|R
50|$|Five manmade {{ecosystems}} {{have contributed}} to modern avian influenza virus ecology: integrated indoor commercial poultry, range-raised commercial poultry, live poultry markets, backyard and <b>hobby</b> flocks, and <b>bird</b> collection and trading systems including cockfighting. Indoor commercial poultry has had the largest impact on the spread of HPAI, {{with the increase in}} HPAI outbreaks largely the result of increased commercial production since the 1990s.|$|R

5|$|In the United States, dragonflies and damselflies are {{sought out}} as a <b>hobby</b> similar to <b>birding</b> and butterflying, known as oding, from the Latin name of the {{dragonfly}} order, Odonata. Oding is especially popular in Texas, where 225 different species of odonates have been observed. With care, and with dry fingers, dragonflies can be handled and released by oders, as {{can be done with}} butterflies, though it is not encouraged.|$|R
5|$|The main predators of {{the house}} martins are those birds of prey which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as the <b>hobby</b> (Falco subbuteo). <b>Birds</b> of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This has therefore become a communal activity, {{with a group of}} these birds descending suddenly on a patch of mud. The generally insectivorous collared falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal house martins.|$|R
500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{references}} to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman comments that Marion eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's <b>hobby</b> of stuffing <b>birds</b> literalizes the British slang expression for sex, [...] "stuffing birds", bird being a British slang for a desirable woman. Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original [...] "stuffed bird", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{learning}} occurs in contexts where people can regulate their study and hence can control their success. College students may decide to focus on mastering some class materials and to largely ignore others; on the job, doctors may decide how much time to devote to learning about the new advances in their field; and for a <b>hobby</b> like <b>bird</b> watching, an enthusiast can choose how to allocate their time to learning birds 2 ̆ 7 names and their songs. Thus, people 2 ̆ 7 s success at learning will be driven in part by how they allocate their study time, {{which brings us to}} the main question of this chapter: What drives people 2 ̆ 7 s allocation of study time as they are attempting to learn new materials? This question has received much attention since Rose Zack 2 ̆ 7 s seminal research in 1961, so to put our current answer in context, we first briefly describe some of the earliest empirical and theoretical work on study-time allocation...|$|R

He died on 8 November 1978, aged 73.|$|R
5000|$|In North America, many birders {{differentiate}} {{themselves from}} birdwatchers, and the term birder is unfamiliar to most lay people. At {{the most basic}} level, the distinction is perceived as one of dedication or intensity, though this is a subjective differentiation. Generally, self-described birders perceive themselves to be more versed in minutiae like identification (aural and visual), molt, distribution, migration timing, and habitat usage. Whereas these dedicated birders may often travel specifically in search of birds, birdwatchers have been described by some enthusiasts as having a more limited scope, perhaps not venturing far from their own yards or local parks to view birds. Indeed, in 1969 a Birding Glossary appeared in Birding magazine which gave the following definitions: Birder. The acceptable term {{used to describe the}} person who seriously pursues the <b>hobby</b> of <b>birding.</b> May be professional or amateur.Birding. A hobby in which individuals enjoy the challenge of bird study, listing, or other general activities involving bird life.Bird-watcher. A rather ambiguous term used to describe the person who watches birds for any reason at all, and should not be used to refer to the serious birder. Birding ...|$|R
2500|$|Among the {{motorized}} vehicles {{banned from}} the refuge are radio-controlled aircraft. Model airplane enthusiasts, who took to the site and its abandoned runways before it was transferred to FWS, had hoped {{to continue to be}} allowed to do so under its management. Many of them wrote in with public comments favoring their <b>hobby,</b> saying wild <b>birds</b> and model airplanes could indeed coexist as they had for 30 years of model aviation at the former airport. While eventually 90% of the comments that addressed it supported model airplaning, FWS did not believe that it was compatible with the goal of preserving a safe habitat for the birds, and officially banned it. Academy of Model Aeronautics president Carl Maroney charged that the agency had made up its mind before soliciting public input. Three years later, the controversy had still not faded as Eastern U.S. Free Flight Conference president Robert Langelius told Congress that the USFWS had been [...] "completely intransigent" [...] and that many enthusiasts had given up the sport for lack of available space.|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} diets of four diurnal raptor {{species were}} studied, by analysis of pellets, prey remains, stomach flushes of trapped birds and feeding observations, in the Top End of the Northern Territory {{and in the}} Kimberley region (northern Western Australia) in 1988 - 89. These were the Black-breasted Buzzard Hamirostra melanosternon, Brown Goshawk Accipiter fasciatus, Little Eagle Hieraaetus morphnoides and Australian Hobby Falco longipennis. The Buzzard and Brown Goshawk were vertebrate generalists (mammals, birds and reptiles), the former also taking birds&# 039; eggs, and the latter also taking many invertebrates. The Little Eagle took mostly birds, with few reptiles and even fewer mammals. The <b>Hobby</b> took small <b>birds</b> and flying insects. This study complements another, concurrent study of the raptor community in the Top End, by characterising the feeding niches of an additional four diurnal species out of the ten now studied in some detail. The remaining 14 species (of the 24 {{that make up the}} diurnal raptor assemblage in northern mainland Australia) require further attention in the tropics...|$|R

40|$|Newcastle {{disease is}} a viral disease of birds caused by avian {{paramyxovirus}} 1 (APMV- 1). For official control purposes, this disease is currently defined as the most severe form of the illness, which is caused only by certain viral strains. Many less virulent strains of APMV- 1 also circulate among domesticated and wild birds. These viruses usually cause much milder clinical signs or infect birds asymptomatically. However, they can sometimes evolve to become the highly virulent strains that cause Newcastle disease. Newcastle disease is considered {{to be one of the}} most important poultry diseases in the world. Chickens are particularly susceptible, and may experience morbidity and mortality rates up to 100 %. Outbreaks can have a tremendous impact on backyard chickens in developing countries, where these birds are a significant source of protein and this disease is endemic. In developed countries, where highly virulent APMV- 1 strains have usually been eradicated from poultry, trade embargoes and restrictions cause significant economic losses during outbreaks. Newcastle disease can also affect other commercial poultry, game birds, ratites, and various pet, <b>hobby</b> and zoo <b>birds.</b> Some of these birds become ill, while others carry and shed virulent viruses asymptomatically. Subclinically infected birds, particularly illegally imported psittacines, can introduce Newcastle disease into countries where it does not usually exist. A number of recent studies have examined the epidemiology of APMV- 1 in wild birds. Although these birds are mainly infected with low pathogenicity strains of APMV- 1, highly virulent strains circulate in some cormorant populations in North America. Outbreaks occur periodically in cormorants, with severe illness and deaths in young birds. Viruses from cormorants can also infect nearby gulls, and could spread to other wild or domesticated birds. Strains of APMV- 1 maintained in wild (and domesticated) Columbiformes may also be a concern, although these particular viruses generally tend to cause serious disease only in pigeons and doves. Recently, several papers described sporadic infections with virulent APMV- 1 viruses in various wild birds throughout the world. The significance of this finding is still uncertain...|$|R
