5|$|Many {{places in}} Norway farms also {{maintained}} mountain farms (seter/støl), where cows, goats, and sheep would put out to pasture {{during the summer}} months. These would typically include a small <b>dwelling</b> <b>house</b> and a dairy for making and storing cheese, sour cream, etc.|$|E
5|$|Building {{practices}} {{along the}} coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people were typically built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a <b>dwelling</b> <b>house</b> (våningshus), hay barn (låve), livestock barn (fjøs), one or more food storage houses (stabbur), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{contacts}} with England after the Union of 1707 {{led to a}} conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture. New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with <b>dwelling</b> <b>house,</b> barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the <b>dwelling</b> <b>house</b> from barns and servants quarters. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep. However, although some estate holders improved {{the quality of life}} of their displaced workers, enclosures led to unemployment and forced migrations to the burghs or abroad.|$|E

40|$|A {{liquefaction}} potential map of a {{wide area}} is very useful for evaluating risk of liquefaction for the <b>dwelling</b> <b>houses.</b> In this study, the liquefaction potential map is developed by overlaying three maps including a PGV（Peak Ground Velocity）map, a liquefaction map from the past earthquakes and a land classification map. The damage ratio of the <b>dwelling</b> <b>houses</b> are evaluated as a production of three results which are the liquefaction susceptibility by the PGV at the ground surface and the ratio of liquefaction area in grid cells of 30 arc-seconds latitude × 45 arc-seconds longitude and the damage ratio of the <b>dwelling</b> <b>houses</b> in a liquefaction area from the past earthquakes. The prediction of this evaluation procedure shows a good agreement with the damage ratio of the <b>dwelling</b> <b>houses</b> for the 1987 Chiba-ken Toho-oki Earthquake...|$|R

Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lime was put down, marshes were drained, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture, creating the landscape of largely rectangular fields that characterises the Lowland Scottish landscape today. New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with <b>dwelling</b> <b>house,</b> barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the <b>dwelling</b> <b>house</b> from barns and servants quarters.

25|$|Between Kilmashogue and Tibradden Mountains lies Kelly's Glen. A spa was {{discovered}} here around 1748 but its {{distance from the}} city and the difficulty in getting to it meant it never became popular. On the south-eastern slopes of Kilmashogue, in the saddle between Two Rock Mountain, is a ruin known as Calbeck's Castle. Despite its name, it is a small <b>dwelling</b> <b>house</b> built to accommodate visitors to the spa. Built around 1800, it had fallen into ruin as early as 1821. The lands around this area were owned by a Councillor Charles Calbeck, a landowner who made considerable investments in his lands, planting trees, building roads and bridges and improving drainage. The two bridges built by Calbeck have inscriptions dedicated to his sister Sophannie.|$|E

25|$|Green's mid-1860s Newmarket {{premises}} were in Station Road, {{very near}} where it joins the High Street. They were obviously very extensive as they included a vast half-mile wide straw-bed circle which, in hard frosts, other trainers (Blanton, Godding and J Wood are mentioned) he allowed to use. But Green's Newmarket premises were {{put up for}} sale at the White Hart Inn on the 13 February 1868 by auctioneer Ebenezer Feist and presumably he, as a quarterly tenant, was obliged to move to other premises in Newmarket at that point. Further details of the property are given though – a <b>dwelling</b> <b>house</b> with enclosed court yard, stalls and loose boxes for sixteen horses, hay, corn and straw chambers, carriage houses and an ample supply of spring water, within a short distance of the railway station.|$|E

25|$|Close to Kirkmuir (previously Laigh Kirkmuir), a farm {{occupied}} by William Mure in 1692, is the Freezeland plantation (previously Fold Park) on the turnpike as {{marked on the}} 1858 OS. Nowadays it is a smallholding without a <b>dwelling</b> <b>house.</b> The origin of the name is unclear, although 'furz' or furs' is old Scots for gorse or whin, however {{the existence of this}} small patch of fenced off land may be linked to the reference in Thomson's 1832 map to a fold, either for sheep or cattle. In 1799 the surrounding field is known as Fold Park. It could have been a pen for strayed stock or be connected with the tolls on the turnpike in some way or a 'stell', the Scot's word for a partial enclosure made by a wall or trees, to serve as a shelter for sheep or cattle. A building may have existed here. Kirkmuir was farmed by John Brown (died 21 August 1880, aged 54) and his wife Catherine Anderson (died 27 August 1895, aged 72). James Walker (died 11 December 1926, aged 86) and his wife Mary Woodburn (died 27 April 1899, aged 57) also farmed Kirkmuir. They were all buried in the Laigh Kirk graveyard.|$|E
