In general with other animals, larger species consume larger prey and smaller species consume higher prey; however {{in the case of}} bats, species that use high-frequency echolocation consume smaller prey, and species that use low-frequency echolocation consume larger prey, as low-frequency echolocation does not detect smaller prey items. Small prey may be absent in the diets of large bats as they are unable to detect them. The adaptations in a particular bat species can directly influence what kinds of prey are available to it.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{threat to}} <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrews</b> {{originates}} from human activities, particularly destruction of their nesting grounds and habitats {{as a result}} of farming. <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrews</b> are also sensitive to weather changes, such as cold winters and dry periods. Major predators are birds of prey, especially owls.|$|R
50|$|<b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrews</b> mate {{primarily}} from March to October, though {{they can be}} pregnant {{at any time of}} the year. Pairs usually form in the spring and may tolerate each other and their young for some time at the nest. The gestation period is 27-28 days, and they have 2-6 cubs per litter. Cubs are born naked and blind, weighing only 0.2 g. After their eyes open at 14 to 16 days old, they mature quickly. The mother usually moves the young when they are 9 to 10 days old and if disturbed leads them by caravanning them to a new location. The young <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrews</b> are weaned at 20 days old. By three to four weeks of age, the young are independent and are soon sexually mature.|$|R
50|$|<b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrews</b> live alone, {{except during}} mating periods. Their {{lifespan}} {{is estimated at}} typically around two years, but with a large uncertainty. They protect their territories by making chirping noises and signs of aggressiveness. They tend to groom themselves constantly when not eating, and are always moving when awake and not hiding. The hiding periods are short, and typically last less than half an hour. Clicking sounds are heard when these shrews are moving, which cease when they rest. The shrews are more active during the night when they make long trips; during the day, they stay near the nest or in a hiding place. They reach their maximum level of activity at dawn.|$|R
2500|$|Hedgehogs often {{comprise}} a fairly {{significant portion of}} the prey taken by Eurasian eagle-owls, both in numbers and biomass. At least eight species of hedgehog have been predated. The European hedgehog is often {{one of the most prominent}} prey species in eagle-owl diet studies from Europe, and was recorded as the most numerous prey species per researchers in parts of Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and south Germany. With an average weight of , the European hedgehog can {{comprise a}} very large portion of the biomass. A study of the Bavarian region of Germany, the European hedgehog (the main prey species) made up 41.7% of the prey by number and 52.1% of the biomass, the maximum representation of hedgehogs known in Europe. Other members of the Erinaceus genus are also locally regularly taken, as is the [...] Daurian hedgehog (Mesechinus dauuricus) in Mongolia. Studies from Greece and the Czech Republic found that the northern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus) was the leading prey species. Unidentified Erinaceus hedgehogs almost totally dominated the diet of eagle-owls in Stavropol, Russia, making up 70.9% of the food, only the European rabbit has been found as more significant at the genera level by number in a given dietary study. Studies from both Syria and Kazakhstan showed that the [...] long-eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus) was the most significant prey, making up 25.3% and 33.6% of the prey remains, respectively. After killing hedgehogs, the Eurasian eagle-owls peel the prickly skin off their backs before consumption, frequently resulting in up to dozens of hedgehog backs being found around nests. Moles and shrews are readily hunted but are usually only a secondary portion of the diet. Eurasian eagle-owls have been recorded hunting the smallest mammal on earth (by weight) the [...] <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> (Suncus etruscus), as well as the largest mole on earth, the [...] Russian desman (Desmana moschata). From the smallest shrew to the heaviest hedgehog, the Eurasian eagle-owl has been verified to hunt the full size range of insectivores. They’ve also attacked bats of every size available, from the smallest European bat, the [...] common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), to the largest species there, the [...] greater noctule bat (Nyctalus lasiopterus). In the Sikhote-Alin range of the Russian Far East, bats were found to comprise 5.9% of the remains and, of five local owl species, the Eurasian eagle-owl was the most regular predator of bats in the area.|$|E

40|$|A {{crucial role}} of tactile {{experience}} for the maturation of neural response properties in the somatosensory system is well established, but {{little is known about}} the role of tactile experience in the development of tactile behaviors. Here we study how tactile experience affects prey capture behavior in <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrews,</b> Suncus etruscus. Prey capture in adult shrews is a high-speed behavior that relies on precise attacks guided by tactile Gestalt cues. We studied the role of tactile experience by three different approaches. First, we analyzed the hunting skills of young shrews' right after weaning. We found that prey capture in young animals in most, but not all, aspects is similar to that of adults. Second, we performed whisker trimming for 3 – 4 weeks after birth. Such deprivation resulted in a lasting disruption of prey capture even after whisker re-growth: attacks lacked precise targeting and had a lower success rate. Third, we presented adult shrews with an entirely novel prey species, the giant cockroach. The shape of this roach is very different from the shrew's normal (cricket) prey and the thorax—the preferred point of attack in crickets—is protected by a heavy cuticle. Initially shrews attacked giant roaches the same way they attack crickets and targeted the thoracic region. With progressive experience, however, shrews adopted a new attack strategy targeting legs and underside of the roaches while avoiding other body parts. Speed and efficiency of attacks improved. These data suggest that tactile experience shapes prey capture behavior...|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is home to}} over 230 {{species of}} {{vascular}} plants, of which 7 endangered in Bulgaria. It is also inhabited by the <b>Etruscan</b> pygmy <b>shrew,</b> the smallest mammal by mass. Lake Atanasovsko {{is also one of}} the key ornithological locations in the country, with 314 species of birds being present, 70% of all in Bulgaria. 12 of them are globally endangered, including the pygmy cormorant, the red-breasted goose, the ferruginous duck, the Dalmatian pelican and the corn crake. In addition, 17 local species of birds in danger of extinction in Bulgaria also live in the lake, such as the common tern and the Audouin's gull. The high number of birds is due to the lake's location on the important Via Pontica bird migration route, the lake being most populated by birds during the autumn migration.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> (Suncus etruscus), is the {{smallest}} mammal by mass, weighing only about 1.8 g on average. The bumblebee bat has a smaller skull size. The smallest mammal that ever lived, the shrew-like Batodonoides vanhouteni, weighed only 1.3 g.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> (Suncus etruscus), {{also known}} as the Etruscan pygmy shrew or the white-toothed pygmy shrew is the {{smallest}} known mammal by mass, weighing only about 1.8 g on average (The bumblebee bat is regarded as the smallest mammal by skull size and body length).|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{its high}} ratio of surface area to body volume, the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> has an {{extremely}} fast metabolism and must eat 1.5-2.0 times its body weight in food per day. It feeds mostly on various invertebrates, including insects, larvae and earthworms, {{as well as the}} young of amphibians, lizards and rodents, and can hunt prey of nearly the same body size as itself. It prefers species with a soft, thin exoskeleton, so it avoids ants when given a choice. Grasshoppers, where common, are often regular prey. It kills large prey by a bite to the head and eats it immediately, but takes small insects back to its nest. When hunting, the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> mostly relies on its sense of touch rather than vision, and may even run into its food at night.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> inhabits a belt {{extending}} between 10° and 40°N latitude across Eurasia. In Southern Europe, it {{has been}} found in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Turkey, with unconfirmed reports in Andorra, Gibraltar and Monaco; {{it has been}} introduced by humans to some European islands, such as Canary Islands.|$|E

Among vertebrates, the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> (Suncus etruscus), the Italian wall lizard (Podarcis sicula), and the lesser mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythii) live here.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> has {{a slender}} (not truncated) body, with a length between 3 and 5.2 cm {{excluding}} the tail, which adds another 2.4 to 3.2 cm. The body mass varies between 1.3 g and 2.5 g {{and is usually}} about 1.8 g. In comparison, the related Greater White-toothed Shrew can be twice as long and weighs {{four to five times}} more. The head is relatively large, with a long, mobile proboscis, and the hind limbs are relatively small. The ears are relatively large and protuberant. The <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> has a very fast heart beating rate, up to 1511 beats/min (25 beats/s) and a relatively large heart muscle mass, 1.2% of body weight. The fur color on the back and sides is pale brown, but is light gray on the stomach. The fur becomes denser and thicker from fall through the winter. The shrew usually has 30 teeth, but the 4th upper intermediate tooth is very small (rudimentary), and is absent in some individuals. Near the mouth grow a dense array of short whiskers, which the shrew actively uses to search for prey, especially in the night. Dimorphism in body features between males and females is absent.|$|E
50|$|The shrew also {{occurs in}} North Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia) and around Arabian Peninsula (Bahrain, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Syria, and Yemen {{including}} Socotra). In Asia, {{it was observed}} in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, China (Gengma County only), Burma, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia (Malaysian part of Borneo island), Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Vietnam. There are unconfirmed reports of the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> in West and East Africa (Guinea, Nigeria, Ethiopia) and in Armenia, Brunei, Indonesia, Kuwait and Uzbekistan.|$|E
5000|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat {{is about}} abbr=on 29 to 33 mm {{in length and}} abbr=on 2 g in mass. hence the common name of [...] "bumblebee bat".

50|$|The {{movements}} of the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> are rapid, with {{a rate of about}} 780 min−1 (13 s−1). In cold seasons and during shortages of food, the shrews lower their body temperatures down to about 12 C and enter a state of temporary hibernation to reduce energy consumption. Recovery from this state is accompanied by shivering with the frequency of about 3500 min−1 (58 s−1). This induces heating, with the rate up to 0.83 °C/min, which is among the highest values recorded in mammals; the heart rate increases exponentially with time from 100 to 800-1200 beats/min, and the respiratory rate rises linearly from 50 to 600-800 beats/min.|$|E
50|$|The Madagascan pygmy shrew (Suncus madagascariensis) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Soricidae. It is the only known Malagasy shrew.

[...] Although widespread and not threatened overall, they are generally uncommon and are endangered in some countries.|$|E
50|$|The American pygmy shrew is the {{smallest}} mammal native to North America {{and is one of}} {{the smallest}} mammals in the world, being just slightly larger than the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> of Eurasia. Its body is about 5 cm (2.0 in) long including a 2-cm-long tail, and it weighs about 2.0 to 4.5 g (0.071 to 0.088 oz). Its fur is generally a reddish or grayish brown during the summer, and a white-gray color during the winter. The underside is generally a lighter gray. This animal molts about twice a year, once during late summer, and again during the spring. It has a narrow head with a pointed nose, and whiskers. The eyes are small and well hidden. The primary senses used for hunting are hearing and smell.|$|E
50|$|Bats {{are present}} {{throughout}} most of the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions. They perform the vital ecological roles of pollinating flowers and dispersing fruit seeds; many tropical plant species depend entirely on bats for the distribution of their seeds. Bats are economically important, as they consume insect pests, reducing the need for pesticides. The smallest bat is the Kitti's hog-nosed bat, measuring 29 - 34 mm in length, 15 cm across the wings and 2 - 2.6 g in mass. It is also arguably the smallest extant species of mammal, with the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> being the other contender. The largest species of bat are a few species of Pteropus (fruit bats or flying foxes) and the giant golden-crowned flying fox with a weight up to 1.6 kg and wingspan up to 1.7 m.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> favors {{warm and}} damp {{habitats}} covered with shrubs, which it uses {{to hide from}} predators. Areas where open terrain such as grasslands and scrub meet deciduous forests are usually inhabited. It {{can be found at}} sea level but is usually confined to the foothills and lower belts of mountain ranges, though has been found up to 3000 m above sea level. It colonizes riparian thickets along the banks of lakes and rivers, as well as human-cultivated areas (abandoned gardens, orchards, vineyards, olive groves and edges of fields). The shrew, however, avoids intensively cultivated areas, as well as dense forests and sand dunes. It is poorly adapted to digging burrows, so arranges its nests in various natural shelters, crevices and others' uninhabited burrows. They frequent rocks, boulders, stone walls and ruins, darting quickly in and out between them.|$|E
50|$|All shrews are {{comparatively}} small, most {{no larger}} than a mouse. The largest species is the Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) of tropical Asia, which is about 15 cm long and weighs around 100 g; several are very small, notably the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> (Suncus etruscus), which at about 3.5 cm and 2 g is the smallest living terrestrial mammal.In general, shrews are terrestrial creatures that forage for seeds, insects, nuts, worms, {{and a variety of other}} foods in leaf litter and dense vegetation, but some specialise in climbing trees, living underground, living under snow, or even hunting in water. They have small eyes and generally poor vision, but have excellent senses of hearing and smell. They are very active animals, with voracious appetites. Shrews have unusually high metabolic rates, above that expected in comparable small mammals. Shrews in captivity can eat 1/2 to 2 times their own body weight in food daily.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2012 {{scientific}} commentary outlining experimental {{plans for}} a more limited project, Alivisatos et al. outlined a variety of specific experimental techniques that {{might be used to}} achieve what they termed a [...] "functional connectome", as well as new technologies {{that will have to be}} developed in the course of the project. They indicated that initial studies might be done in Caenorhabditis elegans, followed by Drosophila, because of their comparatively simple neural circuits. Mid-term studies could be done in zebrafish, mice, and the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew,</b> with studies ultimately to be done in primates and humans. They proposed the development of nanoparticles that could be used as voltage sensors that would detect individual action potentials, as well as nanoprobes that could serve as electrophysiological multielectrode arrays. In particular, they called for the use of wireless, noninvasive methods of neuronal activity detection, either utilizing microelectronic very-large-scale integration, or based on synthetic biology rather than microelectronics. In one such proposed method, enzymatically produced DNA would serve as a [...] "ticker tape record" [...] of neuronal activity, based on calcium ion-induced errors in coding by DNA polymerase. Data would be analyzed and modeled by large scale computation. A related technique proposed the use of high-throughput DNA sequencing for rapidly mapping neural connectivity.|$|E
50|$|Hedgehogs often {{comprise}} a fairly {{significant portion of}} the prey taken by Eurasian eagle-owls, both in numbers and biomass. At least eight species of hedgehog have been predated. The European hedgehog is often {{one of the most prominent}} prey species in eagle-owl diet studies from Europe, and was recorded as the most numerous prey species per researchers in parts of Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and south Germany. With an average weight of 500 to 1000 g, the European hedgehog can {{comprise a}} very large portion of the biomass. A study of the Bavarian region of Germany, the European hedgehog (the main prey species) made up 41.7% of the prey by number and 52.1% of the biomass, the maximum representation of hedgehogs known in Europe. Other members of the Erinaceus genus are also locally regularly taken, as is the 575 g Daurian hedgehog (Mesechinus dauuricus) in Mongolia. Studies from Greece and the Czech Republic found that the northern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus) was the leading prey species. Unidentified Erinaceus hedgehogs almost totally dominated the diet of eagle-owls in Stavropol, Russia, making up 70.9% of the food, only the European rabbit has been found as more significant at the genera level by number in a given dietary study. Studies from both Syria and Kazakhstan showed that the 365 g long-eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus) was the most significant prey, making up 25.3% and 33.6% of the prey remains, respectively. After killing hedgehogs, the Eurasian eagle-owls peel the prickly skin off their backs before consumption, frequently resulting in up to dozens of hedgehog backs being found around nests. Moles and shrews are readily hunted but are usually only a secondary portion of the diet. Eurasian eagle-owls have been recorded hunting the smallest mammal on earth (by weight) the 1.8 g <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> (Suncus etruscus), as well as the largest mole on earth, the 440 g Russian desman (Desmana moschata).

They’ve also attacked bats of every size available, from the smallest European bat, the 5.7 g common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), to the largest species there, the 59 g greater noctule bat (Nyctalus lasiopterus). In the Sikhote-Alin range of the Russian Far East, bats were found to comprise 5.9% of the remains and, of five local owl species, the Eurasian eagle-owl was the most regular predator of bats in the area.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> Suncus etruscus {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} mammals, with adult body masses of wild individuals of approximately 1. 8 g. In this species, an ability to contract at extremely high speed and frequency is exhibited by the heart and skeletal muscles. The mass-specific metabolic rate of the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> exceeds that of all other mammals (Fons and Sicart, 1976; Weibel et al., 1971) and, to achieve sufficient oxygen transport in the body, it exhibits heart rates of up to 1500 min- 1 and respiratory rates as high as 900 min- 1 (Jürgens et al., 1996). From an allometric relationship, a stride frequency at the maximal sustained running speed of 780 min- 1 is predicted for the <b>Etruscan</b> <b>shrew</b> (Heglund and Taylor, 1988). Moreover, shivering at high frequencies is an important mechanism for thermogenesis in this species during cold stress and rewarming from torpor. Fons et al. (1997) observed very high skeletal muscle contraction rates in S. etruscus during rewarming from torpor which, in combination with heat production by brown adipose tissue, generated warm-up rates of up to 1 °C min- 1. In the common European white-toothed shrew Crocidura russula (mean body mass 8. 6 g), ventilatory rates of 500 min- 1 (Nagel, 1991) have been measured, and the maximal stride frequency is estimated to be 620 min- 1. During cold tremor, electromyogram (EMG) frequencies of grouped discharges of up to 3500 min- 1 have been recorded in this species (Kleinebeckel et al., 1994). In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of twitch and tetanic contractions of skeletal muscles in S. etruscus and in the somewhat larger shrew species C. russula. Furthermore, we looked for the properties of the muscle fibre...|$|E
40|$|Highly active {{small mammals}} need to capture prey rapidly {{and with a}} high success rate {{if they are to}} survive.

We model this hunting behaviour using a whiskered robot. Shrews strike rapidly and accurately after gathering very limited sensory information; we attempt to match this performance by using model-based simultaneous discrimination and localisation of a ‘prey’ robot (i. e. by using strong priors). We report performance that is comparable, given the spatial and temporal scale differences, to shrew performance in most respects...|$|E
