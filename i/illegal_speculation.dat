2500|$|On 10 May 2007, Lee officially {{declared}} {{his intention to}} seek the nomination of the Grand National Party (GNP) as its presidential candidate. On 20 August 2007, he defeated Park Geun-hye in the GNP's primary to become the party's nominee for the 2007 Presidential election. During the primary, Lee was accused of profiting from <b>illegal</b> <b>speculation</b> on land owned in Dogok-dong, an expensive neighborhood in Seoul. However, in August 2007, the prosecutors said in the interim announcement, [...] "We do suspect Lee's brother's claim over the land in Dogok-dong, but have failed to verify the real owner of the asset." [...] On 28 September 2007, the prosecutory authority officially dropped the suspicion that the Dogok land was under a borrowed name, announcing, [...] "We have done all necessary investigations, including tracing the proceeds {{from the sale of}} the land and call history, and now got {{to the bottom of this}} case." [...] In December 2007, a few days before the presidential election, Lee announced that he would donate all of his assets to society.|$|E
40|$|Housing is {{the largest}} {{expenditure}} in a typical family budget and the single largest family asset. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, two-thirds of Americans list their home as their single largest asset. Despite {{the fact that more}} than 60 percent of Americans are homeowners, there is a robust and dangerous fringe housing economy that encompasses everything from subprime to predatory lending, and from legal, quasi-legal to outright <b>illegal</b> <b>speculation</b> and lender-initiated scams. This article examines the differences between subprime and predatory lending; various kinds of home, refinancing and home equity loans; and housing speculation...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} Palermo’s Punta Raisi Airport – {{that is called}} today “Falcone and Borsellino” {{in memory of the}} two judges killed by Cosa Nostra - started after World War II, coinciding with the {{increase}} of civilian air traffic in the skies of the Sicilian capital, third in Italy for its number of transits of passengers and freight, which became unsustainable figures for the military airport of Boccadifalco. Everything begins with the creation in 1953 of the Autonomous Consortium for the Airport of Palermo, with the aim to implement the project of a new infrastructure located a few steps away from the city center, ready to compete with the best airports in Italy, to increase the modernization of commerce and of the Sicilian society. The new airport, in fact, soon became able to affect the life of the people and the history of Palermo, changing the character and social structures of the towns and the villages neighboring the airport station, helping to ground specific interests of Cosa Nostra and becoming a crossroad of criminal trafficking and <b>illegal</b> <b>speculations...</b>|$|R
25|$|While {{the fact}} that the {{property}} owned by high officials, including ministers, increased on average, most of them were legally-obtained and inherited property. Those ministers involved in the allegation of <b>illegal</b> real-estate <b>speculation</b> were already replaced. Hence, the average property owned by the three replaced ministers were only 1.7 billion won. In order to set aside the alleged regional bias, Lee's first cabinet appointment procedure faithfully abided by the principles and rules by appointing four from Seoul and Yeongnam district, three from Honam, Gangwon, and Chungcheong province, and one from North Korea.|$|R
50|$|Globočnik was {{relieved}} of his post and {{stripped of his}} party honours in 1939, when {{it was discovered that}} he was involved in <b>illegal</b> foreign currency <b>speculation.</b> As punishment, Himmler transferred Globočnik to the Waffen SS, in the rank of corporal, where he served with SS Standarte Germania during the Polish campaign. Himmler liked Globočnik and recognised the value of the ruthless Austrian. In late 1939, Globočnik was pardoned, promoted to SS-Brigadeführer, and assigned to Lublin province.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1980s, Northern Mindanao {{emerged to}} become one of the three major growth centers in {{southern}} Philippines, with Cagayan de Oro City as its commercial and industrial hub. The coastal city of Cagayan de Oro, fronting Macajalar Bay, became a major industrial port and an entry point for new migrants and settlers. From a 3rd Class City in the 1970s, Cagayan de Oro's population burgeoned to nearly half of million by the late 1990s. But rapid economic growth also spawned increased land <b>speculation,</b> <b>illegal</b> logging, sea piracy, destructive fishing and mining practices, shipping and industrial pollution.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{research}} in {{the archives of the}} Soviet penal camp system, this article addresses the phenomenon of corruption among officials of the Gulag in the period between 1945 and 1953. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, which oversaw the camp system, treated corruption as a harmful and dangerous phenomenon that was unacceptably pervasive. The article investigates the varieties and frequency of corrupt activities among camp officials, including bribery, theft of state property, participation in <b>illegal</b> markets and <b>speculation,</b> and embezzlement Gulag authorities' anti-corruption efforts included inspections, audits, and a large network of prisoner–informants. These anti-corruption campaigns were largely ineffective. The article concludes that corruption existed in significant quantities inside the camp system, and that the forms it took were largely the same as in the wider Soviet society.
