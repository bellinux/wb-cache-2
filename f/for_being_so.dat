5|$|During the {{transition}} period {{he worked as a}} pathology registrar at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the agglutinin reactions in typhoid fever, leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the antibody response in typhoid, even though he was technically supposed to pursuing pathology as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> far behind.|$|E

Nancy later reveals that her leg froze and she couldn't step on the brake, leaving her terrified. In September 2016, Nancy is interviewed over the murder of Patrick, but when she arrives at the school, her leg starts to spasm and she freezes, breaking down in tears, with Louis taking her to the hospital. In January 2017, she is diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.|$|E

He sets out once again to find them, only to {{discover}} that they have been kidnapped by the Abominable Snow Monster. Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten, but the monster hits him {{in the head with a}} stalactite, dazing him. Later, Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph. Hermey, oinking like a pig, lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out. Hermey then pulls out all the monster's teeth. Realizing that the Abominable is now defenseless, Yukon drives the toothless monster back, only to fall over the cliff with all his pack dogs.

500|$|The Carrothers Commission, for {{the first}} time, gave some voice to {{residents}} in the Northwest Territories through extensive consultations with the territorial population. [...] In prior years, the decision to change the seat of government had always been made without consulting Northwest Territories residents. Edgar Dewdney, for example, who {{made the decision to}} change the capital from Battleford to Regina, faced controversy because he owned property in Regina. After the territorial government moved to Ottawa, the government was often resented <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> far away.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes {{struggles to}} eat healthily and her mid-week weigh-in shows {{that she has}} gained two pounds. She begins extreme dieting and faints in the school cafeteria. Former cheerleading captain Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) sympathizes with Mercedes, commending her <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> {{comfortable}} in her own body and advising her not to let being a cheerleader detract from that. Though Mercedes is embarrassed, Quinn tells her that she is beautiful. On {{the day of the}} pep rally, Mercedes abandons the planned routine, and instead sings [...] "Beautiful". The journalist from Splits Magazine assumes that Sue engineered the performance and expresses his admiration for her, promising her positive publicity from his article.|$|E

Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times described [...] "Unfaithful" [...] as [...] "a profoundly ludicrous – but not disagreeable – pop lament". Quentin B. Huff from PopMatters [...] commented that, [...] "Unfaithful' is a well-intentioned ballad informed by dramatic piano and strings". Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani stated, [...] "The melodramatic, string-laden ballad 'Unfaithful' is, if nothing else, an ambitious second single {{for an artist}} like Rihanna, and with lyrics like 'I don't {{want to be a}} murderer/Our love, his trust/I might as well take a gun and put it to his head,' it earns bonus points just <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> fucking weird".|$|E
500|$|Steph {{had several}} romances {{throughout}} {{her time in}} the series. In her early years, Stenson played her as a flirt, who acted out {{for the attention of}} boys.

Her later relationship with Cameron Clark (Ben Gerrard) had [...] "ups and downs" [...] due to his obsessive-compulsive disorder. To boost his confidence she forced him to join a rock band. Her [...] actions were successful, and Stenson said Steph was [...] "proud" [...] of this. She sacrificed their relationship so Cameron could leave and tour Europe. Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap praised Steph <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> supportive, despite Cameron's [...] "erratic behaviour".|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Devourment {{signed a}} record deal with United Guttural and started {{developing}} its first album, Molesting the Decapitated, again produced by Braxton.

He praised the vocals, but said that the drums, in places, let the album down due to them being too fast. Dan Staige, of Metal Review, said that the instruments were [...] "remarkably balanced and crisp", and his only criticism was that the [...] "ultra heavy breakdowns" [...] "may sound a little monotonous", but that [...] "you will still bang your head".|$|E
500|$|In a divisional {{playoff game}} against the Vikings on January 16, 2005, Mitchell caught a two-yard {{touchdown}} pass {{in the first quarter}} and celebrated by feigning to pull his pants up, a reference to the touchdown celebration by Vikings' wide receiver Randy Moss, who pretended to pull his pants down to moon Green Bay fans the week before and was heavily criticized for doing so. Mitchell recovered an L. J. Smith fumble in the endzone for a touchdown in the second quarter, and finished the game with a team-high five receptions for 65yards. In a press conference after the game, Mitchell said, [...] "I just want to thank my hands <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> great." [...] He had two receptions for 20yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game on January 23. In the game, Mitchell sported a well-publicized frohawk.|$|E
500|$|With {{her profile}} raised by her coming {{out as a}} trans woman in 2015, Jenner {{has been called the}} most famous openly {{transgender}} woman in the world. She {{is also one of the}} most recognized LGBT people in the world and arguably the most famous LGBT athlete. Jenner acknowledged in her 20/20 interview that part of her reason <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> visible was to bring attention to gender dysphoria, violence against trans women, and other transgender issues. [...] She also sought to promote more informed discussion of LGBT issues at a time when the trans community has unprecedented visibility. She signed with Creative Artists Agency's speakers department and will collaborate with the CAA Foundation on a philanthropic strategy focusing on LGBT issues. She made a private appearance at the Los Angeles LGBT Center in June 2015, where she spoke with at-risk trans youth.|$|E

500|$|Tony [...] "le Stéphanois" [...] {{has served}} a five-year prison {{term for a}} jewel heist and is {{out on the street}} and down on his luck. His friend Jo {{approaches}} him about a smash-and-grab proposed by mutual friend Mario in which the threesome would cut the glass on a Parisian jeweler's front window in broad daylight and snatch some gems. Tony declines. He then learns that his old girlfriend, Mado, took up in his absence with gangster Parisian nightclub owner Pierre Grutter. Finding Mado working at Grutter's, Tony invites her back to his rundown flat. She is obviously well-kept, and Tony savagely beats her <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> deeply involved with Grutter. Tony changes his mind about the heist; he now accepts on the condition that they rob the jeweler's safe instead of the window. Mario suggests they employ the services of Italian compatriot César, a safecracker. The four devise and rehearse an ingenious plan to break into the store and disarm its sophisticated alarm system.|$|E
500|$|His on-air {{commentary}} {{has caused}} controversy. As a commentator, Boycott has renewed his 'pull-no-punches' style {{in contrast to}} most of his fellow commentators. In particular he is known for criticising players, often in a caustic and strident style. In 2005 he mocked the Australian captain Ricky Ponting for electing to bowl first on a batsman-friendly pitch, saying he was a [...] "nice man" [...] <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> generous to the England team. In 2006, he was initially receptive to the difficulties endured by Marcus Trescothick during his periods of stress-related illness; however, he was not always as amiable. In March 2008, recently dropped Steve Harmison attacked Boycott {{in an article in}} The Mail on Sunday where he referred to Boycott as a [...] "waste of space." [...] This was in response to Boycott's statement a few days previously on 19 March 2008 that if Harmison [...] "gets a central contract this summer then a lot of us will be screaming favouritism and a total waste of money. England should forget him".|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Bowers was {{formally}} overruled by Lawrence v. Texas, from which Scalia dissented. According to Mark V. Tushnet in his {{survey of the}} Rehnquist Court, during the oral argument in the case, Scalia seemed so intent on making the state's argument for it that the Chief Justice intervened. According to his biographer, Joan Biskupic, Scalia [...] "ridiculed" [...] the majority in his dissent <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> ready to cast aside Bowers when {{many of the same}} justices had refused to overturn Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In March 2009, openly gay Congressman Barney Frank described him as a [...] "homophobe". Maureen Dowd described Scalia in a 2003 column as [...] "Archie Bunker in a high-backed chair". In an op-ed for The New York Times, federal appeals judge Richard Posner and Georgia State University law professor Eric Segall described as radical Scalia's positions on homosexuality, reflecting an apparent belief that the religious stances supposedly held by the majority of US citizens should take precedence over the Constitution and characterizing Scalia's [...] "political ideal as verg on majoritarian theocracy".|$|E

500|$|Robert California (James Spader) confronts Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{about the}} number of mishaps and blunders made in the office, and gives him a firm {{directive}} to bring them to a stop. With no ideas on how to make this come about, Andy puts it in the hands of Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who devises a system to find mistakes made by employees in the office. He programs an [...] "efficiency motivator" [...] that will forward incriminating emails to California if they make five mistakes in one day, effectively causing them to lose their jobs. The rest of the office are unhappy with Dwight's system, and call it a doomsday device. Despite their best efforts, the group manages to make five mistakes barely halfway through the first day with the system, and Dwight reveals that the emails will be automatically sent to California at 5:00 pm. Andy pleads with Dwight to deactivate the system, but Dwight refuses, belittles the rest of the office staff <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> careless, and retreats to Schrute Farms.|$|E
500|$|The {{presence}} of Terrell Owens in 2004 led to limited opportunities for Mitchell to catch passes {{and he showed}} his frustration {{on and off the}} field. When Owens went down with an ankle injury {{towards the end of the}} season, Mitchell replaced him as the starter and had a two-touchdown performance in the Divisional Playoff Game against the Minnesota Vikings. After the game, Mitchell said, [...] "I just want to thank my hands <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> great." [...] In the week prior to Super Bowl XXXIX against the New England Patriots, he created controversy by offending members of the Patriots' secondary, including Rodney Harrison. He caught one pass for 11yards in the Super Bowl and was released by the Eagles on May 6, 2005. The Kansas City Chiefs signed him shortly after, but he declined to have arthroscopic surgery on his injured knee and he was released before the start of the season. After his NFL career ended, Mitchell bought a barbecue restaurant in Lakeland in 2008, but the venue was closed in September 2009. Mitchell served time in prison for tax fraud from 2013 to 2016.|$|E
500|$|Following summer break, Takao {{returns to}} school and spots Yukari. His friends inform him {{that she is a}} {{literature}} teacher and that she had been the target of gossip and bullying. Out of kindness and to avoid further confrontation, Yukari opted to avoid work and retreat to the park, hoping she would learn to overcome her fears and be able to [...] "walk" [...] again. However, Yukari quits her job and leaves the school. That afternoon, Takao meets Yukari at the park and greets her by reciting the 2,514th poem from the Man'yōshū Japanese poetry collection, the correct response to her tanka, which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook. After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm, both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his love following dinner, Yukari is visibly moved, but then reminds him that she is a teacher and tells him that she is moving back to her home town on Shikoku. After Takao abruptly excuses himself, Yukari realizes her mistake and runs after him, finding him in the stairwell. Still upset, Takao angrily takes back what he had said and criticizes her <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>so</b> secretive and never opening up to him. Yukari embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her.|$|E
