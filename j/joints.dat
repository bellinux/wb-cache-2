5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These <b>joints</b> and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between <b>joints</b> {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between <b>joints</b> and fractures.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross <b>joints.</b> Erosion acting on master <b>joints</b> is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced <b>joints</b> is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E

5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways. The five basic types of weld <b>joints</b> are the butt joint, lap joint, corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation <b>joints</b> are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation <b>joints</b> are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation <b>joints,</b> they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. Lap <b>joints</b> are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.|$|E

Plans to replace these <b>joints</b> were postponed by the bridge management following the Scottish Government's commitment to the construction of the Queensferry Crossing; the original work proposals would have involved round-the-clock contraflows during the installation of ramps and mini-bridges to carry traffic over the work area, and heavy lorries being diverted.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral <b>joints,</b> from two or three consecutive <b>joints</b> in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the strengthening technique for interior reinforced concrete beam-column <b>joint</b> based on <b>joint</b> expansion concept.

Experimental results demonstrate a good performance of this method to upgrade the <b>joint</b> shear strength, energy dissipation and ductility. It has been found that by increasing the <b>joint</b> size, the <b>joint</b> shear failure can be prevented. The <b>joint</b> expansion is shown to reduce the <b>joint</b> shear stress.

5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the <b>joints</b> could move without dislocating. In many of the <b>joints,</b> the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the <b>joints,</b> as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E

5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the <b>joints</b> and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions.
