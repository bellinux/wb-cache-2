5000|$|Even though {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} on rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs [...] and humans, <b>forasartan</b> is not a popular drug of choice for hypertension due to its short duration of action; <b>forasartan</b> is less effective than losartan. Research demonstrates that <b>forasartan</b> is also significantly less potent than losartan.|$|E
50|$|Negative {{side effects}} of <b>Forasartan</b> are similar to other ARBs, and include {{hypotension}} and hyperkalemia. There are no drug interactions identified with <b>forasartan.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Forasartan</b> is a {{competitive}} and reversible ARB that competes with the angiotensin II binding site on AT1 [...] and relaxes vascular smooth muscle, resulting in decreased blood pressure. <b>Forasartan</b> {{has a high}} affinity for the AT1 receptor (IC50=2.9 +/- 0.1nM). In dogs, it was found to block the pressor response of Angiotensin II with maximal inhibition, 91%. <b>Forasartan</b> administration selectively inhibits L-type calcium channels in the plateau component of the smooth muscle cells, favoring relaxation of the smooth muscle. <b>Forasartan</b> also decreases heart rate by inhibiting the positive chronotropic effect of high frequency preganglionic stimuli.|$|E
50|$|<b>Forasartan,</b> {{otherwise}} known as the compound SC-52458, is a nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB, AT1 receptor blocker).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Forasartan</b> is {{administered}} {{in the active}} oral form [...] which means that it must go through first pass metabolism in the liver. The dose administered ranges between 150 mg-200 mg daily. Increasing to more than 200 mg daily does not offer significantly greater AT1 receptor inhibition. <b>Forasartan</b> is absorbed quickly in the GI, and within an hour it becomes significantly biologically active. Peak plasma concentrations of the drug are reached within one hour.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Forasartan</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of hypertension [...] and, similar to other ARBs, it protects the kidneys from kidney blood vessel damage caused by increased kidney blood pressure by blocking renin-angiotensin system activation.|$|E
