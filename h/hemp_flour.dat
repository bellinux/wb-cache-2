40|$|Addition of {{non-traditional}} raw-materials and flours into {{wheat flour}} follows contemporary trend of manufacturing nutritionally healthier fermented bakery products. Aim {{of the study}} follows this tendency, evaluating nutritional improvement of composite flour and baking potential of prepared wheat-hemp flour composites. Hemp products addition significantly increased both protein and dietary fibre contents. Between five types of <b>hemp</b> <b>flour,</b> differences were observed according to incorporated amount (wheat flour substitution from 5 % to 20 %). In composites containing 20 % of <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> and dehulled hemp wholemeal, protein content increased to 14. 9 % and to 15. 7 %, respectively (compared to 12. 5 % proteins in control wheat flour). Dietary fibre content change was governed unequivocally by addition level for both <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> and hemp wholemeal. Hemp wholemeal affected the solvent retention capacity (SRC) profile of the wheat flour used in a broader extent than <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> done, interacting moreover with addition level applied. Significant diminishing was measured for the sucrose and the lactic acid SRC, which describe physicochemical stage of starch and proteins in prepared composites. Addition of 5 % and 20 % of dehulled hemp wholemeal decreased the formed SRC from 112. 0 % to 102. 3 % and to 64. 1 %, and the latter SRC from 182. 6 % to 108. 0 and to 78. 3 %, respectively. Smaller bread volume and worse shape were evaluated {{as the amount of}} <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> gradually increased; wholemeal form had more or less a positive effect. Correspondingly to that, crumb firmness measured by penetration test was found approximately half for <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> composite bread than for the hemp wholemeal ones...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hemp</b> <b>flour</b> {{composition}} (20 – 30 % proteins, 7 – 13 % fat {{and more}} than 40 % saccharides) is a precondition for its usage into non-traditional cereal products. Corresponding to the fact, that hemp proteins are represented mostly by edestin, a low-molecular globulin, technological behaviour of composites containing 5 – 20 % of <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> is basically different. The effect was clearly reflected in specific bread volume decrease, comparing standard wheat bread vs. wheat-hemp one. Sensorial profile of such fortified product depends on hemp sample origin, the better one was observed for dehulled wholemeal <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> addition. Image analysis of black-white bread cut prints revealed increasing pore densities (up to about 74 %) at reversely diminishing mean cell areas (up to about 31 %) for bread altered by hulled wholemeal <b>hemp</b> <b>flour.</b> Comparing to wheat standard W 2, crumb appearance of bread enhanced by 5 % and 20 % of dehulled hemp wholemeal was described by conversely lower cell density (11 and 9 vs. 13 pores per cm 2) with verifiably larger cells (3. 13 a 4. 25 mm 2 against 2. 35 mm 2). Specific bread volume and crumb penetration were significantly correlated to both cell density (r − 0. 69 and − 0. 65, respectively; P = 99. 9 %) and to cell mean area (0. 79 and 0. 69, respectively; P = 99. 9 %) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to gain more information about antibody production against novel and commonly exposed proteins, using <b>hemp</b> seed <b>flour</b> protein (from Cannabis Sativa plant) as a novel protein source. In this trial, two groups of eight domestic shorthair cats were fed with different diets, a basal canned diet mixed with raw <b>hemp</b> seed <b>flour</b> protein (diet 1) or diet 2 in which the canned diet was first mixed with <b>hemp</b> seed <b>flour</b> and heated afterwards. Antibody production was measured via indirect ELISA, using tree antigens (basal diet extract, raw <b>hemps</b> seed <b>flour</b> extract and heated hemp diet extract) and cats sera of 3 time moments (day 0, 11 and 25 after starting diets). Using raw or heated hemp protein in the diets, the effects of canning (heating) the hemp protein could also be reviewed. Based on results of indirect ELISA robust IgG antibodies were found against all the antigens in both group of cats. This is not in line with oral tolerance theory, in which cats should have lower antibody levels against commonly exposed proteins like the basal diet extract. Some differences were found between IgG levels against hemp protein between the two groups, with a possible explanation that cannabidiol from the <b>hemp</b> seed <b>flour</b> extract induced immune stimulation in the group receiving non-processed, raw hemp diet (diet 1). For more confirmation and clarification about antibody production against dietary proteins in cats, further research is necessary consisting of optimizing ELISA experiments and results...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} wheat-hemp {{composites}} prepared with different amounts of <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> (5, 10, 15 and 20 %) was characterised by the mixolab rheological test. The {{present study is}} related to three defatted <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> types addition, K 1 and K 2 gained from seeds bred conventionally, and K 3 in bio-planting regime. Wheat flour of good baking quality was provided by a Czech commercial mill. Besides the mixolab profiles, basic baking quality parameters were also determined. By analytical methods, protein content, Zeleny’s value and Falling Number were determined. Dough baking quality was tested {{with the help of}} three rheological apparatuses, namely farinograph, extensigraph and amylograph. Moreover, laboratory baking test was performed, and specific bread volume was calculated. Mixolab torque data was strongly affected by substitution level than <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> type. The most precise distinguishing of samples was observed during the mixing and starch retrogradation phases of the test. Correlation analysis confirmed proper relationships between mixolab and rheological parameters related both to protein properties (C 1, C 2, C 1 –C 2 vs. farinograph and extensigraph ones) and starch or starch gel properties (C 3, C 4, C 5 vs. amylograph ones). In the former case, the strongest relationship was found between C 1 and the dough development time (− 0. 80, p < 99 %), while in the latter between the amylase activity estimation (C 3 –C 4) and the amylograph viscosity maximum (− 0. 87, p < 99 %). Bread specific volume could be predicted by all five basic mixolab C’s. The best fitting correlation was found for C 3 readings (starch gelatinization rate, r = 0. 87, p < 99 %), while links of C 1 or C 2 (maximum torque as gluten strength and protein weakening) were softer (r = 0. 73 and 0. 70, respectively, p < 99 %) ...|$|E

Wheat flour was substituted in 4  levels (5, 10, 15, 20 %). HF addition has increased protein content independently on tested <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> form or type. Partial model cereal blends could be distinguished according to protein quality (Zeleny test values), especially between fine and wholemeal HF type. Both flour types affected also amylolytic activity, {{for which a}} relationship between hemp addition and determined level of Falling Number was confirmed for all five model cereal blends. Solvent retention capacity profiles (SRC) of partial models were influenced by both HF form and type, {{as well as by}} its addition level. Between both mentioned groups of quality features, significant correlation were proved - relationships among protein content/quality and lactic acid SRC were verifiable on p < 0. 01 (- 0. 58, 0. 91, respectively). By performed ANOVA, a possibility to distinguish the HF form used in model cereal blend according to the lactic acid SRC and the water SRC was demonstrated.

40|$|In March 2010 the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) {{was used}} to inform about Salmonella Montevideo in a herbal food supplement, {{formulated}} in capsules, distributed under a Dutch label in Germany. Simultaneous to the first RASFF notice, {{in the last two}} weeks of March 2010 an unusual number of 15 infections with S. Montevideo was notified within the electronic reporting system for infectious diseases at the Robert Koch Institute. Adult women (median age: 43, range: 1 – 90 years) were mainly affected. An outbreak was suspected and the food supplement hypothesised to be its vehicle. Cases were notified from six federal states throughout Germany, which required efficient coordination of information and activities. A case–control study (n= 55) among adult women showed an association between consumption of the specific food supplement and the disease (odds ratio (OR) : 27. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 3. 1 –infinity, p-value= 0. 002). Restricting the case–control study to the period when the outbreak peaked (between 29 March and 11 April 2010) resulted in an OR of 43. 5 (95 % CI: 4. 8 –infinity, p-value= 0. 001). Trace-back of the supplement’s main ingredient, <b>hemp</b> seed <b>flour,</b> and subsequent microbiological testing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis supported its likely role in transmission.

40|$|Wheat/hemp and wheat/teff model {{composites}} {{were prepared}} as 90 : 10 and 80 : 20 w/w blends, using two different Czech commercial wheat flour samples (standards M, M 1) and bright/dark forms of these non-traditional crops flour. The ob- jective {{of this study}} was to determine the effect of alternative flour samples on the blend compositional profiles including dietary fibre content, on the technological quality described by modern Solvent Retention Capacity method and on laboratory baking test results. According to seeds composition, nutritional flour enrichment reached higher levels of protein (from approx. 13. 0 % about 30 % vs. 6 %) and fibre contents (from approx. 3. 3 % about 50 % vs. 30 %) in the case of hemp and teff samples. In terms of the SRC profile, the qualitatively better sample M was weakened by <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> additions, while somewhat worse sample M 1 was improved by teff flour additions. Results from the baking test showed that the hemp composites were partly dependent on <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> form. Volumes of bread with bright hemp were diminished from 257 mL/ 100 g up to 196 mL/ 100 g, the products containing dark hemp increased up to 328 mL/ 100 g. Teff-fortified bun volumes were evaluated in close range of 325 - 369 mL/ 100 g against 381 mL/ 100 g for standard M 1.

Addition of 5 % - 20 % of hemp press cake fine flour and fine wholemeal significantly increased dietary fibre content, but their influence on volume of laboratory baked bread was different. Reflecting actual dosage, both types of hemp press cake flour diminished bun sizes about 6 % - 33 %; volumes of bread containing hulled wholemeal were comparable to standard (mean 310 mL/ 100  g vs. 333  ml/ 100  g, respectively. Only dehulled wholemeal hemp form increased the bread specific volume (6 % - 30 %), especially as 10 % fortification (434  mL/ 100  g). Six Canadian hemp products were added as 10 % and 20 % on wheat flour base, comprising fine <b>hemp</b> <b>flour</b> and coarse hemp powder, dehulled whole seeds, hulled hemp seeds with sea salt as well as 50 % and 43 % hemp protein concentrates (KP 1 -KP 6, respectively). The higher level of KP 1, KP 2, KP 5 and KP 6, the lower bread specific volumes were determined (decrease about 9 % - 48 %). Soft increase in buns size caused by 10 % and 20 % KP 3 (323 and 319  ml/ 100  g vs. 296  mL/ 100  g) was insignificant. The effect of KP 4 was reversely verifiable, magnifying the parameter about 25 % and 17 %, respectively.

Addition of barley flour affected specific bread volume; diminishing for wheat-barley blends 70 : 30 and 50 : 50 reached 30 % and 43 %, respectively. Volume of bread prepared from wheat-barley blend 70 : 30 enhanced by dehulled hemp wholemeal was the highest within the tested tri-composites set, achieving 130 % of wheat-barley control; other hemp products caused the parameter decrease (from 8 to 33 %). Within a group of bakery products containing 50 % of barley flour, hulled hemp wholemeal partially supressed negative effect of barley flour – specific bread volumes increased about ca 15 %.
