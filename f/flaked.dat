5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from eastern Africa {{extending from the}} Rift Valley from Ethiopia to northern Tanzania represents the largest archaeological evidence of the shift from the Late Acheulian to the Middle Stone Age tool technologies. This transition is characterized by stratigraphic layering of Acheulian stone tools, a bifacial handaxe technology, underneath and even contemporaneous with MSA technologies, such as Levallois tools, flakes, <b>flaked</b> tools, pointed flakes, smaller bifaces that are projectile in form, and, on rare occasions, hafted tools. Evidence of the gradual displacement of Acheulian by MSA technologies is further supported by this layering and contemporaneous placement, {{as well as by}} the earliest appearance of MSA technologies at Gademotta and the latest Acheulian technologies at the Bouri Formation of Ethiopia, dated to 154 to 160 kya.

5|$|Egypt {{is rich in}} {{building}} and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and fashion jewelry. Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification, which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster. Ore-bearing rock formations were found in distant, inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive gold mines in Nubia, {{and one of the}} first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite, greywacke, and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully <b>flaked</b> to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose. Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances.|$|E
40|$|The self-retracting {{motion of}} a {{graphene}} <b>flake</b> on {{a stack of}} graphene <b>flakes</b> is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown {{that in the case}} when the extended <b>flake</b> is initially rotated to an incommensurate state, there is no barrier to the self-retracting motion of the <b>flake</b> and the <b>flake</b> retracts as fast as possible. If the extended <b>flake</b> is initially commensurate with the other <b>flakes,</b> the self-retracting motion is hindered by potential energy barriers. However, in this case, the rotation of the <b>flake</b> to incommensurate states is often observed. Such a rotation is found to be induced by the torque acting on the <b>flake</b> on hills of the potential relief of the interaction energy between the <b>flakes.</b> Contrary to carbon nanotubes, telescopic oscillations of the graphene <b>flake</b> are suppressed because of the high dynamic friction related to the excitation of flexural vibrations of the <b>flake.</b> This makes graphene promising for the use in fast-responding electromechanical memory cells.

5|$|FES is {{the oldest}} variant of Guinness that is still available, {{although}} its ingredients and production methods have varied over time. In 1824, it had an original gravity (OG) of 1082. After a peak in strength in 1840, when the beer had an OG of 1098, by 1860, the beer was reduced to its current standard strength of around 1075 OG. FES was originally brewed with pale and brown malts. Black malt was used from 1819, and by 1828 its use had entirely replaced brown malt. In 1883, the beer was produced with 85 per cent pale malt, 10 per cent amber malt and 5 per cent roasted malt. From 1929 – 1930 onwards, Guinness switched from using roasted malt in the beer's production to roasted barley. Amber malt continued {{to be added to}} the grist until 1940. <b>Flaked</b> barley was introduced in the early 1950s, and the hopping rate was decreased.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{because of}} its size, The Sirens and Ulysses failed to sell at the Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 Etty met again with Daniel Grant who, without having seen the painting, offered £250 (about £ in today's terms) for Sirens and for Samson and Delilah, also {{exhibited}} by Etty that year. Etty, poor at business and always reluctant to keep unsold paintings in his studio, sold both paintings to Grant for well below their true worth. Etty had used a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which <b>flaked</b> when dry, {{and as soon as}} it was complete Sirens began to deteriorate. It was shown at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition but then considered in too poor a condition for further public display, and placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In 2006 restoration began on it, and in May 2010 Sirens was returned to public display and is now one of the key works in the Manchester Art Gallery.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the cutting efficiency of <b>flake</b> tools increases with increased tool size. Here, we undertook {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>flake</b> size and efficiency parameters using a larger and more variable <b>flake</b> dataset than used in previous analyses. Our analyses were specifically designed to assess whether there is an absolute relationship between ever-increasing <b>flake</b> size and increased efficiency and/or loading potential. An alternative hypothesis is merely that only the smallest <b>flakes</b> are inefficient, and it is this factor which has been driving previous statements linking increasing <b>flake</b> size with increased efficiency. Our first set of analyses, using all experimental <b>flakes,</b> determined that a statistically significant relationship existed between increased <b>flake</b> sizes and increased cutting efficiency, as measured by two different efficiency measures (‘Time taken’ and ‘Number of cutting strokes required’). This analysis also demonstrated a statistically significant positive relationship between <b>flake</b> size and loading forces. However, our second analysis, which excluded the smallest <b>flakes</b> in our sample, revealed a different pattern. In this second set of analyses, increasing <b>flake</b> size did not indicate a statistically significant relationship with our two measures of cutting efficiency. A statistically significant relationship between increased <b>flake</b> size and increased loading was, however, still evinced. In sum, these results suggest that there is not an unconditional or absolute relationship between increased <b>flake</b> size and increased cutting efficiency in all circumstances. Rather, there is a threshold below which <b>flakes</b> of a certain size will become markedly inefficient.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The need {{to develop}} {{recycling}} solutions for carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites has been well established. However, recycled composites remain inferior to composites fabricated with virgin fibers for several reasons. Realistically, recycled composites {{can be expected to}} achieve comparable performance to sheet molding compounds fabricated with virgin fibers if fiber volume fractions can be improved without significantly reducing fiber length. One possible way to achieve this is to fabricate laminates with <b>flakes</b> of cured CFRP. The goal of this research was to investigate the effect of <b>flake</b> geometry on the properties of recycled <b>flake</b> reinforced composites, and to evaluate whether fabricating recycled laminates with CFRP <b>flakes</b> may become a viable alternative to current CFRP recycling techniques. This was accomplished by fabricating and mechanically testing several composite laminates with either shredded <b>flake</b> or single ply <b>flake</b> reinforcement. The shredded material was provided as-shredded by The Boeing Company, and no further processing of the <b>flakes</b> was done prior to resin infusion. The single ply <b>flakes</b> were cured in individual sheets and cut into <b>flakes</b> of different geometries. This <b>flake</b> system was chosen to simulate cured prepreg scrap or delaminated CFRP recyclate, and to provide a well-controlled material system for studying the effects of <b>flake</b> geometry on the properties of <b>flake</b> reinforced composites.

30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the friction behaviors of graphene <b>flakes</b> sliding on a gold substrate using molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of <b>flake</b> size, <b>flake</b> shape, relative rotation angle between <b>flake</b> and substrate, and crystal orientation of substrate on the friction process are thoroughly studied. It is found {{that under the}} same load, the average friction forces per atom are smaller for a bigger graphene <b>flake,</b> which exhibits an obvious size effect. It is also shown that <b>flake</b> shape is critical in determining the friction in the sliding process. The average friction forces per atom for the square <b>flake</b> are much bigger than those for the triangular and round <b>flakes.</b> Moreover, the average friction forces per atom for the triangular <b>flake</b> are the smallest. We also find that the orientation of graphene <b>flake</b> relative to gold substrate plays {{a vital role in}} the friction process. The friction forces for the graphene <b>flake</b> sliding along the armchair direction are much bigger than those for the <b>flakes</b> with rotation. In addition, it is also found that single crystalline gold substrate exhibits a significant anisotropic effect of friction, which is attributed to the anisotropic effect of potential energy corrugation. These understandings not only shed light on the underlying mechanisms of graphene <b>flake</b> sliding on the gold substrates but also may guide the design and fabrication of nanoscale graphene-based devices.|$|R
40|$|Quality of oat <b>flakes</b> is {{dependent}} on end-use. Specific weight is used to steer the <b>flaking</b> process, and is important in ensuring that the correct pack weight is achieved. It is also related to <b>flake</b> thickness. <b>Flake</b> thickness in turn may affect other quality parameters such as water absorption, colour and breakage of the <b>flakes.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the effect of specific weight on the quality parameters of oat <b>flakes.</b> Oat <b>flakes</b> were prepared from locally grown oats by a commercial mill. Five <b>flake</b> thickness levels were obtained by adjusting the gap between the rolls. According to usual practice, specific weight was used as an indicator of thickness. For determination of moisture content and pasting properties, samples were ground using a pin mill and cyclone mill. Thickness was measured from 10 randomly selected <b>flakes.</b> Moisture content was determined by air-drying. Water absorption was determined by weighing 50 g of <b>flakes</b> into a beaker and adding 200 ml of water at 24 °C. After 5 min the mixture was spread over a pre-weighed 0. 85 mm screen, tilted at 28 ° from the horizontal and allowed to drain. <b>Flake</b> colour was measured with a tri-stimulus instrument. <b>Flake</b> size distribution was measured using 5 and 2. 5 mm round-holed sieves, from a representative sample obtained with a sample divider. Pasting properties were measured using a Rapid Viscoanalyzer. There was a positive correlation between specific weight and <b>flake</b> thickness. Specific weight showed strong negative correlations with water absorption and the peak viscosity of <b>flakes</b> ground in a pin mill, however there were no significant difference between finely ground <b>flakes,</b> which suggests differences in the particle size distribution or extractability of starch. Thin <b>flakes</b> were whiter. The relationship between specific weight and breakage was less clear, although thin <b>flakes</b> were more susceptible to breakage. These results suggest some methods for measuring the quality of oat <b>flakes</b> and show the effect of a milling parameter (specific weight) on these quality parameters. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
