40|$|Elastic modulus {{anisotropy}} {{with respect}} to sheet rolling direction was calculated, using X-ray diffraction determined texture components and their known individual anisotropies, for a deep <b>drawing</b> <b>grade</b> steel in the cold rolled as received and three heat treated conditions. The calculated elastic modulus anisotropy was compared to mechanically measured modulus values, at 0, 45 and 90 degrees to the rolling direction, and ultrasonic velocity anisotropy, measured using an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) system. It {{was found that the}} EMAT velocity anisotropy matched the measured modulus variation with angle, with differences between the as rolled and heat treated conditions being observed. However the predicted modulus variation did not show much difference between the as rolled and heat treated conditions, despite different textures being measured, resulting in a slight discrepancy with the EMAT velocity and measured modulus values at 90 degrees for one heat treatment condition. ...|$|E
40|$|Orientation {{distribution}} function Abstract. The variation of microstructure of Ti-IF steel of extra deep <b>drawing</b> <b>grade,</b> which having a 83 %cold-rolled deformation under simulated batch annealing process at temperature ranging from 480 ℃ to 750 ℃, was studied by using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction(XRD) and metallographic micro-hardness tester. The evolution of texture during the recrystallization process was analyzed by Orientation Density Function(ODF). The results show that, the recrystallization temperature of experimental steel is 620 - 630 ℃, and the recrystallization {{process can be}} accomplished within 1 h at 660 ℃. Four major textures after cold rolling are observed as follows,{ 001 }, { 111 }, { 111 } and { 112 }, respectively. At the early stage of recrystallization annealing, texture evolves from{ 111 }toγ-{ 111 }, which is quite beneficial to achieve high deep drawing performance ， the texture { 001 } and { 112 } change marginally. as the annealing temperature rises up to 720 ℃, texture { 001 } and { 112 } change into fiber textureγ-{ 111 }. After annealing,{ 111 } and { 111 } textures become the two main types...|$|E
40|$|Collar forming is a {{tractive}} compressive forming {{technique to}} turn up a closed component border, often a circular hole in a sheet metal or sheet metal component. Today, high-strength steel materials with a reduced deformation capability compared to a smoother deep <b>drawing</b> <b>grade</b> are used increasingly in collar forming due to developments in lightweight body production. This is {{at the expense of}} the constructive claim for preferably high collar heights. In many applications collar shapes requiring an expansion close to the maximum expansion possibility of the sheet metal component are produced. Negative influences on material ductility caused by batch deviations and further process deviations while handling the components can cause undesirable and irregularly appearing cracking during the collar forming process. Visual supervision by the staff at the outfeed conveyor is a limited possibility depending on the cracking type and size and further circumstances in the processing environment. If crack-containing components are not identified and sorted out early in the process chain, they can be joined to the shell or even be delivered to the customer in the corresponding assembly. The project's objective was to develop and validate a non-destructive test method to detect cracks in collar forming respectively components containing a collar automatically. The suitability of the considered test methods has been evaluated in terms of this application. Non-destructive post-process methods and an in-process method were used. Besides inductive thermal imaging, eddy current testing and electromagnetic ultrasound, noise emission analysis has been performed. Laboratory samples containing a collar of high-strength steel materials and an aluminium alloy have been consulted as objects of investigation. Samples with a wide range of both natural and artificial cracks were used to validate the test methods. Parts from serial processes have also been included. Two test concepts based on the investigations realized were created with regards to the process accompanying and integrated application of crack detection. The first concept uses an EMUS test system whose sensory components can be integrated into the transfer press' space. In the simple case, the EMUS test can be integrated into the transfer press as an own test step at the end of the process chain. The integration of the EMUS sensors directly to the collar forming tool is basically possible. In every case the sensors have to be tailored to the height and diameter of the collar geometry. The collar geometry testable with EMUS brings specific requirements. In the second test concept based on inductive thermal imaging any collar geometry can be tested if optically accessible. The necessary demand of space for mounting such a test system is significantly higher than with EMUS. Therefore this test concept cannot be integrated into the transfer press or even into the tool. The thermal imaging test system can be installed at the conveyor as a continuous inline test method. The objective of the project was achieved...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Drawing is an {{economical}} {{and effective}} tool for thinking assisting and ideation expressing {{and has been}} used by the designers and artists for their creative works. For design and art students the drawing is an importantly required core course. The practice in straight line drawing is the most basic and significant item in drawing course. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the effects of hand stability in eight movements on <b>drawing</b> <b>grades.</b> The eight movements are: upward movement, downward movement, leftward movement, rightward movement, left-upward movement, left-downward movement, right-upward movement and right-downward movement. Twenty university and graduate students in design school served as subjects participating in the experiment. The main findings of the study can be concluded as following: 1) the rightward movement is the most stable movement and the left-upward movement is the least stable movement among the eight movements. 2) The stability of hand movement is positive correlated to the drawing ability. 3) The downward movement and left-upward movement are the more powerful predictors for assessing the drawing ability than the other six movements. and 4) The stability of three segments of hand movement from the most to the least stable are in the medium, ending, and starting segment sequence...|$|R

40|$|In the past, {{studies of}} {{aggression}} focussed {{almost exclusively on}} physical aggression; findings revealed that males were more aggressive than females. Recently, interest in female aggression has been rekindled due to the suggestion by Crick and others that females aggress primarily by attacking personal relationships, (i. e., gossiping about others, excluding them from play groups, manipulating friendships); this form of aggression has been termed "relational aggression". Numerous {{studies have examined the}} relationship of relational aggression to negative outcomes such as peer rejection, loneliness and depression. However, relational aggression may fulfil a normative function in female social development by serving to create and maintain the intimate dyads that are the hallmark of girls' social interactions. In the present research, the relationship of gossip and exclusion to friendship intimacy and social competence was examined. Eighty-seven girls, 39 <b>drawn</b> from <b>grades</b> 4 [...] 5 and 48 <b>drawn</b> from <b>grade</b> 8 participated in the study. Engaging in negative gossip and exclusion were predictive of lower peer acceptance, which partially supported the hypothesis that these are dysfunctional behaviours. However, support for the positive role of these behaviours was obtained within the realm of friendship. Exclusion of peers from play was predictive of friendship intimacy in younger subjects, and interview data further supported the idea that these behaviours may help create and maintain intimate dyadic friendships: girls reported that gossip is most likely to occur {{in the presence of a}} best friend, and that the motivation behind exclusion is often preservation of a best friendship. Positive gossip, included with negative gossip in previous research, emerged as an important predictor of peer acceptance and friendship intimacy...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{document}} and compare prevalence rates of adolescent injury-related risk behaviours at six sites in South Africa. Design. The identical self-administered instrument was used at all sites. Prevalence rates (with 95 % confidence intervals) were calculated taking the multistage cluster sampling strategy into account. Setting and subjects. In Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth and Mankweng participants were <b>drawn</b> from either <b>grades</b> 8 or 9, and grade 11, while in Queenstown and Umtata they were <b>drawn</b> from <b>grade</b> 11 only. We selected 39 schools in Cape Town and Durban, 33 in Port Elizabeth and 20 {{in each of}} the rural areas. Outcome measures. Road-related risk behaviour, violence, and suicide attempts. Results. Across the sites there were high rates of risk behaviour in all domains. For example, in the 12 months preceding the survey an estimated 52. 8 % of grade 11 males in Cape Town had travelled {{in the front seat of}} a motor vehicle without a seatbelt, 33. 0 % of grade 8 males in Mankweng had bullied others, while 44. 5 % of the same group had been bullied, and 18. 6 % of females in Port Elizabeth had attempted suicide. Rates were lower in rural areas for behaviour involving motor vehicles, but there were no consistent urban-rural findings for violence-related behaviour. Females were at higher risk of suicidal behaviour and males were at higher risk of other injury-related behaviour. Conclusions. There is a need for effective interventions to reduce the extent of injury-related risk behaviour in adolescents in urban and rural settings...|$|R

40|$|The performance, {{strength}} and ductility of prestressed concrete piles, and their connection to pile caps, subjected to severe seismic loading are investigated in this thesis. Knowledge of the {{strength and}} ductility of the pile within its embedded length in the foundation material is of importance due to the large deformations which can occur during an earthquake, particularly at the interface of hard and soft layers of foundation material. Connection details are of interest since high moments, shears and axial forces need {{to be transferred to}} pile caps during earthquake loading. Two series of tests of piles and their connections, and accompanying analyses, were conducted. Design tables and charts were derived. The first test series consisted of six full scale octagonal prestressed concrete piles, confined spirally with either Grade 275 steel or hard <b>drawn</b> (<b>Grade</b> 485) steel wire and having various confinement levels, tested under axial load and cyclic flexure. Results of the theoretical analysis were compared with the experimental data. It was found that properly detailed prestressed concrete piles without additional nonprestressed longitudinal steel can sustain large displacement ductility factors without losing their lateral load carrying capacity significantly if confined according to full ductility. The second test series consisted of six full scale octagonal piles connected to full scale reinforced pile caps. The piles were either fully or partially prestressed. Three types of pile to pile cap connection were investigated, namely the precast embedded type, the stripped pile head type, and the type where steel dowel bars are used as the connection device. Theoretical analyses were used to compare the experimental data. The connection details investigated were found to give satisfactory performance. Finally, tables and charts obtained for the pile properties are presented for design purposes. The design tables are used to assess the enhancement factors of pile cross sections within the length or at the interface of the connection at the pile cap. The design charts are used to calculate the yield curvatures as well as the available curvatures and available curvature ductility factors. Recommendations for future research are proposed to complement the work already done up to this stage...|$|R

Participants responded to the New Personal Fable Scale, the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, the Children’s Depression Inventory, three indices of suicidal ideation, an inventory of delin-quent risk behaviors, the Global Self-Worth scales from the Self-Perception Profiles for Children and for Adolescents, and two subscales from the Self-Image Questionnaire for Young Adoles-cents. The results showed that omnipotence and narcissism strongly counterindicated internal-izing symptomatology, and were robust predictors of positive mental health and adjustment. Invulnerability was strongly associated with risk behaviors. Personal uniqueness was strongly associated with depression and suicidal ideation, a relationship that increased with age. Hence, personal fable ideation is a multidimensional construct with differential implications for adoles-cent mental health. Adolescent fables of invulnerability and personal uniqueness are risk factors for externalizing and internalizing symptoms, respectively, while “narcissistic omnipotence” is associated with competence.
