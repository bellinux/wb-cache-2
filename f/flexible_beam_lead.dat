40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} an adaptive robust sliding mode control scheme based on the Lyapunov’s direct method for active vibration control of a <b>flexible</b> <b>beam</b> using PZT (<b>lead</b> zirconate titanate) sensor and actuator. PZT, a type of piezoceramic material, has the advantages of high reliability, high bandwidth, and solid state actuation and is adopted here in forms of surface-bond patches for vibration control. Two adaptive robust sliding mode controllers for vibration suppression are designed: one uses a discontinuous bang-bang robust compensator and the other uses a smooth compensator with a hyperbolic tangent function. Both controllers guarantee asymptotic stability, as proved by the Lyapunov’s direct method. Experimental results verified the effectiveness and the robustness of both adaptive sliding mode controllers. However, from the experimental results, the bang-bang robust compensator causes small-magnitude chattering because of the discontinuous switching actions. With the smooth compensator, vibration is quickly suppressed and no chattering is induced. Furthermore, the robustness of the controllers is successfully demonstrated with ensured effectiveness in vibration control when masses {{are added to the}} <b>flexible</b> <b>beam...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formulation for the modeling of a single-link <b>flexible</b> <b>beam</b> that is undergoing slewing motion at an actively controlled pinned end, {{where the other}} end of the beam is free. This pinned end, or slewing axis, is of fixed orientation such that the beam rotates in the horizontal plane. A geared dc electric motor is connected to the beam at the slewing axis. A position and a velocity sensor are placed at this hinged location, and their proportional feedback provides a position control system about the slewing axis. The motor characteristics, gear ratio, and the position feedback constant determine an equivalent rotational spring constant, often called the servo stiffness. This paper generalizes the structure's boundary conditions at the slewing axis to include the effects of the servo system. It is shown that the clamped-free beam assumption for the dynamics of the structure is a valid assumption if the ratio of the servo stiffness to beam flexibility is high. However, for moderate or low values of this ratio, the clamped-free <b>beam</b> <b>leads</b> to erroneous system models so that it becomes necessary to consider the effects of the driving servo on the dynamics of the <b>flexible</b> <b>beam...</b>|$|R

The <b>flexible</b> <b>beam</b> has been widely applied in various fields engineering and industrial. However, the flexible structure is easily influenced by unwanted vibration which may lead to fatigue, performance reduction and structure damage. Thus, the unwanted vibration must be controlled and reduced. In {{order to have a}} good controller performance for vibration suppression, an appropriate model of <b>flexible</b> <b>beam</b> is required. Hence, to obtain a model of the <b>flexible</b> <b>beam</b> structure, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) are implemented in this study as System Identification techniques.
