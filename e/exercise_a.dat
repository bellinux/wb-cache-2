5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority. A concurrent majority is {{a system in which}} a minority group is permitted to <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.|$|E
5|$|Foraker {{had known}} that with McKinley in the Executive Mansion (as the White House was still {{formally}} known) and Sherman expected to be senior senator, he could expect only limited patronage appointments for his supporters. With McKinley's close friend Hanna instead in the Senate, Foraker was allowed to recommend appointees to the President, but McKinley allowed Hanna to <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> veto over Foraker's candidates.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, the {{division}} {{took part in}} the first major joint Anglo-American exercise with the newly arrived American troops. This <b>exercise,</b> <b>a</b> 10-day event codenamed Atlantic, saw U.S. V Corps (U.S. 1st Armored Division, the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, and the British 72nd Infantry Brigade) engage British Forces Northern Ireland (the U.S. 34th and the 61st Infantry). On 15 September, Major-General John Owen Carpenter took command of {{the division}} replacing Fullbrook-Leggatt.|$|E

50|$|Scotism <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> {{influence}} {{on the development of}} philosophy and theology; its importance is not, as is often asserted, purely negative - i.e. it does not consist only in the fact that it <b>exercised</b> <b>a</b> criticism on Thomas Aquinas and the Thomistic school.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to British and Malayan units and personnel, the Commonwealth forces in Malaya included Australians, New Zealanders, Gurkhas, Fijians, Nyasalanders, and Northern and Southern Rhodesians. Southern Rhodesia had been self-governing since 1923. It ran its own affairs in most matters, including defence, {{but it was}} still constitutionally bound to Whitehall insofar as foreign affairs were concerned. The Southern Rhodesian government was therefore able to <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> large degree of independence militarily, though diplomatically it came under the British flag.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is quick}} to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct {{training}} can become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a regular exercise routine to keep them healthy and content. Without adequate <b>exercise,</b> <b>a</b> Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E
5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> great influence on politics.|$|E

5|$|Articles 41 and 68 of the {{constitution}} empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King George Tupou V saying {{that he would be}} guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.|$|E
5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts. However, {{as a result of}} Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial precedents continue to <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly as regards the development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Now aged 23, Matilda {{had only}} limited options {{as to how}} she might {{spend the rest of}} her life. Being childless, she could not <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> role as an {{imperial}} regent, which left her with the choice of either becoming a nun or remarrying. Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She {{does not appear to have}} expected to return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E

5|$|On 29 January 1951, Sydney {{was part}} of an eighteen-ship fleet present in Sydney Harbour to {{celebrate}} the 50th anniversary of Australia's Federation. Following this, the carrier joined a multinational training exercise in south-east Australian waters, then visited Hobart for the Royal Hobart Regatta. During the <b>exercise,</b> <b>a</b> Sea Fury accidentally fired four practice rockets into the superstructure of the New Zealand flagship, : although an inquiry concluded that the pilot had unintentionally pressed the fire button, it was later found that certain signal frequencies transmitted by Sydneys radio aerials could trigger a Fury's firing circuits. Sydney was presented with the Gloucester Cup in April 1951, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN for 1950. The two CAGs were switched over in April, and on 3 May, a Sea Fury crashed during a rocket-assisted take off; the pilot became the carrier's first fatality.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Komnenoi of the Empire of Trebizond were {{famed for}} marrying their daughters to their {{neighbours}} as acts of diplomacy. Theodora Megale Komnene, daughter of John IV, {{was married to}} Uzun Hassan, lord of the Aq Qoyunlu, to seal an alliance between the Empire and the so-called White Sheep. Although the alliance failed to save Trebizond from its eventual defeat, and despite being a devout Christian in a Muslim state, Theodora did manage to <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> pervasive influence both in the domestic and foreign actions of her husband.|$|E
5|$|The {{liberal and}} {{national}} uprising displeased the Austria of Metternich, the principal political {{architect of the}} Holy Alliance. However, Russia, another reactionary gendarme of Europe, looked favorably on the insurrection due to its Orthodox religious solidarity and its geostrategic interest (control of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus). France, another {{active member of the}} Holy Alliance, had just intervened in Spain against liberals at Trocadero (1823) but held an ambiguous position: Paris saw the liberal Greeks first and foremost as Christians, and their uprising against the Muslim Ottomans had undertones of a new crusade. Great Britain, a liberal country, was interested in the regional situation primarily because it lay on the route to India and London wished to <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> form of control there. For all of Europe, Greece represented the cradle of Western civilisation and of art since antiquity.|$|E

When declared operational, the 23rd Infantry Brigade was planned {{to be commanded by}} a colonel with a headquarters of 113 personnel. Supporting units were to include a band platoon (40 members), engineer company (220 strong), Brigade Training Unit (162 strong, now retitled the Armed Forces Training Command, located at Camp Ware under Major Wleh), and a military police company (105 strong).|$|E
5|$|Under section 35 of the Interpretation Act, if {{written law}} confers power on a {{minister}} {{to give a}} direction, issue an order or authorize something to be done, exercise of the power may be done (unless the law states otherwise) under the signature of the permanent secretary to the ministry which the minister is responsible for, or of any public officer authorized in writing by the minister. Section 36 of the Act permits a minister empowered to <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> power or perform a duty to, {{in the absence of}} any statutory provision to the contrary, depute another person to exercise the power or perform the duty on his or her behalf. The delegation must be approved by the President (acting on Cabinet's advice); may be made subject to conditions, exceptions and qualifications; and must be published in the Government Gazette. The minister remains capable of exercising the power or performing the duty personally. The power to make subsidiary legislation cannot be delegated.|$|E
