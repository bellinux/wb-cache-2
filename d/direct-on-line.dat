50|$|Several {{methods of}} {{starting}} a polyphase motor are used. Where a large inrush current and high starting torque can be permitted, the motor can be started across the line, by applying full line voltage to the terminals (<b>direct-on-line,</b> DOL). Where {{it is necessary to}} limit the starting inrush current (where the motor is large compared with the short-circuit capacity of the supply), the motor is started at reduced voltage using either series inductors, an autotransformer, thyristors, or other devices. A technique sometimes used is star-delta (YΔ) starting, where the motor coils are initially connected in star configuration for acceleration of the load, then switched to delta configuration when the load is up to speed.

40|$|Growing {{attention}} towards {{environmental sustainability}} of energy conversion and stricter efficiency standards are encouraging the market penetration of high-efficiency electrical motors. Current regulations define international efficiency classes and the testing procedures for <b>direct-on-line</b> machines only, commonly induction motors.

40|$|Harmonic {{cause of}} {{distortion}} of the voltages and current waveforms, which have adverse effects on electrical equipment. Harmonics {{are one of the}} major power quality concerns. The estimation of harmonics from nonlinear loads {{is the first step in}} a harmonic analysis and this may not be straight forward. Rotating machines are considered sources of harmonics because the windings are embedded in slots which are not perfectly sinusoidally distributed resulting in a distorted mmf. Nonsinusoidal voltage applied to electric machines may cause overheating, pulsating torques or noise. In additional to cross the line applications, adjustable speed drive motors are fed from inverter that can produce significant voltage distortion. In induction motor, they can overheat due to the effects of harmonic currents, depending on their frequency, because of additional rotating magnetic fields in the motor. Harmonic produce harmonic fluxes in motors. The harmonic torques tends to rotate motor at different harmonic synchronous speeds. It can produce high frequency currents in rotor circuits.

The work is focused on theperformance differences between aluminium and copper casted rotors. A method to predict the stator current when starting <b>direct-on-line</b> isdeveloped. This includes modelling of skin-effect, saturation of the leakageflux paths and additional iron losses. The results are verified by measurements. An analytical model accounting for inter-bar currents is derived, andthe dependency of the harmonic rotor currents on the inter-bar resistivity isinvestigated. It is found that the inter-bar currents can have considerableeffect on motor starting performance and stray-load losses, the amount beingstrongly dependent on the harmonic content of the primary MMF. Based on measurements of inter-bar resistivity, the starting performanceof an aluminium and a copper casted rotor is simulated. The results indicatea higher pull-out torque of the aluminium rotor than for the equivalent copperrotor. This is rather due to an increase of the fundamental starting torque ofthe aluminium rotor, than due to braking torques from the space harmonicsin the copper rotor. The results are verified by measurements. It is foundthat the difference between the pull-out torques is even larger than calculatedfrom the model. Thereby, it can be concluded that the inter-bar currents havea considerable effect on motor starting performance. At rated speed the braking torques are larger in the aluminium rotor thanin the copper rotor. This is seen as increased harmonic joule losses in the rotorcage. Simulations have shown, that these losses can be as large as 1 % ofthe output power for the studied machine. QC 2010061...|$|E

40|$|In {{distributed}} energy production, {{permanent magnet}} synchronous generators (PMSG) are often {{connected to the}} grid via frequency converters, such as voltage source line converters. The price of the converter may constitute {{a large part of}} the costs of a generating set. Some of the permanent magnet synchronous generators with converters and traditional separately excited synchronous generators couldbe replaced by <b>direct-on-line</b> (DOL) non-controlled PMSGs. Small directly networkconnected generators are likely to have large markets in the area of distributed electric energy generation. Typical prime movers could be windmills, watermills and internal combustion engines. DOL PMSGs could also be applied in island networks, such as ships and oil platforms. Also various back-up power generating systems could be carried out with DOL PMSGs. The benefits would be a lower priceof the generating set and the robustness and easy use of the system. The performance of DOL PMSGs is analyzed. The electricity distribution companies have regulations that constrain the design of the generators being connected to the grid. The general guidelines and recommendations are applied in the analysis. By analyzing the results produced by the simulation model for the permanent magnet machine, the guidelines for efficient damper winding parameters for DOL PMSGs are presented. The simulation model is used to simulate grid connections and load transients. The damper winding parameters are calculated by the finite element method (FEM) and determined from experimental measurements. Three-dimensional finite element analysis (3 D FEA) is carried out. The results from the simulation model and 3 D FEA are compared with practical measurements from two prototype axial flux permanent magnet generators provided with damper windings. The dimensioning of the damper winding parameters is case specific. The damper winding should be dimensioned based on the moment of inertia of the generating set.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} the derivation of an algorithm for the selection of a numerical simulation method for the <b>direct-on-line</b> starting of induction motors from power supplies whose voltage and frequency may vary during the simulation period. A major part of the work consisted of an evaluation of methods for treating the variation of motor parameters under different conditions and the relative effect of these variations on predicted output. Two new methods were introduced for predicting the variation of leakage reactance with current and a new method was developed for deriving the rotor parameter variation with slip for bars of arbitrary, but known, cross-section. An existing method was modified to derive model parameters from manufacturer's quoted performance data. The results are given of an investigation into the effect on the derived parameters and consequently on the predicted performance, of allowing the quoted performance data to vary within the tolerances permitted by Australian Standard 1359. A set of descriptive measures for simulation output were defined. This enabled the motor's starting performance to be quantified in terms of a small number of variables. The factorial method of experimental design was used to calculate relative coefficients of performance. These related the effect of changes in program input data to the resultant variation in program output and thus allowed numerical measures to be placed on the significance of data uncertainty and model complexity as they affected the simulated performance. PC-based data acquisition and processing techniques were used to take measurements from two laboratory motors which confirmed the results of numerical simulation work. The broad general conclusion of the thesis was that in most situations, the total system data needs {{to be included in the}} model if the uncertainty is to be improved beyond that obtainable with simple non-recursive calculations.

40|$|This master thesis {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} starting performance and losses at rated operation for a 15 kW, 4 -pole industrial induction motor, mounted with standard skewed, unskewed and unskewed asymmetrical die-cast aluminium rotors through measurements and simulations. It is a well-known fact that rotor skewing suppresses the synchronous torques at low speeds and also reduces the audible noise of the machine. However, the casting process results in a low resistive path between the rotor bars and the iron laminations, for skewed rotors, this promotes the flow of inter-bar currents. These currents, flowing between the rotorbars, increase the harmonic torques during a start and create additional losses at rated operation. For standard unskewed rotors, these losses are ideally zero, but these rotors may produce high audible noise. Studies have shown that rotors with asymmetrical rotor slot pitch can reduce the audible noise level in unskewed machines. By removing the skew, the inter-bar current losses are suppressed to a negligible level; ultimately increased machine efficiency is obtained. In this work the electrical performance is verified through measurements on the built prototypes. <b>Direct-on-line</b> starts and rated performance for motors with different rotor slot arrangements is simulated using 2 D FEM tool FCSmek. The three prototypes are tested in the laboratory according to IEC 60034 - 2 - 1 standard and the simulation results are in good agreement with the measured results. An additional test for the measurement of high frequency delta connected stator winding currents for each prototype machine is also performed, in order to study the losses induced in the stator winding. Results have shown that by introducing the proposed asymmetry in the rotor slots, the synchronous torques at low speeds are suppressed effectively, thus, improving the starting performance of the asymmetrical rotor compared to the standard unskewed rotor. Additionally, a higher pull-out torque is obtained for the unskewed rotor motor compared to the standard skewed rotor motor. However, the losses {{were more or less}} re-distributed in the unskewed rotor motor, resulting in similar efficiency as the standard skewed rotor motor. One important observation is that; to capture the inter-bar current losses which are estimated to be 5. 5 % of the total losses, requires more accurate methods of measurements than the existing. And sufficient repeatability must be achieved; alternatively one should rely on statistical data obtained from measurements on several number of motors...|$|E
40|$|Submitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering in Fulfilment of the Requirements for the Magister Technologiae in Electrical Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology SUPERVISOR: E. VOSS NOVEMBER 2013 The {{reluctance}} {{synchronous machine}} (RSM) operates {{on the principle}} of magnetic reluctance, which is produced through a careful selection of rotor flux barriers and cut-outs. Magnetic reluctivity is the resistance to magnetic flux and can be directly related to the principles of Ohm’s law in electrical circuits. Although reluctance motors have been known for more than 150 years, researchers lost interest when Nikola Tesla’s induction machine (IM) was introduced to industry. Over the last few decades, however, RSMs have shown a lot of potential. They are cheap, robust, reliable, and their rotors can also be used in the stators of IMs. The disadvantage of these machines is an inherently high torque ripple, being the result of its rotor geometry, but the biggest advantage is having a significant reduction in copper losses after the rotor cage has been removed. This advantage drove engineers to investigate, optimise and modify the performance and structure of this machine, which led to the usage of electronic drive systems. The recent advances in technology have allowed researchers to further investigate and modify the design and performance of this special type of machine, with the integration of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software also making a contribution {{to the development of the}} RSM’s current driven systems. The voltage-fed RSM, driven <b>direct-on-line</b> (DOL) from the utility supply, was left in the shadows as the current-fed RSM took reign, but still is, in the author’s opinion, not yet fully analysed. This thesis practically investigates the performance characteristics of the cageless, voltage-fed 3 kW RSM in its steady-state operation, under various loads. These performance characteristics are also compared to a RSM driven from a sensorless vector drive (current-fed) to investigate the advantages and disadvantages between the two. Experiments performed on the test bench immediately reveal a limitation to the voltage-fed RSM’s ability to drive higher loads. While the current-fed RSM conveniently reaches 150 % of its full-load, the voltage-fed RSM, due to its cageless structure, only reaches 110 % of its full-load power. Despite this discovery, the voltage-fed RSM proves to have a lower core loss, harmonic content and torque ripple. Using a FE software package with an integrated source-code, additional parameters such as the dq-axis inductances and currents are also compared and analysed in terms of its reaction to an increase in load. The eddy-current, hysteresis and excess losses are also analysed as well as the harmonic components caused by the geometry of the RSM. For academic purposes, a fair amount of emphasis is placed on the approach to the problem. The preparation for the FE simulation is explained in detail, providing insight into the FE mathematical model as well as parameter acquisition. These parameters include current angle, friction and windage losses, stator resistance, end-winding leakage reactance, core loss and inertia. The results obtained by the FE model are compared to that of the measured results and is found to have an error of only 0. 52 %. Furthermore, this study attempts to find the feasibility of the voltage-fed RSM’s practicality in modern-day industry. The conclusion is drawn that the voltage-fed RSM could be used as a more elegant alternative to an otherwise over-complicated and over-priced installation...|$|E
