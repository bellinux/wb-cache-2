5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|All major moons {{comprise}} approximately <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> {{rock and}} ice, except Miranda, {{which is made}} primarily of ice. The ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. Their surfaces are heavily cratered, though all of them (except Umbriel) show signs of endogenic resurfacing {{in the form of}} lineaments (canyons) and, in the case of Miranda, ovoid race-track like structures called coronae. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae. Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel's appears oldest. A past 3:1 orbital resonance between Miranda and Umbriel and a past 4:1 resonance between Ariel and Titania are thought to be responsible for the heating that caused substantial endogenic activity on Miranda and Ariel.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} of approximately <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> of silicate rock and water ice. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Its surface {{is composed}} of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover {{about a third of}} the satellite. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Oberon formed from the {{accretion}} disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet's formation. The moon consists of approximately <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water may be present at {{the boundary between the}} mantle and the core. The surface of Oberon, which is dark and slightly red in color, appears to have been primarily shaped by asteroid and comet impacts. It is covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210km in diameter. Oberon possesses a system of chasmata (graben or scarps) formed during crustal extension {{as a result of the}} expansion of its interior during its early evolution.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> of time at each location.|$|E
5|$|By January 2011, {{much of the}} nation's {{attention}} {{had shifted}} from the Gascoyne flood to the devastating floods in Queensland. Many residents struggling to get their lives back together were frustrated {{with the government and}} demanded aid. Though people affected by the floods were to be given A$15,000 in funds, they expressed further anger after hearing that residents in Queensland would receive A$25,000. On 11 January, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that the imbalance in funds was to be corrected and residents of Western Australia would receive <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> to those in Queensland. By 20 January, donations for flood victims from the Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund exceeded A$1million. Power restoration, especially in Gascoyne Junction, was unusually sluggish. Dozens of residents were without power for eight weeks, as electricity was finally restored between 12 and 13 February. This coincided with the arrival of replacement furniture from Paraburdoo; however, heavy rains renewed flooding and prevented most residents from picking up the supplies.|$|E

5|$|Callisto (Jupiter IV) is {{the fourth}} and last Galilean moon, and is the second largest of the four, and at 4820.6 {{kilometers}} in diameter, it is the third largest moon in the Solar System, and barely smaller than Mercury, though {{only a third of}} the latter's mass. It is named after the Greek mythological nymph Callisto, a lover of Zeus who was a daughter of the Arkadian King Lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. The moon does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating. Callisto is composed of approximately <b>equal</b> <b>amounts</b> of rock and ices, which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons. It {{is one of the most}} heavily cratered satellites in the Solar System, and one major feature is a basin around 3000km wide called Valhalla.|$|E
