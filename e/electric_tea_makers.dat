40|$|Faced with fierce {{competition}} in marketplaces, manufacturers {{need to determine}} the appropriate settings of engineering characteristics of the new products so that the best customer preferences of the products can be obtained. To achieve this, functional models relating customer preferences to engineering characteristics need to be developed.

Existing approaches use only fuzzy-based technologies to address the uncertainty caused by fuzziness.

5000|$|In 1946, Nestle USA {{introduced}} the first instant tea, Nestea.

The American market for instant tea powders, which developed quickly following Nestle's introduction, has slackened off considerably over the past quarter century, as Americans have more and more turned to naturally icing their favorite loose teas, as well as preparing iced tea from tea bags, and to ready-to-drink iced teas where the smaller sizes are found in the supermarkets' refrigerated drinks sections and the larger gallon sizes are found in the supermarkets' non-refrigerated drinks sections.|$|R

Strengths and weaknesses of the instant water boiling technology and its integration into the internal water supply system are also demonstrated. Aqua Hot 98 instant hot water dispenser is capable of heating up to 60 cups in an hour, while consuming 20 % of the electric power needed to boil the water on a stove or in an <b>electric</b> <b>tea</b> pot. Besides, the water is ready for consumption at any moment of time.

Given the fact that Aqua Hot 98 instant hot water dispenser is also capable of supplying cold filtered water, the proposed technology is more economical and ecological that bottled water supply, as plastic bottles accumulated at junkyards damage the environment.

50|$|Oxidation {{results in}} the {{browning}} of the leaves and intensification of their flavor compounds. From the moment they are plucked, the cells within the tea leaves are exposed to oxygen and the volatile compounds within them begin to undergo chemical reactions. It is at this stage that polyphenolic oxidase, including theaflavin and thearubigin, begin to develop within the leaves. Theaflavins lend briskness and brightness to the tea while thearubigins offer depth and fullness to the liquor that’s produced.In order to bring out specific intensities in flavors, <b>tea</b> <b>makers</b> control the amount of oxidation the leaves undergo. Controlled-oxidation is typically carried out in a large room where the temperature is maintained at 25-30º C and humidity stands steady at 60-70%. Here, withered and rolled leaves are spread out on long shelves and left to ferment for a fixed period of time, {{depending on the type}} of tea being made. To halt or slow down oxidation, fermented leaves are moved to a panning trough where they are heated and then dried. Due to oxidation, the leaves undergo a complete transformation and exhibit an aroma and taste profile that’s completely different from the profile of the leaves that do not undergo this process. Less oxidized teas tend to retain most of their green color and vegetal characteristics due to a lower production of polyphenols. A semi-oxidized leaf has a brown appearance and produces yellow-amber liquor. In a fully oxidized tea, amino acids and lipids break down completely, turning the leaves blackish-brown. The flavors in such a tea are more brisk and imposing.|$|R

40|$|Fuzzy {{regression}} {{methods have}} commonly {{been used to}} develop consumer preferences models which correlate the engineering characteristics with consumer preferences regarding a new product; the consumer preference models provide a platform whereby product developers can decide the engineering characteristics {{in order to satisfy}} consumer preferences prior to developing the products. Recent research shows that these fuzzy regression methods are commonly used to model customer preferences. However, these approaches have a common limitation in that they do not investigate the appropriate polynomial structure which includes significant regressors with only significant engineering characteristics; also, they cannot generate interaction or high-order regressors in the models. The inclusion of insignificant regressors is not an effective approach when developing the models. Exclusion of significant regressors may affect the generalization capability of the consumer preference models. In this paper, a novel fuzzy modelling method is proposed, namely fuzzy stepwise regression (F-SR), in order to develop a customer preference model which is structured with an appropriate polynomial which includes only significant regressors. Based on the appropriate polynomial structure, the fuzzy coefficients are determined using the fuzzy least square regression. The developed fuzzy regression model attempts to obtain a better generalization capability using a smaller number of regressors. The effectiveness of the F-SR is evaluated based on two design problems, namely a <b>tea</b> <b>maker</b> design and a solder paste dispenser design. Results show that better generalization capabilities can be obtained compared with the fuzzy regression methods commonly-used for new product development. Also, smaller-scale consumer preference models with fewer engineering characteristics can be obtained. Hence, a simpler and more effective product development platform can be provided...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a research {{carried out to}} develop a humidity control system for tea rolling and fermenting room of a tea factory. During the rolling process, cell breakage causes the mixing of enzymes with other chemical compounds, and fermentation starts and continues throughout the rolling and roll breaking processes. Further fermentation is allowed to continue on fermenting racks for such time as desirable. Rolling room operation should be geared for ventilating and humidifying to control those fermentation reactions at desired levels. Moisture is an essential requirement for enzyme activity and lack of humidity leads to surface drying of dhools and loosing the liquor properties of tea. During all rolling room processes, a humid atmosphere should surround dhools and hygrometric difference between 2 - 30 F is satisfactory. Humidification also helps in reducing the room temperature up {{to the level of}} ambient wet bulb. Since British introduced tea to Sri Lanka, almost all the factories still use wet and dry bulb hygrometers to observe the level of humidity during rolling and fermenting processes and use manually switchable humidifiers. Tea industry is still very reluctant to give-up wet and dry bulb difference method and move to work with relative humidity. Even Tea Research Institute in Sri Lanka is still using wet and dry bulb difference method. This research automates same art with digital wet and dry bulb sensors and reads level of relative humidity using a digital humidity sensor as an addition. While providing traditional dry-wet (D-W) control mode, the controller also provides humidity control mode for the customers to choose. Displaying relative humidity level at traditional dry-wet mode addresses the knowledge gap of <b>tea</b> <b>makers</b> to move to the direct humidity control mode from traditional wet and dry bulb difference method. The developed humidity control system addresses the lapses of previous products and performs satisfactorily compared to widely used low resolution alcohol wet and dry bulb hygrometers and automatically switches ON or OFF relevant humidifiers to maintain the desired humidity level...|$|R
