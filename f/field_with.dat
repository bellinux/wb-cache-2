40|$|In 1966, {{when the}} annual damage survey was initiated, Dr. C. R. Weaver, Statistician at the Ohio Agriculture Research and Development Center, Wooster, Ohio, {{drew up a}} {{sampling}} plan, balancing costs against desired precision. The plan included three combinations of fields to be sampled and stations per field for high damage areas, three combinations for moderate damage areas, and two combinations for light damage areas. Alternatives for the high damage area included (1) 497 <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> two stations per field (±. 48), (2) 775 <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> two stations per field (±. 26), and (3) 235 <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> ten stations per field (—. 68). For the moderate damage areas, the alternatives were (1) 441 <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> three stations per field (±. 26), (2) 155 <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> three stations per field (±. 50), and (3) 235 <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> ten stations per field (±. 32). The light dam¬age area alternatives were (1) 297 <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> three stations per field (-. 26), and (2) 81 <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> three stations per field (±. 50). The original survey in 1966 sampled eight counties in three regions. In 1967, 14 counties in the same three regions were sampled. Two new counties were added to one region and two new regions with two counties each (treated as one region for sampling purposes) {{were added to the}} 1968 survey. The 1968 survey was of sufficient size to be representative of the corn damage picture in Ohio and Southeast Michigan. The 1969 survey was identical to the 1968 survey...|$|R

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>with</b> the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>with</b> the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E

30|$|For example, P. pipistrellus {{activity}} decreased {{with increasing}} insect abundance above <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> {{a high proportion}} of woody vegetation cover and built-up area (Fig.  3 a, b). On <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> a low proportion of woody vegetation cover and built-up area, P. pipistrellus bats were more active when insect abundance was high. In contrast to this pattern, we found that the activity of N. noctula, for instance, was positively correlated with insect abundance above fields surrounded by a relatively high density of roads (Fig.  3 c). Similarly, P. pipistrellus bats were more active with increasing insect abundance above <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> a relatively high road and kettle hole density (Fig.  3 d, e). In contrast, on <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> a relatively low road and kettle hole density, P. pipistrellus bats were less active with increasing insect abundance.|$|R
40|$|I suggest wave {{equations}} for the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and pseudovector <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> different masses for spin {{zero and}} one states. Tensor, matrix, and quaternion formulations of <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> two mass and spin states are considered. This is the generalization of the Dirac-Kähler equation {{on the case}} of different masses of <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> spin one and zero. The equation matrices obtained are simple linear combinations of matrix elements in the 16 -dimensional space. Spin projection operators and solutions of equations (for spin one) in the form of matrix-dyads are obtained. The canonical quantization of fields under consideration is studied. The anomalous interaction of the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and pseudovector <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> the external electromagnetic field is considered. Three constants which characterize the anomalous magnetic moment and quadrupole electric moment of a particle are introduced. ...|$|R
