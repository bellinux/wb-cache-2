40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{corrosion}} is the predominant mechanism for the deterioration of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes,</b> leading to the reduction of pipe capacity and ultimate collapse of the pipes. In order to assess the remaining service life of corroded cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes,</b> it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of corrosion over a long term and to develop models for pipe deterioration. Although many studies have been carried out to determine the corrosion behavior of cast iron, little research has been undertaken to understand how cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> behave over a longer time scale than hours, days, or weeks. The present paper intends to fill the gap regarding the long-term corrosion behaviour of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> in the absence of historical data. In this paper, a comprehensive experimental program is presented in which the corrosion behaviour of three exservice pipes was thoroughly examined in three simulated service environments. It has been found in the paper that localised corrosion is the primary form of corrosion of cast <b>iron</b> water <b>pipes.</b> It has also been found that the microstructure of cast irons is a key factor that affects the corrosion behaviour of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes.</b> The paper concludes that long-term tests on corrosion behaviour of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> can help develop models for corrosion-induced deterioration of the pipes for use in predicting the remaining service life of the pipes...|$|R

25|$|In 1857 the South Staffordshire Waterworks Co. {{proposed}} {{to fill in}} the pool {{and replace it with a}} public gardens. This was proposed, as it was undesirable to have an open area of water in the middle of a city, which would be used for domestic supply. This proposal was very unpopular among the citizens and the proposal was amended to retain the pool. Instead a cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> supported by brick piers was laid along the bed of the pool extending under Dam Street and into Stowe Pool. The pipe would carry water from Leamonsley and Trunkfield Brooks through the Museum Gardens in Beacon Park, under Bird Street through Minster Pool and into Stowe Pool.

25|$|The 1853 lease {{gave the}} company {{the right to}} extract water from Red Tarn and Keppelcove Tarn. In the late 1860s both tarns were {{modified}} by building dams. A dam was built in 1868 to increase the capacity of Red Tarn and to regulate the beck supplying water to the Low Mill. In Keppel Cove a natural tarn had formed behind a glacial moraine across {{the floor of the}} valley. To draw on this water in times of low rainfall, a tunnel was made through the moraine and an 18-inch cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> laid through it to extract water {{from the bottom of the}} tarn. The top of the moraine was flattened and widened, and the work completed in 1871. Catchment of the tarn was increased by diverting two streams into it, include the one out of Brown Cove and at some point a dam was built to create a reservoir in Brown Cove. Its remains can still be seen, though the wall was cut down in 1936 when it was no longer needed.|$|E

Also in the room was an electrical transformer, plugged into a wall, and with wires leading to the bed. A metal tray containing syringes, small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops was also close to the bed.

Investigators also noted that although Bryson's restraints had been tied to posts at each corner of the bed, other posts on the bed had been extensively worn, suggesting that restraints had earlier been tied to these posts, and that the individual or individuals had struggled to free themselves.|$|E

40|$|Cast iron was the {{dominant}} material for buried pipes for water networks {{prior to the}} 1970 s in Australia and overseas. At present, many water utilities still have {{a significant amount of}} ageing cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes.</b> Cast <b>iron</b> is a brittle material and when large diameter cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> (diameters above 300 mm) further deteriorate, the consequences of failure can be substantial. Focusing on the likelihood of failure to assist risk assessment, this paper examines the performance of large-diameter cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> using probabilistic analysis, incorporating uncertainties of governing variables. Finite element analysis is first conducted to study the physical mechanism of buried pipes subjected to complex environmental conditions. The deterioration of cast <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> due to corrosion is considered on the basis of recent research. The uncertainties of governing variables, such as the physical properties of soil, cast iron, water pressure and corrosion patterns, in pipe failure risk assessment are considered. Using probabilistic physical modelling, the lifetime probability of failure is derived and a time-dependent sensitivity analysis is presented. The results of this probabilistic physical modelling are compared with cohorts of failure data from two Australian water utilities to examine the underlying trends from both physical modelling and statistical analysis...|$|R
