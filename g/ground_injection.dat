Trebbiano d’Abruzzo {{grown in}} three {{vineyards}} located in Teramo Province, Abruzzi, Italy, severely affected by esca proper, {{were subjected to}} trunk renewal and thereafter treated with triazoles and fosetyl Al fungicides, applied either by trunk injection via syringe, or by <b>ground</b> <b>injection</b> via injector pole. Trunk renewal, by cutting the trunk, {{made it possible to}} determine the extent and type of wood deterioration on the residual trunk portion, where it was found that rotted and discoloured wood often still remained. Fungicide treatment was begun in 1995, when trunk renewal was performed, and was continued until 1998; after this the vines continued to be monitored for a further 4 years until 2002. In 2002, vines that had received trunk injections after trunk renewal were in better vegetative condition than vines without such injections, with full yield and lower mortality. Cyproconazole was particularly effective when trunk injected, but was not effective when injected into the ground. A possible explanation for this is given. Moreover the effect that the severity of the wood necrosis observed at the time of trunk renewal had on treatment effectiveness was evaluated. The current lack of similar trials and studies in other vineyards makes standardisation of control methods difficult; any positive effects may have been due to concurrent factors such as cultivar vigour, or peculiar environmental or cultural conditions...|$|E

40|$|Surface {{electrodes}} {{are essentially}} {{required to be}} switched for boundary data collection in electrical impedance tomography (Ell). Parallel digital data bits are required to operate the multiplexers used, generally, for electrode switching in ELT. More the electrodes in an EIT system more the digital data bits are needed. For a sixteen electrode system. 16 parallel digital data bits are required to operate the multiplexers in opposite or neighbouring current injection method. In this paper a common <b>ground</b> current <b>injection</b> is proposed for EIT and the resistivity imaging is studied. Common ground method needs only two analog multiplexers each of which need only 4 digital data bits and hence only 8 digital bits are required to switch the 16 surface electrodes. Results show that the USB based data acquisition system sequentially generate digital data required for multiplexers operating in common <b>ground</b> current <b>injection</b> method. The profile of the boundary data collected from practical phantom show that the multiplexers are operating in the required sequence in common <b>ground</b> current <b>injection</b> protocol. The voltage peaks obtained for all the inhomogeneity configurations are found at the accurate positions in the boundary data matrix which proved the sequential operation of multiplexers. Resistivity images reconstructed from the boundary data collected from the practical phantom with different configurations also show that the entire digital data generation module is functioning properly. Reconstructed images and their image parameters proved that the boundary data are successfully acquired by the DAQ system which in turn indicates a sequential and proper operation of multiplexers...|$|R

A prevision method, based on finite cavity expansion in dilatants soil theory, has been developed and is presented in this paper. A comparison between theoretical data and on site tests results is also provided. Starting from specific laboratory tests carried out on resin samples, a modification was introduced to the previous works on cavity expansion, based on the experimental relationship between resin expansion pressure and confinement pressure offered by the treated soil. The different behaviour shown by cohesive and granular soils depends on their permeability to resin. The resin, in its liquid phase, expands in cohesive soils in a monolithical body and poorly permeates the soil by breaking it along micro-fissures. On the other side, after injection in granular soils, the liquid resin fills the soil voids and originates a composite hard material with a compressive strength comparable to concrete...|$|R

40|$|A Radio Frequency (RF) based {{digital data}} {{transmission}} scheme with 8 channel encoder/decoder ICs is proposed for surface electrode switching of a 16 -electrode wireless Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system. A RF based wireless digital data transmission module (WDDTM) is developed and the electrode switching of a EIT system is studied {{by analyzing the}} boundary data collected and the resistivity images of practical phantoms. An analog multiplexers based electrode switching module (ESM) is developed with analog multiplexers and switched with parallel digital data transmitted by a wireless transmitter/receiver (T-x/R-x) module working with radio frequency technology. Parallel digital bits are generated using NI USB 6251 card working in LabVIEW platform and sent to transmission module to transmit the digital data to the receiver end. The transmitter/receiver module developed is properly interfaced with the personal computer (PC) and practical phantoms through the ESM and USB based DAQ system respectively. It is observed that the digital bits required for multiplexer operation are sequentially generated by the digital output (D/O) ports of the DAQ card. Parallel to serial and serial to parallel conversion of digital data are suitably done by encoder and decoder ICs. Wireless digital data transmission module successfully transmitted and received the parallel data required for switching the current and voltage electrodes wirelessly. 1 mA, 50 kHz sinusoidal constant current is injected at the phantom boundary using common <b>ground</b> current <b>injection</b> protocol and the boundary potentials developed at the voltage electrodes are measured. Resistivity images of the practical phantoms are reconstructed from boundary data using EIDORS. Boundary data and the resistivity images reconstructed from the surface potentials are studied to assess the wireless digital data transmission system. Boundary data profiles of the practical phantom with different configurations show that the multiplexers are operating in the required sequence for common <b>ground</b> current <b>injection</b> protocol. The voltage peaks obtained at the proper positions in the boundary data profiles proved the sequential operation of multiplexers and successful wireless transmission of digital bits. Reconstructed images and their image parameters proved that the boundary data are successfully acquired by the DAQ system which in turn again indicates a sequential and proper operation of multiplexers {{as well as the}} successful wireless transmission of digital bits. Hence the developed RF based wireless digital data transmission module (WDDTM) is found suitable for transmitting digital bits required for electrode switching in wireless EIT data acquisition system.

40|$|One of the {{concerns}} about the technology {{as a means of}} soil and groundwater remediation was the possibility of transferring chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) to the atmosphere through the <b>ground</b> surface, <b>injection</b> wells, and monitoring wells. Emissions testing was performed to obtain a qualitative picture of VOC losses to the atmosphere. The sampling and analytical methodologies for the emissions tests are presented in the following subsections. F. 1. 1 Dynamic Surface Emissions Sampling Methodology A dynamic surface emissions sampling method was used at the LC 34 site. This method involves enclosing an area of soil under an inert box designed to allow the purging of the enclosure with high-purity air (Dupont, 1987). The box was purged with high-purity air for two hours to remove any ambient air from the region above the soil and to allow equilibrium to be established between the VOCs emitted from the soil and the organic-free air. The airstream was then sampled by drawing a known volume of the VOC/pure air mixture through a 1 -L Summa canister. The Summa canister captured any organics associated with surface emissions from the test plot. Emissions samples also were collected in the same manner near the drainage ditch in order to monitor organic concentrations in the infiltration gallery (see Figure F- 1). Additionally, ambient air samples were collected using Summa canisters held at shoulde...|$|R

30|$|Fluid-driven {{fracture}} propagating in porous {{media is}} widely used in geomechanics to improve the permeability of reservoirs in oil and gas recovery or of geothermal wells. Another application of importance {{is related to the}} overtopping stability analysis of dams. In the case of reservoir engineering, water is forced under high pressure deep into the <b>ground</b> by <b>injection</b> into a well. The fluid, usually mixed with sand and some chemicals, penetrates in the reservoir rock, opening long cracks (fracking). Horizontal drilling together with hydraulic fracturing makes the extraction of tightly bound natural gas from shale formations economically feasible [1]. In the field, it is unfortunately rather difficult to obtain direct information about the evolution of the crack in the ground, and very little data are known or accessible. Two types of measurements are mainly performed: monitoring of pressure fluctuations at the injection pump and registration of acoustic emissions at the surface [2]. Fracking can also induce small earthquakes [3]. Pressure-induced fracture propagation presents some peculiar features such as pressure peaks and stepwise advancement, which have been discovered only recently and need further investigation. It is recalled that differently from tensile experiments where the crack surfaces are stress free, in hydraulic fracturing, these surfaces are loaded by a pressure distribution resulting from the invading fluid or gas [2]. Simulation is an extremely useful tool to obtain more insight into the problem. The paper addresses this issue.|$|R

This technique {{allowed us to}} determine the temporal and spatial distribution of volumetric strain sources up to 5 km depth. Results have shown complex spatial and temporal patterns, identifying important features that were not noticed before. The first result is the observation of positive strain sources (expansion) migrating upward (in 2000 and 2006). We have interpreted them as hot fluid batches injected {{at the bottom of}} the geothermal reservoir, migrating upward and reaching the surface. Furthermore we have identified an injection episode (in 1997), which was not recognized before. This batch did not reach the surface and probably dissipated by diffusion and lateral advection without producing significant <b>ground</b> uplift. The <b>injection</b> of fluid batches does not occur at the center of the caldera, but along its borders. The three identified injection episodes (in 1997, 2000 and 2006) occur in different points.

30|$|Due {{to the low}} {{attenuation}} of {{low frequency}} wave propagating in the porous media, the low-frequency vibration oil extraction technology has a large effective action radius when it is applied in the oilfield (White 1975). Therefore, {{there is a high}} possibility of overlapping in sphere of action of two technologies. Sometimes, the flowing gel injection area may be covered in the range of vibration oil recovery technique, which may cause certain effect on gelling process, ultimate gel strength and gel plugging efficiency. The whole gel injection process combines the <b>ground</b> mix, pipe <b>injection,</b> pushed into the oil layer, flowing in the pore throats, and achieving the stable gel strength finally. In the gel accelerating stage, the gel strength as well as the injecting pressure and friction factor may sharply increase because of the violent disturbance, which could bring severe problems to gel displacement. The construction success rate may be harmed thereby (Junowicz et al. 1972; Broseta et al. 2000), whereas low-frequency vibration also has the functions of increasing internal fluid contact, shear thinning, and improving the seepage velocity inside the porous media (Ma et al. 1996). Considering the above factors, the composite action mechanisms of two technologies become much complex. Research on change of flowing gel rheological property under low-frequency vibration is important for optimizing the profile control and water plugging effects.|$|R
40|$|Jet {{grouting}} {{is adopted}} in different geotechnical conditions to ensure provisional earth retaining and waterproofing functions {{at the bottom}} and walls of excavations. Despite careful theoretical models avail-able to predict the mechanical response of these structures, design is often carried out without adequate con-trol, i. e. by assuming ideal effectiveness of ground improvement. On the contrary, adverse effects have been documented by past experiences which {{can be traced back to}} erroneous prediction of treatments effects, inac-curate control of the execution or to unexpected responses of the surrounding environment. All these uncertainties, which become particularly critical when excavation is performed in urbanized areas, can be mini-mized by detailed preliminary field trials, accurate controls of the execution of treatments and a prompt monitoring of the surrounding area. The present paper describes this methodology applied to the design and the execution of a massive jet grouting bottom plug forming the base of a large excavation in city environment.

40|$|Grout {{injection}} is {{used for}} sealing or strengthening the ground {{in order to prevent}} water entrance or any failure after excavation. There are many methods of grouting. Permeation grouting {{is one of the most}} common types in which the grout material is injected to the pore spaces of the ground. In grouting operations, the grout quality is important to achieve the best results. There are four main characteristics for a grout mixture including bleeding, setting time, strength, and viscosity. In this paper, we try to build some efficient grouting mixtures with different water to cement ratios considering these characteristics. The ingredients of grout mixtures built in this study are cement, water, bentonite, and some chemical additives such as sodium silicate, sodium carbonate, and triethanolamine (TEA). The grout mixtures are prepared for both of the sealing and strengthening purposes for a structural project. Effect of each above-mentioned ingredient is profoundly investigated. Since each ingredient may have positive or negative aspect, an optimization of appropriate amount of each ingredient is determined. The optimization is based on 200 grout mixture samples with different percentages of ingredients. Finally, some of these grout mixtures are chosen for the introduced project. It should be mentioned that grouting operations depend on various factors such as pressure of <b>injection,</b> <b>ground</b> structure and grain size of soils. However, quality of a grout can be helpful to make an injection easier and reasonable. For example, during the injection, a wrong estimated setting time can destroy the injected grout by washing the grout or setting early which prevents grouting.

40|$|Background Morton's neuroma is a common, {{paroxysmal}} neuralgia {{affecting the}} web {{spaces of the}} toes, typically the third. The pain is often so debilitating that patients become anxious about walking or even putting their foot to the <b>ground.</b> Insoles, corticosteroid <b>injections,</b> excision of the nerve, transposition of the nerve and neurolysis of the nerve are commonly used treatments. Their effectiveness is poorly understood. Objectives To examine the evidence from randomised controlled trials concerning the effectiveness of interventions in adults with Morton's neuroma. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group trials register (searched January 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 2 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to February Week 2 2003), and CINAHL (January 1982 to February Week 1 2003). Selection criteria Randomised or quasi-randomised (methods of allocating participants to an intervention which were not strictly random e. g. date of birth, hospital record, number alternation) controlled trials of interventions for Morton's neuroma were selected. Studies where participants were not randomised into intervention groups were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers selected trials {{for inclusion in the}} review, assessed their methodological quality and extracted data independently. Main results Three trials involving 121 people were included. There is, at most, a very limited indication that transposition of the transected plantar digital nerve may yield better results than standard resection of the nerve in the long term. There is no evidence to support the use of supinatory insoles. There are, at best, very limited indications to suggest that dorsal incisions for resection of the plantar digital nerve may result in less symptomatic post-operative scars when compared to plantar excision of the nerve. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence with which to assess the effectiveness of surgical and non-surgical interventions for Morton's neuroma. Well designed trials are needed to begin to establish an evidence base for the treatment of Morton's neuroma pain...|$|R

It is not solely structural aspects which are of importance, health issues of the pilot and the airfield per- sonnel are also very important, as high acoustic levels may result in severe hearing damage. It remains a major challenge to reduce the overall noise levels of the aircraft, where the supersonic exhaust is the main noise source for near <b>ground</b> operation. Fluidic <b>injection</b> into the supersonic jet at the nozzle exhaust has been shown as a promising method for noise reduction. It {{has been shown to}} speed up the mix- ing process of the main jet, hence reducing the kinetic energy level of the jet {{and the power of the}} total acoustic radiation. Furthermore, the interaction mechanism between the fluidic injection and the shock structure in the jet exhaust plays a crucial role in the total noise radia- tion. In this study, LES is used to investigate the change in flow struc- tures of a supersonic (M= 1. 56) jet from a converging-diverging nozzle. Six fluidic actuators, evenly distributed around the nozzle exit, inject air in a radial direction towards the main flow axis with a total mass flow ratio of 3 %. Steady injection is compared with flapping injection. With flapping injection turned on, the injection angle of each injector is varied sinusoidally in the nozzle exit plane and the variation is the same for all injectors.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of spin doped fullerenes are investigated in hybrid organic/inorganic structures {{with the aim}} of establishing the extent to which magnetic states can be induced and controlled in these materials. Volume magnetometry is used to measure a reduction of net magnetization and an increase in coercivity in cobalt which can be understood in terms of a transfer of majority spin electrons from the transition metal d-band into spin polarized hybrid interface states. This is supported by PNR and XAS studies of Co/C 60 which reveal AF coupling between Co metal films and a hybrid interfacial region where magnetic ground states are induced in fullerenes through charge transfer. Investigations of hybridization between C 60 and the RE-TM alloy CoGd show that the compensation temperature of the ferrimagnet is altered by the presence of C 60. PNR measurements of CoGd/C 60 MLs reveal interfacial coupling which creates an AF region 1. 5 ± 0. 1 nm thick. Magnetometry of Gd/C 60 bilayers indicates that hybridization between the metal conduction bands and the C 60 LUMO modifies magnetic ordering in Gd. This is supported by the observation of novel features in the temperature dependence of magnetization and resistivity in the composite. XAS of Gd/C 60 bilayers shows a large peak in the carbon K-edge at 282 eV which is attributed to interfacial hybridization. It is shown that PL quenching in C 60 is greater over Co than Au which is attributed to the greater electron transfer between Co and C 60. PL quenching is proposed as an effective way to measure magnetic coupling and electron transfer in interfaces. Raman spectra are recorded in C 60 junctions during spin polarised transport. The Ag(2) peak splitting is shown to depend on the polarisation of injected current acting as an effective probe of triplet formation in C 60. Finally, XAS at the carbon K-edge is recorded during spin transport. A suppression of the LUMO to zero and increase in the intensity of the 282 eV peak occurs after removal of external bias and is shown to be reversible and repeatable under cycles of <b>grounding</b> and charge <b>injection.</b> A proposed mechanism involving the redistribution of charge following the removal of bias which causes electrons to become trapped in interfacial states is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Energy's (DOE) Hanford site in southeastern Washington state was established in 1943 to produce nuclear materials, especially plutonium, for the nation's defense. The site occupies 586 square miles northwest of the cities of Richland, Pasco, and Kennewick, with a combined regional population of over 200, 000. The Columbia River, the nation's second largest river {{and a source of}} hydropower production and drinking water for downstream communities, as well as a major route for salmon migration, flows through the site for almost 50 miles. DOE built nine nuclear reactors to produce plutonium and other materials near the river shore to take advantage of river water for reactor cooling. Several miles away from the river, DOE built other facilities used in making nuclear materials. During operations from 1943 to 1989, activity at these reactors and other facilities generated large volumes of hazardous and radioactive waste. Some of this waste was deposited directly into the <b>ground</b> in trenches, <b>injection</b> wells, or other facilities designed to allow the waste to disperse into the soil. Some of the most hazardous and radioactive material was stored in large underground tanks. Over time, concern has developed about the impact of Hanford's waste moving through the ground and toward the Columbia River. Besides the waste discharged directly into the ground, DOE has assumed, based on tank monitoring data and other techniques to detect contamination in the soil, that 67 of the 177 underground storage tanks have also leaked contaminants into the soil. Many types of hazardous and radioactive waste produced at Hanford can be borne by water through the ground. While Hanford is a near-desert location with limited rainfall and thick layers of soil and rock beneath its surface, water from precipitation and other sources moves through these layers, and the groundwater moves {{in the general direction of}} the river. In the center of the site, the groundwater is more than 200 feet below the surface, but at the river, the groundwater is at or near river level. Over time, the movement of these contaminants through the "vadose zone" [...] the span of soil and rock between the surface and the groundwater beneath [...] has resulted in a number of contaminant "plumes. " These plumes are volumes of contamination extending downward and outward from their sources. When these plumes reach the level of the groundwater, the contamination they contain enters the groundwater. In some cases, contamination from these plumes has already reached the river. Since the early 1990 s, DOE has shifted its efforts at the Hanford site from production of nuclear materials to cleaning up the contamination and other materials left over from the production era. Milestones and requirements for this cleanup are specified in an agreement between DOE and its regulators [...] the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Washington State Department of Ecology. DOE spends about $ 2 billion per year on the cleanup of the Hanford site and estimates that the cost of Hanford's cleanup effort will eventually total about $ 45 billion and will be completed around 2035. The cleanup effort includes exhuming and treating buried waste, cleaning up facilities, and other necessary steps, including protecting the Columbia River by keeping contamination from migrating through the groundwater to the river. This report responds to a Congressional request for preliminary information about DOE's efforts to address river contamination. It addresses (1) the past, current, and future sources of contaminants to the Columbia River and the status of the contaminant plumes that threaten the river; and (2) DOE's planned approach to prevent contamination from reaching the Columbia River and DOE's efforts to implement its plan. ...|$|R
