Chris Stamper continued to code for the company through the mid-90s, while also serving as Rare's chairman and technical director. Tim, the managing director, continued to work on graphics for the company, including backgrounds in Donkey Kong Country. Their younger brother, Stephen, also worked as Rare's operations director. The Stampers encouraged competition between the company's development teams and {{were involved in the}} decision-making on every game, even when the company expanded to several hundred employees. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> left in 1997 to work for another Sony-focused studio, while another group left during production for the sequel to GoldenEye. Despite decent reviews, Rare's subsequent games did not appear to meet the high standards of their predecessors, and poor sales led to another staff exodus.|$|E

The analysed data comes from a quantitative questionnairebased survey (n= 315). The results show that in the Czech companies, flexitime is most frequent among regular employees (51. 7 %) and graduates up to 30 years old (24. 1 %). A reduced work schedule is most frequently used by mothers with children and senior citizens (41. 3 %, 27 %) and as part-time work among students (41 %).

The Public Service Employee Relations Act (PSERA) received Royal Assent on May 18, 1977, giving AUPE bargaining rights for each <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> for which it had a collective agreement.

25|$|VAM {{executives}} and engineers sought {{to move the}} two-door 1976 American ECD from the limited edition status into a regular production model, and also change its concept from general luxury into a personal luxury vehicle, which VAM no longer offered since the mid-1976 discontinuation of the Classic Brougham (Matador Brougham coupe) model. Taking advantage of this upcoming new model was a plan of this <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> to make a homage to VAM's general manager Gabriel Fernández Sáyago, {{one of the most}} respected men in the Mexican auto industry at the time and leader of the company since 1946. The new personal luxury compact was named after him using his initials as a designation. The model was presented to him as a surprise in late 1976, which he appreciated highly but opting for a more humble stance, he requested the model not to carry his name. The group of VAM employees respected his decision, but managed an indirect way to keep their original plan. Te general manager's initials were retained, but the meaning was changed into Grand Formula Sport. The model was introduced along with VAM's 1977 lineup as a two-door alternative to the American ECD and a luxury one to the sporty American Rally.|$|E
