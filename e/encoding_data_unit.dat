40|$|Abstract — With {{the help}} of HTML form-based search interfaces, {{a large number of}} {{databases}} have become web accessible. For the sake of human browsing, the <b>data</b> <b>units</b> from the underlying database are decoded into the result pages very dynamically. The <b>encoded</b> <b>data</b> <b>units</b> need to be machine processable. It is very important for many applications such as deep web data collection and Internet applications, and are extracted and meaningful labels are assigned. It is accessible data extraction method, ODE (Ontology-assisted Data Extraction), which automatically extracts the query result records from the HTML pages. ODE first constructs ontology for a domain according to information matching between the query interfaces and query result pages from different web sites within the same domain. Then, the constructed domain ontology is used during data extraction to identify the query result section in a query result page and to align and label the data values in the extracted records. The ontology assisted data extraction method is fully automatic and overcomes many of the deficiencies of current automatic data extraction methods. The annotation wrapper which is automatically constructed for that particular site can be used to annotate new result pages from the same web database. By the test results it is found that this approach is good and effective...|$|R

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>units</b> are the {{foundation}} for a new process interaction paradigm for distributed and multiprocessor systems. The <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> abstraction combines many of the strengths of RPC, distributed shared memory, and object-based approaches. It generalizes the concept of memory space to include structure information. When structure information is available, the underlying system can provide services such as transparent translation and support for dynamically linked data structures that span machine boundaries. This paper presents <b>data</b> <b>units</b> and their relationship to existing approaches. In addition, a prototype system based on <b>data</b> <b>units</b> is described, along with applications built using the <b>data</b> <b>unit</b> concept.

In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{explosion}} of interest in succinct data structures, which store the given data in compact or compressed formats and answer queries on the data rapidly while it is still in its compressed format. Our focus in this talk is to introduce <b>encoding</b> <b>data</b> structures. <b>Encoding</b> <b>data</b> structures consider the data together with the queries and aim to store only as much information about the data as is needed to store the queries. Once this is done, the original data can be deleted. In many cases, one can obtain space-efficient <b>encoding</b> <b>data</b> structures even when the original data is incompressible.
