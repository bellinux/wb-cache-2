2500|$|In 1981, a new {{inclined}} elevator was installed. It travels on a 10° angle for {{the first}} , shifting its position horizontally , and straight up for the [...] remainder of the climb. The <b>elevator</b> <b>car</b> stays level at all times during its movement {{because it has a}} gimbal-mounted double frame. Before the installation of the new elevator, the observatory had been reached by taking first one elevator, then climbing a flight of stairs to a second elevator.|$|E

50|$|In the atmosphere, {{the risk}} factors of wind and {{lightning}} come into play. The basic mitigation is location. As long as the tether's anchor remains within two degrees of the equator, it {{will remain in the}} quiet zone between the Earth's Hadley cells, where there is relatively little violent weather. Remaining storms could be avoided by moving a floating anchor platform. The lightning risk can be minimized by using a nonconductive fiber with a water-resistant coating to help prevent a conductive buildup from forming. The wind risk can be minimized by use of a fiber with a small cross-sectional area that can rotate with the wind to reduce resistance. Ice forming on the cable also presents a potential problem. It could add significantly to the cable's weight and affect the passage of <b>elevator</b> <b>cars.</b> Also, ice falling from the cable could damage <b>elevator</b> <b>cars</b> or the cable itself. To get rid of ice, special <b>elevator</b> <b>cars</b> could scrape the ice off.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} achieve the weightless effect the Imagineers desired, cables {{attached}} {{to the bottom of}} the <b>elevator</b> <b>car</b> pull it down at a speed slightly faster than what a free fall would provide.

2500|$|With time an issue, the {{construction}} team worked around the clock. The domed top, housing {{the top five}} levels (including the restaurants and observation deck), was perfectly balanced so that the restaurant could rotate {{with the help of}} one tiny electric motor, originally , later replaced with a [...] motor. With paint colors named Orbital Olive for the body, Astronaut White for the legs, Re-entry Red for the saucer, and Galaxy Gold for the roof, the Space Needle was finished in less than one year. It was completed in April 1962 at a cost of $4.5 million. The last <b>elevator</b> <b>car</b> was installed the day before the Fair opened on April 21. During the course of the Fair nearly 20,000 people a day rode the elevators to the Observation Deck. The 20,000 mark was never reached, missed by fewer than 50 people one day. At the time of construction, it was the tallest building in the West, taking the title from the Smith Tower across town that had held that title since 1914.|$|E
2500|$|Within three minutes, the Greene Street {{stairway}} became unusable in both directions. Terrified employees crowded {{onto the}} single exterior fire escape, which city officials had allowed Asch to erect {{instead of the}} required third staircase. It was a flimsy and poorly anchored iron structure {{which may have been}} broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed from the heat and overload, spilling about 20 victims nearly [...] to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. Elevator operators Joseph Zito and Gaspar Mortillalo saved many lives by traveling three times up to the ninth floor for passengers, but Mortillalo was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator doors open and jumped into the empty shaft, trying to slide down the cables or to land on top of the car. The weight and impacts of these bodies warped the <b>elevator</b> <b>car</b> and made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt. William Gunn Shepard, a reporter at the tragedy, would say that [...] "I learned a new sound that day, a sound more horrible than description can picture -- the thud of a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk". Even once firefighters arrived, their ladders were only long enough to reach as high as the sixth to seventh floors.|$|E

2500|$|At the GWMNMA's {{annual meeting}} in February 1947, the Alexandria-Washington Lodge Replica Room was dedicated. [...] The {{association}} also voted to allot {{one of the rooms}} in the unfinished tower to the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm (also known as [...] "the Grotto"), which had raised $25,000 to finish the room. The Supreme Council, Scottish Rite (Southern Jurisdiction, USA) donated $100,000 to finish the north lodge room on the second floor and dedicate it to Cryptic Masonry. [...] Prior to this donation, the association was unsure whether appendant bodies of Freemasonry should be allowed to occupy rooms in the memorial. [...] The Southern Jurisdiction's donation effectively ended this debate. It also encouraged many Grand Lodges (state organizations) of Masonry to make large donations to the memorial, bringing new life to the memorial's fund-raising efforts. [...] The association also agreed to expend funds to build a kitchen and dining room, hang bronze doors on the first floor, and install bronze grillwork for the heating and ventilation system on the first floor. Two other major decisions were made in 1947 as well. [...] Long-time memorial architect Harvey W. Corbett presented his plans for completing the memorial's interior, and sculptor Bryant Baker discussed his plans for a life-size statue of George Washington to adorn the memorial hall. The Order of DeMolay, the young men's affiliate of Freemasonry, had won the association's approval for a campaign to raise money for a bronze statue of George Washington back in 1934. Baker proposed a marble statue that would cost $50,000 to $60,000 and stand on a pedestal worth $7,000 to $10,000. The association also began work on its first elevator. The Otis Elevator Company was awarded this contract on October 23, 1947. [...] Designed to fit into the southeast stairwell, the company overcame the 7.5 degree incline of the stairwell by putting wheels {{on one side of the}} <b>elevator</b> <b>car</b> to keep it vertical. The memorial's dining room was completed at the end of 1947, and its first use was for a meeting of the GWMNMA in February 1948.|$|E

His little cage had quite warmed with the glow of her repressed eagerness. And now, on the down trip, it was glacier-like. The sparkle and the color were gone. She was frowning, and what little he could see of her eyes was cold and steel-gray. Oh, he knew the symptoms, he did. He was an observer, and he knew it, too, and some day, when he was big enough, {{he was going to}} be a reporter, sure.

50|$|Elevator air {{conditioning}} {{is fast becoming}} a popular concept around the world. The primary reason for installing an elevator air conditioner is the comfort that it provides while traveling in the elevator.

40|$|An {{elevator}} group supervisory controller is {{a control}} system that manages systematically {{two or more}} elevators in order to serve passengers as required.

Virgil and the <b>Elevator</b> <b>Cars</b> rush to intercept the inbound Fireflash on Runway 29, but when one of the remote-controlled cars malfunctions and crashes into a Boeing 727, which explodes twice on impact, the rescue attempt is aborted and the operation suspended while Virgil activates a reserve car. Fireflash starts a second run and successfully makes contact with all three vehicles. Applying brakes, Virgil loses control of the master car, which crashes into a trench; he is uninjured, however, and Fireflash comes to a halt before reaching the end of the runway.

40|$|Group {{elevator}} scheduling is an NP-hard sequential decision-making {{problem with}} unbounded state spaces and substantial uncertainty. Decision-theoretic reasoning plays a surprisingly limited role in fielded systems. A new opportunity for probabilistic methods has opened {{with the recent}} discovery of a tractable solution for the expected waiting times of all passengers in the building, marginalized over all possible passenger itineraries. Though commercially competitive, this solution does not contemplate future passengers. Yet in up-peak traffic, the effects of future passengers arriving at the lobby and entering <b>elevator</b> <b>cars</b> can dominate all waiting times. We develop a probabilistic model of how these arrivals affect the behavior of <b>elevator</b> <b>cars</b> at the lobby, and demonstrate how this model {{can be used to}} very significantly reduce the average waiting time of all passengers.

5000|$|The company's {{name for}} their {{proprietary}} control system, {{was introduced in}} 1995. It was the industry's first example of control system now known as [...] "hall call" [...] destination system. The system features keypads and LED screens instead of hall button stations whereby riders enter their desired floor before entering an <b>elevator</b> <b>car.</b> The system then directs the rider to a specific <b>elevator</b> <b>car,</b> while grouping riders traveling to nearby floors together. Schindler claims this minimizes the number of stops, and decreases congestion and travel time—especially during peak traffic periods. The system was continuously further developed and new functions were amended, eventually evolving in systems which guarantee highly efficient and energy-saving traffic management. Especially in high rise buildings, traffic-management systems like Miconic 10 allow building designers to maximize rentable space and transportation efficiency. Moreover, access control becomes feasible.|$|E
