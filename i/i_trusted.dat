2500|$|After {{more than}} 20film roles, {{the role of}} the vicious and slatternly Mildred Rogers in the RKO Radio {{production}} of Of Human Bondage (1934), a film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel, earned Davis her first major critical acclaim. Many actresses feared playing unsympathetic characters, and several had refused the role, but Davis viewed it as an opportunity to show the range of her acting skills. Her co-star, Leslie Howard, was initially dismissive of her, but as filming progressed, his attitude changed and he subsequently spoke highly of her abilities. The director, John Cromwell, allowed her relative freedom, and commented, [...] "I let Bette have her head. <b>I</b> <b>trusted</b> her instincts." [...] She insisted that she be portrayed realistically in her death scene, and said, [...] "the last stages of consumption, poverty, and neglect are not pretty and I intended to be convincing-looking." ...|$|E

In his book Honorable Men Colby's title evidently refers to Helms as {{representative}} of those officers who followed such an Agency ethic.

2500|$|In late 2005, Helmet {{were dropped}} by Interscope {{following}} lacklustre sales for Size Matters. Helmet then signed with Warcon Enterprises {{and announced that}} a new album was in the works. Helmet performed at the 2006 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, with a temporary lineup consisting of Charlie Walker on drums, Chris Traynor on bass, and Anthony Truglio (formerly of Gandhi) on guitar. The new album, Monochrome, was recorded and co-produced by Wharton Tiers, who recorded Helmet's first two albums, Strap It On and Meantime. For the album, Hamilton and Traynor returned to the studio with newly recruited drummer, Mike Jost (formerly of Adair). Helmet headlined the 2006 Warped Tour in support of Monochrome, with Jeremy Chatelain reprising his role from the 2005 Size Matters tour. The band later split with Warcon due {{to a variety of}} financial disputes between Hamilton and the label's owners. Hamilton stated [...] "Amphetamine Reptile and Interscope were both fantastic experiences for us, and Warcon {{was the first time that}} I’d actually run into any problems with a label. <b>I</b> <b>trusted</b> somebody and got screwed. I’m not bitter about it, but I lost a lot of money. They never paid me tour support that they were contractually obligated to pay. There were a lot of things. I’ve never seen one penny of royalties from them, but I own the record [...] now, so it’s my record." ...|$|E
2500|$|White Zombie {{announced}} in 1998 that the band had officially broken up, {{and it was}} confirmed that Rob had begun working on a solo debut album. Though acting as a solo artist, Zombie worked to find a band to record and tour with; Mike Riggs was selected to play guitar, Blasko played bass guitar, and John Tempesta played the drums. Tempesta {{had been a member of}} White Zombie, while Rob was introduced to Riggs through a mutual friend. On finding the guitar player, Zombie claimed [...] "Danny [...] was just like, ‘I know the perfect guy.’ He gave me Riggs’ phone number and I called him out of nowhere. <b>I</b> <b>trusted</b> Danny, so that was it. Riggs came out and he was great. We didn’t have a bass player yet. Riggs and I hung out and talked and I told him everything I wanted to do." [...] Work on the album began in August of 1997, prior to the announcement of White Zombie's separation. The album took an estimated ten months to complete. The majority of the album was recorded at The Chop Shop in Hollywood, California. Zombie described the finished product as a [...] "full-blown evil raging beast - a total Zombie extravaganza" [...] and claimed that album was [...] "no small, self-indulgent album filled with whining about deep feelings." ...|$|E
