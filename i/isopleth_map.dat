The ash deposit was distributed {{around the first}} crater of Nakadake with the NE- and SE-trending axes.

Some clear glass shards presented dark-brown rims and/or were characterized by typical blocky textures with cracked surfaces. The surface morphology of clear glass shards strongly indicates that they resulted from brittle behavior by interaction of magma and water under wet condition. We believe that the clear glass shards included in the February 2008 ash were related to newly ascending magma {{and that they were}} partially hydrated or altered due to hydrothermal water after fragmentation of magma, and erupted due to an increased gas flux probably in the evening of 17 February 2008...|$|E

Consideration of common requirements results in four criteria by which map effective-ness is evaluated: effectiveness for direct acquisition of both specific and general information and for memory of both specific and general information. The influence of visual map complexity and two methods of symbolization (choropleth and shaded <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps)</b> on each aspect of complexity is evaluated. Though <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps</b> prove to be consistently less complex than choropleth maps, the only significant difference in effectiveness between the methods is for memory of general patterns, in which case <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps</b> are more effective. Map complexity is found to have two components that influence effectiveness in quite different ways. Complexity of a mapped distribution is inversely related to effectiveness of maps in communicating general patterns but has little relation to communication of specific details. The second aspect of com-plexity, the number of classes, is inversely related to communication of specific details but exhibits little relationship to communication of general patterns.

Such lightweight structures are vulnerable to ground movements {{as a result of}} cyclic soil shrinkage and swelling arising from soil moisture (suction) variations. The Australian Residential Slabs and Footings Standard AS 2870 recommends the use of Thornthwaite Moisture Index (TMI) to quantify the effect of climate changes on the residential footing design. The TMI based <b>isopleth</b> <b>map</b> for the State of Victoria is endorsed by the standard, which assists geotechnical engineers to estimate the depth of design soil suction change (Hs) needed for the calculation of the characteristic ground movement (ys), which forms the basis for site classification for potential ground movements. This paper presents a review of the current footing design and construction in Australia, including site classification process and two commonly used footing types. The related design parameters in the Australian Standards AS 2870 are also introduced and discussed, which include the characteristic design surface movement (ys), Thornthwaite Moisture Index (TMI), the depth of design suction change (Hs) and the instability index (Ipt).

40|$|On May 1 st 2008 Mount Chaitén (southern Chile) {{interrupted}} a {{long period}} of quiescence, generating a sequence of explosive eruptions and causing the evacuation of Chaitén town located a few kilometers south of the volcano. The activity was characterized by several explosive events each associated with plumes which reached up to about 19 km above sea level. The products were dispersed across a wide area, with the finest ash reaching the Atlantic coast of Argentina. Our field observations in the proximal-medial area (3 – 25 km from the vent) indicate that the May 2008 tephra deposit consists of numerous layers, most of which can be correlated with individual eruptive events. These layers vary from extremely fine-grained ash to layers of lapilli and blocks, composed of both juvenile and lithic material. Here we describe the stratigraphy and physical characteristics of the May 2008 deposits, and propose a reconstruction of the timing of the May 2008 events. The deposits are mainly associated with the three main explosive phases which occurred on 1 st– 2 nd May, 3 rd– 5 th May and 6 th May, with an estimated bulk tephra volume of 0. 5 – 1. 0 km 3 (integration of both exponential and power-law fitting). For the 6 th May event, represented by a layer composed mainly of lithic lapilli and blocks (> 2 mm), an <b>isopleth</b> <b>map</b> was compiled from which a 19 km plume height was determined, which is in good agreement with satellite observations...|$|E
40|$|We present {{deep and}} wide V, I CCD {{photometry}} of Ursa Major I (UMa I) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) in Local Group. The {{images of the}} galaxy were taken by Subaru/Suprime-Cam wide field camera, covering a field of 34 × 27 located at {{the centre of the}} galaxy. Colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the UMa I dSph shows a steep and narrow red giant branch (RGB), blue and red horizontal branch (HB), and main sequence (MS) stars. A well-defined main sequence turn-off (MSTO) is found to be located at V_ 0,MSTO∼ 23. 5 mag. The distance modulus is derived as (m-M) _ 0 = 19. 93 ± 0. 1 (corresponding to a distance D= 96. 8 ± 4 kpc) from the V-band magnitude of the horizontal branch (V_ 0,HB= 20. 45 ± 0. 02). The mean metallicity of the RGB stars is estimated by the V-I colour to [Fe/H]∼- 2. 0. The turn-off age estimated by overlaying the theoretical isochrones reveals that most of stars in the UMa I dSph are formed at very early epoch (∼ 12 Gyrs ago). The <b>isopleth</b> <b>map</b> of stellar number density of the UMa I dSph, based upon the resolved star counts of MS, RGB, HB stars as well as blue stragglers (BS), shows that the morphology of the UMa I dSph is quite irregular and distorted, suggesting that the galaxy is in a process of disruption. The very old and metal-poor nature of the stellar population implies that the star formation history of this newly discoverd faint dSph may have been different from other well-known `classical' dSphs, which show significant stellar population of intermediate age. The stellar population of the UMa I dSph closely resembles that of Galactic old metal-poor globular cluster, but its size is typical of Galactic dSphs (r_e= 188 [pc], r_ 1 / 2 = 300 [pc]), and the shape of its spatial density contours suggests that it is undergoing tidal disruption.

The National Atmospheric Deposition Program/ National Trends Network (NADP/NTN) measures and reports precipitation amounts and chemical constituent concentration and deposition data for the United States on annual <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps</b> using inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation methods. This interpolation for unsampled areas {{does not account for}} topographic influences. Therefore, NADP/NTN <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps</b> lack detail and potentially underestimate wet deposition in high-elevation regions. The NADP/NTN wet-deposition maps may be improved using precipitation grids generated by other networks. The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) produces digital grids of precipitation estimates from many precipitation-monitoring networks and incorporates influences of topographical and geographical features. Because NADP/NTN ion concentrations do not vary with elevation as much as precipitation depths, PRISM is used with unadjusted NADP/NTN data in this paper to calculate ion wet deposition in complex terrain to yield more accurate and detailed <b>isopleth</b> deposition <b>maps</b> in complex terrain. PRISM precipitation estimates generally exceed NADP/NTN precipitation estimates for coastal and mountainous {{regions in the}} western United States.

40|$|Interpolation {{procedures}} used in isopleth mapping are {{closely tied to}} methods of areal interpolation, which is a technique used to transfer attribute information from source zones with known values to the target zones with unknown values. This research first presents and describes new local polycategorical methods for solving areal interpolation problems. Two different types of local neighborhoods for selecting observations used to estimate density coefficients are presented: one spatially based and one statistically based. The new local polycategorical methods are evaluated against a number of existing methods. Results suggest that polycategorical methods provide comparable results to the local statistical areal interpolation models, especially with enhanced land cover data sets, but with much less computational requirements. Remotely sensed land cover data are widely used as control data in intelligent areal interpolation methods. This research then examines the usefulness of different publicly available remotely sensed land cover data sets as control data {{used in conjunction with}} different areal interpolation methods. Results show that greater detail in the land use classification of developed areas was important for areal interpolation. Even more important is the further enhancement of remotely sensed land cover categories by incorporating local road or parcel data layers. Overall weaker methods using enhanced remote sensing-derived land cover data produce more accurate results than overall stronger methods using only the original land cover data. The results also show that parcels produce better enhancements than road buffers Finally, this research reunites areal interpolation with the isopleth mapping process to construct intelligent isopleth maps. Two types of interpolated population density surfaces are used as inputs for pycnophylactic smoothing procedures, one is target zone population density surface and the other is control zone population density surface. Results suggest that control zone population density surface-derived isopleth maps has more peaks and variations in population distributions than target zone population density surface-derived isopleth maps. And intelligent isopleth maps with control data are better than simple <b>isopleth</b> <b>map</b> derived from areal weighting results. Furthermore, intelligent isopleth maps based on parcel enhanced land cover data sets have less overall error values than those derived from land cover data sets without any enhancement...|$|E
40|$|The Southeast Crater (SEC) of Mt. Etna, Italy, {{is renowned}} for its high activity, mainly {{long-lived}} eruptions consisting of sequences of individual paroxysmal episodes which have produced more than 150 eruptive events since 1998. Each episode typically forms eruption columns followed by tephra fallout over distances of up to about 100 km from the vent. One of the last sequences consisted of 25 lava fountaining events, which took place between January 2011 and April 2012 from a pit-vent on the eastern flank of the SEC and built a new scoria cone renamed New Southeast Crater. The first episode on 12 – 13 January 2011 produced tephra fallout which was unusually dispersed toward to the South extending out over the Mediterranean Sea. The southerly deposition of tephra permitted an extensive survey at distances between ~ 1 and ~ 100 km, providing an excellent characterization of the tephra deposit. Here, we document the stratigraphy of the 12 – 13 January fallout deposit, draw its dispersal, and reconstruct its <b>isopleth</b> <b>map.</b> These data are then used to estimate the main eruption source parameters. The total erupted mass (TEM) was calculated by using four different methodologies which give a mean value of 1. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 4 [*]×[*] 108 kg. The mass eruption rate (MER) is 2. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 7 [*]×[*] 104 kg/s using eruption duration of 100 min. The total grain-size (TGS) distribution, peaked at − 3 phi, ranges between − 5 and 5 phi and has a median value of − 1. 4 phi. Further, for the eruption column height, we obtained respective values of 6. 8 – 13. 8 km by using the method of Carey and Sparks (1986) and 3. 4 [*]±[*] 0. 3 km by using the methods of Wilson and Walker (1987), Mastin et al. (2009), and Pistolesi et al. (2011) and considering the mean value of MER from the deposit. We also evaluated the uncertainty and reliability of TEM and TGS for scenarios where the proximal and distal samples are not obtainable. This is achieved by only using a sector spanning the downwind distances between 6 and 23 km. This scenario is typical for Etna when the tephra plume is dispersed eastward, i. e., in the prevailing wind direction. Our results show that, if the analyzed deposit has poorer sample coverage than presented in this study, the TEM (3. 4 [*]×[*] 107 kg) is 22 % than the TEM obtained from the whole deposit.

40|$|Climate {{change has}} become one of the most {{pressing}} environmental concerns and the greatest challenges to global infrastructure in society today. It has been proved by many researchers that Victoria along with other Australian states and territories has been experiencing a drying climate over the past several decades. Numerous lightly-loaded residential buildings constructed on expansive soils are subjected to distortions arising from differential ground movements. Many countries in the world include Australia, United States, Israel, India and South Arica have reported infrastructure damage problems due to the movement of expansive soils. The problems are particularly significant in Australia as 20 % of the surface area in Australia is covered by expansive soils (Richards et al. 1983). The primary focus in this research study is the Thornthwaite Moisture Index (TMI). The main objective is to develop a program (based on Excel spreadsheet) for TMI calculation and to predict and produce future TMI <b>isopleth</b> <b>map</b> for Victoria, and thus to facilitate a better understanding of the impact of climate change on residential footing design and construction. In the thesis, long term climate records over 60 years (i. e. 1954 - 2013) from 70 weather stations of Victoria were adopted for TMI determination and this computation work was performed by the use of the program developed by the candidate. TMI isolines were then plotted on the Victoria map to present climate conditions since 1954. The main factors influencing climate change and ground movements were discussed. The past and the projected climate change, particularly for elements such as temperature, precipitation and sea level were also reviewed. Numerous emission scenarios and diverse climate models used to project the future climate were presented. Step-by-step method in predicting and quantifying future climate condition for Victoria by the use of TMI was demonstrated. The derived TMI results were then used for the delineation of isolines in Victoria map for 2030, and 2050 and 2070. Three case studies were carried out to facilitate a better understanding of different equations and methods used for estimating TMI as well as to demonstrate the effect of climate change on the characteristic ground surface movement ys, which was predicted based on the projected climate trend and the depth of seasonal design suction change Hs. The main contributions of this research are the updated as well as the predicted future TMI isopleth maps of Victoria, which superseded the old TMI map recorded in AS 2870 (2011) and can be used to evaluate the impact of climate change on residential footing design. These maps have demonstrated that Victoria has experienced a significant growth of drying over the past 60 years and an overall increase of aridity for its future climate is expected if the drying climate trends are persisted. It is believed that the developed TMI climate tool would be very useful for design engineers and building industry...|$|E

However, until now, the inverse problem of the reconstruction of a Plinian event from observed data has been only roughly tackled. This paper discusses the efficient variational data assimilation (VDA) that manages the optimization iterate sequence by means of gradient computations. Theoretical developments of VDA are presented for both the Woods equations and a generic system allowing for the modelling of the Navier-Stokes equations. Two- and three-dimensional unsteady Plinian models being based on the latters, VDA could be clearly performed on their differentiable subset of equations. Although no column data are available for the 1982 El Chichon eruptions, identical twin experiments were used to check the abilities of the VDA approach.

The IAVCEI Commission on Tephra Hazard Modelling has carried out a dedicated exercise to assess the influence of various strategies on the determination of the largest clasts. Suggestions on the selection of sampling area, collection strategy, choice of clast typologies and clast characterization (i. e. axis measurement and averaging technique) are given, mostly based on a thorough investigation of two outcrops of a Plinian tephra deposit from Cotopaxi volcano (Ecuador) located at different distances from the vent. These include: (1) sampling on a flat paleotopography far from significant slopes to minimize remobilization effects; (2) sampling on specified-horizontal-area sections (with the statistically representative sampling area depending on the outcrop grain size and lithic content); (3) clast characterization based on the geometric mean of its three orthogonal axes with the approximation of the minimum ellipsoid (lithic fragments are better than pumice clasts when present); and (4) use of the method of the 50 th percentile of a sample of 20 clasts as the best way to assess the largest clasts. It is also suggested that all data collected for the construction of <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps</b> be made available to the community {{through the use of a}} standardized data collection template, to assess the applicability of the new proposed strategy on a large number of deposits and to build a large dataset for the future development and refinement of dispersal models...|$|R

ESPs are crucial for the characterization of volcanic systems and for the compilation of comprehensive hazard scenarios but are naturally associated with various degrees of uncertainties that are traditionally not well quantified. Recent studies have highlighted the uncertainties associated with the estimation of ESPs mostly related to: i) the intrinsic variability of the natural system, ii) the observational error and iii) the strategies used to determine physical parameters. Here we review recent studies focused on the characterization of these uncertainties and we present a sensitivity analysis for the determination of ESPs and a systematic investigation to quantify the propagation of uncertainty applied to two case studies. In particular, we highlight the dependence of ESPs on specific observations used as input parameters (i. e. diameter of the largest clasts, thickness measurements, area of isopach contours, deposit density, downwind and crosswind range of <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps,</b> and empirical constants and wind speed for the determination of MER). The highest uncertainty is associated to the estimation of MER and eruption duration and is related to the determination of crosswind range of <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps</b> and the empirical constants used in the empirical parameterization relating MER and plume height. Given the exponential nature of the relation between MER and plume height, the propagation of uncertainty is not symmetrical, and both an underestimation of the empirical constant and an overestimation of plume height have the highest impact on the final outcome. A ± 20 % uncertainty on thickness measurements, area of isopach contours, integration limit for the power-law fit and deposit density result in ESP uncertainties ≤± 20 % for plume height and erupted volume/mass. Finally, a third case study has also been used to explore the sensitivity of the Voronoi Tessellation strategy for the determination of TGSD and the inversion on both mass/area and grain-size data for the determination of erupted mass and plume height. Results confirm the validity of the methods but also the strong dependence on the distribution and number of observations...|$|R
40|$|Two {{scenarios}} {{in terms}} of odour impact assessment were studied during the phase of upgrading of an existing waste treatment plant: CALPUFF {{was used for the}} simulation of odour dispersion. Olfactometric measures, carried out over different periods and different positions in the plant, were used for model calibration. Results from simulations were reported {{in terms of}} statistics of odour concentrations and <b>isopleths</b> <b>maps</b> of the 98 th percentile of the hourly peak concentrations, as requested from the European legislation and standards. The excess perception thresholds and emissions were utilized to address the plant upgrade options. The hourly evaluation of odours was performed to determine the most impacting period of the day. An inverse application of the numerical simulation starting from defining the odour threshold at the receptor was made to allow the definition of the required abatement efficiency at the odours source location. Results from the proposed approach confirmed the likelihood to adopt odour dispersion modelling, not only in the authorization phase, but also as a tool for driving technical and managing actions in plant upgrade so to reduce impacts and improve the public acceptance. The upgrade actions in order to achieve the expected efficiency are reported as well...|$|R
40|$|The Kings Bowl pit {{was formed}} by a phreatic blast through a solidifying lava lake at Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, Idaho, around 2000 years ago. The blast {{produced}} a tephra deposit that was carried eastward by the wind, leaving only ballistic ejecta {{on the west side}} of the blast site. In the summer of 2015 we conducted a tephrostratigraphic study of the deposits to evaluate the style of the blast in conjunction with the NASA FINESSE project. Data was obtained by digging holes and recording the depth, collecting samples from the inside wall of the hole, and recording any in situ tephrostratigraphy. Bioturbation caused by sagebrush resulted in only one hole showing preserved tephrostratigraphy for two fall units. Therefore the rest of the holes were reported as bulk, the result of mixing of an unknown number of units. Not only was there extensive bioturbation, there was also extensive eolian dust. Isopach and <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps</b> of the tephra deposit support the hypothesis that there were at least three blasting events. This indicates that the phreatic blasts at Kings Bowl were more complex than previously recognized...|$|R
50|$|This {{phenomenon}} is also inherent in calculating the sound levels from aircraft noise, so that an accurate determination of topographic features may be understood.

30|$|The above parameters, {{extracted}} {{for each}} grid, from the 1 : 50, 000 scale topographical maps were taken as fixed or as reference values, {{against which the}} same parameters derived from the other DEM datasets were then compared. Thereafter, the respective differences for each parameter, on basis of their values derived {{from each of the}} other eight datasets for these grids, were computed, by subtracting its value from the corresponding topographical map value. A number of <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps,</b> through interpolation of the gridded morphometric parameters, were then prepared to visually represent this difference, keeping similar ranges to aid comparison, in order to find that particular dataset which most closely matched (in terms of actual values and the isoline trends), the surveyed large-scale topographical map derived values by showing the least deviation from the same. This dataset could then be claimed to best represent this terrain for these parameters and be used subsequently in further geomorphometric computations. The percentage of difference for each parameter was also computed grid-wise by dividing the above difference by the corresponding topographical map derived value for that grid, and then multiplying by 100. From these, the mean difference, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of this percentage difference between the different values, were finally computed.|$|R
40|$|Hekla is {{the most}} active silicic volcano in Iceland, with 18 subplinian–Plinian eruptions since AD 1104. In the period 1970 to 2000, the {{frequency}} of such eruptions increased to once every decade. Hekla is currently inflated to above the levels observed prior {{to the most recent}} eruptions in 1991 and 2000. The next eruption could pose a hazard to air traffic between North America and Europe because explosive eruptions of Hekla, independent of size, typically start with a subplinian or Plinian phase that produces a sustained ash plume. We present an overview of five of the largest historical Hekla eruptions (taking place in 1104, 1158, 1300, 1693, and 1766). These eruptions cover a compositional range of rhyolite to andesite, previously estimated Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) values of 4 – 5 and are characterised by contrasting wind dispersal (dispersal axes NW–NE). New isopach maps show both greater deposit thicknesses in the proximal region and wider dispersal than previously inferred, resulting in different volume estimates (minimal values ranging between 0. 18 and 0. 91 km 3). New <b>isopleth</b> <b>maps</b> were also compiled and resulted in inferred plume heights of about 13 – 25 km. These changes in the estimated values of volume and mass eruption rates have large implications on the forecasting and impacts of future Hekla eruptions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 The Ksudach Volcano KS- 1 rhyodacite {{deposits}} {{offer an}} opportunity to study eruption dynamics and plume stability during a caldera-forming eruption. Stratigraphic relations indicate four phases of eruption, Initial, Main, Lithic, and Gray. Well-sorted, reverse-graded pumice fall deposits overlying a silty ash compose the Initial phase layers. The Main, Lithic and Gray phases are represented by pumice fall layers interbedded with pyroclastic flow and surge deposits (proximally) and co-ignimbrite ashes (distally). Although most of the deposit is 50 wt. % lithics. White and gray pumices are compositionally indistinguishable, however vesicle textures and microlite populations indicate faster ascent by the white pumices prior to the Gray phase. The eruption volume is estimated as 7. 5 km³ magma (dense rock equivalent) and 2. 4 km³ lithics. <b>Isopleth</b> <b>maps</b> indicate mass discharge rates (MDR) ranged from 5 - 10 x 10 ⁷ kg/s in the Initial phase to> 10 ⁸ kg/s in the Main, Lithic, and Gray phases. Stratigraphic, granulometric, and component analyses indicate simultaneous eruption of buoyant plumes and non-buoyant flows during the Main, Lithic and Gray phases. Caldera collapse during the Lithic phase is reflected by a large increase in lithic particles and the textural change from white to gray pumices; collapse occurred after eruption of 2 / 3 of the magma...|$|R
