5000|$|An axostyle is a {{sheet of}} microtubules found in certain {{microbial}} eukaryotes. It arises from the bases of the flagella, sometimes projecting beyond {{the end of the}} cell, and is often flexible or contractile, and so may be involved in movement and provides support for the cell. Axostyles originate in association with a flagellar microtubular root and occur in two groups, the oxymonads and parabasalids; they have different structures and are not homologous. Within Trichomonads the axostyle has been theorised to participate in locomotion and cell adhesion, but also <b>karyokinesis</b> during cell division.|$|E

The third part is the G2 phase in which a significant protein synthesis occurs, mainly involving the production of microtubules that are required during the process of division, called mitosis.The fourth phase, M phase, consists of nuclear division (<b>karyokinesis)</b> and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis), accompanied by the formation of a new cell membrane.

[...] The group generated a population of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that would undergo <b>karyokinesis</b> but miss the cytokinesis stage. Using live cell imaging, klerokinesis was found while studying human RPE cells to establish the hypothesis of German biologist Theodor Boveri, {{that the presence of}} an abnormal number of sets of chromosomes in a cell (polyploidy) would lead to out-of-control cell division, causing cancer. However, contrary to Boveri's hypothesis, researchers found that abnormal cell division rarely has long-term negative effects in human cells, rather, some cell divisions occurred later than the end of mitosis {{in such a way that}} the normal chromosome complement was restored.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of Symbiodinium was first {{described}} from cells growing in culture media. For isolates that are in log phase growth, division rates occur every 1-3 days, with Symbiodinium cells alternating between a spherical, or coccoid, morphology and a smaller flagellated motile mastigote stage (see ‘Morphological Characteristics’). While several similar schemes are published that describe how each morphological state transitions to other, the most compelling life history reconstruction was deduced from light and electron microscopy and nuclear staining evidence. During asexual propagation (sometimes referred to as mitotic or vegetative growth), cells undergo a diel cycle of <b>karyokinesis</b> (chromosome/nuclear division) in darkness. The mother cell then divides (cytokinesis) soon after exposure to light and releases two motile cells. The initiation and duration of motility varies among species. Approaching or {{at the end of}} the photoperiod the mastigotes cease swimming, release their flagella, and undergo a rapid metamorphosis into the coccoid form. As cultures reach stationary growth phase, fewer and fewer motile cells are observed, indicating slower division rates.|$|E

40|$|CHO 1 is a {{mammalian}} kinesin-like motor protein of the MKLP 1 subfamily. It {{associates with}} the spindle midzone during anaphase and concentrates to a midbody matrix during cytokinesis. CHO 1 was originally implicated in <b>karyokinesis,</b> but the invertebrate homologues of CHO 1 {{were shown to}} function in the midzone formation and cytokinesis. To analyze {{the role of the}} protein in mammalian cells, we mutated the ATP-binding site of CHO 1 and expressed it in CHO cells. Mutant protein (CHO 1 F�) was able to interact with microtubules via ATP-independent microtubule-binding site(s) but failed to accumulate at the midline of the central spindle and affected the localization of endogenous CHO 1. Although the segregation of chromosomes, the bundling of midzone microtubules, and the initiation of cytokinesis proceeded normally in CHO 1 F�-expressing cells, the completion of cytokinesis was inhibited. Daughter cells were frequently entering interphase while connected by a microtubule-containing cytoplasmic bridge from which the dense midbody matrix was missing. Depletion of endogenous CHO 1 via RNA-mediated interference also affected the formation of midbody matrix in dividing cells, caused the disorganization of midzone microtubules, and resulted in abortive cytokinesis. Thus, CHO 1 may not be required for <b>karyokinesis,</b> but it is essential for the proper midzone/midbody formation and cytokinesis in mammalian cells...|$|E

40|$|Cardiomyocytes stop {{dividing}} {{after birth}} and postnatal heart growth is only achieved by increase in cell volume. In some species, cardiomyocytes undergo an additional incomplete mitosis {{in the first}} postnatal week, where <b>karyokinesis</b> {{takes place in the}} absence of cytokinesis, leading to binucleation. Proteins that regulate the formation of the actomyosin ring are known to be important for cytokinesis. Here we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} small GTPases like RhoA along with their downstream effectors like ROCK I, ROCK II and Citron Kinase show a developmental stage specific expression in heart, with high levels being expressed in cardiomyocytes only at stages when cytokinesis still occurs (i. e. embryonic and perinatal). This suggests that downregulation of many regulatory and cytoskeletal components involved in the formation of the actomyosin ring may be responsible for the uncoupling of cytokinesis from <b>karyokinesis</b> in rodent cardiomyocytes after birth. Interestingly, when the myocardium tries to adapt to the increased workload during pathological hypertrophy a re-expression of proteins involved in DNA synthesis and cytokinesis can be detected. Nevertheless, the adult cardiomyocytes do not appear to divide despite this upregulation of the cytokinetic machinery. The inability to undergo complete division could be due to the presence of stable, highly ordered and functional sarcomeres in the adult myocardium or could be because of the inefficiency of degradation pathways, which facilitate the division of differentiated embryonic cardiomyocytes by disintegrating myofibrils...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Activation of the Wnt {{signaling}} pathway is important for induction of gene expression and cell morphogenesis throughout embryonic development. We examined the subcellular localization of dishevelled, the immediate downstream component from the Wnt receptor, in the embryonic mouse kidney. Using immunofluorescence staining, confocal microscopy, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we show that dishevelled associates with actin fibers and focal adhesion plaques in metanephric mesenchymal cells. Stimulation of Wnt signaling leads to profound changes in metanephric mesenchymal cell morphology, including disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, increased cell spreading, and increased <b>karyokinesis.</b> Upon activation of Wnt signaling, dishevelled also accumulates in an...|$|E
40|$|A novel gene, {{designated}} byr 4, {{was identified}} in Schizosaccharomyces pombe {{that affects the}} mitotic cell cycle and shows genetic interactions with the ras 1 signaling pathways. Null alleles of byr 4 cause cell cycle arrest in late mitosis and permit multiple rounds of septation. The multiple septa typically divide two nuclei, but the nuclei frequently do not stain equally with 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 - phenylindole (DAPI), suggesting that byr 4 is required for proper <b>karyokinesis.</b> Overexpression of byr 4 inhibits cytokinesis, but cell cycle progression continues leading to multinucleate cells. When byr 4 is overexpressed, the early steps in the cytokinesis pathway, including formation of the medial F-actin ring, occur normally; however, the later steps in the pathway, including contraction of the F-actin ring, septation, and rearrangement of the medial F-actin following mitosis, rarely occur, byr 4 shows two genetic interactions with ras 1. The inhibition of cytokinesis by byr 4 overexpression was exacerbated by null alleles of ras 1 and scd 1, suggesting a link between pathways needed for cell polarity and cytokinesis. Overexpression of byr 4 also partially bypasses the need for ras 1 for sporulation. The electrophoretic mobility of the byr 4 protein varied in response to mutants that perturb cytokinesis and <b>karyokinesis,</b> suggesting interactions between byr 4 and these gene products. A more rapidly migrating byr 4 protein was found in cells with mutations in cdc 16, which undergo repeated septation, and in cdc 15, which fail to form a medial F-actin ring in mitosis. A slower migrating byr 4 protein was found in cells with a mutation in the beta-tubulin gene, which arrests cells at the metaphase-anaphase transition...|$|E

Here, the occurrence of specific chemicals with antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines was evidenced in hyperplasia (leafy galls) induced when plants interact with particular phytopathogens, such as the Actinomycete Rhodococcus fascians. METHODS: We examined leafy galls fraction F 3. 1. 1 on cell proliferation, cell division and cytoskeletal disorganization of human cancer cell lines using time-lapse videomicroscopy imaging, combined with flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis. We determined the F 3. 1. 1 -fraction composition by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The leafy galls induced on tobacco by R. fascians yielded fraction F 3. 1. 1 which inhibited proliferation of glioblastoma U 373 cells with an IC 50 of 4. 5 µg/mL, F. 3. 1. 1 was shown to increase cell division duration, cause nuclear morphological deformations and cell enlargement, and, at higher concentrations, <b>karyokinesis</b> defects leading to polyploidization and apoptosis. F 3. 1. 1 consisted of a mixture of isomers belonging to the cembrenoids. The cellular defects induced by F 3. 1. 1 were caused by a peculiar cytoskeletal disorganization, with the occurrence of fragmented tubulin and strongly organized microtubule aggregates within the same cell. Colchicine, paclitaxel, and cembrene also affected U 373 cell proliferation and <b>karyokinesis,</b> but the induced microtubule rearrangement {{was very different from}} that provoked by F 3. 1. 1.
