50|$|<b>Epilation</b> can {{be painful}} {{to some people}} because, as with waxing, it {{involves}} pulling hair out of the roots. Because of the pain involved being particularly bad on the first <b>epilation</b> of an area, some people prefer to have the area professionally waxed first, then use <b>epilation</b> to remove regrowth.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{strength}} and brittleness of the hair, some may snap off rather than being pulled out. Because those hairs snap off just above the skin surface, they can look somewhat like stubble from shaving, but are far more sparsely spread because the other hairs have been pulled out entirely. As with waxing, because of the phases of growth that occur with hair, there is not as much regrowth following the first <b>epilation.</b> Regular <b>epilation</b> of regrowth is less painful than the initial <b>epilation</b> {{and the number of}} broken off hairs diminishes with regular <b>epilation.</b>|$|E

More hair may grow in certain areas that are prone to hormone-induced growth (e.g. a woman's chin and neck) based on individual hormone levels or changes therein, and one's genetic predisposition to grow new hair.|$|E
50|$|Similar effects {{apply to}} animals, with fur acting as {{additional}} factor for both increased particle retention and partial skin shielding. Unshorn thickly wooled sheep are well protected; while the <b>epilation</b> threshold for sheared sheep is between 23-47 Gy (2500-5000 rep) and the threshold for normally wooled face is 47-93 Gy (5000-10000 rep), for thickly wooled (33 mm hair length) sheep it is 93-140 Gy (10000-15000 rep). To produce skin lesions comparable with contagious pustular dermatitis, the estimated dose is between 465-1395 Gy.|$|E
50|$|Welcome to {{the world}} of Metalonia, where we meet the Barbarians - a fierce and ever battle-hungry tribe of muscle-worshipping warriors with strict codes for <b>epilation,</b> chaps and piercings.

50|$|The hyfrecator has a {{large number}} of uses, such as removal of warts (especially {{recalcitrant}} warts), pearly penile papules, desiccation of sebaceous gland disorders, electrocautery of bleeding, <b>epilation,</b> destruction of small cosmetically unwanted superficial veins, in certain types of plastic surgery, and many other dermatological tasks. It may also be instrumental in the destruction of skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma. For larger amounts of tissue destruction, the hyfrecator may be used in multiple sessions in the same area or point, as for example to gradually reduce {{the size of a large}} subcutaneous structure, such as a plantar wart.|$|E
50|$|If the {{exposure}} to beta radiation is intense, the beta burns may first manifest in 24-48 hours by itching and/or burning sensation that last {{for one or two}} days, sometimes accompanied by hyperaemia. After 1-3 weeks burn symptoms appear; erythema, increased skin pigmentation (dark colored patches and raised areas), followed by <b>epilation</b> and skin lesions. Erythema occurs after 5-15 Gy, dry desquamation after 17 Gy, and bullous epidermitis after 72 Gy. Chronic radiation keratosis may develop after higher doses. Primary erythema lasting more than 72 hours is an indication of injury severe enough to cause chronic radiation dermatitis. Edema of dermal papillae, if present within 48 hours since the exposition, is followed by transepidermal necrosis. After higher doses, the malpighian layer cells die within 24 hours; lower doses may take 10-14 days to show dead cells. Inhalation of beta radioactive isotopes may cause beta burns of lungs and nasopharyngeal region, ingestion may lead to burns of gastrointestinal tract; the latter being a risk especially for grazing animals.|$|E
50|$|The first {{attempted}} {{x-ray treatment}} was by Victor Despeignes, a French physician who used {{them on a}} patient with stomach cancer. In 1896, he published a paper with the results: a week-long treatment {{was followed by a}} diminution of pain and reduction {{in the size of the}} tumor, though the case was ultimately fatal. The results were inconclusive, because the patient was concurrently being given other treatments. Freund's first experiment was a tragic failure; he applied x-rays to a naevus in order to induce <b>epilation</b> and a deep ulcer resulted, which resisted further treatment by radiation. The first successful treatment was by Schiff, working with Freund, in a case of lupus vulgaris. A year later, in 1897, the two published a report of their success and this provoked further experimentation in x-ray therapies. Thereafter they did a successful treatment of lupus erythematosus in 1898. The lesion took a common form of a 'butterfly-patch' which appeared on both sides of the face, and Schiff applied the irradiation to one side only, in order to compare the effects.|$|E
5000|$|A {{symptomatic}} {{patient will}} present an unusual amount of itching and alopecia. [...] Primary treatment involves griseofulvin, an antimycotic agent. For patients who don't respond to Griseofulvin, other drugs, Itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine {{can be used}} as a replacement to or in conjunction with griseofulvin. These drugs are preferred over griseofulvin as they have a shorter duration for treatment. [...] However, these agents have drug-drug interactions and over a prolonged period of time can cause liver damage. [...] Currently, squalamine, an aminosterol with fungicidal properties is being researched as its mechanism of action is different from that of the aforementioned medicines, making it a good drug for those who don't respond well to Itraconazole, fluconazole or terbinafine. Systemic treatment with oral medication and anti-fungal shampoos has also been effective. [...] Antifungal shampoos (Ketoconazole 2% shampoo or selenium sulfide 2.5% [...] ) are effective as they reduce the transmission of the diseased hair by preventing its shedding. [...] Other treatments include, <b>epilation</b> of the infected follicles, topical ointments and steroidal treatments. Topical ointments immobilize the fungus and reduce shedding but they do not penetrate the hair follicle and hence must be used in conjunction with other treatment methods. [...] Steroidal treatments aid in inflammation and pain reduction.|$|E
5000|$|The fallout {{produced}} by the Castle Bravo test was unexpectedly strong. A white snow-like dust, nicknamed by the scientists [...] "Bikini snow" [...] and consisting of contaminated crushed calcined coral, fell for about 12 hours upon the Rongelap Atoll, depositing a layer of up to 2 cm. Residents suffered beta burns, mostly {{on the backs of}} their necks and on their feet, and were resettled after three days. After 24-48 hours their skin was itching and burning; {{in a day or two}} the sensations subsided, to be followed after 2-3 weeks by <b>epilation</b> and ulcers. Darker-colored patches and raised areas appeared on their skin, blistering was uncommon. Ulcers formed dry scabs and healed. Deeper lesions, painful, weeping and ulcerated, formed on more contaminated residents; the majority healed with simple treatment. In general, the beta burns healed with some cutaneous scarring and depigmentation. Individuals who bathed and washed the fallout particles from their skin did not develop skin lesions. The fishing ship Daigo Fukuryu Maru was affected by the fallout as well; the crew suffered skin doses between 1.7-6.0 Gy, with beta burns manifesting as severe skin lesions, erythema, erosions, sometimes necrosis, and skin atrophy. 23 U.S. radar servicemen of the 28-member weather station on Rongerik were affected, experiencing discrete 1-4 mm skin lesions which healed quickly, and ridging of fingernails several months later. Sixteen crew members of the aircraft carrier USS Bairoko received beta burns and there was an increased cancer rate.|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the association between}} <b>epilation</b> and cancer mortality in Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors, cancer mortality was determined {{for a total of}} 9, 356 survivors (3, 591 males and 5, 765 females) from 1 January 1970 to 31 December 1997. The subjects included individuals other than those in the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort of ABCC-RERF. Information on acute injury was obtained from a survey that was conducted at the time of application for a health handbook. The association between <b>epilation</b> and cancer mortality was evaluated by the Cox proportional hazards model, including factors such as gender, age {{at the time of the}} bombing, attained age, radiation dose and <b>epilation.</b> <b>Epilation</b> was found in 81 (2. 3 %) males and 148 (2. 6 %) females. No significant difference in the frequency of <b>epilation</b> was observed by gender or age at the time of the bombing. The hazard ratio of cancer mortality in those with <b>epilation</b> compared to those without <b>epilation</b> was 1. 06 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 72 - 1. 54). Similar to the study of the LSS cohort, no significant effects of <b>epilation</b> on cancer mortality were observed in the present study. The results indicated that the cancer mortality was significantly higher in those exposed to atomic bombing younger as was reported by LSS studies. However, the effects of radiation dose on cancer mortality have not been observed in the present study...|$|E
40|$|Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) {{needs to}} be managed {{to reduce the risk}} of vision loss. The {{long-term}} impact of <b>epilation</b> (a common traditional practice of repeated plucking of lashes touching the eye) in preventing visual impairment and corneal opacity from TT is unknown. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of <b>epilation</b> versus surgery for the management of minor TT (fewer than six lashes touching the eye) in Ethiopia. Here we report the four-year outcome and the effect on vision and corneal opacity. 1300 individuals with minor TT were recruited and randomly assigned to quality trichiasis surgery or repeated <b>epilation</b> using high quality <b>epilation</b> forceps by a trained person with good near vision. Participants were examined six-monthly for two-years, and then at four-years after randomisation. At two-years all <b>epilation</b> arm participants were offered free surgery. At four-years 1151 (88. 5 %) were re-examined: 572 (88 %) and 579 (89 %) from <b>epilation</b> and surgery arms, respectively. At that time, 21. 1 % of the surgery arm participants had recurrent TT; 189 / 572 (33 %) of the <b>epilation</b> arm had received surgery, while 383 (67 %) declined surgery and had continued epilating ("epilation-only"). Among the epilation-only group, 207 (54. 1 %) fully controlled their TT, 166 (43. 3 %) had minor TT and 10 (2. 6 %) had major TT (> 5 lashes). There were no differences between participants in the epilation-only, epilation-to-surgery and surgery arm participants in changes in visual acuity and corneal opacity between baseline and four-years. Most minor TT participants randomised to the <b>epilation</b> arm continued epilating and controlled their TT. Change in vision and corneal opacity was comparable between surgery and epilation-only participants. This suggests that good quality <b>epilation</b> with regular follow-up is a reasonable second-line alternative to surgery for minor TT for individuals who either decline surgery or do not have immediate access to surgical treatment...|$|E
40|$|PurposeEight {{million people}} have trachomatous trichiasis (TT). The World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} entropion surgery for TT regardless of severity. However, <b>epilation</b> is widely practiced for treating minor TT (1 – 5 lashes touching the globe). We report the frequency and effectiveness of patient-initiated <b>epilation</b> {{and its relationship to}} corneal opacity. DesignCross-sectional baseline data of individuals recruited to 2 randomized, clinical trials. ParticipantsWe included 2556 individuals (4310 eyes) with previously unoperated TT in ≥ 1 eye. MethodsA single ophthalmologist examined all participants for signs of trachoma using WHO grading systems with additional assessment of entropion grading, location and number of trichiatic lashes, and evidence of <b>epilation.</b> A questionnaire enquired about <b>epilation</b> practices. Main Outcome MeasuresThe association between <b>epilation</b> and degree of corneal opacity. <b>Epilation</b> practices of TT patients. ResultsCentral corneal scarring was present in 1436 (33 %) eyes. Entropion was absent/mild in 2328 (54 %) eyes, moderate in 1259 (29. 2 %), and severe in 723 (16. 8 %). The median number of lashes touching the eye was 2 (interquartile range, 1 – 5; range, 0 – 133). There was clinical evidence of <b>epilation</b> in 3018 (70 %) eyes, of which 738 (24 %) were successfully epilated (no lashes touching globe). <b>Epilation</b> was performed frequently (at least monthly in 3311 [76. 8 %] eyes), by someone other than the patient (92. 8 %), and using locally made forceps (88. 9 %). Controlling for age and degree of entropion, successful <b>epilation</b> was associated with less corneal opacity (odds ratio [OR], 0. 61; 95 % confidence interval [CI]. 0. 43 – 0. 88; P = 0. 007). The association was only significant in patients with severe entropion (OR, 0. 07; 95 % CI, 0. 02 – 0. 25; P< 0. 005). ConclusionsWe found an association between successful <b>epilation</b> and less central corneal opacity. This indicates the importance of preventing eyelashes from touching the cornea, particularly in individuals with severe entropion. This is a cross-sectional study; therefore, a causative relationship cannot be concluded. However, the results suggest that among patients who decline or are unable to access surgery, and perhaps in minor TT where the management remains controversial, the provision of high-quality forceps and <b>epilation</b> training may be beneficial.

40|$|Trachomatous trichiasis {{can cause}} corneal damage and visual impairment. WHO {{recommends}} surgery for all cases. However, {{in many regions}} surgical provision is inadequate and patients frequently decline. Self-epilation is common and was associated with comparable outcomes to surgery in nonrandomised studies for minor trichiasis (<six lashes touching eye). This trial investigated whether <b>epilation</b> is noninferior to surgery for managing minor trichiasis. 1, 300 individuals with minor trichiasis from Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia were recruited and randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive trichiasis surgery or <b>epilation.</b> The <b>epilation</b> group were given new forceps and <b>epilation</b> training. The surgical group received trichiasis surgery. Participants were examined every 6 months for 2 years by clinicians masked to allocation, with 93. 5 % follow-up at 24 months. The primary outcome measure ("failure") was ≥five lashes touching the eye or receiving trichiasis surgery during 24 months of follow-up, and was assessed for noninferiority with a 10 % prespecified noninferiority margin. Secondary outcomes included number of lashes touching, time to failure, and changes in visual acuity and corneal opacity. Cumulative risk of failure over 24 months was 13. 2 % in the <b>epilation</b> group and 2. 2 % in the surgical group (risk difference =  11 %). The 95 % confidence interval (8. 1 %- 13. 9 %) includes the 10 % noninferiority margin. Mean number of lashes touching the eye was greater in the <b>epilation</b> group than the surgery group (at 24 months 0. 95 versus 0. 09, respectively; p< 0. 001); {{there was no difference}} in change in visual acuity or corneal opacity between the two groups. This trial was inconclusive regarding inferiority of <b>epilation</b> to surgery for the treatment of minor trichiasis, relative to the prespecified margin. <b>Epilation</b> had a comparable effect to surgery on visual acuity and corneal outcomes. We suggest that surgery be performed whenever possible but <b>epilation</b> be used for treatment of minor trichiasis patients without access to or declining surgery.
