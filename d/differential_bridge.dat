In most cases, four strain gauges {{are used to}} obtain maximum sensitivity and temperature compensation. Two of the gauges are usually in tension can be represented as T1 and T2,and two in compression can be represented as C1 and C2, and are wired with compensation adjustments. The strain gauge load cell is fundamentally a spring optimized for strain measurement. Gauges are mounted in areas that exhibit strain in compression or tension. When weight {{is applied to the}} load cell, gauges C1 and C2 compress decreasing their resistances. Simultaneously, gauges T1 and T2 are stretched increasing their resistances. The change in resistances causes more current to flow through C1 and C2 and less current to flow through T1 and T2. Thus a potential difference is felt between the output or signal leads of the load cell. The gauges are mounted in a <b>differential</b> <b>bridge</b> to enhance measurement accuracy. When weight is applied, the strain changes the electrical resistance of the gauges in proportion to the load. Other load cells are fading into obscurity, as strain gauge load cells continue to increase their accuracy and lower their unit costs.|$|E

40|$|Thermally induced {{stresses}} in composite steel-concrete bridges {{are higher}} than those experienced by their concrete and steel cousins due to dissimilarity in material properties. These thermal stresses are relatively high when compared to service load stresses, leading to significant damage that manifest itself in terms of crack development in the concrete deck. This in turns leads to the corrosion of the steel reinforcement, steel superstructure, along with {{the deterioration of the}} concrete through water seepage. The various bridge design codes emphasize the importance of thermal stresses by providing designers with suggested thermal gradients that account for the temperature <b>differential</b> in <b>bridges.</b> However, previous studies have failed to account for the pre-existing construction transverse cracks in the concrete deck and their effect on the temperature distribution in composite bridges. In this study, a three-dimensional finite element model was developed to investigate the temperature distribution in a selected case study bridge. The model is a realistic depiction of an existing bridge with pre-existing transverse deck cracks and actual environmental boundary conditions for a selected geographical region. The results of a thermo-elastic analysis show that the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification is overly conservative and overestimates the vertical temperature gradient for the studied bridge. The AASHTO and other models found in existing literature seem to ignore the nonlinear thermal gradient for composite bridges, which produces a nonlinear strain component that can be critical for the bridge design and cannot be treated in a trivial manner. In addition, the pre-service deck transverse cracks appear to have a considerable effect on both, the vertical and the longitudinal temperature distributions in composite steel-concrete bridges, and hence require further assessment.

Many types of soils are classified as soft soft soils such as peat soils, soft clays and organic soft soils. Local and federal authorities in Malaysia responsible with road construction are always faced with undulating effects when roads meet bridges and those which are constructed on soft soils such as peaty and soft clays.

However the structural responses are also linked to environmental effects, such as its temperature and the traffic load. In order to understand a typical suspension bridge’s behaviour to environmental conditions, studies on the Tamar Suspension Bridge’s response to temperature and traffic are contained in this thesis. This was achieved by observing data collected from long-term monitoring systems installed on the structure, and simulated responses derived from a three-dimensional finite element model of the bridge. The data of the bridge {{have shown that the}} profile of the suspension bridge reconfigures when the temperature of its structure increases, causing the deck to sag and expand. The natural frequencies of the bridge were noted to drop during the day. Transient thermal responses were also indentified; the differing rates of warming up between the deck, towers and cables manifested in the structural responses of the bridge. Phenomena caused by the temperature <b>differential</b> across the <b>bridge’s</b> surface were also studied. Investigations on the effect of traffic demonstrated its additional mass causes the natural frequencies to decrease for certain modes. This was identifiable in the time series data, where the largest reduction in frequencies is during rush hours. The investigations have shown that the changes the modal frequencies and modal mass are dependent on the eccentricity of the traffic flow on the bridge, which may increase or decrease depending on the mode shape. The loading of an abnormally heavy trailer on the bridge has also demonstrated the deformation to the bridge’s quasi-static shape as the vehicle travelled across. The location of the vehicle on the bridge was also able to affect the modal properties of the suspension bridge, according to simulated results.

40|$|The bump {{at the end}} of {{the railway}} bridge is a result of {{differential}} movement between the bridge deck and the approach embankment. The movement can have the form of a bump or a dip. Either defect in the track geometry can cause significant problems in track performance. The current state of practice was evaluated by conducting a literature review and an industry survey. According to the survey, approximately half of all railway bridges are affected by the bump/dip. The total annual cost for repairing these bridge transition problems is estimated at $ 26 million. This does not take into account the considerable cost resulting from speed reductions that railroads must place on trains at these locations. In addition to the increased maintenance costs, the bump/dip leads to higher impact loads, uncomfortable rides and possible safety hazards. The track response due to the bump {{at the end of}} the bridge was evaluated by creating a 4 -D finite element model of the train, track structure and track substructure. The motion of the train model across a bridge/approach transition, with and without a bump/dip, was then simulated using LS-DYNA. It was found that a track modulus differential alone (no bump/dip) at a bridge/approach location leads to impact forces as well as increased ballast and subgrade pressures on the approach. This instigates the formation of a bump or dip in the track. The track response is increased when a bump/dip is present in the track profile. A parametric study looking at the influence of train direction, train speed, bump/dip size, approach embankment soil modulus, approach tie material, bridge tie material, bridge deck type, ballast thickness and approach tie length on the magnitude of impact forces, track deflection, ballast and subgrade pressures was also performed with the model.

The carboxyl-terminal peptide most likely contains the intramolecular disulfide bridge since neither its yield nor its electrophoretic mobility is altered by addition of reductant. Each GLUT 1 cysteine was changed to serine by oligonucleotide-directed, in vitro mutagenesis. The resulting transport proteins were expressed in CHO cells and screened by immunofluorescence microscopy {{for their ability to}} expose tetrameric GLUT 1 -specific epitopes. Serine substitution at cysteine residues 133, 201, 207, and 429 does not inhibit exposure of tetrameric GLUT 1 -specific epitopes. Serine substitution at cysteines 347 or 421 prevents exposure of tetrameric GLUT 1 -specific epitopes. Hydrodynamic analysis of GLUT 1 /GLUT 4 chimeras expressed in and subsequently solubilized from CHO cells indicates that GLUT 1 residues 1 - 199 promote chimera dimerization and permit GLUT 1 /chimera heterotetramerization. This GLUT 1 N-terminal domain is insufficient for chimera tetramerization which additionally requires GLUT 1 residues 200 - 463. Extracellular reductants (dithiothreitol, beta-mercaptoethanol, or glutathione) reduce erythrocyte 3 -O-methylglucose uptake by up to 15 -fold. This noncompetitive inhibition of sugar uptake is reversed by the cell-impermeant, oxidized glutathione. Reductant is without effect on sugar exit from erythrocytes. Dithiothreitol doubles the cytochalasin B binding capacity of erythrocyte-resident glucose transporter, abolishes allosteric interactions between substrate binding sites on adjacent subunits, and occludes tetrameric GLUT 1 -specific GLUT 1 epitopes in situ. CHO cell-resident GLUT 1 structure and transport function are similarly affected by extracellular reductant. We conclude that each subunit of the glucose transporter contains an extracellular disulfide bridge (Cys 347 and Cys 421) that stabilizes transporter oligomeric structure and thereby accelerates transport function...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{economic}} and urban development, the high-speed railway system connecting majorcities {{serves as a}} vital role in the national transportation network. Due to its high speed, punctuality,safety, comfort, high transportation capacity and less land use, it has become a new trend of railwaydevelopment in the world especially in Asian and European countries. We have derived the benefits ofhigh-speed railways since Tokaido Shinkansen as first high-speed railway was began operations inJapan in 1964. The main railway lines usually pass directly over densely populated urban areas orhigh-tech industrial areas, where the railway structure mainly comprises elevated bridges. Consideringthe extremely high speed, the bridge vibration caused by running high-speed train (HST) is concerned. This long-term vibration may cause deterioration of the bridge structures, such as the cracking orexfoliation of concrete. On the other hand, the bridge vibration propagates to the ambient ground viafooting and pile structures, thereby causing long-term environmental problems. Those vibrations oftenbring annoyances to the residents alongside railway lines and malfunction to the vibration-sensitiveequipment housed in the nearby buildings. Furthermore, they can induce the secondary vibration of thebuildings, which seriously affect the structural safety of ancient buildings near the railway lines. Alongwith further urbanization and more rapid transport facilities, there is rising public concern about theenvironmental problems in modern Japan. Therefore, it is quite necessary to clarify the developmentand propagation mechanism of ground vibration caused by running HSTs on the rigid-frame viaducts(RFVs) to find out more effective countermeasures against the HST-induced vibration problems. In this study, the vibration issues related to the train-bridge-ground interaction system: the HSTinducedbridge vibration problem, the environmental vibration problem caused by running HSTs andthe vibration reduction method, have been investigated by the 3 D numerical analysis approach. For the HST-induced bridge vibration problem, {{it is very important to}} perform effective predictionand diagnosis on the HST-induced vibration of either existing bridges or those in the planning stageand obtain some instructive information for the ground vibration analysis as well as the vibrationmitigation analysis. An analytical procedure to simulate the train-bridge coupled vibration problemwith considering the train-bridge interaction (TBI) as well as the effect of ground properties isestablished. The vibration responses of RFVs caused by running HSTs are analyzed in considerationof the wheel-track interaction including the rail surface roughness. The RFVs including the trackstructure are modeled as the 3 D beam elements and simultaneous vibration <b>differential</b> equations ofthe <b>bridge</b> are derived by using modal analysis. The elastic effect of ground springs at the pier bottomsand the connection effect of the sleepers and ballast between the track and the deck slab are modeledwith double nodes connected by springs. A 3 D HST model modeled as multi-DOFs vibration systemthat can appropriately express the lateral, vertical and rotational motions of the car body and bogies isdeveloped for the analyses. Newmark’s β method for direct numerical integration is applied to solvethe vibration differential equations. For the validation of the developed 3 D HST model and theanalytical approach, the vibration response analysis of the TBI system is carried out and the analyticalresults are compared with experimental ones. Based on the simulation of TBI, the vibrationcharacteristics of the RFVs in both vertical and lateral directions including the fact where predominantvibration occurs are clarified. Frequency characteristics are clarified by Fourier spectral analysis and 1 / 3 octave band spectral analysis. Furthermore, the parametric study of bridge vibration caused byrunning HSTs is performed to examine the vibration influences of different factors including trainspeeds, train types, track irregularities, rail types and damping based on their analytical results. For the environmental vibration problem caused by running HSTs, based on the developedanalytical procedure for the TBI, an approach to simulate ground vibration around the RFVs of thehigh-speed railway is established with considering the vibration interactions between the train and thebridge as well as the foundation and the ground. The TBI model established preciously is convenientlyused in this analysis. The entire train-bridge-ground interaction system is divided into two subsystems:the train-bridge interaction and the soil-structure interaction (SSI). In the stage of the TBI problem, thevibration responses of RFVs are simulated to obtain the vibration reaction forces at the pier bottoms ofiiRFVs. Then, applying those vibration reaction forces as input excitation forces in the SSI problem, theground vibration around the RFVs in both vertical and lateral directions is simulated and evaluated bymeans of using a general-purpose program named SASSI 2000. Based on the simulation of TBI andSSI, the characteristics of ground vibration including the fact where predominant vibration occurs areclarified. The ground vibration is rapidly attenuated along with the increase of propagation distance inthe near field and their vibration influence in the vertical direction is much more serious than that inthe lateral direction. The predominant frequency components are basically same for differentobservation points and they are determined by those of bridge vibration. Frequency characteristics arealso clarified by Fourier spectral analysis and 1 / 3 octave band spectral analysis. It is verified that theprimary vibration frequency component is dependent on the speed of HST in relation to the length ofcar and the higher frequency components are integer multiples of the primary one. The lowerfrequency band mainly exists in the vicinity of bridge piers and reduces quickly along with theincrease of propagation distance. The lateral vibration is mainly affected by the higher frequencycomponents. Furthermore, the parametric study of ground vibration caused by running HSTs is alsocarried out to examine the vibration influences of different factors including train speeds, train types,track irregularities, rail types and damping based on their numerical results. Based on the vibration characteristics related to the above-mentioned vibration issues, two kinds ofvibration reduction countermeasure are proposed to reduce the HST-induced vibration to meet therequirement of environmental vibration. One kind is to reinforce the hanging parts of RFVs to firstlyreduce the HST-induced bridge vibration. The other one is to install a new barrier called reinforcedconcrete vibration isolation unit (RCVIU) to directly isolate the HST-induced ground vibration. Then,according to 3 D numerical analysis approach of the entire train-bridge-ground interaction system, themitigation analyses are carried out to comparatively investigate the HST-induced vibration responsesfor three reinforcement methods and a double-layer RCVIU. Their vibration screening efficiencies areevaluated by the reduction of vibration acceleration level (VAL) based on 1 / 3 octave band spectralanalysis and the reduction factor on the maximum acceleration from three aspects such as vibrationfrequency, train speed and propagation distance. Furthermore, the combined vibration reductionmethod with strut and RCVIU is proposed to involve the source motion control and the wavepropagation obstruction. It is an effective vibration reduction method to reduce the HST-inducedground vibration around the RFVs in both vertical and lateral directions. The reduction of VAL is 9. 67 dB and 2. 78 dB at 25 m in the vertical and lateral direction, respectively. In particular, aboutvibration frequency, it is more effective to mitigate the ground vibration at 25 m in the lower frequencyband and the high frequency band such as 1 - 2. 5 Hz and 6 - 25 Hz. The largest reduction of VAL is 11. 35 dB at 8 Hz and 13. 68 dB at 12. 5 Hz in the vertical and lateral direction, respectively. But it is smallaround the primary frequency component 3. 15 Hz. According to the ground vibration response, the environmental vibration evaluation is performedby means of the VAL from two aspects: vibration frequency and train speed. Taking advantage of thefrequency-dependent base curves of perceptible vibration from ISO 2631 - 2 : 1989 and the threshold 70 dB of environmental vibration for Shinkansen railway in Japan, the environmental vibration iscomparatively investigated through the 1 / 3 octave band spectral analysis. The parametric effectsincluding train speeds, train types, track irregularities, rail types and damping are also investigated forthe environmental vibration caused by running HSTs. Furthermore, the assessment for vibrationreduction methods is carried out to clarify the effectiveness of improvement of environmentalvibration. The results show: the VALs in the lateral direction are below the base curves and far lessthan those in the vertical direction; the VALs in the vertical direction easily exceed the smallest basecurves in the range of 8 Hz to 25 Hz and the threshold 70 dB at the border for Shinkansen railway. Thevarious impact factors can cause the change of the HST-induced vibration but the change for the railtype is very small. In particular, the train speed can easily cause the variation of predominantfrequency components; the train type and damping ratio can easily cause the variation of magnitudes;track irregularity can cause the variation of both predominant frequency components and magnitudes. Finally, the application of vibration reduction countermeasures is useful to reduce the HST-inducedvibration to satisfy the requirement of environmental vibration in the vibration-sensitive areas...|$|R
