5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

Typical passive <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> on aluminium, stainless steels, and alloys is within 10 nanometers. The passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating and are in the micrometer thickness range – the passive film recovers if removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not.

25|$|The main {{consideration}} with SIMS is {{ensuring that}} the sample is stable under ultra-high vacuum, or pressures less than 10−8 torr. The nature of the ultra-high vacuum is that it ensures the sample remains constant during analysis as well as ensuring the high energy ion beam strikes the sample. Ultra-high vacuum solves {{many of the problems}} that need to be considered during sample preparation. When preparing the sample for analysis, another thing that should be considered is the thickness of the film. Typically, if a thin monolayer can be deposited onto the surface of a noble metal, analysis should be successful. If the <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> is too large, which is common in real world analysis, the problem can be solved by methods such as depositing a perforated silver foil over a nickel grid onto the film surface. This yields similar results to thin films deposited directly onto a noble metal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rated voltage}} of {{different}} film materials depends on {{factors such as}} the thickness of the film, the quality of the material (freedom from physical defects and chemical impurities), the ambient temperature, and frequency of operation, plus a safety margin against the breakdown voltage (dielectric strength). But to a first approximation, the voltage rating of a film capacitor depends primarily on the thickness of the plastic film. For example, with the minimum available <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> of polyester film capacitors (about 0.7µm), it is possible to produce capacitors with a rated voltage of 400VDC. If higher voltages are needed, typically a thicker plastic film will be used. [...] But the breakdown voltage for dielectric films is usually nonlinear. For thicknesses greater than about 5 mils, the breakdown voltage only increases approximately with the square-root of the <b>film</b> <b>thickness.</b> On the other hand, the capacitance decreases linearly with increased <b>film</b> <b>thickness.</b> [...] For reasons of availability, storage and existing processing capabilities, it is desirable to achieve higher breakdown voltages while using existing available film materials. This can be achieved by a one-sided partial metallization of the insulating films in such a manner that an internal series connection of capacitors is produced. By using this series connection technique, the total breakdown voltage of the capacitor can be multiplied by an arbitrary factor, but the total capacitance is also reduced by the same factor.|$|E

2500|$|The GC-MS is {{composed}} of two major building blocks: the gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph utilizes a capillary column which depends on the column's dimensions (length, diameter, <b>film</b> <b>thickness)</b> {{as well as the}} phase properties (e.g. 5% phenyl polysiloxane). [...] The difference in the chemical properties between different molecules in a mixture and their relative affinity for the stationary phase of the column will promote separation of the molecules as the sample travels the length of the column. The molecules are retained by the column and then elute (come off) from the column at different times (called the retention time), and this allows the mass spectrometer downstream to capture, ionize, accelerate, deflect, and detect the ionized molecules separately. The mass spectrometer does this by breaking each molecule into ionized fragments and detecting these fragments using their mass-to-charge ratio.|$|E

2500|$|Ellipsometry {{can also}} be done as imaging {{ellipsometry}} by using a CCD camera as a detector. This provides a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> and refractive index. Advanced imaging ellipsometer technology operates {{on the principle of}} classical null ellipsometry and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. [...] Imaging ellipsometry is based on the concept of nulling. [...] In ellipsometry, the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. [...] The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. [...] In order to obtain data about <b>film</b> <b>thickness,</b> the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. [...] Nulling is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. [...] Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532nm green laser light. [...] Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an ellipsometer from parts. [...] Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a linear polarizer (P). [...] The linearly polarized light then passes through a quarter wavelength compensator (C) which transforms the light into elliptically polarized light. [...] This elliptically polarized light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a CCD camera by a long working distance objective. The analyzer here is another polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. [...] This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.|$|E

The very small thickness of the dielectric decreased the overall dimensions of these capacitors compared to other film capacitors of the time. MKU film capacitors are no longer manufactured, because polyester film capacitors can now be produced in the smaller sizes that were the market niche of the MKU type.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, {{a sliding}} ski melts a thin and {{transitory}} film of lubricating layer of water, {{caused by the}} heat of friction between the ski and the snow in its passing. Colbeck suggests that the optimum water <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> is in the range between 4 [...] and 12 μm. However, the heat generated by friction can be lost by conduction to a cold ski, thereby diminishing {{the production of the}} melt layer. At the other extreme, when the snow is wet and warm, heat generation creates a thicker film that can create increased capillary drag on the ski bottom. Kuzmin and Fuss suggest that the most favorable combination of ski base material properties to minimize ski sliding friction on snow include: increased hardness and lowered thermal conductivity of the base material to promote meltwater generation for lubrication, wear resistance in cold snow, and hydrophobicity to minimize capillary suction. These attributes are readily achievable with a PFTE base, which diminishes the value added by glide waxes. Lintzén reports that factors other than wax are much more important in reducing friction on cross-country skate skis—the curvature of the ski and snow conditions.|$|E
