5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} Malawi, certain factors such as sexual orientation, gender, and age influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the <b>epidemic</b> <b>began</b> in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS <b>epidemic</b> <b>began</b> in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans, or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E

25|$|In 1684, the {{beginning}} of the Morean War between Venice and the Ottoman Empire resulted in the temporary reconquest of {{a large part of the}} country by the Republic. In 1687 the Venetian army arrived in Piraeus and captured Attica. The number of the Athenians at that time exceeded 6000, the Albanians from the villages of Attica excluded, whilst in 1674 the population of Aegina did not seem to exceed 3000 inhabitants, ⅔ of which were women. The Aeginetans had been reduced to poverty to pay their taxes. The most significant plague <b>epidemic</b> <b>began</b> in Attica during 1688, an occasion that caused the massive migration of Athenians toward the south; most of them settled in Aegina. In 1693 Morosini resumed command, but his only acts were to refortify the castle of Aegina, which he had demolished during the Cretan war in 1655, the cost of upkeep being paid as long as the war lasted by the Athenians, and to place it and Salamis under Malipiero as Governor. This caused the Athenians to send him a request for the renewal of Venetian protection and an offer of an annual tribute. He died in 1694 and Zeno was appointed at his place.|$|E

The disease could be passed on between any nearby characters, and would kill characters with lower levels in a few seconds, while higher level characters could keep themselves alive. It would disappear as time passed or when the character died. Due to a programming error, when hunters dismissed their pets, those pets would keep any active debuffs when summoned again.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Marshall Heights had a {{reputation}} as a poor but stable neighborhood of families and retirees. But an epidemic of crack cocaine hit the District of Columbia in 1985, bringing with it significant amounts of gun violence and murder. Marshall Heights, along with the neighborhoods of Anacostia, Garfield Heights, Shaw, and a few others, were among the hardest-hit. Drake Place SE {{was one of the most}} active open-air drug markets in the Mid-Atlantic region.

2500|$|In the Late Middle Ages (1340–1400) Europe {{experienced}} the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing {{a third of}} the human population. Some historians believe that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution. [...] The Black Death originated in or near China and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries. Arab historians Ibn Al-Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia. Chinese records also showed a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s. Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region, where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia. The Mongols had cut off the trade route, the Silk Road, between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe. The <b>epidemic</b> <b>began</b> with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants' last trading station in the region, Caffa in the Crimea. In late 1346, plague broke out among the besiegers and from them penetrated into the town. When spring arrived, the Italian merchants fled on their ships, unknowingly carrying the Black Death. Carried by the fleas on rats, the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another.|$|E
60|$|We will cite two {{or three}} cases in {{illustration}} of our meaning. Six or eight years ago, the <b>epidemic</b> <b>began</b> to display itself among the linen-drapers and haberdashers. The primary symptoms were an inordinate love of plate-glass, and a passion for gas-lights and gilding. The disease gradually progressed, and at last attained a fearful height. Quiet, dusty old shops {{in different parts of}} town, were pulled down; spacious premises with stuccoed fronts and gold letters, were erected instead; floors were covered with Turkey carpets; roofs supported by massive pillars; doors knocked into windows; a dozen squares of glass into one; one shopman into a dozen; and there is no knowing what would have been done, {{if it had not been}} fortunately discovered, just in time, that the Commissioners of Bankruptcy were as competent to decide such cases as the Commissioners of Lunacy, and that a little confinement and gentle examination did wonders. The disease abated. It died away. A year or two of comparative tranquillity ensued. Suddenly it burst out again amongst the chemists; the symptoms were the same, with the addition of a strong desire to stick the royal arms over the shop-door, and a great rage for mahogany, varnish, and expensive floor-cloth. Then, the hosiers were infected, and began to pull down their shop-fronts with frantic recklessness. The mania again died away, and the public began to congratulate themselves on its entire disappearance, when it burst forth with tenfold violence among the publicans, and keepers of ‘wine vaults.’ From that moment it has spread among them with unprecedented rapidity, exhibiting a concatenation of all the previous symptoms; onward it has rushed to every part of town, knocking down all the old public-houses, and depositing splendid mansions, stone balustrades, rosewood fittings, immense lamps, and illuminated clocks, at the corner of every street.|$|E

40|$|Infectious disease {{epidemics}} {{have played}} {{and continue to}} play important roles in human populations. At different geographical levels, the spread of epidemics are affected by multiple demographic, social, cultural, political, economic, and other factors. Variation in these factors often produces different local or regional outcomes, so {{it is important for}} researchers to understand how individual behaviors and interactions can produce and explain larger patterns of disease spread. In small, traditional communities, important factors include settlement and household organization, daily behaviors, and relationships among residents. This research uses two computer simulation models to test the relative impact of these factors on disease spread in a small study community in Newfoundland and Labrador in the early 20 th century, using data from the 1918 flu pandemic and other archival sources. In the agent-based model, which emphasizes movement to important social spaces, schoolchildren drive the size and timing of epidemics. In the social network model, which reflects important relationships among community residents, <b>epidemics</b> <b>begun</b> by adult women tend to be slower and smaller than <b>epidemics</b> <b>begun</b> by other types of individuals. These results demonstrate that, based on their roles in the community, members of different age and sex groups can strongly affect epidemic outcomes. Further, because simulation models are often used to develop or recommend public health policies or intervention strategies, the different results of the two models indicate the importance of selecting appropriate design features to ensure the best possible recommendations...|$|R
