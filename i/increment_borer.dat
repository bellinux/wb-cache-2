50|$|The test's {{hands-on}} portion includes various {{tasks such}} as tree and leaf/needle identification, collecting tree core samples using an <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> to determine tree age and historical influences, and tree planting using proper techniques.|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} other tools, <b>increment</b> <b>borers</b> should be {{properly}} maintained {{to keep them in}} good working condition; should be thoroughly cleaned after each use and dried before storing. Sharpening kits are available and should be used regularly, hopefully before when such bits become dull.|$|R
40|$|High-density {{hardwood}} {{trees with}} large diameters {{have been found}} to damage manually operated <b>increment</b> <b>borers,</b> thus limiting their use in the tropics. Therefore, we herein report a new, low-cost gasoline-powered sampling system for high-density tropical hardwood trees with large diameters. This system provides increment cores 15 mm in diameter and up to 1. 35 m in length, allowing minimally invasive sampling of tropical hardwood tree species, which, up to the present, could not be collected by conventional 5 or 10 mm <b>increment</b> <b>borers.</b> This system provides a single core sample with ample amount of wood for multidisciplinary analyses, including ring width, stable isotope and wood anatomical measurements. The borer never gets stuck inside stems, even in hollowed trees, cores will never twist during coring, and the gasoline drill gives ample flexibility in the field. It is anticipated that the dendrochronological community will find our technique very useful in the pursuit of tropical tree ring research...|$|R
40|$|The dimensions, {{manufacture}} {{and application of}} a mini-borer to take 3 -mm cores are described. This new instrument seems particularly well-suited to determining ages of saplings in situations where collection of cross-sections and coring with standard <b>increment</b> <b>borers</b> are too destructive, and where node-counting may not be sufficiently accurate. The design has resulted in trouble-free use in the field, and the mini-cores {{can be stored in}} the straws, and mounted and sanded in the core mounts used for collections of the standard 4 - 5 -mm increment cores...|$|R
50|$|According to the Iasi Environmental Protection Agency's {{official}} data, {{the tree}} is approximately 458 years old. A more recent survey conducted using an <b>increment</b> <b>borer,</b> placed the tree at 540 years of age (+- 3%).|$|E
50|$|Effective {{use of an}} <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> {{requires}} specialized training. Samples {{are taken}} at breast height or stump height of the tree trunk, depending on the user's objectives; during use the borer should be well lubricated, thus {{making it easier to}} use and preventing it from becoming stuck in the wood.|$|E
5000|$|The {{previously}} oldest named {{specimen of}} this species, [...] "Methuselah", is also {{located in the}} Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest of the White Mountains.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} laser to trim the outer surface from tree-ring increment cores in preparation for dendrochemistry of certain metals. A source of contamination specific to dendrochemistry of metals is metal constituents, such as iron, tungsten, chromium, nickel, and cobalt, coming off tools used to collect and process cores and adhering to the sample surface. One method to eliminate this contamination is to trim off the outer surface of cores using laser. To test this application of laser, three tree-ring increment cores were collected from each of three trees. For each tree, one core was trimmed using a CO 2 laser, one core was trimmed using a stainless steel razor blade, and one core was left untrimmed. The resultant cores were measured for metals using acid dissolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Trimmed cores had on average one-third the content of iron, tungsten, and chromium than that of untrimmed cores. Laser-trimmed cores had less of these metals than razor-trimmed cores. Razor-trimmed cores also had measurable nickel, but laser-trimmed cores had no nickel. Laser trimming is an ideal solution to potential contamination of cores with metals from <b>increment</b> <b>borers</b> without imparting other contamination from tools such as razor blades...|$|R
40|$|Since 1988, Virginia Tech has had various {{programs}} in which undergraduate students visited {{public schools and}} presented natural resources-based information One {{of the more popular}} presentations involved teaching public school students how to identify and measure forest vegetation. In 2008, the Ambassadors for Conservation Education (ACE) Program was developed to enlist a larger, more diverse student body to participate in forestry and agriculturally-related undergraduate degree programs. In this program, undergraduates visited two parks and six high schools with forest nearby to collect forest ecological data with high school students. At each park and school we established a series of 0. 02 -ha permanent plots. Accurate baseline data on tree species, and tree diameter (3 ̆e 10 cm) were collected on all plots by Virginia Tech faculty and staff. These data, along with the exercise objectives and field trip preparation material (e. g., data sheets), were placed on the internet for use by teachers. To prepare for their teaching days, undergraduate students enrolled in a communication class where they were taught principles of effective communication. The class emphasized outdoor environmental teaching with numerous practice sessions where students improved their skills at teaching outdoors in informal settings. Undergraduates then led high school field trips where students and their teachers visited the plots and collected the same information in the pre-established plots. High schoolers learned principle of tree identification and use of diameter tapes and <b>increment</b> <b>borers.</b> Following data collection, students returned to the classroom and submitted their data via the internet. Relatively accurate data can be collected when trained undergraduates assist high school students closely. Utilizing schools with forest plots nearby greatly increased the number of students reached and eliminates the need for special field trip permission and transportation costs...|$|R
50|$|As {{plants are}} able to {{translocate}} and accumulate particular types of contaminants, plants {{can be used as}} biosensors of subsurface contamination, thereby allowing investigators to quickly delineate contaminant plumes. Chlorinated solvents, such as trichloroethylene, have been observed in tree trunks at concentrations related to groundwater concentrations. To ease field implementation of phytoscreening, standard methods have been developed to extract a section of the tree trunk for later laboratory analysis, often by using an <b>increment</b> <b>borer.</b> Phytoscreening may lead to more optimized site investigations and reduce contaminated site cleanup costs.|$|E
50|$|Here, stories diverge. It is {{not clear}} whether Currey requested, or Forest Service {{personnel}} suggested, that he cut down and section the tree in lieu of coring it. There is also some uncertainty as to why a core sample could not be obtained. One version has it that he broke or lodged his only long <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> and could not obtain another {{before the end of the}} field season; another claims he broke two of them, while another implies that a core sample was too difficult to obtain and also would not provide as much definitive information as a full cross-section of the tree.|$|E

Blueprints and boring samples were given to the West Virginia State Museum in Charleston and to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> is a {{specialized}} tool used to extract {{a section of}} wood tissue from a living tree with relatively minor injury to the plant itself. [...] The tool consists of a handle, an auger bit and a small, half circular metal tray ( [...] the core extractor) that fits into the auger bit; the last is usually manufactured from carbide steel. It is most often used by foresters, researchers and scientists to determine the age of a tree - the relative science being called dendrochronology - The operation enables the user to count the rings in the core sample, to reveal {{the age of the}} tree being examined and its growth rate. After use the tool breaks down: auger bit and extractor fit within the handle, making it highly compact and easy to carry.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{of the methods}} used to {{determine}} site index is tree height. Determining site index is achieved by measuring and averaging the total height and age of trees found on that site. Height is obtained from dominant or co-dominant trees (referred to as canopy position) in a stand and is estimated using an instrument called a clinometer, or measured using a laser or releskope. Tree height is also commonly estimated by measuring DBH*statement is inaccurate as DBH stands for diameter at breast height (4.5 feet above bare mineral soil) and does not correlate to height, as both DBH and height {{are affected by the}} canopy position of tree, such as, is it suppressed, domminant, co-dominant, or released. A tree first focuses on gaining height, and then growing diameter. Age is calculated using an instrument called an <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> or from planting records for even aged stands. These values are then used on a graph or an equation called a site index curve.|$|E
30|$|Generally, the “cutting” by {{the threads}} of {{increment}} bores produces no sawdust during coring. Apart from a “cutting” <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> type, {{there is a}} “sawing” increment bore type, which utilizes a plug cutter instead of cutting edge {{at the tip of}} the bit [2]. The plug cutter produces sawdust (or splints) when coring. One of the main advantages of the sawing <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> is its reduced friction on the outside of the drill compared to cutting <b>increment</b> <b>borer.</b> The sawing <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> requires smaller torque for coring, and therefore is suited for sampling long cores of hardwood (e.g., “Dendrobohrer” by Pressler GmbH) [3]. The disadvantage is longer time required for coring.|$|E
30|$|However, cutting <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> {{does have}} some disadvantages. High-density {{hardwood}} trees with large diameters sometimes damage manually operated cutting increment borers. In our experience, it happens when coring temperate hardwood trees such as Q. crispula or tropical hardwood such as T. grandis. When coring these species, {{the cutting edge of}} the <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> is sometimes nicked, and in rare cases, the shaft of borer bit can snap. If these problems happen frequently, the “sawing” type <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> may be a better option. With increasing length and/or diameter of the core, the sampling operation requires greater power to drive the cutting <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> because the higher surface areas in contact with the wood increase the driving torque.|$|E
30|$|The third {{advantage}} is high sample throughput. Recently developed coring devices have become lighter (e.g., combined weight of 23  kg for engine, borers and support frame) [3] and {{are capable of}} sampling 12  mm cores from tropical hardwood. However, such devices employ a sawing <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> [3, 16], which is time consuming. When the sawing <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> is driven by an engine-powered drill, it takes about 20  min to sample 30  cm core [3]. A cutting <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> coupled with Smartborer requires only about 3  min to sample a similar core (Table  1).|$|E
30|$|After {{reaching}} the desired coring depth, we disconnect the socket (Fig.  2 g) from the square {{end of the}} bit and attach {{the handle of the}} <b>increment</b> <b>borer.</b> After manually retrieving the sample core, we connect the smart <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> (Smartborer) again to the bit end. By simply reversing the rotation setting of the electric wrench, we can rotate the bit counter-clockwise and extract the bit out from the stem. We needed lower torque at bit extraction than insertion.|$|E
40|$|An <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> is {{the primary}} tool used to collect samples for dendrochronological analyses. These are {{precision}} instruments and users should be trained in their proper use, care, and maintenance. In this paper, I describe the various parts of an <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> and how to keep these in working condition. I provide details on how to sharpen an <b>increment</b> <b>borer,</b> properly core a tree, check for core compression ("jamming"), extract the core, and store the core for transport. I provide {{tips on how to}} clear a jammed borer and remove a borer stuck in a tree. An important topic concerns the effects of boring on trees. The majority of studies indicate that conifers are minimally affected by both fungal decay and discoloration, whereas certain hardwood species can sustain major internal damage. Plugging the holes created by coring is unnecessary...|$|E
30|$|The first {{important}} feature is power source. Gasoline engines, {{such as the}} one used for a chainsaw [12] or for an engine drill [5, 7], can produce large torque. However, gasoline engines are rather heavy (for example, Tanaka TED- 270 RS weighs 6.0  kg with a full tank) and it is physically challenging to support this weight throughout the entire coring process. A battery-powered wrench is lighter, but lacks sufficient torque for coring with the cutting <b>increment</b> <b>borer.</b> Furthermore, rotational speed of an electric wrench or engine drill (390 – 1600  rpm) is too fast for the cutting <b>increment</b> <b>borer.</b> These power sources, when used alone, may cause overheating of the cutting edges, resulting in burnt core surface [5].|$|E
30|$|For many {{researchers}} in wood and forest sciences, <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> is a preferred way of sampling {{because it can}} take wood core samples without killing the living tree. Manual increment borers have a tapered cutting thread at the tip, which draws the borer into the stem when rotated. They are {{the most commonly used}} tool to obtain core samples, typically from 4.35 to 12  mm in diameter [1]. The bit for sampling 12  mm cores has the outer diameter of 19  mm. Owing to high contact surface area and large friction forces with the wood, the <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> needs a high torque to penetrate the wood, especially when sampling 12  mm cores.|$|E
30|$|If {{the purpose}} of {{increment}} core sampling is to determine exact tree age, a sampled core should include the pith. For precise alignment of the coring direction, one can initially start an <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> manually with a borer starter until the coring direction is stabilized, then switch to mechanical boring.|$|E
40|$|Using an <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> {{to extract}} many cores can be tedious. The {{performance}} of cordless drills has improved greatly, making them an alternative for driving and removing increment bore bits. High torque cordless drills {{can reduce the}} time required to extract cores by a third and substantially reduce the effort required...|$|E
30|$|There is {{a socket}} (Fig.  2 g) {{that connects the}} output of the gearbox and the square end of an <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> bit (Fig.  2 h). This socket has two eyelets {{that can be used to}} thread a rope (φ 5 – 6  mm). All {{custom-made}} parts (Fig.  2 b–d, g) are made of stainless steel.|$|E
40|$|Dendrochronologists {{have used}} the {{presence}} of spiral grain {{as an indicator of}} old trees for most {{of the history of the}} field, although this relationship has been little studied. We examined cross-sections from dead trees and used a 12 -mm Haglof Swedish <b>Increment</b> <b>borer</b> to collect cores from living white oak (Quercus alba L.) trees in an Eastern Deciduous Forest stand in southwestern Illinois. Spiral grain is the alignment of wood fibers to the longitudinal axis of trees and is driven by patterns of initial cambial cell division. In this study, we examine environmental factors that may affect spiral grain severity, the usefulness of non-destructive sampling methods (using the 12 -mm <b>increment</b> <b>borer),</b> and the relationship between tree age and spiral grain. We tested Brazier’s method (1965) of averaging the spiral grain angle from two radii taken 180 degrees apart (i. e. one diameter in the tree) to get representative grain angles for the whole circumference of a tree at a certain height. The 12 -mm <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> did not produce consistent results in this study; therefore, the collection of cross-sections is advised for the study of spiral grain in white oaks. Brazier’s method should not be used in white oaks and should not be applied universally to all tree species. The severity of spiral grain is expressed in the xylem and may not be expressed in the bark of the tree. Left spiral grain does generally increase in white oaks with age, although this relationship is not always consistent, so a tree without severe spiral grain is not necessarily young...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{modification}} to {{a standard}} <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> handle is described that enhances use of the borer in situations where obstructions to the rotation of a normal handle prevents utilization of {{the full length of}} the borer. The modification, informally called the ‘‘Quad-B’’ (Brown’s bent boomerang borer handle), involves bending both sides of the handle to ~ 35 – 40 ° angles. Some potential uses of the modified handle are described...|$|E
30|$|Samples were {{collected}} from trees using an <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> that removed 5 mm diameter cores. The increment corer was surface sterilised in bleach and rinsed with commercially bottled water between every tree to avoid cross contamination. To sample pruned trees, the increment corer was inserted directly above a branch stub while unpruned trees were sampled {{as close to the}} whorl as possible. The same trees were sampled in 2006, 2007 and 2008.|$|E
30|$|Efflorescence {{samples were}} {{collected}} into plastic vials {{by means of a}} plastic scalpel from the ceiling and the wall of Aspaas House (denoted ASP 1 and ASP 2, respectively), and from Tronshart House. Besides, wood cores (10  cm length and 0.5  cm diameter) were collected from both intact and efflorescence-coated areas in the Aspaas House using an <b>increment</b> <b>borer.</b> If present, the efflorescence was removed from the surface before collecting the core.|$|E
30|$|We {{tested the}} Smartborer on large (DBH >  60  cm) Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara) and Japanese oak (Quercus crispula) to {{simulate}} dendrochronological sampling, and on small (DBH <  30  cm) Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi) and Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) to simulate sampling for wood quality research. We sampled over 200 each of 5 and 12  mm cores, to mid-diameter, by Smartborer. We used Haglof <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> bits of 5 and 12  mm with lengths of 45 – 80  cm.|$|E
30|$|For {{ponderosa pine}} trees from the Air Patrol, Brewer, and Early Bird fires in eastern Montana, cambium status was {{determined}} on 307 randomly selected trees (of 1748 total trees) by removing {{a sample of}} cambium at groundline from each quadrant using an <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> and then treating it with 1 % orthotolidine vital stain solution {{in the field to}} determine visually if the tissue was alive based on a color reaction (see Ryan 1982 for detailed methods).|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was done in}} order to determine the inserting direction of the <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> at breast height of stems by investigating eccentric growth of trees. The results of the research are follows: 1. Eccentric growth of the diameter at breast height; 1) The range and the mean of the eccentric growth percentage, which is expressed as the percentage of the difference between the maximum and the minimum diameter to the -maximum, are from 4 % to 16 %, and 7. 4 % respectively. 2) On individual tree, the eccentric growth of the diameter at breast height is mainly caused by the condition of branching and the inclination of the forest land. In the direction of the contour, the eccentric growth is not recognized. 3) As a whole, the percentage of the eccentric growth is found to be 2 % in the total value of samples. 4) There is no significant difference in diameter at various direction. 5) It is resumed that the measurement of the diameter at breast height may be pertinent at any direction from the result stated in the above 3) and 4). 2. Eccentric growth in the length from the pith to the cambium; 1) The eccentric growth percentage from the pith, which is expressed as the percentage of the difference between the maximum and the minimum radius excluding the thickness of the bark to the maximum, ranges from 10 % to 55 %, while the mean of samples is 28. 9 %. 2) On the individual tree, it is presumed that the eccentric growth occurs to the direction of the wind and the inclination of the forest land. 3) The eccentric growth percentage from the pith in total value of samples is 11 %. 4) From the analysis of variance, it is found the eccentric growth from the pith is not significantly affected by the direction. 5) Although the maximum value of the eccentric growth from the pith reaches 55 % with a extreme sample, the difference of the eccentric growth from the pith become smaller when may sample are averaged and the significant difference is not found. There is, therefore, no necessity to be particula. r about the inserting direction of the <b>increment</b> <b>borer.</b> 3. Core length; 1) The percentage of the difference between the maximum and the minimum core length to the maximum ranges from 13 % to 40 %, and the mean is 24. 4 %. 2) In regard to individual tree, the core length is longest in the west side of the tree and shortest in the direction of the descent. 3) The percentage of the difference between the maximum and the minimum core length to the maximum in the value of total samples is 3 %. 4) According to the result of the analysis of variance, there is no significant difference in the core length of respective directions. 5) Significant difference between the core length in recent five years and the true growth measured by a disk at breast height is not recognized in the respective directions. 6) It may be reasonable to think that there is no propare direction for the insertion of the <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> from the statement of the above 3), 4) and 5). 4. Diameter growth; 1) The percentage of the difference between the maximum and the minimum of the diameter growth to the maximum ranges from 5 % to 40 %, and the mean of samples is 22. 1 %. 2) In each sample tree, the maximum value of the diameter growth in recent five years is highest in frequency at the east side of the tree, but lowest in the direction with the longest branch. 3) As a whole, the percentage of the difference between the largest diameter growth and the smallest to the largest is about 4 %. 4) It is found that the diameter growth, which is measured by using the <b>increment</b> <b>borer,</b> is not significantly affected by the direction from the result of the analysis of variance. 5) It may be not necessary to be particular about the inserting direction in case of investigating the diameter growth with the <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> as mentioned in the 3) and 4). It may be concluded that it is not necessary to take the inserting direction in consideration when the <b>increment</b> <b>borer</b> is used for the measurement of the diameter growth...|$|E
30|$|The fourth {{important}} {{feature is the}} facility of starting and extracting an <b>increment</b> <b>borer.</b> Previous devices lack the means to start a borer bit or to extract a borer bit when it becomes lodged in the stem. The former situation arises especially when a physically small person is starting a 12  mm borer. The latter situation arises, for example, when the bit encounters a hollow pocket or decay in the stem wherein the threads of the bit are unable to engage. Since the 12  mm bits used to bore trees cost $ 1000 – 2000, there is an economic incentive to extract these bits when they become lodged.|$|E
