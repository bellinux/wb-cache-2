5|$|Because {{the trial}} judge had criticized the police investigation, Essex Police held an {{internal}} inquiry, conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Dickinson. Bamber alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been withheld by the police, so he made a <b>formal</b> <b>complaint,</b> which was investigated in 1991 by the City of London Police. This process uncovered more documentation, which Bamber used to petition the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994.|$|E

He played three frames of snooker against former world championship runner-up Rex Williams, winning all three. The charge of bringing the game into disrepute was subsequently dropped.|$|E

The Commission began an antitrust investigation in 2007 of Apple's business practices after the complaint was made, but ultimately the Commission probe found no agreements between Apple and major record labels on how iTunes is run in Europe, only that Apple had been paying higher wholesale prices to UK music labels and was passing the cost along to UK customers.|$|E

5|$|In early 1858, a {{group of}} peasants from Keserwan lodged a <b>formal</b> <b>complaint</b> against the Khazens to Khurshid Pasha, the Ottoman {{governor}} of Beirut. Later, in March 1858, the Khazens held a summit {{for the people of}} Keserwan to garner support for their nomination of a new qaimaqam. Instead, the peasants participating in the summit voiced their dissent against the Khazens and in October, several villages in Keserwan entered into an alliance against the Khazen sheikhs. Shahin was chosen by this alliance of peasants as their leader in December, and was declared the wakil awwal (first delegate).|$|E

The findings from this investigation stated that CF members handled the detainees appropriately, and were given medical treatment. However, the MPCC also found that the CF failed to conduct an investigation into how one of the detainees became injured, contrary to normal direction.|$|E
5|$|Exeter {{had been}} badly damaged {{in the battle}} with Admiral Graf Spee, and Dorsetshire escorted her back to Britain in January 1940, before {{returning}} to South American waters to search for German supply ships. On 11 February, her reconnaissance aircraft spotted the German supply freighter Wakama twelve {{miles off the coast}} of Brazil, which was promptly scuttled by her crew. Dorsetshire arrived on the scene shortly thereafter, picked up ten officers and thirty-five crewmen and sank Wakama to prevent her from being a navigational hazard. The following month, the President of Panama, Augusto Samuel Boyd, sent a <b>formal</b> <b>complaint</b> to the British government protesting against Dorsetshires violation of the Pan-American Security Zone in the Wakama incident.|$|E

5|$|For the 1981–82 season, Nea Salamina {{acquired}} foreign footballers for {{the first}} time, Bulgarians Nazca Michailiof and Stefan Pavlov. An unprecedented incident occurred during the 1982–83 season when, {{in a game against}} Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in GSZ Stadium, three Nea Salamina's players were expelled and the remaining players surrounded the linesman to protest. The linesman, claiming to have received blows, was transported to the hospital where radiographs failed to show injuries caused by the players. After the linesman made a <b>formal</b> <b>complaint,</b> a court imposed a sentence of 45 days. This was unprecedented for Cypriot football. The players remained in jail for five days and were released after public outcry, but then CFA authorities imposed crippling sanctions on them, ordering them to stay off the court for several months.|$|E
5|$|Penn's brother {{revealed}} {{two days}} after the bout that the Penn camp would be making a <b>formal</b> <b>complaint</b> to the NSAC. In addition, Penn's head coach, Rudy Valentino alleged that St-Pierre also had an illegal substance on his body during his April 2008 rematch with Matt Serra. NSAC Executive Director Keith Kizer confirmed that improprieties had occurred in St-Pierre's corner. He witnessed St-Pierre's cornerman Phil Nurse apply Vaseline to St-Pierre's face and then immediately rub St-Pierre's shoulders and back before Nurse wiped his hands. Kizer had St-Pierre's back wiped down after the second round, and confirmed after the third round that no Vaseline was being applied. Kizer was critical of the cornerman's action, but expressed doubts that the controversy would overturn St-Pierre's victory.|$|E
5|$|There were {{complaints}} that year from officials {{at all three}} of the mints concerning the quality of the coins produced. In the summer of 1874, coiner A. Loudon Snowden issued a <b>formal</b> <b>complaint</b> to Pollock {{about the quality of the}} strikings, most notably on the high points of the design; Barber began modifying the design later that year, reducing the relief. The modified dies began service in 1875. In the fall of that year, Linderman suggested that the reverse of the trade dollar should be altered in 1876 to commemorate the centennial of American independence; Pollock opposed the idea, noting that such a change would be difficult to carry out because Congressional approval would be necessary and that it might cause the coin to lose favor in the Orient. In May 1876, former assistant engraver Anthony C. Paquet created a reverse die after being hired by Linderman to improve the striking quality of the coins. Linderman approved of the new design, but it was ultimately rejected by Mint officials due to fears of Chinese disapproval.|$|E

5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a <b>formal</b> <b>complaint</b> with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
5|$|Motte v Faulkner (decided 28 November 1735) was a {{copyright}} lawsuit between Benjamin Motte and George Faulkner over {{who had the}} legal rights to publish the works of Jonathan Swift in London. This trial {{was one of the}} first to test the Statute of Anne copyright law in regards to Irish publishing independence. Although neither held the copyright to all of Swift's works, the suit became a legal struggle over Irish rights, which were eventually denied by the English courts. Faulkner, in 1735, published the Works of Jonathan Swift in Dublin. However, a few of the works were under Motte's copyright within the Kingdom of Great Britain, and when Faulkner sought to sell his book in London, Motte issued a <b>formal</b> <b>complaint</b> to Jonathan Swift and then proceeded to sue Faulkner. An injunction was issued in Motte's favor, and the book was prohibited from being sold on British soil. The basis of the law protected the rights of the author, and not the publisher, of the works, and Swift was unwilling to support a lawsuit against Faulkner. With Swift's reaction used as a basis, the lawsuit was later seen as a struggle between the rights of Irishmen to print material that were denied under English law.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season O'Neill was Australia's leading batsman {{during the}} 1959–60 tour to Pakistan and India, {{where he was}} a part of the last Australian team to win a Test on Pakistani soil for 39 years. After a quiet match in the First Test eight-wicket win in Dacca in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), in which he scored two and 26 not out, O'Neill played a key role in the victory in the Second Test in Lahore that was to Australia's last in Pakistan until 1998. O'Neill made his maiden Test century of 134 in the first innings to give Australia a 245-run lead. He then took his maiden Test wicket in Pakistan's second innings, that of Shujauddin. This left Australia chasing a target of 122 in the last two hours on the final day. The chase was on schedule with O'Neill partnering Neil Harvey when the Pakistanis began wasting time to prevent an Australian victory. This was implemented by swapping fielders very slowly when the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single, and overs began taking seven minutes instead of three. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away when a ball was aimed at the stumps and threw away his wicket by letting himself be bowled for 37. This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give no opportunity to waste time by switching the field. Benaud then threatened Pakistani captain Imtiaz Ahmed with a <b>formal</b> <b>complaint</b> over the time-wasting, and proceesings returned to their normal pace. Australia made the target with a few minutes to spare, with O'Neill on 43. O'Neill failed to make double figures in the final Test, which was drawn, but ended the series with 218 runs at 72.66. In another tour match, against the President's XI, O'Neill scored an unbeaten 52 in a low-scoring match as Australia stumbled to their target of 116 with only three wickets in hand.|$|E
