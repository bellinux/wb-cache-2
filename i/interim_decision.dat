40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} fixed samples size, {{sequential}} and adaptive survival trials {{and consists of}} two major parts. In the first part fixed sample size, sequential and adaptive testing methods are derived that utilize data from a survival {{as well as a}} categorical surrogate endpoint in a fully non-parametric way without the need to assume any type of proportional hazards. In the second part extensions to quality-adjusted survival endpoints are discussed. In existing adaptive methods for confirmatory survival trials with flexible adaptation rules strict type-I-error control is only ensured if the <b>interim</b> <b>decisions</b> are based solely on the primary endpoint. In trials with long-term follow-up it is often desirable to base <b>interim</b> <b>decisions</b> also on correlated short-term endpoints, such as a surrogate marker. Surrogate information available at the interim analysis may be used to predict future event times. If <b>interim</b> <b>decisions,</b> such as selection of a subgroup or changes to the recruitment process, depend on this information, control of the type-I-error is no longer formally guaranteed for methods assuming an independent increments structure. In this thesis the weighted Kaplan-Meier estimator, a modification of the classical Kaplan-Meier estimator incorporating discrete surrogate information, is used to construct a non-parametric test statistic for the comparison of survival distributions, a generalization of the average hazard ratio. It is shown in this thesis how this test statistic can be used in fixed design, group-sequential and adaptive trials, such that the type-I-error is controlled. Asymptotic normality of the multivariate average hazard ratio is first verified in the fixed sample size context and then applied to noninferiority testing in a three-arm trial with non-proportional hazards survival data. In the next step the independent increments property is shown to hold asymptotically for the weighted Kaplan-Meier estimator. Consequently, for all test statistics based on it. Standard methods for the calculation of group-sequential rejection boundaries are applicable. For adaptive designs the weighted Kaplan-Meier estimator is modified to support stage-wise left-truncated and right-censored data to ensure independence of the stage-wise test statistics, even when <b>interim</b> <b>decisions</b> are based on surrogate information. Standard combination test methodology can then be used to ensure strict type-I-error control. Quality-adjusted survival is an integrated measure of quality-of-life data, which has gained interest in recent years. In this thesis a novel non-parametric two-sample test for quality-adjusted survival distributions is developed, that allows adjustment for covariate-dependent censoring, whereby the censoring is assumed to follow a proportional hazards model. It is shown how this result can be used to design adaptive trials with a quality-adjusted survival endpoint...|$|R

I. INTRODUCTION Parallel concatenated convolutional (turbo) codes and iterative decoding achieve error performances close to Shannon limit [1]. The principle of the iterative decoding is that the component decoders exchange their outputs of the likelihood values each other, and update them though the iterative procedures. In the conventional decoding algorithms, only the likelihood values for systematic parts are treated to be updated [1, 2]. Here we propose novel decoding algorithms which update both likelihood and channel values based on the <b>interim</b> hard <b>decision</b> results i [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{ethical and}} {{logistical}} concerns {{it is common}} for data monitoring committees to periodically monitor accruing clinical trial data to assess the safety, and possibly efficacy, of a new experimental treatment. When formalized, monitoring is typically implemented using group sequential methods. In some cases regulatory agencies have required that primary trial analyses should be based solely on the judgment of an independent review committee (IRC). The IRC assessments can produce difficulties for trial monitoring given the time lag typically associated with receiving assessments from the IRC. This results in a missing data problem wherein a surrogate measure of response may provide useful information for <b>interim</b> <b>decisions</b> and future monitoring strategies. In this paper, we present statistical tools that are helpful for monitoring a group sequential clinical trial with missing IRC data. We illustrate the proposed methodology in the case of binary endpoints under various missingness mechanisms including missing completely at random assessments and when missingness depends on the IRCâs measurement. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sequential {{monitoring}} {{in clinical}} trials is often employed to allow for early stopping and other <b>interim</b> <b>decisions,</b> while maintaining the type I error rate. However, sequential monitoring is typically described only {{in the context of}} a population model. We describe a computational method to implement sequential monitoring in a randomization-based context. In particular, we discuss a new technique for the computation of approximate conditional tests following restricted randomization procedures and then apply this technique to approximate the joint distribution of sequentially computed conditional randomization tests. We also describe the computation of a randomization-based analog of the information fraction. We apply these techniques to a restricted randomization procedure, Efron's [Biometrika 58 (1971) 403 [...] 417] biased coin design. These techniques require derivation of certain conditional probabilities and conditional covariances of the randomization procedure. We employ combinatoric techniques to derive these for the biased coin design. Comment: Published in at [URL] the Annals of Statistics ([URL] by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics ([URL]...|$|R

More thought during the planning phase needs to be given to multiplicity adjustments for secondary endpoints given these are increasing in importance in differentiating products in the market place.
