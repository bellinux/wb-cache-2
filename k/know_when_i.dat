There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [...] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them and talk to them on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.|$|E

Jones auditioned without knowing what X-Men character he was up for, saying he auditioned because it was a superhero that fit his biotype: [...] "I've got red hair and freckles, I'm not gonna be Batman, Robin or Spider-Man". The actor also stated that the script defined the character more than the comics, as Banshee went through various reinventions in print. Given Banshee gets involved with MacTaggert in the comics, Jones also tried to [...] "look at her just a little bit differently, you <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can." [...] As Jones suffers from acrophobia, using the rig that was to depict Banshee's flight required much preparation time with the stunt team.|$|E
500|$|Forty-five drivers {{attempted}} to qualify; due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Keselowski clinched his first pole {{position in the}} Sprint Cup Series, {{with a time of}} 28.515. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Bowyer. Stewart qualified third, Jamie McMurray took fourth, and Juan Pablo Montoya started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twenty-fifth, while Harvick was scored in twenty-seventh. The two drivers who failed to qualify for the race were Jeff Green and Johnny Sauter. Once qualifying concluded Keselowski said, [...] "I felt I got a shot at the pole before I qualified but you never really <b>know.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> ran the lap I knew I gave up {{a little bit of time}} right in the middle of both corners but I had a plan going into it and stuck to it and it worked.

500|$|Similar {{to other}} artists that the {{director}} have worked with, Rolston usually brought his team of professionals along to the shooting, including make-up artist, wardrobe-hair stylist, dancers and choreographer. However, Rolston and his team turned out to cause a few creative conflicts with the group during production. One of them came from the original routine conducted by Watkins, {{the person who was}} in fact choreographed most of the group's early videos. She remembered Rolston's camp's choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. [...] "locked" [...] the girls out from providing ideas as they were practicing the new dance moves. The trio eventually dropped his choreograph because they thought his version wasn't their [...] "style of dancing." [...] But still, two of his moves were adapted in the final clip. [...] "To me, I didn't even think about, 'Well, can I really choreograph?' I was just like, 'Let me do my thing.' I just like to dance and I <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> like what I see. I like different kinds of stuff," [...] Watkins shared. The [...] "bend-down-and-jump-up" [...] dance that appears in the video was made up by Watkins to [...] "Foe Life", a song of Mack 10, the rapper whom she later married from 2000 to 2004.|$|E
500|$|Vocally, Benson {{performs}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] using a whispered, [...] "intense" [...] {{singing voice}} {{as opposed to}} belting, although her performance has also been described as [...] "bigger-than-yourself". Spanning exactly one octave from C4 to C5, the song's limited vocal range allows Benson to effortlessly transition from her speaking to her singing voice, raising and lowering her volume throughout {{in a manner that}} resembles normal speech. In addition to singing using [...] "a light, speech-driven ‘mix’", the singer also incorporates [...] "quirky little comments and girly gestures". According to Screen Rant's Turner Minton, Benson's vocals [...] " [...] a rawness to the song, giving a depth of eagerness to Ariel’s voice that makes for a genuine performance", by delivering a vocal track that is a combination of passion, strength, sincerity, angst, emotion and innocence. Described as [...] "wistful pleas", Bustles Emma Lord observed that Benson sings the song using a combination of [...] "tomboyish-ness and yearning". Meanwhile, the final line of the song's reprise is sung with [...] "a bit more oomph" [...] than the original, declaring [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>when,</b> <b>I</b> don't know how/But I know something's starting right now". Musical similarities have been drawn between [...] "Part of Your World" [...] and [...] "Somewhere That's Green" [...] from Ashman and Menken's musical Little Shop of Horrors, specifically {{the way in which the}} lines [...] "part of your world" [...] and [...] "somewhere that’s green" [...] are sung. The song has also been compared to Judy Garland's song [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] due to their shared themes about [...] "wish for something new and different." [...] Meanwhile, Variety observed similarities between the ballad and some selections from the stage musical Les Misérables (1980).|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E minor, with Scherzinger's vocal range spanning from low-note of E3 to the high-note of G5. Lyrically, the song is centered around {{the desire to be}} famous when one grows up. Using satirical and autobiographical lines, Scherzinger begins the song's first verse with: [...] "Now I've got a confession / When I was young I wanted attention". The [...] "repetitive and catchy chorus" [...] follows, where she sings the lines: [...] "When I grow up / I wanna be famous / I wanna be a star / I wanna be in movies". MTV News commented that the song contains a theme that is [...] "getting plenty of traction these days – beware the high cost of fame." [...] Meanwhile, group member Melody Thornton said of the song's concept: [...] "If you strive for higher and bigger things – along with that – comes hard work and dealing with a lot of stuff that you'd never assume you'd have to. So yeah, while the song is meant to be playful, it still does have that little warning twist to it". Bill Lamb from About.com named [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] a possible answer song to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls" [...] (2006). Music critics were initially confused by the line [...] "I wanna have groupies" [...] in the chorus; mistaking the line as saying [...] "I wanna have boobies". American comedian Ellen DeGeneres also pointed this out when they performed the song on her talk show on September 23, 2008. Nicole Scherzinger said that [...] "All of us started with a dream...I <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was young, and I would sign people's notebooks, I wrote, 'Remember me when I'm famous,' and I don't know of a little kid who hasn't aspired to be someone" ...|$|E

500|$|Clements and Musker {{enjoyed the}} song but would {{sometimes}} disagree with Ashman over its lyrics, which Ashman had insisted be very specific. Musker specifically {{wanted to change}} the line [...] "I wanna be where the people are" [...] because he felt that it sounded too political and reminded him of Governor of Illinois Dan Walker, suggesting that [...] "the" [...] be removed. Appalled by this suggestion, Ashman insisted that the line remain unchanged to prevent the word [...] "where" [...] from having to be held longer; Musker would eventually admit that his suggestion was [...] "idiotic". Although Ashman was very defensive about the song and typically dismissed most of the directors' suggestions, he agreed to revise lyrics that originally described the contents of Ariel's grotto using eloquent terms such as [...] "fine china" [...] and [...] "books bound in leather and gold", {{and replaced them with}} words that would be more familiar to a mermaid who learns about humans from an uneducated seagull named Scuttle. Ashman's revisions integrated funnier lyrics such as [...] "thingamabobs” and “whozits and whatzits" [...] into the song, making [...] "Part of Your World" [...] more consistent with the film's lighthearted tone. Ashman initially pitched Ariel's reprise of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a sad lament in which the character sings [...] "I’ll never be…part of that world". Clements and Musker argued that the reprise should instead convey Ariel's determined nature as she decides to pursue her dream of becoming part of Eric's world. Howard agreed to rewrite the reprise into a more positive anthem that ultimately reads [...] "I don’t <b>know</b> <b>when,</b> <b>I</b> don’t know how, but I know something’s starting right now…Watch and you’ll see…someday I’ll be…part of your world", providing the film with more momentum while establishing further conflict between Ariel and her father King Triton. Ashman's willingness to rewrite both versions of the song's lyrics pleasantly surprised the directors.|$|E

The Eleventh Doctor's dismissal of the Tenth Doctor and War Doctor as [...] "Sandshoes and Grandad" [...] to mock their respective footwear and age echo the First Doctor's description of his two successors in The Three Doctors as [...] "a dandy and a clown". (The War Doctor's initial incredulous reaction upon seeing his future selves also reflects this moment.) Likewise, a Time Lord says, [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was well-off. All twelve of them." [...] which recalls the Brigadier's line from The Three Doctors: [...] "Three of them, eh? I didn't <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was well off." [...] More of the Brigadier's dialogue from the latter serial is alluded to when Kate asks for an incident report code-named [...] "Cromer"; in the earlier story, upon being transported to another universe, the Brigadier initially believes himself to be near the coastal Norfolk town. A line from the First Doctor from The Five Doctors is also reused near the end as the Tenth Doctor tells the Eleventh, [...] "It's good to know my future is in safe hands" [...] (which the First told the Fifth in the earlier story, appended by [...] "after all"). When the War Doctor appears, Clara remarks, [...] "I think there's three of them," [...] to which Kate responds, [...] "There's a precedent for that," [...] in reference to The Three Doctors.|$|E

2500|$|As the PBS series Frontline explored, MTV was {{a driving}} force that catapulted music videos to a {{mainstream}} audience, turning music videos into an art form {{as well as a}} marketing machine that became beneficial to artists. Danny Goldberg, chairman and CEO of Artemis Records, said the following about the art of music videos: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> worked with Nirvana, Kurt Cobain cared as much about the videos as he did about the records. He wrote the scripts for them, he was in the editing room, and they were part of his art. And I think they stand up as part of his art, and I think that's true of the great artists today. Not every artist is a great artist and not every video is a good video, but in general having it available as a tool, to me, adds to the business. And I wish there had been music videos in the heyday of The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. I think they would've added to their creative contribution, not subtracted from it." ...|$|E
