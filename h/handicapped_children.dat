It was further hypothesized that the variables of mother 2 ̆ 7 s age at the birth of the <b>handicapped</b> <b>child,</b> education, and rigidity, child 2 ̆ 7 s birth order and the husband 2 ̆ 7 s occupation would be unrelated to the mother 2 ̆ 7 s reaction to her child. The population consisted of 18 mothers of deaf children and 17 mothers of children with visible physical handicaps.

25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been three major {{policies}} addressing special education in the United States. These policies were the Education for All <b>Handicapped</b> <b>Children</b> Act in 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1997, and the No Child Left Behind in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for special education teachers, and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff. For one to be a Certified Autism Specialist, one must have a master's degree, two years of career experience working with the autism population, earn 14 continuing education hours in autism every two years, and register with the International Institute of Education.

40|$|Which {{strategy}} is least expensive {{to prevent the}} birth of a <b>handicapped</b> <b>child</b> in couples with recurrent miscarriage (RM); parental chromosome analysis followed by amniocentesis in case of carrier status of one of the parents, or amniocentesis in all ongoing pregnancies without the knowledge of parental carrier status? For virtually all couples with RM amniocentesis in all ongoing pregnancies without the knowledge of parental carrier status is less expensive in preventing {{the birth of a}} <b>handicapped</b> <b>child</b> than parental chromosome analysis followed by amniocentesis in case of carrier status of one of the parents. One of the causes of RM is a balanced chromosome abnormality in one of the partners. If one of the partners is carrier of a balanced structural chromosomal abnormality, the risk of offspring with an unbalanced structural chromosome abnormality is increased. Like all couples, couples with RM also have an age-dependent risk for fetal aneuploidy, of which trisomy 21 is most common. Model-based economic analysis to compare costs and effects of two strategies in couples with RM to prevent the birth of a <b>handicapped</b> <b>child</b> in case of ongoing pregnancy. Comparison of two strategies in women with RM: strategy (I) parental chromosome analysis followed by amniocentesis in pregnancy in case of carrier status of one of the parents and strategy (II) amniocentesis in all ongoing pregnancies without the knowledge of carrier status. No testing was the reference strategy. Data on probabilities and costs were derived from the literature. Incremental costs and effects were calculated [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ]. Effectiveness was expressed as the number of prevented births of <b>handicapped</b> <b>child</b> equivalents compared with no testing. In these calculations, the birth of a <b>handicapped</b> <b>child</b> was valued 10 times worse than the loss of a viable pregnancy due to amniocentesis. Depending on the risk for carrier status, the ICER for Strategy I (parental chromosome analysis followed by amniocentesis in case of carrier status of one of the parents) varied between € 226, 000 and € 6, 556, 000 per prevented <b>handicapped</b> <b>child</b> equivalent. For Strategy II (amniocentesis in all ongoing pregnancies without the knowledge of carrier status), the ICER varied between € 2000 and € 233 000 per prevented <b>handicapped</b> <b>child</b> equivalent. Strategy I was less expensive than Strategy II only for a small subgroup of couples with maternal age < 23 years, three or more previous miscarriages and a family history of RM. Our analysis is not a plea for amniocentesis in all women with RM. Individual risk assessment with serum markers and nuchal translucency is probably more effective at lower cost. This analysis can be used by clinicians to explain the chances of adverse pregnancy outcome in couples with RM, as well as by policy makers in health-care economics. Future guidelines on RM might be more restrictive {{from the perspective of the}} limited health-care resources that we have availabl...|$|R
