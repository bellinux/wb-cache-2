25|$|When eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} {{is related}} to an illness such as cancer or parasitic infection, treatment of the underlying cause is effective in resolving the lung disease. When due to AEP or CEP, however, treatment with corticosteroids results in a rapid, dramatic resolution of symptoms {{over the course of}} one or two days. Either intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone are most commonly used. In AEP, treatment is usually continued for a month after symptoms disappear and the x-ray returns to normal (usually four weeks total). In CEP, treatment is usually continued for three months after symptoms disappear and the x-ray returns to normal (usually four months total). <b>Inhaled</b> <b>steroids</b> such as fluticasone have been used effectively when discontinuation of oral prednisone has resulted in relapse.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} infections {{of the mouth}} {{include the use of}} {{chlorhexidine}} mouth wash in those with poor immune function and washing out the mouth following the use of <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroids.</b> Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk, antifungal medications may be used preventatively.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if suboptimal use of <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid</b> and over-reliance on bronchodilator medication to control asthma symptoms is associated with higher risk of acute asthma episodes. Details of repeat prescriptions for medication and use of health services over 12 months were collected for 754 adult outpatients with asthma; all were prescribed inhaled corticosteroid. Patients who requested less than five prescriptions per year were considered suboptimal users. Patients who requested seven or more bronchodilator prescriptions and less than five <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid</b> prescriptions had significantly more family physician consultations for asthma episodes (p < 0. 05), more hospital admissions (p < 0. 05), and more disturbed nights in the week before hospital or family physician review (p < 0. 05). Some patients with more severe asthma put themselves at risk by relying on bronchodilator medication rather than regular <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid</b> for asthma control.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} adding salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily for six months to current treatment in subjects with asthma who control their inhaled corticosteroid dose according to a management plan. DESIGN: A double blind, randomised crossover study. SETTING: Nottingham. SUBJECTS: 101 subjects with mild or moderate asthma taking at least 200 micrograms twice daily of beclomethasone dipropionate or budesonide. INTERVENTIONS: Salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily and placebo for six months each, with a one month washout. Subjects adjusted <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid</b> dose according to guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reduction in <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid</b> use, exacerbations of asthma, and use of oral steroids. RESULTS: Data were available for 87 subjects. When compared with placebo salmeterol treatment was associated with a 17 % reduction in <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid</b> use (95 % confidence interval 12 % to 22 %) with {{no significant difference in the}} number of subjects who had an exacerbation (placebo 25 %, salmeterol 16 %) or use of oral steroids. For secondary end points salmeterol treatment was associated with higher morning and evening peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in one second; a reduction in symptoms, bronchodilator use and airway responsiveness to methacholine; and no effect on serum potassium concentration, 24 hour heart rate, or the final forced expiratory volume in one second achieved during a salbutamol dose-response study. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects who adjusted their <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid</b> treatment according to guidelines the addition of salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily was associated with a reduction in <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid</b> use and improved lung function and symptom control...|$|R

5000|$|Inhaled {{corticosteroids}} (e.g., {{for treatment}} of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), are {{not intended to be}} administered topically in the mouth, but inevitably there is contact with the oral and oropharyngeal mucousa as it is inhaled. In asthmatics treated with <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroids,</b> clinically detectable oral candidiasis may occur in about 5-10% of adults and 1% of children. Where <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroids</b> are the cause, the candidal lesions are usually of the erythematous variety. Candidiasis appears at the sites where the steroid has contacted the mucosa, typically the dorsum of the tongue (median rhomboid glossitis) and sometimes also on the palate. Candidal lesions on both sites are sometimes termed [...] "kissing lesions" [...] because they approximate when the tongue is in contact with the palate.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundTwo major acute-phase {{proteins}} {{were identified}} in human, C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A. There are 3 types of C-reactive protein assays: conventional C-reactive protein, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and cardiac C-reactive protein. High sensitivity C-reactive protein assays can detect minor inflammatory changes that could be missed by other indices of inflammation. Induced sputum cell counts are relatively non-invasive, safe and reliable method for identifying the presence and type of airway inflammation in asthmatic patients. Purpose of the workThis {{study was designed to}} detect the role of serum levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein in asthmatic patients with or without inhaled corticosteroids treatment. Also to determine the relationship of serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels to clinical indices of asthma and inflammatory cell counts in induced sputum. Subjects & MethodsSerum high sensitivity C-reactive protein level, pulmonary function tests, body mass index and induced sputum cell counts were estimated in 50 asthmatic patients (26 <b>steroid</b> <b>inhaled</b> and 24 <b>steroid</b> naïve). Fifteen healthy volunteers, who matched in age and sex with the other groups, were used as a control group. ResultsThere was an increase of high sensitivity C-reactive protein in asthmatic patients among both <b>steroid</b> <b>inhaled</b> and <b>steroid</b> naïve patients compared to the healthy controls. Serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein correlated negatively with pulmonary function tests and positively with sputum eosinophil % in both <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid</b> and steroid naïve groups.

40|$|Nine of 14 {{asthmatic}} {{patients who}} presented with persistent dysphonia while taking inhaled corticosteroids had a bilateral adductor vocal cord deformity with bowing of the cords on phonation.

40|$|In {{this second}} {{in a series of}} three interviews, Sir David Jack talks of the period from 1961 to 1973 when he was {{research}} director of Allen & Hanburys Ltd, Ware, a division of Glaxo. He discusses the discovery of salbutamol, a bronchodilator with selective ß-adrenergic activity used to treat asthma. Salbutamol, which was marketed as Ventolin, was the second major drug for Glaxo, the first being betamethasone valerate (Betnovate), a topical anti-inflammatory steroid. Sir David talks of how the income from salbutamol enabled research to be expanded at Ware, and he refers to 1972 as the annus mirabilis for Glaxo, when a second major asthma drug, beclomethasone dipropionate (Becotide), an <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid,</b> went on the market. 1972 was also the year in which work began on ranitidine (Zantac) for the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers, and the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) programme was started. During his time as research director of the highly successful Ware group, several major drugs were developed, and in the interview Sir David comments on the remarkably short development times for the group's products. In the following section of the interview, there is discussion of how the combination of a bronchodilator (Ventolin) and <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid</b> (Becotide), pioneered by the Ware group, changed the treatment of asthma, and Sir David acknowledges Wilfred Simpson, the medical director of Allen and Hanburys, as the person who proposed the use of <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroid.</b> The interview then moves to an account of the discovery of ranitidine following an investigation of histamine blockers, an opportunistic line of research suggested to Sir David after attending a lecture by the pharmacologist, James Black (later Sir James), who proved that histamine is a physiological mediator of acid secretion. (Ranitidine became the world's largest selling pharmaceutical product.) There is a final reflection on recent mergers of pharmaceutical companies in the UK...|$|R
50|$|Asthma is {{a common}} cause of chronic cough in adults and children. Coughing {{may be the only}} symptom the person has from their asthma, or asthma {{symptoms}} may also include wheezing, shortness of breath, and a tight feeling in their chest. Depending on how severe the asthma is, it can be treated with bronchodilators (medicine which causes the airways to open up) or <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroids.</b> Treatment of the asthma should make the cough go away.|$|E
50|$|If {{candidiasis}} {{is secondary}} to corticosteroid or antibiotic use, {{this may be}} stopped, although often {{this is not a}} feasible option depending on the initial reason the drug was prescribed. In individuals who have developed candidiasis secondary to the use of <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroids,</b> rinsing out the mouth with water after taking the steroid. Use of a spacer device to reduce the contact with the oral mucosa may greatly reduce the risk of oral candidiasis.|$|E
50|$|When {{combined}} with <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroids,</b> β adrenoceptor agonists can improve symptoms. In children this benefit is uncertain {{and they may}} be potentially harmful. They should not be used without an accompanying steroid due to an increased risk of severe symptoms, including exacerbation in both children and adults. At least with formoterol, an increased risk appears to be present even when steroids are used and this risk has not been ruled out for salmeterol.|$|E

Design: 150 asthma patients with symptoms and prn use of short-acting bronchodilator {{at least once a week}} were randomised to 24 weeks’ treatment with either S/FP 50 / 100 μgbd (n= 78) or FP 100 μgbd (n= 72). The primary endpoint was the percentage of symptom-free ‘day+night's. Results: The percentage of symptom-free ‘day+night's increased significantly more for S/FP (20 to 64 %) compared to FP (24 to 51 %). The treatment difference was 15. 3 %, P= 0. 008. In the sub-group of patients with mild asthma the treatment difference was also statistically significant in favour of S/FP (P= 0. 0245, n= 74). S/FP was also significantly superior to FP alone for: lung function, salbutamol use prn, day symptom score, symptom-free days, and episode-free ‘day+night's. Treatments were equally well tolerated.

50|$|While {{the use of}} inhaled LABAs {{are still}} {{recommended}} in asthma guidelines for the resulting improved symptom control, further concerns have been raised, by a large meta-analysis of the pooled results from 19 trials with 33,826 participants, that salmeterol may increase the small risks of asthma deaths, and this additional risk is not reduced with the additional use of <b>inhaled</b> <b>steroids</b> (e.g., as with the combination product fluticasone/salmeterol).This seems to occur because although LABAs relieve asthma symptoms, they also promote bronchial inflammation and sensitivity without warning.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cough {{may be the}} {{consequence}} of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and inflammation.

In a community-based primary healthcare centre, 135 previously healthy adults suffering from cough for o 2 weeks were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of inhaled FP 500 mg b. i. d. for 2 weeks. Participants completed daily diary cards of lower respiratory tract symptoms. The primary outcome measure was the decrease in mean total daily cough score (0 – 6) during the second week of treatment. In the FP group, the cough score decreased from 3. 8 at baseline to mean¡SEM 1. 4 ¡ 0. 2 during the second week. In the placebo group, this decrease was from 3. 8 to 1. 9 ¡ 0. 1 and was statistically significantly less. A favourable effect of FP was only detectable in nonsmokers, in whom the score was 0. 9 points lower compared with placebo. The clinical relevance of this finding has to be established further. Allergy, FEV 1 and BHR at baseline did not affect the efficacy of FP.
