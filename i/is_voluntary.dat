5|$|The Troy Cemetery Association {{was formed}} on September 9, 1848; John Paine, D. Thomas Vail, Isaac McConihe, George M. Tibbits, John B. Gale, and Stephen E. Warren were elected its trustees. It {{was the first}} rural {{cemetery}} association incorporated under an 1847 law authorizing the incorporation of such associations. The trustees appointed a committee to report on an eligible location for a cemetery and on September 5, 1849, the first parcel of land was purchased. On October 16, 1850, {{the land of the}} cemetery was consecrated and Oakwood became the fourth rural cemetery founded in New York. The Association is made up of lot owners who are elected by fellow lot owners; the position <b>is</b> <b>voluntary</b> and receives no pay.|$|E
5|$|The {{main purpose}} for kulintang {{music in the}} {{community}} is to function as social entertainment at a nonprofessional, folk level. This music is unique {{in that it is}} considered a public music in the sense everyone is allowed to participate. Not only do the players play, but audience members are also expected to participate. These performances are important in that they bring people in the community and adjacent regions together, helping unify communities that otherwise may not have interacted with one another. Traditionally, when performers play kulintang music, their participation <b>is</b> <b>voluntary.</b> Musicians see performances as an opportunity to receive recognition, prestige and respect from the community and nothing more.|$|E

5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith <b>is</b> <b>voluntary,</b> and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on {{the knowledge of the}} truth of the Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular and reserve armies, all former Regular Army personnel (known as the Regular Reserve) may be recalled for duty as needed. The Regular Reserve has two categories: A and D. Category A is mandatory, with {{the length of time}} in the category dependent on time spent in Regular Army service. Category D <b>is</b> <b>voluntary,</b> and consists of personnel who are no longer required to serve in category A. Regular Reserves in both categories serve under a fixed-term reserve contract and may report for training or service overseas and at home, similar to the Army Reserve. In 2007, there were 121,800 Regular Reserves, of which 33,760 served in categories A and D. Beginning in April 2013, the full Regular Reserve strength was no longer reported—only those serving in categories A and D (30,000 in 2015).|$|E
5|$|The U.S. also {{increased}} the installation {{and use of}} full-body scanners in many of its major airports {{as a result of}} the attack. The scanners are designed to be able to detect bombs under clothing, and 11 airports, including O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, began to receive the machines in March 2010. The TSA said that it had plans to have 1,000 of the machines in airports by the end of 2011. Before, the U.S. had only 40 scanners across 19 airports. The government also said that it planned to buy 300 additional scanners in 2010 and another 500 in the following fiscal year, starting October 2010. It costs around an estimated $530 million to purchase the 500 machines and hire over 5,300 workers to operate them. However, the U.S. government has stated that being scanned <b>is</b> <b>voluntary</b> and that passengers who object to the process could choose to undergo a pat-down search or be searched with hand-held detectors. Under new rules prompted by the incident, airline passengers traveling to the U.S. from 14 nations would undergo extra screening: Afghanistan, Algeria, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The inclusion of non-Muslim Cuba on the list was criticized.|$|E
