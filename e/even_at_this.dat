5|$|In 1927 the {{gendarmerie}} {{was reporting}} a strength of 160 officers, 2,522 gendarmes and 551 rural policemen. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> late date only about 40 {{of the officers}} were Haitian, the majority being United States Marines and sailors.|$|E
5|$|In 1730, Vaccarini {{arrived in}} Catania as the {{appointed}} city architect and immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman Baroque style. The pilasters lose their rustication and support Roman type cornices and entablatures, or curved pediments, and free-standing columns support balconies. Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature {{rather than a}} general building material, using it intermittently with other materials, and spectacularly for an obelisk supported {{on the back of}} the Catanian heraldic elephant, for a fountain in the style of Bernini in front of the new Town hall. Vaccarini's principal fa√ßade to Catania's cathedral, dedicated to Santa Agata, shows strong Spanish influences <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> late stage of Sicilian Baroque. Also in the city is Stefano Ittar's Church of the Collegiata, built around 1768. It is an example of Sicilian Baroque at its most stylistically simple.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, a study {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Hawker Siddeley and Bristol for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept, which developed as the HSA.1000 and Bristol 198. Armstrong Whitworth also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached Lockheed, and after the creation of British Aircraft Corporation in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with Boeing, General Dynamics, Douglas Aircraft and Sud Aviation.|$|E

5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, but <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque {{style in}} Sicily was largely {{confined}} to buildings erected by the church, and palazzi built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy. The earliest {{examples of this}} style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, Florence, and Naples. However, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By {{the middle of the}} 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably {{different from that of the}} mainland, it typically included at least two or three of the following features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterise in words.|$|E
5|$|The laws made {{separate}} {{provision for}} Ine's English and British subjects and were neither oppressive to the British nor completely even-handed. The evidence they {{provide for the}} incomplete integration of the two populations is supported by research into placename history, the history of religious houses, and local archaeology, which indicates that {{the western part of}} Wessex was thinly settled by the Germanic newcomers at the time the laws were issued. It is notable that, although issued by the Saxon king of a Saxon kingdom, the term used in the laws to define Ine's Germanic subjects is Englisc. This reflects the existence, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> early date, of a common English identity encompassing all the Germanic peoples of Britain.|$|E

5|$|Three more eggs {{containing}} embryos {{from the}} same formation were described in 2016 by Wang et al. Though they noted that these eggs strongly resemble M. yaotunensis, they declined to refer them to any ootaxon lower than Elongatoolithidae because Macroolithus is not clearly defined and {{is in need of}} revision. The embryos within these eggs {{are some of the most}} well-preserved of any oviraptorids, providing new information on oviraptorid ontogeny. The specimens show a relatively shallow head which indicates that as oviraptorids matured, their skulls grew dorsoventrally (top-to-bottom) faster than anteroposteriorly (front-to-back). This growth pattern is unusual among theropods, but is also seen in derived ("advanced") tyrannosaurids. Also unusual is that, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> early stage of development, the nasal bones are fused. Coincidentally, tyrannosaurids also show fusion of the nasals early in development.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 1603 recorded that Upnor Castle had 20 guns of various calibres, plus another 11 guns split between two sconces or outworks, known as Bay and Warham Sconces. The castle's armament {{consisted of a}} demi-cannon, 7 culverin, 5 demi-culverin, a minion, a falconet, a saker, and four fowlers with two chambers each. Bay Sconce was armed with 4 demi-culverin, while Warham Sconce had 2 culverin and 5 demi-culverin. Eighteen guns were recorded as being mounted in the castle twenty years later. The garrison's armament included 34 longbows, an indication that archery was still of military value <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> late date. By this time, however, the castle {{was in a state}} of disrepair. The drawbridge and its raising mechanism were broken, the gun platforms needed repairs, and the courtyard wall had collapsed. A new curtain wall had to be built to protect the landward side of the castle. The foundations of Warham Sconce were reported to have been washed away by the tide, and it appears that both sconces were allowed to fall into ruin.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Rommel {{received}} a promotion from Hitler {{to the rank}} of Generalmajor ahead of more senior officers. Showalter notes that <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> early stage, Hitler already regarded Rommel {{as a model for the}} fusion of Germany's new and old orders. With an intervention by Hitler, Rommel was subsequently able to obtain command of an armoured (Panzer) division despite having been turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division. Rommel's unprofessional conduct was noted by his fellow officers and added to his growing reputation as one of Hitler's favoured commanders. After the Fall of France, Rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, Rommel {{received a}} letter of thanks. Unknown to Rommel though, Hitler had barely looked at his diary and the letter was written by an adjutant. Remy remarks that by this time, Hitler still did not treat Rommel as a significantly important person.|$|E

His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him ("All Kinds of People"). Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters from the next room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, is curious about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Caf√©‚Äîan establishment open <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> hour‚Äîhad heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in.

5|$|On 11 April, 4th Regiment Hurricanes {{successfully}} {{shot down}} a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter over Nova Gradi≈°ka. The following day, {{two or three}} of the remaining 105th Squadron Hurricanes were burned by ground crews at Veliki Radinci, while other machines from the same squadron flew to Bijeljina, where other aircraft had concentrated. This move had only just been completed when a large formation of German Bf 110s swept over the airfield and destroyed over two dozen aircraft, including {{all but one of the}} 105th Squadron Hurricanes. At Kniƒá, approaching German vehicles caused the last two 163rd Squadron Hurricanes to scramble, flying to Zemun. The first pilot landed safely, but was immediately captured by armed Volksdeutsche. The other pilot, seeing that Zemun was not safe, broke off and tried to fly to Bjeljina, but ran out of fuel and was killed when he tried to crash-land near Valjevo. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> late stage, the 4th Regiment still had five or six airworthy Hurricanes. They continued to chase reconnaissance aircraft throughout the day, shooting down one Ju 88 near Banja Luka. When German bombers again attacked the airfields around Mostar, the one remaining Hurricane of the Air Training School attacked a Ju 88 but was hit by return fire, forcing the pilot to bail out.|$|E
