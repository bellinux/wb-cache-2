5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor isoniazid {{increases the risk of}} hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E

5|$|The table {{contains}} {{the date and}} time of the greatest eclipse (in dynamical time, which <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> {{the time when the}} axis of the Moon's shadow cone passes closest to the centre of Earth; this is in Universal Time). The number of the saros series that the eclipse belongs to is given, followed by the magnitude of the eclipse (the fraction of the Sun's diameter obscured by the Moon) and the type of the eclipse (either total, annular, partial or hybrid). For total and annular eclipses, the duration of the eclipse is given, as well as the location of the greatest eclipse (the point of maximum eclipse) and the path width of the total or annular eclipse. The geographical areas from which the eclipse can be seen are listed.|$|E
30|$|There {{are some}} rare reports of extrahepatic HCC without primary hepatic parenchymal lesions [2, 11]; hence, the bile duct tumors <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> might <b>be</b> new HCC lesions. However, the bile duct tumors <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} recurrence {{because of the}} morphological similarities and venous invasion. Furthermore, most cases of primary extrahepatic HCC are continuous and localized masses [12], whereas the tumors <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>are</b> extensively distinct and scattered.|$|R

5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers {{may be used}} {{to provide}} {{accurate}} distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> a supermassive black hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.|$|E
