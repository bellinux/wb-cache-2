500|$|When Friends premiered in September 1994, critics {{initially}} perceived Monica as the show's main character; Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker attributes this to {{the fact}} that Cox was the show's most famous cast member at the time. The actress has garnered largely positive reviews for her performance, with Tucker concluding that Cox successfully [...] "plays straight woman ... with alluring modesty". Tony Scott of Variety commended the entire cast for [...] "appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills ... especially Cox", while The Baltimore Sun's David Zurawik described her acting as [...] "terrific". John Kiesewetter of The Cincinnati Enquirer praised Cox's ability to [...] "deliver both verbal and physical comedy". Contactmusic.com's Sophie Miskiw commended Cox for portraying Monica with [...] "endearing neurosis". As a character, Lifetime described Monica as [...] "neurotic yet lovable". Bustle's Emma Lord wrote, [...] "I can't <b>imagine</b> <b>why</b> anyone wouldn't want to be Monica Geller", describing her as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "savvy" [...] character. Admitting that Monica is [...] "probably not our favourite character", TalkTalk described the character as [...] "wonderfully neurotic," [...] while Nick at Nite reviewed her as [...] "just as lovable as she is neurotic" [...] despite her overbearing personality. Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times was receptive towards the entire cast, especially Cox and her character, both of whom he described as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "likable and funny". Also writing for the Los Angeles Times, Glenn Whipp lauded Cox's tenure on Friends, enthusing that the actress successfully [...] "took a character loaded with obsessive-compulsive quirks and a goofy, overly competitive nature and fashioned a flesh-and-blood woman". Describing the actress' comic timing as [...] "impeccable", Whipp went on to write that Cox [...] "brought out Monica's insecurities in a way that turned self-deprecation into an art form". Jenna Mullins of E! dubbed Cox [...] "a fantastic comedic actress". Alec Harvey of The Birmingham News described Monica as a [...] "very, very funny" [...] character. Kayla Upadhyaya of The Michigan Daily appreciated the fact that [...] "Cox brought moments of sincerity and severity to Monica". However, The Washington Post panned Cox's performance as [...] "degrading", while Mike Ryan of ScreenCrush dismissed Monica as a [...] "fairly normal, but boring" [...] character.|$|E

[...] When asked why in another interview the same year, he responded, [...] "I feel as if I've worked very hard since the demise of the Smiths and the others haven't, so why hand them attention that they haven't earned? We are not friends, we don't see each other. Why on earth would we be on a stage together?"

2500|$|The {{invention}} of the solid saddle tree allowed development of the true stirrup {{as it is known}} today. [...] Without a solid tree, the rider's weight in the stirrups creates abnormal pressure points and make the horse's back sore. Modern thermography studies on [...] "treeless" [...] and flexible-tree saddle designs have found that there is considerable friction across the center line of a horse's back. A coin of Quintus Labienus, who was in service of Parthia, minted circa 39 BC depicts on its reverse a saddled horse with hanging objects. Smith suggests they are pendant cloths, while Thayer suggests that, considering the fact that the Parthians were famous for their mounted archery, the objects are stirrups, but adds {{that it is difficult to}} <b>imagine</b> <b>why</b> the Romans would never have adopted the technology.|$|E

To argue for this conclusion I distin- guish between <b>imagining</b> <b>why</b> someone did something and imagining how they could have done it, and I try to grasp partial understanding, in part by distinguishing different imaginative pers- pectives we can have on an act. When we do this we see an often unnoticed asymmetry: we do not put the same demands on our understanding of wrongdoing as on that of most everyday, morally acceptable, actions...|$|R

Nor why the Captain pulled up his shirt-collar to the utmost limits allowed by the Irish linen below, and by so doing decorated himself with a complete pair of blinkers; nor why he changed his shoes, and put on an unparalleled pair of ankle-jacks, which he only wore on extraordinary occasions. The Captain being at length attired to his own complete satisfaction, and having glanced at himself from head to foot in a shaving-glass which he removed from a nail for that purpose, took up his knotted stick, and said he was ready.|$|R
2500|$|Refusing to {{participate}} in what he felt was a farcical trial, Wali Khan did not take part in his own legal defence. In response {{to one of the}} charges before the Hyderabad Tribunal, that he had been sent Rs 20 million by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi through a certain emissary, Wali Khan sarcastically filed a civil suit against the emissary for the recovery of the Rs 20 million. He argued that, although he could not <b>imagine</b> <b>why</b> Indira Gandhi would send him such a large sum of money, he had never received the money, and obviously the emissary had embezzled the money. As civil unrest was widely spread the country, the power struggle between PNA, Pakistan Armed Forces and Bhutto, including his colleagues, was triggered and, Wali Khan saw Bhutto's actions as his last stand. In an open public seminar, Wali Khan quoted that [...] "There is one possible grave for two people ... let us see who gets in first".|$|E

On American official broke from the line and told the media: [...] "Hell, there's been so much advance knowledge we can't possibly <b>imagine</b> <b>why</b> the Diệm government didn't know, too". A picture of Taylor, Minh and Walt Rostow {{on the tennis court}} in Saigon in October was printed with the caption [...] "There could be no doubt that the US encouraged the coup". The New York Times asserted that Washington [...] "had created the atmosphere that made the coup possible". It opined that Kennedy's CBS television interview with Walter Cronkite on 2 September in which the president called for [...] "changes in policy and perhaps with personnel" [...] amounted to a [...] "virtual invitation to insurrection".|$|E
