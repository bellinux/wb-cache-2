25|$|Philosophers {{of science}} such as Paul Feyerabend {{argued that a}} {{distinction}} between science and nonscience is neither possible nor desirable. Among the issues which can make the distinction <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> variable rates of evolution among the theories and methods of science in response to new data.|$|E
25|$|It can {{sometimes}} be difficult to distinguish between eye symptoms due to hyperthyroidism and those due to Graves' antibodies, {{not in the least}} because the two often occur coincidently. What can make things particularly <b>difficult,</b> <b>is</b> that many patients with hyperthyroidism have lid retraction, which leads to stare and lid lag (due to contraction of the levator palpebrae muscles of the eyelids). This stare may then give the appearance of protruding eyeballs (proptosis), when none in fact exists. This subsides when the hyperthyroidism is treated.|$|E
25|$|One {{area where}} data access {{is likely to}} be <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> flows from the technosphere. The technosphere is more simply defined as the {{man-made}} world. Considered by geologists as secondary resources, these resources are in theory 100% recyclable; however, in a practical sense, the primary goal is salvage. For an LCI, these technosphere products (supply chain products) are those that have been produced by man and unfortunately those completing a questionnaire about a process which uses a man-made product as {{a means to an end}} will be unable to specify how much of a given input they use. Typically, they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA-practitioner tools, or that can be readily accessed, are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions.|$|E

500|$|Tower Ridge is {{the longest}} of the north face's four main ridges, with around 600 metres of ascent. It is not {{technically}} demanding (its grade is Difficult), and most pitches can be tackled unroped by competent climbers, but it is committing and very exposed. Castle Ridge (Moderate), the northernmost of the main ridges, is an easier scramble, while Observatory Ridge (Very Difficult), the closest ridge to the summit, is [...] "technically the hardest of the Nevis ridges in summer and winter". Between the Tower and Observatory Ridges are the Tower and Gardyloo Gullies; the latter {{takes its name from}} the cry of [...] "garde à l'eau" [...] (French for [...] "watch out for the water") formerly used in Scottish cities as a warning when householders threw their slops (and worse) out of a tenement window into the street. The gully's top wall was the refuse pit for the now-disused summit observatory. The North-east Buttress (Very <b>Difficult)</b> <b>is</b> the southernmost and bulkiest of the four ridges; it is as serious as Observatory Ridge but not as technically demanding, mainly because an [...] "infamous" [...] rock problem, the 'Man-trap', can be avoided on either side.|$|E

In 2008, the torture he makes in Metal Gear Solid was listed by GameSpy as one of the best moments from the game due to how Ocelot toys with Snake and how <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> to pass it besides how significant is the outcome for the rest of the game. In response to his role in Metal Gear Solid 3, GameSpy called Ocelot one of the [...] "series mainstay", hoping he would become an entertaining opponent.|$|E

2500|$|An {{incident}} {{that took place}} on Golden State Freeway June 17, 1992, brought public attention {{to the existence of}} organized crime rings that stage auto accidents for insurance fraud. These schemes generally consist of three different levels. At the top, there are the professionals—doctors or lawyers who diagnose false injuries and/or file fraudulent claims and these earn the bulk of the profits from the fraud. Next are the [...] "capper (insurance fraud)s" [...] or [...] "runners", the middlemen who obtain the cars to crash, farm out the claims to the professionals at the top, and recruit participants. These participants at the bottom-rung of the scheme are desperate people (poor immigrants or others in need of quick cash) who are paid around $1000 USD to place their bodies in the paths of cars and trucks, playing a kind of Russian roulette with their lives and those of unsuspecting motorists around them. According to investigators, cappers usually hire within their own ethnic groups. What makes busting these staged-accident crime rings <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> how quickly they move into jurisdictions with lesser enforcement, after a crackdown in a particular region. As a result, in the US several levels of police and the insurance industry have cooperated in forming task forces and sharing databases to track claim histories.|$|E
2500|$|The ascent {{starts in}} Hammersbach (...) through the Höllental along the Hammersbach stream. The path {{runs through the}} Höllental Gorge (Höllentalklamm) and was built from 1902 to 1905. Twelve tunnels were driven in the rock of the 1,026metre long gorge with a total length of 288metres. Another 569metres of path was dynamited into the rock {{in the shape of}} a half profile, whilst 120metres was led over {{footbridges}} and [...] 49metres over scree. The construction costs came to a total of 57,000 gold marks. Each year around 60,000 people pass through the gorge. The gorge can also be circumnavigated over the Stangensteig path. After the gorge the route heads for the [...] Höllentalanger Hut (...) , after which it crosses the Höllentalanger stream. Above that the Brett is crossed on steel pins fixed to a rock face. Crossing the Grünen Buckel the trail runs up to the Höllentalferner glacier. The glacier is mostly snow-free in summer so that crampons are required to cross it. Even more <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> the randkluft because the ice retreats further and further from the rock as it melts. After the glacier there is a klettersteig to the summit of the Zugspitze. This route climbs through a height of , for which between seven and eight hours are needed. There is also the option of getting to the Höllental route on the Riffelsteig path from Eibsee. This path crosses the Riffelscharte wind gap and meets the route before the Brett.|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie [...] "Hex" [...] Bendixsen (Series 5–12) {{took over}} the role from Junglist in time for series 5. Bendixsen had also auditioned for ABC3, but won the role on Good Game after {{approaching}} Bajo at Supanova as a fan, and being told Good Game was looking for someone. She sent {{in a series of}} reviews, the style of which she said she already knew how to do having already watched the show for a couple of years. She later did a screen test and ended up getting the job [...] "quite quickly". Her first episode was on 26 October 2009. Hex got into games relatively late as she did not have a gaming household. Her first games were MUDs – specifically the game Lensmoor which she started playing at age 15), and enjoyed as it was like [...] "collectively writing a book". Hex says she is okay with the harder parts of production as they are a part of her job. She said she finds great satisfaction in seeing a completed show go to air as so much time and love has gone into it. Hex states that, [...] "The only thing that's sometimes <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> that I have less time to play the games that I want to play recreationally, because the games I'm reviewing for work take priority." [...] While she is happy to weigh in on gender-related issues, she also acknowledges that she {{does not want to be}} a [...] "poster girl" [...] for it and instead wants to be thought of as [...] "a PERSON who just enjoys gaming".|$|E

2500|$|After her mother's presumed death, Kiki starts {{building}} {{a relationship with}} Silas. Actress Hayley Erin said [...] "They have a little relationship, and it's sweet" [...] but Silas cannot replace Ava. Kiki really tries to establish that connection with Silas and they do but [...] "She just wishes he were around more." [...] In [...] "losing" [...] Ava, Kiki [...] "lost herself" [...] and resorts to questionable actions such as drugging Michael {{in an attempt to}} make sure he loses custody of their sister. Kiki descends further into turmoil when she finds Silas stabbed to death and believing Franco is guilty she feels [...] "sheer hatred" [...] for him. What makes it most <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> that she has trusted Franco so much. Kiki is very relieved when Franco is proven to be innocent of her father's murder and Ava, who has been passing herself off as Ava's twin is revealed to be alive. Hayley Erin was quite upset by the decision to kill off Silas. [...] "I took it personally" [...] she said. The actress later continued, [...] "But it made for a great storyline {{and there was a lot}} of great material for all of us." [...] Instead of focusing on whether Kiki was aware that Ava was truly alive in her portrayal, Erin went with the most basic off all the emotions with Kiki only being happy to have her mother back. Kiki's glee at having Ava back is ruined when she learns about Ava and Morgan's secret affair. Erin noted the irony of Kiki having Ava for a mother as [...] "the worst thing that could have happened to anyone" [...] while the actress said getting to work opposite Maura West is the [...] "greatest thing that could ever happen to anyone." [...] She continued, [...] "I love it, because she makes me step up my game." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E
