5|$|The Jain {{philosophical}} {{concept of}} Anekantavada made <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> to ancient Indian philosophy, {{in the areas}} of skepticism and relativity. The epistemology of anekāntavāda and syādvāda also {{had a profound impact on}} the development of ancient Indian logic and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The {{state also}} made <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> to relief efforts.

5|$|Cantor {{recovered}} soon thereafter, {{and subsequently}} made further <b>important</b> <b>contributions,</b> including his diagonal argument and theorem. However, he never again attained {{the high level}} of his remarkable papers of 1874–84, even after Kronecker's death on December 29, 1891. He eventually sought, and achieved, a reconciliation with Kronecker. Nevertheless, the philosophical disagreements and difficulties dividing them persisted.|$|E

5|$|German {{painters}} {{have influenced}} western art. Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German {{artists of the}} Renaissance, Peter Paul Rubens and Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Such German sculptors as Otto Schmidt-Hofer, Franz Iffland, and Julius Schmidt-Felling made <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> to German art history in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Euler made <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> in optics. He {{disagreed}} with Newton's corpuscular theory {{of light in}} the Opticks, which was then the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the quantum theory of light.|$|E
5|$|Money {{that had}} been raised during the 1920s and {{financial}} backing from the Rockefeller Foundation helped the school to survive through the Great Depression.

5|$|Notable among secular {{writings}} on music and medicine were Vidyaranya's Sangitsara, Praudha Raya's Ratiratnapradipika, Sayana's Ayurveda Sudhanidhi and Lakshmana Pandita's Vaidyarajavallabham. The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished {{during this period}} under such well known scholars as Madhava (c. 1340–1425) who made <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> to Trigonometery and Calculus, and Nilakantha Somayaji (c. 1444–1545) who postulated on the orbitals of planets.|$|E
5|$|One of Kraft's most <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> to manned spaceflight {{would be}} his {{origination}} {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much, particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E

5|$|Another {{work from}} Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De Materia Medica, a five-volume {{encyclopedia}} about herbal medicine {{written in the}} middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides. De Materia Medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years. <b>Important</b> <b>contributions</b> from the medieval Muslim world include Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture, Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī's (828–896) the Book of Plants, and Ibn Bassal's The Classification of Soils. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and Ibn al-Baitar (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by {{their attempts to}} outcompete and disgrace each other, but they made <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> to science and the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further work—both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts {{of the two men}} led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs being discovered and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted in an increase in knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to continued fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow. Many historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity.|$|E

5|$|<b>Important</b> <b>contributions</b> {{were made}} by some {{prominent}} literary families. One Jain family produced several authors, including Mallikarjuna, the noted anthologist (1245); his brother-in-law Janna (1209), the court poet of King Veera Ballala II; Mallikarjuna's son Keshiraja (1260), considered by D. R. Nagaraj, a scholar on literary cultures in history, {{to be the greatest}} theorist of Kannada grammar; and Sumanobana, who was in the court of King Narasimha I and was the maternal grandfather of Keshiraja. Harihara (1160) and his nephew Raghavanka (1200), poets who set the trend for using native metres, came from a Shaiva family (devotees of the god Shiva).|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's {{achievements}} in physics included the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions, {{work on the}} theory of electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in nuclear fusion, and the first prediction of quantum tunneling. With his students he also made <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> to the modern theory of neutron stars and black holes, {{as well as to}} quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and the interactions of cosmic rays. As a teacher and promoter of science, he is remembered as a founding father of the American school of theoretical physics that gained world prominence in the 1930s. After World War II, he became director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The {{era of the}} Kingdom of Mysore is {{considered}} a golden age {{in the development of}} Kannada literature. Not only was the Mysore court adorned by famous Brahmin and Veerashaiva writers and composers, the kings themselves were accomplished in the fine arts and made <b>important</b> <b>contributions.</b> While conventional literature in philosophy and religion remained popular, writings in new genres such as chronicle, biography, history, encyclopedia, novel, drama, and musical treatise became popular. A native form of folk literature with dramatic representation called Yakshagana gained popularity. A remarkable development of the later period was the influence of English literature and classical Sanskrit literature on Kannada.|$|E

5|$|These <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> to {{medicine}} and biology were first seriously honoured in 1968 when Woodruff {{was elected to}} be a Fellow of the Royal Society. The next year, 1969, Woodruff was knighted by the Queen, a rare accomplishment for a surgeon. Additionally, numerous medical organizations gave Woodruff honorary membership, including the American College of Surgeons, the American Surgical Association, and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Woodruff also held office in several scientific organizations, serving as Vice-President of the Royal Society and President of The Transplantation Society. Finally, Woodruff served for many years as a WHO advisor and as a visiting professor {{at a number of}} universities.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a German Renaissance {{printmaker}} {{who made}} <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement), meant {{to teach the}} subjects of linear perspective, geometry in architecture, Platonic solids, and regular polygons. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy. While the examples of perspective in Underweysung der Messung are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of polyhedral nets, polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing. Dürer published another influential book on human proportions called Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion) in 1528.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other <b>important</b> <b>contributions</b> include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
