40|$|AbstractHeterogeneity in {{clinical}} manifestations {{is a well-known}} feature in Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). The extent of this phenomenon became evident in families wherein both symptomatic and asymptomatic family members are reported. The study hence warrants genetic testing and/or <b>screening</b> of <b>family</b> members of LQTS probands for risk stratification and prediction. Of the 46 <b>families</b> <b>screened,</b> 18 probands revealed novel variations/compound heterozygosity in the gene/s <b>screened.</b> <b>Families</b> 1 – 4 revealed probands carrying novel variations in KCNQ 1 gene along with compound heterozygosity of risk genotypes of the SCN 5 A, KCNE 1 and NPPA gene/s polymorphisms screened. It was also observed that families- 5, 6 and 7 were typical cases of “anticipation” in which both mother and child were diagnosed with congenital LQTS (cLQTS). Families- 16 and 17 represented aLQTS probands with variations in IKs and INa encoding genes. First degree relatives (FDRs) carrying the same haplotype as the proband were also identified which may help in predictive testing and management of LQTS. Most of the probands exhibiting a family history {{were found to be}} genetic compounds which clearly points to the role of cardiac genes and their modifiers in a recessive fashion in LQTS manifestation...|$|R

VIPP-SD, based on attachment theory and coercion theory, focuses on mirroring and discussing actual parent-child interactions in six 1. 5 -hr sessions with individual families at home. VIPP-SD proved {{to be effective in}} enhancing maternal attitudes toward sensitivity and sensitive discipline and in promoting sensitive discipline interactions in the intervention group as compared with the control group. Moreover, in families with more marital discord and in families with more daily hassles, the intervention resulted in a decrease of overactive problem behaviors in the children.

40|$|Objective. The {{information}} concerning the morbidity and mortality of hereditary hemochromatosis is based primarily on clinical cohorts of symptomatic patients. The major {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the long-term prognosis for Swedish patients with this condition, with respect to both clinical features and survival, in relation to the route by which the disease was detected. Patients and methods. 373 patients with hemochromatosis detected through routine health checkups (n = 153), <b>family</b> <b>screening</b> (n = 44), symptoms of arthralgia (n = 23), investigation of other diseases/symptoms (n = 108) or signs of liver disease (n = 45) were monitored for a mean period of 11. 9 +/- 5. 8 years. The degree of liver fibrosis and survival were analyzed. Results. Overall survival among these patients was not significantly different from that of a matched normal population. The patients diagnosed through health check-ups and <b>family</b> <b>screening</b> were detected at an earlier age and had the highest rate of survival. Liver biopsy at the time of diagnosis revealed cirrhosis in 9 % of those detected through the health check-ups and 5 % in the case of <b>family</b> <b>screening,</b> compared with 13 % for the group with arthralgia, 17 % for other diseases/symptoms and 42 % for liver disease. Conclusion. Health check-ups and <b>family</b> <b>screening</b> allow detection of hereditary hemochromatosis at an earlier age and with less advanced liver fibrosis, although a few of these patients have already developed cirrhosis. Our study indicates that iron indices should be included in health check-ups, and if abnormal, should lead to further investigation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Family</b> <b>screening</b> in {{inherited}} cardiac arrhythmias {{has been}} performed in The Netherlands since 1996, when diagnostic DNA testing in long QT syndrome (LOTS) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) became technically possible. In multidisciplinary outpatient academic clinics, an adjusted protocol for genetic counselling, originally derived from predictive testing in Huntington's disease, is being used. 1110 Individuals, including 842 relatives of index patients, were informed about their risks, and most were tested molecularly and/or clinically for carriership {{of the disease}} present in their family. Of 345 relatives who were referred for cardiologic follow-up, 189 are being treated, because of {{an increased risk of}} life-threatening arrhythmias. Evaluation of the psychological and social consequences of <b>family</b> <b>screening</b> for inherited arrhythmias can be performed by using the adapted criteria of Wilson and Jüngner, i. e., from a point of view of public health. Preliminary results of psychological research show that parents of children at risk for LQTS show high levels of distress.

40|$|The {{incidence}} and prevalence rates of {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP) in Finland between 1961 and 1990 were estimated from Finnish polyposis registry data comprising 81 FAP families, including 251 affected patients. In addition, the effect of <b>family</b> <b>screening</b> on the occurrence of colorectal carcinoma was evaluated by comparing the call up and proband groups and calculating the proportion of FAP among all patients with colorectal carcinoma. The incidence of FAP was 0. 62 to 2. 38 per million and the prevalence increased steadily from 0. 88 to 26. 3 million {{during the study period}} suggesting improving prognosis. Altogether 76 of 116 probands (65. 5 %) had colorectal carcinoma compared with only five of 76 call up patients (6. 6 %). Consequently, the life expectancy of the call up patients was significantly better than that of the probands from the age of 31 years and above. However, at most, 0. 53 % of all colorectal carcinomas were associated with FAP in 1966 - 70, and the diminishing frequency of this proportion was more a result of an increase in sporadic colorectal carcinomas in Finland than of <b>family</b> <b>screening</b> for FAP. <b>Family</b> <b>screening</b> is very effective in FAP and must always be undertaken when a new proband is diagnosed...|$|E
