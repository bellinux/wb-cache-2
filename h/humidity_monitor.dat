40|$|Part 1 : Simulation, Optimization, Monitoring and Control TechnologyInternational audienceThe temperature, humidity, air {{composition}} and pH value {{are very important}} parameters in the granary that keep the grain safely store and good quality. Nowadays only temperature and moisture are used in most granary monitor and control system. Air composition, pH and insect pest are not monitored because classic industrial personal computer or microcomputer {{are not able to}} handle these real-time multiply tasks at the same time. So it is necessary to design a monitor and alarm system to monitor these parameters in the granary to minimize or curtail damage or loss. Applying the advanced embedded technology and sensor technology, a set of granary temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>monitor</b> and alarm system is designed based on the ARM. Temperature sensor, humidity sensor, air composition sensor and pH value sensor are selected to monitor the parameters in the granary. Based on the ARM microprocessor LPC 2290, the hardware system consists of serial communication module, LCD display module and alarm module. Based on the embedded operation system, the software completes the allocation design and testing of the tasks and realizes the functions such as pulse frequency signal acquisition, analog signal A/D convert, serial digital signal communication, alarm in different grades and LCD display.

A standardized source of positive control antibody (human anti-Ov 16 IgG 4) will ensure the quality of surveillance data using these tests. A recombinant human IgG 4 antibody to Ov 16 was identified by screening against a synthetic human Fab phage display library and converted into human IgG 4. This antibody was developed into different positive control formulations for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) platforms. Variation in ELISA results and utility as a positive control of the antibody were assessed from multiple laboratories. Temperature and humidity conditions were collected across seven surveillance activities from 2011 - 2014 to inform stability requirements for RDTs and positive controls. The feasibility of the dried positive control for RDT was evaluated during onchocerciasis surveillance activity in Togo, in 2014. When the anti-Ov 16 IgG 4 antibody was used as a standard dilution in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) ELISAs, the detection limits were approximately 1 ng/mL by HRP ELISA and 10 ng/mL by AP ELISA. Positive control dilutions and spiked dried blood spots (DBS) produced similar ELISA results. Used as a simple plate normalization control, the positive control antibody may improve ELISA data comparison in the context of inter-laboratory variation.

As a packaged positive control for Ov 16 RDTs, stability of the antibody was demonstrated for over six months at relevant temperatures in the laboratory and for over 15 weeks under field conditions. The recombinant human anti-Ov 16 IgG 4 antibody-based positive control will benefit inter-laboratory validation of ELISA assays and serve as quality control (QC) reagents for Ov 16 RDTs at different points of the supply chain from manufacturer to field use...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Northwest Scientific Association and can be found at: [URL] variables such as air temperature and relative humidity influence habitat conditions and ecological processes in riparian forests. The increased relative humidity levels within riparian areas are essential for many plant and wildlife species. Information about relative humidity patterns within riparian areas and adjacent uplands are necessary for the prescription of effective buffer widths. Relative <b>humidity</b> <b>monitoring</b> is more expensive than temperature monitoring due to greater sensor costs, and it is primarily conducted for research purposes. To make relative <b>humidity</b> <b>monitoring</b> in riparian areas more cost effective, we explored modeling relative humidity as a function of air temperature and other covariates using linear fixed and linear mixed effects models applied to two case studies. Localizing predictions for stream reaches using a linear mixed effects model or a linear fixed effects model with correction factor improved model predictions, especially when large variability among stream reaches was present. A minimum of three to five relative humidity measurements per stream reach seem sufficient to estimate the random stream reach effect or correction factor for the linear mixed and linear fixed effects models, respectively. Including covariates that describe distance to stream and canopy cover in addition to air temperature improved model performance. Although further model refinement is probably needed to allow detection of small changes in relative humidity associated with changes in stand structure from partial overstory removal, the models developed provide a means towards decreasing the costs of monitoring microclimates of importance to riparian area function...|$|R
