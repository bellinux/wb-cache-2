25|$|For example, Rivers {{proposed}} that officers and soldiers {{who suffer from}} night terrors {{do so because they}} are trying to wittingly repress emotions and their associated instincts back into the unconscious. Repression, according to Rivers, is never adequate for removing conflict; it is only fruitful when a person can exert a conscious <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. As a result, the repressed instincts, along with their associated emotions and memories, seep into consciousness when soldiers are sleeping. The result is night terrors.|$|E

[...] In Carte's obituary, The Times noted, [...] "By his refined taste he raised the reputation of the mise en scène of the Savoy operas to a very high pitch. He set a high standard".

500|$|After 17 {{months of}} development, Chahi {{was only about}} one-third {{finished}} with the game, and realized that this rate would have been impractical. He began {{to take steps to}} simplify the development, including reusing background graphics and creating building blocks that allowed him to focus more on the game's puzzles. At the same time, he began to seek a publisher for the game. He first spoke to his former employer, Delphine Software, but also sought other distributors. One, Virgin Interactive, was favourable to Chahi's game but had suggested that he change it to a point-and-click style adventure game. Chahi had considered changing the game in line with this request but realized [...] "the <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this would have been too huge, and some friends who played the game loved it." [...] Ultimately, he accepted Delphine's offer in June 1991, and set a tentative release date in November.

One ending captured on these storyboards, but abandoned, was Lester becoming the leader of the alien world. The game was finished in 1991, which inspired the game's tagline: [...] "It took six days to create the Earth.

500|$|The Chief Justice {{proceeded}} to detail the origin, purpose, and case law {{history of the}} separation of powers. Article Three of the United States Constitution establishes an independent judiciary with [...] "distinct and inviolable authority." [...] Such separation of powers [...] "safeguards individual freedom." [...] As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 78, quoting Montesquieu, [...] "'there is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.'" [...] The separation of powers between the judiciary and legislative branches was examined in detail in Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc. (1995), in which the Supreme Court found unconstitutional a statute that reopened a case after a final judgment. At the time of the framing of the Constitution, judicial and legislative powers were often intermingled. The colonial legislatures often performed many of the functions of the judiciary, such as functioning as the court of last resort, granting new trials, and providing original review, appellate review, stays of judgments, and providing other types of relief [...] "in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what is agreeable to Right and Justice." [...] The colonial charters of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island gave the legislatures the authority of court of last resort. In New Hampshire, judicial appeals were directed to the governor and his council, but routinely referred to the legislature for discussion. And for over half a century, the colonial assembly of Virginia could review court judgments. The involvement of legislatures in judicial matters [...] "intensified during the American Revolution," [...] which [...] "soon prompted a sense of a sharp necessity to separate the legislative from the judicial power." [...] The interference of the legislatures in judicial matters [...] "figur prominently in the Framers' decision to devise a system for securing liberty through the division of power." [...] This resulted in Article Three of the United States Constitution, which forms the [...] "central pillar of judicial independence" [...] and places [...] "'he judicial Power of the United States'... in 'one supreme Court', and in such 'inferior Courts'" [...] as Congress may establish. This judicial power extends [...] "to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority." ...|$|E
