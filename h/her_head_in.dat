5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers on the back of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, Obama {{traveled}} to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, {{following the death}} of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so, though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs, even being praised in some corners. Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.|$|E

5|$|Olivia (Anna Torv) {{dreams that}} she pushes {{a woman in}} front of a subway train at Grand Central Terminal, but assumes it was just in <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> the morning however, the news reports that the woman killed herself with the train. Walter (John Noble) puts forth various theories, such as astral projection, while Peter (Joshua Jackson) thinks it was still just a dream.

5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added with digital effects. One such scene was on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks deciding what to cut out. One of the scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but that scene was cut in favor of another episode. Manning's scenes were also cut due from the final broadcast to the length, though viewers could still make out the top of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the finished episode.|$|E
5|$|Waray guerrillas under {{a former}} schoolteacher named Captain Nieves Fernandez fought the Japanese in Tacloban. Nieves {{extensively}} trained her men in combat skills and making of improvised weaponry, {{as well as}} leading her men in the front. With only 110 men, Nieves managed to take out over 200 Japanese soldiers during the occupation. The Imperial Japanese Army posted a 10,000 Pesos reward on <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the hopes of capturing her but to no avail. The main commander of the resistance movement in the Island of Leyte was Ruperto Kangleon, a former Filipino soldier turned resistance fighter and leader. After {{the fall of the}} country, he successfully escaped capture by the Japanese and established a united guerrilla front in Leyte. He and his men, the Black Army, were successful in pushing the Japanese from the mainland province and further into the coastlands of Southern Leyte. Kangleon's guerrillas provided intelligence for the American guerrilla leaders such as Wendell Fertig, and assisted in the subsequent Leyte Landing and the Battle of Leyte soon after. The guerrillas in Leyte were also very instrumental not only in the opposition against Japanese rule, but also in the safety and aid of the civilians living in the island. In the book The Hidden Battle of Leyte: The Picture Diary of a Girl taken by the Japanese Military by Remedios Felias; a former comfort woman, revealed how the Filipino guerrillas saved the lives of many young girls raped or to-be raped by the Japanese. In her vivid account of the Battle of Burauen, she recounts how the guerrillas managed to wipe out entire Japanese platoons off the various villages in the municipality, eventually saving the lives of many.|$|E

The first, using her laugh, she finds entertaining although she suggests some changes. The second, using sounds of their love-making, horrify her and after arguing she exits in disgust, never to reappear. This leaves Jerome with nobody to act as though she is his fiancée at next week's meeting.

25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over one side of her face. The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E

500|$|Marine {{biologist}} Ronald J. Schusterman and {{his research}} associates have studied sea lions' cognitive ability. They {{have discovered that}} sea lions are able to recognize relationships between stimuli based on similar functions or connections made with their peers, rather than only the stimuli's common features. Sea lions have demonstrated the ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language. However, the sea lions rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In 2011, a California sea lion named [...] "Ronan" [...] was recorded bobbing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> synchronization to musical rhythms.|$|E
500|$|In the Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu {{takes the}} form of the enchantress, Mohini, in order to trick the demons into giving up Amrita, the elixir of life.

In the Brahmanda Purana, Shiva's wife Parvati [...] "hangs <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> shame" [...] when she sees her husband's pursuit of Mohini. In some stories Shiva asks Vishnu to take on the Mohini form again so he can see the actual transformation for himself. Stories in which Shiva knows of Mohini's true nature have been interpreted to [...] "suggest the fluidity of gender in sexual attraction".|$|E
