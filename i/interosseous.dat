25|$|The first dorsal <b>interosseous,</b> one of {{the central}} muscles of the hand, extends {{from the base of the}} thumb {{metacarpal}} to the radial side of the proximal phalanx of the index finger.|$|E
25|$|The <b>interosseous</b> ligaments {{consist of}} short, thick fibers, and {{are limited to}} {{one part of the}} carpometacarpal articulation; they connect the {{contiguous}} inferior angles of the capitate and hamate with the adjacent surfaces of the third and fourth metacarpal bones.|$|E
25|$|The third, {{the most}} extensive, passes between the {{contiguous}} {{margins of the}} two rows of carpal bones, and sometimes, {{in the event of}} one of the <b>interosseous</b> ligaments being absent, between the bones of the second row to the carpal extremities of the second, third, fourth, and fifth metacarpal bones.|$|E
25|$|Overworking {{young or}} unfit horses at speed or in tight circles may cause splints. The uneven loading of the limb in tight circles places {{excessive}} {{force on the}} medial splint, which can cause it to move excessively relative to the cannon bone, causing tears in the <b>interosseous</b> ligament and periosteal reaction.|$|E
25|$|The {{extensor}} pollicis longus (EPL) originates on the {{dorsal side}} of the ulna and the <b>interosseous</b> membrane. Passing through the third tendon compartment, it is inserted onto {{the base of the}} distal phalanx of the thumb. It uses the dorsal tubercle on the lower extremity of the radius as a fulcrum to extend the thumb and also dorsiflexes and abducts the hand at the wrist. It is innervated by the deep branch of the radial nerve (C7-C8).|$|E
25|$|The {{abductor}} pollicis longus (APL) originates on the dorsal {{sides of}} both the ulna and the radius, and from the <b>interosseous</b> membrane. Passing through the first tendon compartment, it inserts {{to the base of}} the first metacarpal bone. A part of the tendon reaches the trapezium, while another fuses with the tendons of the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis brevis. Except for abducting the hand, it flexes the hand towards the palm and abducts it radially. It is innervated by the deep branch of the radial nerve (C7-C8).|$|E
25|$|A ventral forearm muscle, the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) {{originates}} on {{the anterior}} {{side of the}} radius distal to the radial tuberosity and from the <b>interosseous</b> membrane. It passes through the carpal tunnel in a separate tendon sheath, after which it lies between {{the heads of the}} flexor pollicis brevis. It finally attaches onto the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. It is innervated by the anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve (C7-C8) It is a persistence of one of the former contrahentes muscles that pulled the fingers or toes together.|$|E
25|$|Jumping {{is a very}} strenuous {{activity}} that places high physical demands on the horse. The primary stresses affect the suspensory apparatuses of the hind legs during take-off and the forelegs during landing, though the galloping and turning associated with jumping also place torque on the joints. Most injuries, chronic or acute, begin with strain; as structures in the horse's body absorb the shock of take-off and landing, they acquire small amounts of damage. Over time, this damage leads to inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and ligaments (desmitis). The most common injuries in the forelimb occur to the <b>interosseous</b> ligaments and the superficial digital flexor tendons and less commonly, the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon. Strain on the superficial digital flexors is greater when jumping higher fences, so horses {{may no longer be}} suitable for competitive jumping after damaging that apparatus.|$|E
2500|$|Essex-Lopresti {{fracture}} – {{a fracture}} of the radial head with concomitant dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint with {{disruption of the}} <b>interosseous</b> membrane ...|$|E
2500|$|Maisonneuve {{fracture}} – {{a spiral}} fracture of the proximal {{third of the}} fibula associated with a tear of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis and the <b>interosseous</b> membrane ...|$|E
2500|$|The splint bones, (metacarpal or {{metatarsal}} II and IV), {{which are}} remnants {{of two of}} the five toes of prehistoric horses, run down either side of the cannon bone. They narrow as they go from the carpal or tarsal joint down, and form a [...] "button" [...] at the bottom or their length, a few inches above the fetlock. Splint bones are attached to the cannon by the <b>interosseous</b> ligament, providing some mobility in the young horse. [...] As the horse ages, the <b>interosseous</b> ligament is typically replaced by bone. [...] In some older horses, the cannon and splint bones may become completely fused.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{sacroiliac}} joints, formed {{between the}} auricular {{surfaces of the}} sacrum and the two hip bones. are amphiarthroses, almost immobile joints enclosed by very taut joint capsules. [...] This capsule is strengthened by the ventral, <b>interosseous,</b> and dorsal sacroiliac ligaments.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{the same}} {{clinical}} features as Type IV, it is distinguished histologically by [...] "mesh-like" [...] bone appearance. Further {{characterized by the}} [...] "V triad" [...] consisting of a) radio-opaque band adjacent to growth plates, b) hypertrophic calluses at fracture sites, and c) calcification of the radio-ulnar <b>interosseous</b> membrane.|$|E
2500|$|Concussion {{is another}} cause of splints. Concussive forces {{run from the}} carpus or tarsus into the splint bones. [...] Working a horse on hard {{surfaces}} increases the concussion received by the <b>interosseous</b> ligament, which causes tearing. Splints caused by concussion are usually found on both front legs, most commonly {{on the inside of}} the leg a few inches below the knee.|$|E
2500|$|Because the splint bone {{does have}} some {{mobility}} independent of the cannon bone, it can cause tension and strain on the periosteum of the splint bone where the <b>interosseous</b> ligament attaches. The horse will then lay down new bone and the area will become inflamed. [...] "Blind splints" [...] are named because the bony reaction happens on the inside border between the splint bone and cannon bone, where {{it can not be}} seen, and is usually not palpable. Besides causing pain as any active splint reaction can, the swelling can impinge on the suspensory ligament. This condition is difficult to diagnose, but ultrasound is generally diagnostic. [...] MRI and CT also show these well.|$|E
2500|$|With the popliteus (see above) as {{the single}} exception, all muscles in the leg are {{attached}} to the foot and, based on location, can be classified into an anterior and a posterior group separated from each other by the tibia, the fibula, and the <b>interosseous</b> membrane. In turn, these two groups can be subdivided into subgroups or layers— the anterior group consists of the extensors and the peroneals, and the posterior group of a superficial and a deep layer. Functionally, the muscles of the leg are either extensors, responsible for the dorsiflexion of the foot, or flexors, responsible for the plantar flexion. These muscles can also classified by innervation, muscles supplied by the anterior subdivision of the plexus and those supplied by the posterior subdivision. [...] The leg muscles acting on the foot are called the extrinsic foot muscles whilst the foot muscles located in the foot are called intrinsic.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} <b>interosseous</b> artery (volar <b>interosseous</b> artery) is {{an artery}} in the forearm. It is {{a branch of}} the common <b>interosseous</b> artery.|$|E
50|$|Passing {{backward}} {{to the upper}} border of the <b>interosseous</b> membrane, it divides into two branches, the anterior <b>interosseous</b> and posterior <b>interosseous</b> arteries.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} <b>interosseous</b> nerve (a {{branch of}} the median nerve) and the anterior <b>interosseous</b> artery and vein pass downward {{on the front of}} the <b>interosseous</b> membrane between the flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum profundus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{posterior}} <b>interosseous</b> artery (dorsal <b>interosseous</b> artery) is {{an artery}} of the forearm.|$|E
5000|$|Injury to the {{anterior}} <b>interosseous</b> branch in the forearm causes {{the anterior}} <b>interosseous</b> syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|The {{anterior}} ulnar recurrent, posterior ulnar recurrent, anterior <b>interosseous,</b> posterior <b>interosseous</b> and superficial {{branches of}} the ulnar artery.|$|E
50|$|It may {{compress}} {{the anterior}} <b>interosseous</b> nerve, a motor {{branch of the}} median nerve, causing a condition called anterior <b>interosseous</b> nerve syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Before it pierces the <b>interosseous</b> {{membrane}} {{the anterior}} <b>interosseous</b> sends a branch downward behind the pronator quadratus muscle {{to join the}} palmar carpal network.|$|E
50|$|The <b>interosseous</b> crest or lateral {{border is}} thin and prominent, {{especially}} its central part, and gives {{attachment to the}} <b>interosseous</b> membrane; it commences above {{in front of the}} fibular articular facet, and bifurcates below, to form the boundaries of a triangular rough surface, for the attachment of the <b>interosseous</b> ligament connecting the tibia and fibula.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>interosseous</b> {{recurrent}} artery (or recurrent <b>interosseous</b> artery) is {{an artery}} of the forearm which {{arises from the}} posterior <b>interosseous</b> artery near its origin. It ascends to the interval between the lateral epicondyle and olecranon, on or through the fibers of the supinator but beneath the anconeus. It anastomoses with the middle collateral artery.|$|E
5000|$|The deep {{branch of}} the radial nerve pierces the supinator muscle, winds around the radius {{under the cover of}} supinator to reach {{posterior}} of forearm where it again pierces supinator and after which it is known as the posterior <b>interosseous</b> nerve of forearm. It pierces the posterior extensor muscles and comes to lie on posterior <b>interosseous</b> membrane just below extensor pollicis brevis. It continues to move along with posterior <b>interosseous</b> artery(a deep branch of common <b>interosseous</b> artery which is a branch of ulnar artery), and ends as a pseudoganglion below extensor retinaculum.|$|E
50|$|At {{the upper}} {{border of the}} {{pronator}} quadratus muscle it pierces the <b>interosseous</b> membrane and reaches {{the back of the}} forearm, where it anastomoses with the dorsal <b>interosseous</b> artery.|$|E
50|$|Before it divides {{it gives}} {{off to the}} first space an <b>interosseous</b> branch which {{supplies}} the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe and sends a filament to the first <b>Interosseous</b> dorsalis muscle.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} <b>interosseous</b> nerve (volar <b>interosseous</b> nerve) is {{a branch}} of the median nerve that supplies the deep muscles on the anterior of the forearm, except the ulnar (medial) half of the flexor digitorum profundus.|$|E
50|$|Severe forearm {{injuries}} involving {{separation of}} the radius and ulna {{may be due to}} rupture of the <b>interosseous</b> membrane. Rupture can lead to proximal migration of the radius and an apparent lengthening of the ulna at the wrist. Often <b>interosseous</b> membrane tears are associated with adverse impacts on forearm rotation. MRI-assisted diagnosis has been used for mid-substance tears of the <b>interosseous</b> membrane but is expensive and not widely available. On the contrary, ultrasound has proven useful in diagnosing tears of the tibiofibular <b>interosseous</b> membrane of the leg, and this technique may also be applied to acute cases of membrane tears in the forearm due to its low cost and portability.|$|E
50|$|It {{is made up}} of the dorsal carpal {{branches}} of both the ulnar and radial arteries. It also anastomoses with the anterior <b>interosseous</b> artery and the posterior <b>interosseous</b> artery. The arch gives off three dorsal metacarpal arteries.|$|E
50|$|The {{posterior}} <b>interosseous</b> nerve may be entrapped at {{the arcade}} of Frohse, {{which is part}} of the supinator muscle. Posterior <b>interosseous</b> neuropathy is purely a motor syndrome resulting in finger drop and radial wrist deviation on extension.|$|E
50|$|As {{it is on}} the {{anterior}} side of the arm, it is innervated by a branch of the median nerve, {{the anterior}} <b>interosseous</b> nerve (roots C8 and T1 with T1 being primary). Arterial blood comes via the <b>interosseous</b> artery.|$|E
50|$|The first palmar <b>interosseous</b> {{is located}} at the thumb's medial side. Passing between the first dorsal <b>interosseous</b> and the oblique head of {{adductor}} pollicis, it is inserted on the base of the thumb's proximal phalanx together with adductor pollicis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>interosseous</b> {{membrane}} {{of the leg}} (middle tibiofibular ligament) extends {{between the}} <b>interosseous</b> crests of the tibia and fibula, helps stabilize the Tib-Fib relationship and separates the muscles on the front from those {{on the back of}} the leg.|$|E
