40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how didelphid marsupials have diversified in morphology of their claws and <b>digital</b> <b>pads</b> as they evolved different foraging preferences such as terrestrial, aquatic, and arboreal feeding behaviours. Both arboreal and more terrestrial didelphids have papillary ridges on the <b>digital</b> <b>pads</b> of the fore and hindfoot. In contrast, the papillary ridges on the pedal digital skin of the water opossum Chironectes minimus have been replaced by nonoverlapping, thickened epidermal scales. Chironectes also differs from the other didelphids studied in having finger tips with reduced claws and <b>digital</b> <b>pads</b> that are covered with raised epidermal scales having projecting, finger-like cones arranged radially around the perimeter of each scale. The reduced claws and unusual digit skin microstructure of Chironectes likely improve this animal's ability to recognise and identify live animal prey under water using only its sense of touch...|$|R

40|$|A young Labrador Retriever was {{presented}} {{for treatment of}} severe distal hindlimb necrosis caused by bandage ischemia. During digit amputation at the metatarsophalangeal joints, {{the third and fourth}} <b>digital</b> <b>pads</b> were salvaged and transferred to the metatarsal stump to create a weight-bearing surface. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPVVT) was utilized for flap immobilization and to promote granulation tissue in the remaining wound defect.

The skin defect healed completely by second intention and the stump was epithelialized with a thin pad after three months.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and selectivity of complex carbohydrates in the eccrine glands of the <b>digital</b> <b>pads</b> in the North American raccoon (Procyon lotor) were studied using light and electron microscopic histochemical methods, particularly lectin histochemistry.

40|$|Numerous {{and very}} large Vater-Pacini corpuscles were {{observed}} in the forefoot <b>digital</b> <b>pads</b> of the North American raccoon (Procyon lotor). In addition to ultrastructure, the distribution and selectivity of complex glycoconjugates in this sensory corpuscle type were examined by carbohydrate histochemical techniques, in particular lectin histochemistry. The Vater-Pacini corpuscles present showed the typical lamellar structure known for mammals and contained high amounts of neutral and acidic glycoconjugates with various saccharide residues (α-l-fucose, β-d-galactose, sialic acid) in a specific intracorpuscular distribution pattern, including variations between the outer lamellae and the inner core. The results obtained are discussed with regard to possible functions of the Vater-Pacini corpuscles found in the raccoon forefoot pads. The corpuscular glycoconjugate components may furnish a high and differentiated viscoelasticity for rapid pressure transmission within the large Vater-Pacini corpuscles.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether a cheap, fast, easy, and widely available photographic method {{is an accurate}} alternative to Visitrak when measuring wound area in cases where a non–wound-contact method is desirable. Methods: The areas of 40 surgically created wounds on porcine models were measured using 2 techniques—Visitrak and photography combined with ImageJ. The wounds were photographed with a ruler included in the photographic frame to allow ImageJ calibration. The images were uploaded to a computer and opened with ImageJ. The wound outline was defined from the photographic image using a <b>digital</b> <b>pad,</b> and the ImageJ software calculated the wound area. The Visitrak method involved a 2 -layered transparent Visitrak film placed on the wound and the outline traced onto the film. The top layer containing the tracing was retraced onto the Visitrak <b>digital</b> <b>pad</b> using the Visitrak pen and the software calculated the wound area. Results: The average wound area using the photographic method was 52. 264 cm 2 and using Visitrak was 51. 703 cm 2. The mean difference in wound area was 0. 560 cm 2.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and molecular weight of epidermal proteins of gecko lizards {{have been studied}} by ultrastructural, autoradiographic, and immunological methods. Setae of the climbing <b>digital</b> <b>pads</b> are cross-reactive to antibodies directed against a chick scutate scale beta-keratin but not against feather beta-keratin. Cross-reactivity for mammalian loricrin, sciellin, filaggrin, and transglutaminase are present in alpha-keratogenic layers of gecko epidermis. Alpha-keratins have a molecular weight in the range 40 - 58 kDa. Loricrin cross-reactive bands have molecular weights of 42, 50, and 58 kDa. Bands for filaggrin-like protein are found at 35 and 42 kDa, bands for sciellin are found at 40 - 45 and 50 - 55 kDa, and bands for transglutaminase are seen at 48 - 50 and 60 kDa. The specific role of these proteins remains to be elucidated. After injection of tritiated histidine, the tracer is incorporated into keratin and in setae. Tritiated proline labels the developing setae of the oberhautchen and beta layers, and proline-labeled proteins (beta-keratins) of 10 - 14, 16 - 18, 22 - 24 and 32 - 35 kDa are extracted from the epidermis. In whole epidermal extract (that includes the epidermis with corneous layer and the setae of <b>digital</b> <b>pads),</b> beta-keratins of low-molecular weight (10, 14 - 16, and 18 - 19 kDa) are prevalent over those at higher molecular weight (34 and 38 kDa). In contrast, in shed epidermis of body scales (made of corneous layer only while setae were not collected), higher molecular weight beta-keratins are present (25 - 27 and 30 - 34 kDa). This suggests that a proportion of the small beta-keratins present in the epidermis of geckos derive from the differentiating beta layer of scales and from the setae of <b>digital</b> <b>pads.</b> Neither small nor large beta-keratins of gecko epidermis cross-react with an antibody specifically directed against the feather beta-keratin of 10 - 12 kDa. This result shows that the 10 and 14 - 16 kDa beta-keratins of gecko (lepidosaurian) have a different composition than the 10 - 12 kDa beta-keratin of feather (archosaurian). It is suggested that the smaller beta-keratins in both lineages of sauropsids were selected during evolution {{in order to build}} elongated bundles of keratin filaments to make elongated cells. Larger beta-keratins in reptilian scales produce keratin aggregations with no orientation, used for mechanical protection. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
