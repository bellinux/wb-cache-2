40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the largest longitudinal investigation of institutionalized children less than 2 years old ever conducted. The Bucharest <b>Early</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Project</b> is an ongoing randomized controlled trial of foster placement as an alternative to institutionalization in abandoned infants and toddlers being conducted in Bucharest, Romania. In addition to describing the contexts in which this study is imbedded, we also provide an overview of the sample, the measures, and the intervention. We hope that the natural experiment of institutionalization will allow us to examine directly the effects of intervention on early deprivation. We hope it will provide answers to many of the critical questions that developmentalists have asked about the effects of early experience, the timing of deprivation, and the ameliorating effects of early intervention and provide clues to which underlying neurobiological processes are compromised by, and resilient to, dramatic changes in early experience. The period from conception to age 3 years is unparalleled in the human life cycle for the rapidity, complexity, and profundity of developmental changes.

40|$|Developing a {{critical}} analysis of the relational and situated practices of social policy, this paper draws on an evaluation of an <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>project</b> in Scotland (UK) where volunteer adult mentors supported young people ‘at risk’ of offending or antisocial behaviour. Contributing to ‘enlivened’ accounts of social practice, we explore how practices of mentoring developed through the co-presence of mentor and young person in the often transitory spaces of care which characterized the ‘diversionary activities’ approach in the project. We expand {{the notion of the}} relational in social practice beyond the care-recipient dyad to include wider networks of care (families, programme workers, social institutions). The paper explores how such social interventions might both be ‘good’ for the young people involved, and yet recognize critiques that more individualized models of intervention inevitably have limitations which make them ‘not enough’ to deal with structural inequalities and disadvantages. Acknowledging the impacts of neoliberalism, we argue critical attention to diverse situated relational practices points to the excessive nature of engagement in social policy and provides scope for transformative practice where young people’s geographies can be ‘upscaled’ to connect to the realms of social policy and practice...|$|E

40|$|Early {{adversity}} can negatively {{impact the}} development of cognitive functions, although {{little is known about}} whether such effects can be remediated later in life. The current study examined one facet of executive functioning — inhibitory control — among children who experienced institutional care and explored the impact of a foster care intervention {{within the context of the}} Bucharest <b>Early</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Project</b> (BEIP). Specifically, a go/nogo task was administered when children were eight years old and behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures were collected. Results revealed that children assigned to care as usual (i. e., institutional care) were less accurate and exhibited slower neural responses compared to children assigned to the foster care intervention and children who had never been institutionalized. However, children in both the care as usual and foster care groups exhibited diminished attention processing of nogo cues as assessed via P 300 amplitude. Foster care children also showed differential reactivity between correct and error responses via the error-related negativity (ERN) as compared to children in the care as usual group. Combined, the results highlight perturbations in neural sources of behavioral and attention problems among children experiencing early adversity. Potential implications for academi...|$|E

Dependent measures included the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the Preschool Language Scale. Demographic data such as parent level of education, number of individuals living in the home, and family income were among the independent measures. Research hypotheses predicted the experimental group to score higher on posttest dependent measures as compared to the control group. Results did not support the research hypotheses. Although experimental group Mental Development Index (MDI) scores did increase in the predicted direction, this increase was not statistically significant. Further, two age groups within the control group also showed positive increases in MDI scores.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} a complex intervention programme entitled the 'Early Learning Partnership Project' (ELPP) which was rolled out across nine voluntary and community sector (VCS) agencies within the United Kingdom during a period of Government reform. It focused on parents of children aged between 1 - 3 who were at risk of learning delay, and aimed to increase parental involvement within children's learning as a precursor to reducing the later effects of disadvantage. A mixed methods evaluation examined the influence of ELPP. This paper reports specifically on a sample of parents from twenty 'exemplar' sites participating in the programme. Parents took part in a selection of structured observations (HOME and Book-sharing Observation) and structured questionnaires (Home Learning Environment, Parental Feelings Questionnaire and Father Involvement Questionnaire) across two time points. This paper shows that a short intervention with parents can influence parenting practices, personal beliefs and affective relationships with children. The findings suggest that through ELPP, a UK-based intervention, it is possible to improve levels of parental involvement and broaden the quality of the home learning environment via an <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>project</b> in a minimum of three months...|$|E
