5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways. They can be pressed into {{concrete}} or plaster to make decorative paths, steps or walls {{and can be}} used to embellish picture frames, mirrors or other craft items. They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments. They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting <b>implements.</b> Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone <b>implements,</b> perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When <b>implementing</b> a propagator for a constraint, {{one must}} decide about variants: When <b>implementing</b> min, should one also <b>implement</b> max? Should one <b>implement</b> linear {{equations}} both {{with and without}} coefficients? Constraint variants are ubiquitous: <b>implementing</b> them requires considerable effort, but yields better performance. This paper shows how to use variable views to derive perfect propagator variants: derived propagators inherit essential properties such as correctness and domain and bounds completeness. ...|$|R

It has a peak interprocessor bandwidth of 96GB/s and a peak memory bandwidth of 34GB/s. With QuickPath, the processor has integrated memory controllers and interfaces the memory directly, using QPI interfaces to directly connect to other processors and I/O hubs. QuickPath is also used on Intel processors using the Nehalem microarchitecture, making it probable that Tukwila and Nehalem {{will be able to}} use the same chipsets.|$|E
