50|$|Since 2010, all Mexican {{passports}} are biometric. All passport applicants {{must have}} their pictures taken digitally; all ten fingerprints are taken and an <b>iris</b> <b>scan</b> is done: Although Mexican passports are biometric, {{they do not}} contain a data chip.|$|E
50|$|Biometric {{authentication}} authenticates individuals {{by identifying}} their physiological or behavioral characteristic. The physiological features include {{but are not}} limited to fingerprint, hand geometry, retina scan, <b>iris</b> <b>Scan,</b> signature dynamics, keyboard dynamics, voice print, and facial scan. The most widely used biometric authentication nowadays is the fingerprint method.|$|E
50|$|Nok Nok Labs’s {{focus is}} authenticating user {{identity}} using whatever method {{is available on}} a user device (fingerprint, password, PIN, <b>iris</b> <b>scan,</b> voice, face recognition, etc.). The company has taken advantage of industry trends including the proliferation of mobile devices that are shipping with sophisticated authentication technologies such as fingerprint readers.|$|E

50|$|Mexico's Viajero Confiable {{program is}} open to Mexican {{citizens}} and US citizens {{who are members of}} Global Entry. Prospective members must pass a background check, interview with a Mexican immigration officer, and have fingerprints and <b>iris</b> <b>scans</b> taken. Kiosks are currently available at the Cancun, Los Cabos, and Mexico City international airports, but the Mexican government hopes to expand it to other cities in the near future.|$|R
50|$|Iris {{recognition}} - A form of authentication {{that uses}} data linked to features {{associated with the}} colored part of {{the eye of a}} user. It involves analyzing the patterns of the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil. It uses a fairly normal camera and does not require close contact between the eye and the scanner. Glasses can be worn during an <b>iris</b> <b>scan,</b> unlike a retinal scan.|$|E

50|$|The film flashes forward seven years. Ian {{has written}} a book on the {{evolution}} of the eye that he claims further debunks creationism. Ian and Karen are now married and Karen is pregnant. When their baby is born, the hospital takes an <b>iris</b> <b>scan</b> of him. The results are entered in the database and the program identifies the baby as a certain Paul Edgar Dairy. The nurse re-enters the results and the problem disappears.|$|E

50|$|CATSA also {{completed}} {{the first phase}} of its Restricted Area Identity Card (RAIC) program in January 2007. This program replaces the old Airport Restricted Area Passes issued to airport employees after security checks by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Transport Canada with new cards (issued after the same checks are conducted) that contain biometric information (fingerprints and <b>iris</b> <b>scans)</b> belonging to the person issued the RAIC.|$|R
50|$|A {{few months}} later, a Doctor Simmons calls, {{claiming}} that {{a test of}} the baby's urine may indicate an elevated risk of autism and recommending a further test. But Ian and Karen become suspicious during this test and decide to investigate Doctor Simmons. They find that she is in fact one of a few people with full access to the <b>iris</b> <b>scan</b> database. Ian tracks some pictures from this test to Idaho where he stumbles on the family of Paul Edgar Dairy, who apparently died just before their baby was conceived.|$|E
50|$|India's {{national}} ID {{program called}} Aadhaar {{is the largest}} biometric database in the world. It is a biometrics-based digital identity assigned for a person's lifetime, verifiable online instantly in the public domain, at any time, from anywhere, in a paperless way. It is designed to enable government agencies to deliver a retail public service, securely based on biometric data (fingerprint, <b>iris</b> <b>scan</b> and face photo), along with demographic data (name, age, gender, address, parent/spouse name, mobile phone number) of a person. The data is transmitted in encrypted form over the internet for authentication, aiming to free it from the limitations of physical presence of a person at a given place.|$|E
50|$|Traditional DNA profiling, {{sometimes}} referred to as DNA fingerprinting, uses DNA as a biometric identifier. Like an <b>iris</b> <b>scan</b> or fingerprint, a DNA profile can uniquely identify an individual with very high accuracy. For forensic purposes, this means that investigators must have already identified and obtained DNA from a potentially matching individual. DNA phenotyping is used when investigators need to narrow the pool of possible individuals or identify unknown remains by learning about the person’s ancestry and appearance. When the suspected individual is identified, traditional DNA profiling can be used to prove a match, provided there is a reference sample {{that can be used for}} comparison.|$|E
40|$|It is a newer {{method of}} {{biometric}} authentication that uses specific pattern recognition techniques based on high-resolution {{images of the}} iris of an individual's eyes. <b>Iris</b> <b>scanning</b> system {{is considered to be}} the best biometric performer because it has very low false reject rates and also faster identification facilities. The technique is gaining importance amidst modern threats of Terrorism, High security needs in order to ensure safety of people around the world.

50|$|The {{lawsuit was}} {{filed in the}} U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Verified Identity Pass Inc., by Schneider Wallace Cottrell Brayton Konecky LLP and Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP. The suit claims that by ceasing {{operations}} and not offering refunds, VIP committed conversion, fraud, breach of contract, negligence and unjust enrichment. Additional lawsuits since have focused upon demanding the return or destruction of personal information, social security numbers, credit card numbers, fingerprints and <b>iris</b> <b>scans</b> in addition to refunding membership fees.|$|R
40|$|The Department of Homeland Security is {{deploying}} the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) to U. S. ports to {{help ensure}} only authorized individuals having undergone background checks have access to secure areas. Congress mandated the TWIC have a biometric authenticator; DHS chose fingerprints. This thesis argues <b>iris</b> <b>scanning</b> is a better choice {{because of the nature}} of the maritime environment and because <b>iris</b> <b>scanning</b> is a more accurate biometric. This thesis also argues there are social factors affecting a biometric-enabled identification card which must be considered for the program to be successful. To investigate the issue of biometrics and the TWIC, this thesis performed a field study of an iris scanner; a survey of biometric attitudes, and interviews with members of the PMA and the ILWU. The iris study operated the scanner in an identification mode, experiencing no false acceptances and few false rejects; however it found the scanner sensitive to sun position with respect to the subject. The pilot study of attitudes found subjects supportive of biometrics in scenarios currently requiring positive identification, but opposing them when it would create new requirements for identification. Both pilot studies were impacted by an inability to provide an incentive to study subjects. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
