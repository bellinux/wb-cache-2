5|$|The {{cotingas}} are {{birds of}} forests or forest edges in tropical Central and South America. Comparatively little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> diverse group, although all have broad bills with hooked tips, rounded wings, and strong legs. The males {{of many of}} the species are brightly colored or decorated with plumes or wattles.|$|E
5|$|The deity {{depicted}} on page 9 of the Grolier Codex {{is believed to}} be the Mountain God with split head. This image was otherwise unknown in the 1960s. Other examples of it were later discovered at the Maya sites of Tancah and Pasión del Cristo. Coe and his colleagues argue that it is very unlikely that a forger would have <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> deity before it was described elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|After Mindaugas' death, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania entered {{times of}} {{relative}} instability, as {{reflected by the}} fact that seven Grand Dukes held the title {{over the course of the}} next 32 years. Little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> period, but the Gediminid dynasty was founded in about 1280. Despite the instability, the Grand Duchy did not disintegrate. Vytenis assumed power in 1295, and during the next 20 years laid solid foundations for the Duchy to expand and grow under the leadership of Gediminas and his son Algirdas. While the Grand Duchy was established between 1219 and 1295, the years after 1295 marked its expansion.|$|E

5|$|Documents {{mention the}} {{construction}} of another bucentaur in 1449 larger than the 1311 one, but little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> vessel. The earliest known image of a bucentaur appeared in Jacopo de' Barbari's monumental woodcut Pianta di Venezia (Map of Venice) {{which was published in}} 1500. This work pictured a bucentaur afloat in the Arsenale without oars or decoration save for a large wooden sculpture of Justice in the bow. A similar illustration was produced by Andrea Valvassore between 1517 and 1525.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War {{the largest}} {{substantial}} {{conflict in the}} area was the Battle of Naseby in 1645, although a minor skirmish in the town resulted {{in the killing of}} a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer. Severe reprisals followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest, Thomas Jones, and 40 prisoners by a group of Roundheads. However, after the Civil War Wellingborough was home to a colony of Diggers. Little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> period.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{may include}} beetles and sciomyzid fly larvae, {{many of which}} {{specialize}} in feeding upon snails. Other potential predators may include the northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata), northern dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus), and Allegheny Mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ochrophaeus), which are common in the talus and on the ledges, as well as various small mammals or passerine birds such as robins and pigeons, which are often seen {{in or near the}} habitat. Although predation {{does not appear to be}} a limiting factor at this time, its potential impact on a low or stressed population is unclear. The 1978 listing rule included predation by the introduced European snails, Discus rotundatus and Oxychilus spp. as serious threats to Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. Little is currently <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> relationship.|$|E

5|$|The shapeshifter was {{an enigmatic}} and mysterious {{character}} in the StarCraft Universe. Very little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> creature, beyond {{the fact that the}} shapeshifter was in fact a Xel'Naga, and was by its own admission several thousand years old. In each case that the shapeshifter has appeared in a meaningful role the creature has assumed the form of a Terran Male. The Shapeshifter's allegiance was to the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, and accordingly its actions were to further Amon's own goals.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 he {{designed}} a funerary chapel for the Güell {{family at the}} abbey of Montserrat, but little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> work, which was never built. That year, construction finally began on the Bodegas Güell, the 1882 project for a hunting lodge and some wineries at La Cuadra de Garraf (Sitges), property of Eusebi Güell. Constructed between 1895 and 1897 {{under the direction of}} Francesc Berenguer, Gaudí's aide, the wineries have a triangular end facade, a very steep stone roof, a group of chimneys and two bridges that join them to an older building. It has three floors: the bottom one for a garage, an apartment and a chapel with catenary arches, with the altar in the centre. It was completed with a porter's lodge, notable for the iron gate {{in the shape of a}} fishing net.|$|E
5|$|Little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> species' behavior. The Congo serpent eagle {{lives in}} the {{understory}} of its habitat and occasionally perches on lower boughs in tall trees. It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially chameleons, toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the understory, where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light, though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E

5|$|The North Pacific {{right whale}} appears {{to occur in}} two {{population}}s. The population in the eastern North Pacific/Bering Sea is extremely low, numbering about 30 individuals. A larger western population of 100–200 appears to be surviving in the Sea of Okhotsk, but very little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> population. Thus, the two northern right whale species are the most endangered of all large whales {{and two of the}} most endangered animal species in the world. Based on current population density trends, both species are predicted to become extinct within 200 years. The Pacific species was historically found in summer from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east, generally north of 50°N. Today, sightings are very rare and generally occur in the mouth of the Sea of Okhotsk and in the eastern Bering Sea. Although this species is very likely to be migratory like the other two species, its movement patterns are not known.|$|E
