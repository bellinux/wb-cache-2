It is a construction element consisting of base material made of <b>graphitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and reinforcing steel insertion of simple geometric shape. The structural unit of a “brake shoe” must be functional during train wheels braking. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} design a computational model allowing to simulate operation load and to predict future failure. Because of that, this paper focuses on structural properties with an impact on the construction unit material properties required for computational modeling. Manufacturing technology affects the quality of the final structure whose character may be the cause of the failure initiation.

The experimental part of the thesis presents the results of performance assessment of brazed joints on other than CuZn basis using silicone (CuSi 3 Mn 1) or aluminium bronze (CuAl 10 Fe). TIG electrical arc was used as a source of heat to melt these filler materials. The results show satisfactory brazed joints with a CuAl 10 Fe filler metal, while pre-heating is not necessary, which favours this method greatly while repairing sizeable castings. The technological procedure recommends the use of AC current with an increased frequency and a modified balance between positive and negative electric arc polarity to focus the heat on a filler metal without melting the base material. The suitability of the joint is evaluated on the basis of visual inspection, mechanic and metallographic testing...|$|E

40|$|The narrow {{production}} {{window for}} compacted graphite iron material (CGI) drastically reduces {{the possibilities to}} produce it in small batches outside an industrial environment. This fact hinders laboratory-scale investigations on CGI solidiﬁcation. This work presents a solution to that issue by introducing an experimental technique to produce <b>graphitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> of the main three families. Samples of a base hypereutectic spheroidal graphite iron (SGI) were re-melted in a resistance furnace under Ar atmosphere. Varying the holding time at 1723 K (1450 °C), graphitic irons ranging from spheroidal to lamellar were produced. Characterization of the graphite morphology evolution, in terms of nodularity {{as a function of}} holding time, is presented. The nodularity decay for the SGI region suggests a linear correlation with the holding time. In the CGI region, nodularity deterioration shows a slower rate, concluding with the sudden appearance of lamellar graphite. The fading process of magnesium, showing agreement with previous researchers, is described by means of empirical relations as a function of holding time and nodularity. The results on nodularity fade and number of nodules per unit area fade suggest that both phenomena occur simultaneously during the fading process of magnesium.

40|$|Cast iron {{components}} in combustion engines, such as cylinder blocks and heads of trucks, are exposed {{for long periods}} of time to elevated temperatures. Moreover, the engines are started and stopped frequently during their operational life, constituting a large number of heating and cooling cycles. In geometrical complex components the sudden heating (starting the engine) and cooling (stopping the engine) lead to thermal gradients and thermal mismatch within the material, resulting in the local development of high stress levels. The many start-stop operations and their associated alternating stress levels can lead to a localized cracking phenomenon known as Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue (TMF). Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) is a common material of choice for diesel engine cylinder heads of heavy trucks and is a type of <b>graphitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> consisting of vermicular graphite particles embedded in a metal matrix of pearlite. This material provides a suitable combination of thermal and mechanical properties, satisfying the functional requirements of these engine components. The main aim of this research is to identify and understand the damage micro-mechanisms that control thermo-mechanical fatigue phenomena in cast iron (CGI). The acquired knowledge is of relevance for predicting the lifetime, improving the properties and increasing the reliability of diesel truck cylinder heads. The work of this study can roughly be categorized into three main subjects: (i) Microstructural evolutions of CGI at elevated temperatures, (ii) TMF crack growth characterization and (iii) precise microstructural analysis of the TMF-crack path. Microstructural Evolutions of CGI at Elevated Temperatures In a first series of experiments, time and temperature induced microstructural changes in CGI were characterized, in view of their possible role in the TMF behavior of CGI. During open air annealing of CGI at 420 °C microstructural changes take place in the material, which gave rise to volume expansion and weight increase. The weight increase can be explained by considering the formation of an oxide scale whereas the volume expansion can be attributed to the decomposition of pearlite into ferrite and graphite. It was observed that the atmosphere is of crucial importance in this process. Annealing in an open-air atmosphere produced ten times less volume expansion as compared to annealing in vacuum conditions. Internal oxidation was observed during annealing under atmospheric conditions and the presence of an internal oxidation layer largely inhibited the progress of pearlite decomposition. The observed oxide layers at the internal metal/vapour interface of cavities (left behind by denuded graphite) cause the obstruction of carbon diffusion and thus the suppression of the pearlite decomposition process. In addition it was found that the depth of the oxidized zone near the surface (the oxide penetration depth) was of the same order of magnitude as the eutectic cell size, i. e. the volume in which graphite particles are interconnected. This suggests that the interconnectivity of the graphite has a dominant influence on the kinetics of the oxidation process. The microstructural dependence of tensile and fatigue properties of CGI at room temperature were evaluated by an extended annealing treatment of 720 h at 420 °C. This extended annealing treatment leads to better tensile (increase in yield strength, ductility) and dynamic properties (fatigue lifetime) at room temperature. The variations of mechanical properties were observed both after annealing under atmospheric and vacuum conditions, but were more pronounced after vacuum annealing. This can be explained by the decomposition of the pearlite phase during annealing and the formation of new ferrite at the graphite/metal interface. It is assumed that the ferrite/graphite interface exhibits a stronger bond than the pearlite/graphite interface. As this stronger bond will be better resistant to delamination, it will strengthen the material both in static and dynamic loading. Such effects were far less pronounced in the open-air annealed material, which could be associated with the fact that it was shown that internal oxidation strongly reduced the kinetics of decomposition. TMF Crack Growth Characterization An important part of this study was to measure and analyze the TMF lifetime of CGI. For smooth and notched specimens, the TMF lifetime was measured in TMF tests under total-constraint conditions, with temperatures cycling between 50 °C and 420 °C. By considering the notch depth as the initial crack length, TMF lifetimes were reproduced numerically using the Paris equation for fatigue crack growth (da/dN = C (?K) m). The calculated lifetimes were found to be in good agreement with all experimental results, covering a wide range of TMF lifetimes from 30 to 1400 cycles. Also for smooth specimens the Paris model worked well by considering the typical graphite particle size as notch depth. It is one of the main conclusions of this work that graphite particles act as internal notches from which a TMF crack almost immediately starts to grow during the first TMF cycles. Hence, it was established that TMF lifetime in CGI is governed by crack growth and not by crack initiation. The relevance of the Paris growth law was further confirmed by meticulously measuring the actual crack growth rates for three typical values of the stress intensity factor. The resulting crack growth rates proved to be in reasonable agreement with the predicted values according to the Paris model. It was further shown that the cyclic plasticity of the bulk material, accumulated during TMF cycles, does not have a noticeable effect on TMF lifetime (i. e. crack growth rates are not affected). The notched dog-bone specimen geometry is proposed in this work as a valid alternative for monitoring the TMF behavior of CGI. By applying standard TMF tests with notched specimens, it was possible to significantly reduce both testing time and experimental data scatter, whilst preserving a realistic estimation of the lifetime of the smooth sample. The effect of prolonged holding times (HT) on TMF lifetime was studied by using notched specimens and a clear effect was observed. Extended holding times were accompanied by an increased relaxation of compressive stresses, causing higher tensile stresses to develop in the subsequent low temperature stages of the TMF cycles. So, extended HTs had an adverse effect on the sample lifetime with a saturating effect for HTs above 1800 s. The Paris fatigue-crack-growth model was used also to estimate the impact of extended HTs. According to the Paris growth law, using a fixed value of tensile stress at low temperature, it was estimated that an increase of holding time from 30 s to 18000 s (5 h) produced a drop of 45 % in lifetime. In reality a 60 % drop in lifetime was measured, though, which implies that a combined effect of (tensile) stress and microstructural evolution during TMF is responsible for the reduction of lifetime. Precise Microstructural Analysis of the TMF Crack Path To the purpose of precise characterization of the complex TMF-crack-path morphology in CGI in relation to local microstructural features and to find out how and by which mechanisms the cracks predominantly develop, 2 D and 3 D orientation contrast imaging was carried out on wide field sample volumes, covering several mm 3 of imaged material. The data analysis revealed that the crystal planes that are parallel to the (local) crack plane are essentially of a random orientation. Conversely, it was found that graphite particles do not only play a crucial role in the crack initiation, but also are of primary significance for crack propagation. Quantitative analysis of the EBSD data in 2 D and 3 D showed that the distribution of graphite particles is very important for the crack propagation, as it was revealed that graphite particles enhance crack growth. It was statistically proven that the density of graphite particles in the crack plane is more than double of the density in an arbitrary plane. Our materials knowledge, based on the interpretation of test results in terms of quantifiable microstructural data functions, is of crucial importance to develop a microstructurally based TMF model.

40|$|Compacted {{graphite}} iron (CGI) is rapidly becoming an attractive alternative material for engine {{components in the}} automotive industry, replacing lamellar {{graphite iron}} (LGI) in applications where high mechanical strength is desired. However, the gain in mechanical strength comes with a cost; thermal conductivity, process control and machining are three areas that are more challenging for CGI. This generates a need for research regarding various aspects concerning CGI. In this thesis the microstructure formation during solidification and solid state transformation will {{be the focus of}} interest. The phase transformations relevant for microstructure formation of importance to properties in CGI were studied. Experiments were performed in an industrial foundry giving this research direct relevance to regular production of CGI castings. Solidification of the grey (graphite/austenite) eutectic will be discussed, focusing on some relevant aspects influencing the graphite morphology of CGI. The formation of graphite nodules has been investigated by studying colour-etched microstructures. In a material containing mainly CGI cells it was found that nodules form either early during solidification as a consequence of high undercooling or late in the solidification sequence due to a combination of high undercooling and segregation of nodularising elements. Solidification of the white (cementite/austenite) eutectic was studied using chill wedges and the influence of some alloying elements on the amount of carbides was examined. To further enhance the understanding of carbide formation in CGI a commercial casting simulation software was used to correlate real castings to simulations. It was found that the alloying elements investigated influence the carbide formation in a similar way as in other <b>graphitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and that high nodularity CGI is more prone to chill formation than low nodularity CGI. The solid state transformation was studied and a deterministic model was developed. The model divides a eutectic cell into layers, in order to take into account segregation of alloying elements, which was observed to be influential for the ferrite growth. Moreover, the effect of alloying elements on mechanical properties (tensile properties and hardness) was evaluated. Properties were correlated to microstructural features originating from both solidification and solid state transformations. The trends found generally confirmed previous results regarding properties in <b>graphitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons...</b>|$|R

40|$|Compacted {{graphite}} iron is rapidly becoming an attractive alternative for engine {{applications in the}} automotive industry. The improved process control now available that allows CGI components to be cast in a reproducible and reliable way has been the driving force for this development. To be able to optimise the properties in a CGI component {{it is crucial to}} have extensive knowledge of the factors influencing microstructure formation in the material. To understand microstructure formation and how the microstructure influences the mechanical properties a series casting trials were performed. A hemispherical sampling cup was used enabling temperature measurements as well as evaluation of the microstructure and a geometry consisting of cylinders of different diameters was used to obtain tensile test bars. A range of cooling rates and chemical compositions were studied in the casting experiments, resulting in substantial differences in both graphite morphology and matrix structure, suggesting that mechanical properties will vary accordingly. Nineteen trials were cast investigating the influence of varying: nodularity treatment level, Cu-content, Si-content, Sn-content and varying content of carbide promoting elements (Cr, Mn and Mo). It was found {{that the majority of the}} investigated alloying elements (Cu, Mg, Si and Sn) affect the graphite morphology. Similar to other <b>graphitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> Cu, Sn and carbide promoting elements promote pearlite formation in CGI, while Si promotes ferrite formation. It was also found that higher nodularity favours a pearlitic matrix structure. Mechanical properties are generally raised by increasing nodularity and increasing pearlite content, but a contribution from solution hardening of ferrite was found at high Si-contents. The influence of carbides on mechanical properties was negligible, for the investigated alloying contents and cooling conditions. From the microstructure investigation it was found that CGI is prone to develop a ferritic matrix. It was also clear that segregation of pearlite and ferrite promoting elements influenced the ferrite content. A deterministic model was developed to describe the ferrite growth in CGI. The growth rate of the ferrite border was assumed to be determined by an interface reaction at the ferrite-graphite interface, and that specifically the amount of carbon atoms that can be added to the graphite played a dominant role...|$|R
5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of <b>graphitic</b> carbon in <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} multiaxial {{elastoplastic}} behaviour of <b>graphitic</b> grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{with the aim}} to provide physically appropriate and numerically reliable constitutive relations for use in FE-codes. To achieve this goal, this work {{is divided into three}} parts: Biaxial experiments are performed on thin cruciform specimens. An existing biaxial hydraulic test unit is equipped with new control and data acquisition modules and a fixture to facilitate compressive loading without excessive out of plane displacements. A test series is performed on some 30 specimens subjected to different ratios of loads in two perpendicular in-plane directions. Several tests included load histories resulting in reversed plasticity. Based on experimentally determined points of initial yielding and hardening behaviour, constitutive equations founded on the classical incremental theory of plasticity are proposed. It is then assumed that the grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> behaves as a continuum due to the randomness of the distribution of graphite flakes in the pearlitic matrix. For biaxial compressive loadings the material response is governed by the pearlitic matrix, thus resembling the behaviour of many ordinary steels. Yielding in compression is therefore described with a von Mises yield function together with the yield strength, sc, in uniaxial compression. Recorded stress-strain curves in biaxial tension or in tension-compression are found to be more nonlinear with global nonelastic strains observed at very low stress levels. This is explained by severe notch effects of the graphite flakes and the resulting formation of voids and microcracks. The nonelastic strains are here treated as plastic strains (time independent), and yielding is modelled with a von Mises yield function with a term proportional to the first invariant of the stress tensor, I 1 = skk, added. This, so-called, modified von Mises yield condition employs two yield stresses, sc, as mentioned above, and the yield stress sT in uniaxial tension which is initially chosen as sT = sc/ 3. The hardening behaviour is modelled by linear isotropic hardening or linear Prager kinematic hardening. In both cases different hardening parameters in tension and compression are employed. Associated and non-associated flow rules are evaluated. The kinematic hardening rule together with an associated flow rule is found to give the best agreement with experimental results involving reversed plasticity. For cyclic loadings a kinematic hardening model with multi-linear hardening in tension is proposed. The constitutive equations proposed are implemented into the commercially available FE-code ABAQUS, through a user-supplied material routine. An operator-split algorithm (elastic predictor, plastic corrector) in combination with a consistent tangent modulus is used for the integration of the constitutive relation proposed. As an application, a fully three-dimensional study of a cylinder head made of grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> for a heavy duty Diesel truck engine is performed.
