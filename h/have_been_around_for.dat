25|$|Though {{there is}} {{evidence}} that ocular implants <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> thousands of years modern nonintegrated spherical intraconal implants came into existence around 1976 (not just glass eyes). Nonintegrated implants contain no unique apparatus for attachments to the extraocular muscles and do not allow in-growth of organic tissue into their inorganic substance. Such implants have no direct attachment to the ocular prosthesis. Usually, these implants are covered with a material that permits ﬁxation of the extraocular recti muscles, such as donor sclera or polyester gauze which improves implant motility, but does not allow for direct mechanical coupling between the implant and the artiﬁcial eye.|$|E

500|$|The {{fossil record}} tells a {{different}} story. [...] Although it cannot show the earliest possible {{date for the}} appearance of a taxonomic group, other concerns have arisen about these vastly earlier divergence dates predicted independently of the fossil record. [...] First, palaeontologists have expressed concerns that if primates <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> significantly more than 66million years, then the first one-third of the primate fossil record is missing. [...] Another problem is that some of these molecular dates have overestimated the divergence of other mammalian orders, such as Rodentia, suggesting primate divergence might also be overestimated. [...] One of the oldest known strepsirrhines, Djebelemur, dates from the early Eocene of northern Africa and lacks a fully differentiated toothcomb. [...] Based on fossils and other genetic tests, a more conservative estimate dates the divergence between lemurs and lorises to around 50 to 55mya.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film, remarking, [...] "It's clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone's seen time and again, and the characters <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> {{more than half a}} century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again." [...] To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. [...] "It's also the blockbuster," [...] Travers said, [...] "I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's Transformers with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor." [...] Justin Chang of Variety wrote, [...] "Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the film's frenetic pace, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that it [...] "provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable". Conversely, A. O. Scott of The New York Times believed that [...] "while The Avengers is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre." ...|$|E
