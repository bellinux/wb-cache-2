25|$|At a more {{integrative}} level, {{the primary}} {{function of the}} nervous system is to control the body. It does this by extracting information from the environment using sensory receptors, sending signals that encode this information into the central nervous system, processing the information to determine an appropriate response, and sending output signals to muscles or glands to activate the response. The evolution of a complex nervous system has made it possible for various animal species to have advanced perception abilities such as vision, complex social interactions, rapid coordination of organ systems, and <b>integrated</b> <b>processing</b> of concurrent signals. In humans, the sophistication {{of the nervous system}} makes it possible to have language, abstract representation of concepts, transmission of culture, and many other features of human society that would not exist without the human brain.|$|E

2500|$|The ship’s stern hangar {{accommodates}} 1 Kamov Ka-28 (export {{version of}} the Kamov Ka-27, NATO codename: Helix) antisubmarine warfare (ASW) helicopter, or alternatively, 1 Z-9 ASW helicopter (Chinese {{version of the}} Eurocopter Dauphin AS 365N), and both type can carry various weapons including torpedoes and depth charges. [...] The Ka-28 helicopter can operate in all weather conditions up to 200nbsp&km from the host ship, but its onboard dipping sonar only has half {{the range of the}} Chinese copy of the French dipping sonar on board Z-9, furthermore, it lacks the processing capability to process the information gathered, so the information has to be passed back to the host ship for processing via data links, while in contrast, Z-9 can process information gathered on board the helicopter, but with shorter range. [...] Z-9 can process information on board because it is equipped with IPS, short for <b>Integrated</b> <b>Processing</b> System, which is essentially an airborne version of combat data system, which also is a subsystem of the combat data system on board the mother ship. [...] Type 052C is the first warship in Chinese navy to be equipped with IPS, and after evaluation which judged to be successful, IPS is fitted to all other Z-9 helicopters in Chinese navy during scheduled upgrades.|$|E

40|$|Neuronal {{activity}} in sensory and fronto-parietal (FP) areas underlies the representation and attentional control, respectively, of sensory information maintained in visual working memory (VWM). Within these regions, beta/gamma phase-synchronization supports {{the integration of}} sensory functions, while synchronization in theta/alpha bands supports the regulation of attentional functions. A key challenge is to understand which mechanisms <b>integrate</b> neuronal <b>processing</b> across these distinct frequencies and thereby the sensory and attentional functions. We investigated whether such integration could be achieved by cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS). Using concurrent magneto- and electroencephalography, we found that CFS was load-dependently enhanced between theta and alpha gamma and between alpha and beta-gamma oscillations during VWM maintenance among visual, FP, and dorsal attention (DA) systems. CFS also connected the hubs of within-frequency-synchronized networks and its strength predicted individual VWM capacity. We propose that CFS <b>integrates</b> <b>processing</b> among synchronized neuronal networks from theta to gamma frequencies to link sensory and attentional functions...|$|R
