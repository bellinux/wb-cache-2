An OS personality is implemented via a set of user-mode DLLs (see Dynamic-link library), which are mapped into application processes' address spaces as required, together with an emulation subsystem server process (as described previously). Applications access system services by calling into the OS personality DLLs mapped into their address spaces, which in turn call into the NT run-time library (ntdll.dll), also mapped into the process address space.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 A {{generalized}} {{modeling system}} {{was developed for}} digital computer simulation of the pharmacodynamic response of selected chemicals introduced into mammalian systems. The modeling system {{is based on the}} compartmental approach used extensively in pharmacodynamic studies in which the mammal is assumed to be subdivided into compartments which interact by means of blood and other fluid flow according to the actual anatomical and physiological characteristics. <b>Executive</b> <b>routines</b> are provided to automatically formulate and solve all differential equations required in all subregions of all compartments. Utility routines are provided to facilitate rapid input and output of data and results. Complex simulations can be performed for a variety of situations with minimal computer programming by the user. The model of each compartment consists of transport fluid, interstitial and intracellular subregions. Any number of transport fluid subregions in series can be specified which interact with a single interstitial subregion. The interstitial subregion also interacts with any number of specified intracellular subregions. Provision is made for combining any or all of the subregions with the interstitial subregion in the absence of mass transfer resistance between that subregion and the interstitial fluid in order to reduce numerical computation time. Chemical reaction can occur by Michealis-Menten kinetics in any subregion. Source and excretion of chemical must be defined by specially written routines by the user of the generalized modeling system. Equilibrium protein binding of chemical can occur on protein binding sites which are specified by data input. The generalized pharmacodynamic modeling system was tested by reproducing several pharmacodynamic studies reported in the literature. In addition, the uptake and distribution of methyl mercury in rats was modeled using the generalized system. The model was constructed with six compartments: blood, liver, kidney, muscle, GI, and other tissue. No resistance to mass transfer was assumed between the transport fluid and the interstitial subregion. Methyl mercury was assumed to be bound to hemoglobin and albumin in blood and to albumin only in the interstitial subregion. The binding of methyl mercury to protein in the various tissue and the mass transfer coefficients between interstitial and intracellular subregions were adjusted to promote agreement between model and experimental tissue distribution data {{due to the lack of}} this information. Excretion of methyl mercury in feces was modeled by assuming that fecal excretion included ten percent of the methyl mercury in the bile from the liver in addition to the excretion by exfoliation of the epithelial cells of the small intestine. Excretion of methyl mercury in urine was assumed to be proportional to the concentration of methyl mercury in the cells of the kidney. Good agreement was obtained between the model and the experimental data of Dr. Fang (1976) ...|$|R

40|$|The United States Senate now {{operates}} as a sixty-vote chamber. Nearly every action, from passing significant legislation to consenting to <b>routine</b> <b>executive</b> nominations, requires support from a supermajority of senators. The basis for the sixty-vote Senate rests with Rule XXII, defining the standard for invoking cloture to end debate. A largely ignored provision of the Constitution renders Rule XXII suspect. Article I, Section 3 states, in part, “Each Senator shall have one Vote. ” Conventional wisdom misidentifies this clause as serving only the basic purpose of denoting a change from the state-based voting practiced under the Articles of Confederation. The history of the Senate’s creation reveals, however, that the provision is better read as meeting the Framers’ goal of devising an active, effective upper chamber, and that they instilled in the “Each Senator” language the principles of equality and representation. Relying on the Supreme Court’s one person, one vote jurisprudence as a roadmap, this Article argues that because Rule XXII serves to disproportionately weight its members’ votes, it violates Article I, Section 3 ’s command of senatorial voting equality...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to highly controversial statements issued by President George W. Bush upon signing various bills into law, an American Bar Association Task Force and Senator Arlen Specter both recently {{called for the}} creation of a cause of action to obtain a federal judicial declaration concerning the legal validity of future presidential signing statements. This essay argues that such legislation would be ill-advised and counterproductive. It would exacerbate existing underlying institutional infirmities. More fundamentally, the inclination to facilitate immediate resort to the judiciary for resolution of a dispute between the political branches about the President 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional obligations is premised on an unidentified, unjustified (and in my view unjustifiable) assumption about the relative roles of Congress and the Court. Specifically, the proposed law assumes that the Court, rather than Congress, is primarily responsible for ensuring that the President remains subject to the rule of law. This premise has matters backwards. Under our constitutional text, structure, and traditions, properly understood, Congress has far greater competence and legitimacy than do the courts to undertake the awesome task of compelling presidential compliance with the Constitution and laws of the United States. It is the judicial role in so doing that can be best understood as incidental and sharply circumscribed by concerns about competence and legitimacy. Indeed, absent longstanding congressional neglect of its many, powerful tools for disciplining the <b>executive</b> branch, <b>routine</b> and open presidential assertions of the intent to disregard statutory provisions just signed into law would be all but inconceivable. Were Congress to act on Senator Specter 2 ̆ 7 s pending bill, the resulting legislation would further entrench this congressional neglect and atrophy the congressional muscles alone capable of resisting a truly lawless President. Ironically, the bill 2 ̆ 7 s unintended but most significant long-term consequence would be to make all the more likely the kind of presidential usurpation of the law-making function that the ABA Task Force report and Senator Specter warn against...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{progress}} in devising technological aids to decision makers, most decisions are largely or entirely {{the product of}} intuitive, psychological processes. Many times, aids are not available (e. g., under field conditions); at other times, too many decisions {{have to be made}} to rely on more than educated intuition (e. g., those made by an officer or <b>executive</b> during a <b>routine</b> day); even when the stakes involved clearly justify investment in aids, time pressures may make that impossible (e. g., crisis situations). Moreover, the use of formal aids has a strong judgmental component. If these psychological processes are to be improved, they. must first be understood. For many years, the dominant model for describing many kinds of decisions has been a weighted average model. In this view, people make decisions on the basis of arithmetic calculations that systematically consider the magnitude of all possible consequences of a decision and the chances of achieving them. Ii Reviewing many research results, the present report concludes: (a) the ability of the weighted average models to *predict the decisions that people make varies from situation to situation; (b) even where they are successful in predicting decisions, these models may not {{do a very good job}} of describing the psychological processes that determined them. That is, their predictive accuracy is in part an artifact of the research techniques used.

40|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{literature}} concerning the personnel <b>executive</b> deals with <b>routine</b> activities and excludes consideration of the social forces impacting on the external business environment. Also, {{the literature}} chiefly focuses on how to administer the personnel function rather than how to direct {{the efforts of the}} personnel function toward contributing more directly to the achievement of corporate objectives. ^ This study was undertaken to evaluate the adequacy of the current role of the personnel executive in light of the realities in the changing business environment. In addition, it proposed to define the traditional role of the personnel executive as perceived by the corporation, determine the self-defined role of the personnel executive, and appraise both of these roles in terms of potential for contributing to the achievement of corporate objectives. ^ Most of the subjects for the study were personnel executives employed by the 500 largest private employers in the United States as identified by Forbes. Two instruments were used in the collection of data; questionnaires and interviews. These instruments yielded similar information and provided insight into how the respondents received their jobs, the changing nature of their corporate roles, and their interpretation of the changing business environment and the potential impact of external change. ^ The study 2 ̆ 7 s principal conclusion concerns the inadequacy of the current role of many personnel executives in light of the changing business environment. While many personnel executives acknowledge the changing business environment, they seem to fail to understand its relevance in relation to their corporate roles. Also, most personnel executive roles are defined generally by standards devised by the corporation. As a results, many personnel executives define their roles according to those corporate caveats. Finally, the traditional role of the personnel executive has generally made it difficult for personnel executives to take the responsibility for directing their performance toward contributing to the achievement of corporate results. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} explores three related {{questions about}} the 'Next Steps' agency model and agencification processes in the UK central state between 1988 and 1998. First, how did the creation of agencies, or agencification, work in the period and was the reform a substantial change. Second, why was the reform adopted and did agencies bring about benefits {{in the delivery of}} services. Third, what is the likely course of future developments in the use of agencies. The first question is explored in Part One. The agency model is identified as a set of institutions, or structures, for delivering public services proposed by government actors who developed the 'Next Steps' reform. The UK central state made extensive use of the agency model in the period 1988 to 1998. Over the period, 155 agencies were created. By 1998, 65 per cent of civil servants worked in 138 agencies. The 'Next Steps' reform was predominately mitigated agencification, where there was already some separation of activities prior to the reform. This type of agencification accounted for 69 per cent of cases. There was pure agencification in 14 per cent of cases, in which the reform was an even more significant reorganisation; the case of the Benefits Agency was an example of this form of agency creation. However, in 14 per cent of cases, there was nominal change and the reform was largely a relabelling exercise. New function agencification was found in only 2 per cent of cases. The second question is explored in Part Two. The official justifications for the reform were fragmented and, at some points, inconsistent. The public interest model, based on official accounts, suggests that senior officials and politicians had the goals of delivering public services in an efficient and effective manner with maximum economy, expressed through minimising transaction costs associated with delivering services. Agencies promoted this goal in handling <b>routine,</b> <b>executive</b> activities rather than non-routine, policy activities. However, the public interest model {{does not seem to be}} consistent with disputes between parts of the central state, the bracketing of nominal changes with more significant ones under the overall 'Next Steps' reform banner, and use of the agency model for non-routine policy work were inconsistent with the model. The performance of agencies did not match all the expectations of the public interest model. The institutional rational choice approach, through Patrick Dunleavy's bureau-shaping model, makes a substantial contribution to understanding why the reform occurred. But the original model is inadequate for explaining the 'Next Steps' reform. The mark II bureau-shaping model overcomes the inadequacies of the original model and is an important theoretical advance. The model is supported by evidence about developments during the period. Senior officials in the departments saw their role primarily as policy work rather than the direct, hands on, management of executive activities. Entrepreneurial officials in the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit had career incentives to come up with innovative organisational solutions to problems of public service delivery that were successfully implemented. They provided senior officials in departments with the agency model as a piece of bureau-shaping technology, enabling them to respond to politicians by passing on executive work to agencies. In departments with agencies, 70 per cent of senior officials ended up working in the parent department after the creation of agencies. The third question is explored in Part Three. The mark II bureau-shaping model suggests that bureau-shaping strategies will continue to be an important influence on reform in the future as will entrepreneurial officials in central units who have incentives to come up with new mechanisms for improving public services. The most likely future for most agencies appears to be continued use of the agency model with closure of implementation gaps. These developments are likely to be supplemented by additional mechanisms in agencies with moderate performance problems. In a few cases of very poor performance more radical changes are more likely. Partial dismantling of the agency model may occur in the Benefits Agency...|$|R
