5|$|From {{the moment}} the three were {{grounded}} on July 14, Strindberg's highly specialized cartographic camera, which {{had been brought to}} map the region from the air, became instead a means of recording daily life in the icescape and the constant danger and <b>drudgery</b> of the trek. Strindberg took about 200 photos with his seven-kilogram (15lb) camera {{over the course of the}} three months they spent on the pack ice, one of the most famous being his picture of Andrée and Frænkel contemplating the fallen Eagle (see image above).|$|E
5|$|Fertilisation of Orchids {{is a book}} by English naturalist Charles Darwin {{published}} on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing. Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin—a relief from the <b>drudgery</b> of writing—developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.|$|E
5|$|In February 1918, {{the call}} {{went out for}} volunteers to {{participate}} in a special mission to close the port of Zeebrugge using blockships. Although many aboard Australia volunteered their services in an attempt to escape the <b>drudgery</b> of North Sea patrols, only 11 personnel—10 sailors and an engineering lieutenant—were selected for the raid, which occurred on 23 April. The lieutenant was posted to the engine room of the requisitioned ferry , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) for his efforts. The other Australians were assigned to the boiler rooms of the blockship , or as part of a storming party along the mole. All ten sailors survived—Australia was the only ship to have no casualties from the raid—and three were awarded the DSM, while another three were mentioned in dispatches. One of the sailors was listed in the ballot to receive a Victoria Cross, but he did not receive the award.|$|E

The Writers Guild of Alberta awarded Saltwater Trees its Howard O'Hagan prize for short fiction. Reviewer Mary Walters Riskin noted the book was a fine beginning to Robinson's career. [...] "One of the most refreshing aspects of this collection is that so many of the 13 stories in Saltwater Trees rise out of the insanities, the batterings and the <b>drudgeries</b> of real life to end on notes of hope," [...] Riskin wrote.|$|R

The trade in our streets believes in no metaphysical causes, thinks nothing of the force which necessitated traders and a trading planet to exist; no, but sticks to cotton, sugar, wool, and salt. The ward meetings, on election days, are not softened by any misgivings {{of the value of}} these ballotings. Hot life is streaming in a single direction.

5000|$|In a 1906 {{article in}} The Independent, Sinclair {{outlined}} {{a plan for}} a home colony located within one-hour of New York City. Following the model proposed by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in her book The Home, Sinclair sought [...] "authors, artists, and musicians, editors and teachers and professional men" [...] who wanted to avoid the <b>drudgeries</b> of domestic life. A farm community would be established that would generate its own meat, milk and produce. Food would be served in a communal kitchen and children raised in separate nurseries. The community would be run by a board of directors. While Sinclair insisted that the project was not a Socialist one, he did think that those interested in participating [...] "would have to be in sympathy with the spirit of socialism". Sinclair planned for about 100 houses on a 400 acre lot, and would get proposals for architects and business experts to create a business plan for the endeavor.|$|R

25|$|As a {{child and}} youth, Voranc {{experienced}} first hand the back-breaking <b>drudgery</b> of farming steep mountain slopes, and {{the theme of the}} farmer fighting the unyielding soil is recurrent in much of his writing.

The beauty of the scenery is conveyed against the backdrop of shared toil and camaraderie. Voranc was drawn to the unfortunate and unjustly treated people he witnessed.|$|E

So in universities, and all manner of dames' and other schools, of the very highest class as of the very lowest; and Society at large, when we enter there, confirms with all its brilliant review-articles, successful publications, intellectual tea-circles, literary gazettes, parliamentary eloquences, the grand lesson we had. Other lesson in fact we have none, in these times. If there be a human talent, let it get into the tongue, and make melody with that organ. The talent that can say nothing for itself, what is it?

60|$|So {{much for}} the {{financial}} and economic position of an ordinary woman in a Socialist State. But management and economies are but the basal substance of a woman's life. She will be free not merely financially; the systematic development of the social organisation and of the mechanism of life will be constantly releasing her more and more from the irksome duties and <b>drudgeries</b> that have consumed {{so much of the}} energies of her sex in the past. She will be a citizen, and free as a man to read for herself, think for herself and seek expression. Under the law, in politics and all the affairs of life she will be the equal of a man. No one will control her movements or limit her actions or stand over her to make decisions for her. All these things are implicit in the fundamental generalization of Socialism, which denies property in human beings.|$|R

25|$|The Human Use of Human Beings {{is a book}} by Norbert Wiener, the {{founding}} thinker of cybernetics theory and an influential advocate of automation; it {{was first published in}} 1950 and revised in 1954. The text argues for the benefits of automation to society; it analyzes the meaning of productive communication and discusses ways for humans and machines to cooperate, with the potential to amplify human power and release people from the repetitive <b>drudgery</b> of manual labor, in favor of more creative pursuits in knowledge work and the arts. The risk that such changes might harm society (through dehumanization or subordination of our species) is explored, and suggestions are offered on how to avoid such risk.|$|E

She had thought of encouraging love, and love had come to her in the shape of Mr Maguire, a very strict evangelical clergyman, without a cure or an income, somewhat in debt, and with, oh! such an eye! She tore the papers, very gently, into the smallest fragments. She tore them again and again, swearing to herself as she did so that there should be an end of all that; and, as there was no fire at hand, she replaced the pieces in her desk. During this ceremony of the tearing she devoted herself to the duties of a single life, to the <b>drudgeries</b> of ordinary utility, to such works as those she was now doing. As to any society, wicked or religious,--wicked after the manner of Miss Todd, or religious after the manner of St Stumfolda,--it should come or not, as circumstances might direct. She would go no more in search of it. Such were the resolves of a certain night, during which the ceremony of the tearing took place.|$|R

He maintained that the guide had become lax in its standards. Though Michelin states that its inspectors visited all 4,000 reviewed restaurants in France every 18 months, and all starred restaurants several times a year, Rémy said only about one visit every 3½ years was possible because there were only 11 inspectors in France when he was hired, rather than the 50 or more hinted by Michelin. That number, he said, had shrunk to five {{by the time he}} was fired in December 2003.|$|E
25|$|In My Life and Work Ford speaks (briefly) {{of racing}} {{in a rather}} dismissive tone, as {{something}} that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing. Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, production efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of <b>drudgery</b> in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, Reavis enlisted in Hunter's Regiment of the Confederate Army, 8th Division of the Missouri State Guard. Several months later he went to Springfield and reenlisted in Captain Lowe's company. Initially holding dreams of glory, the 18-year-old Reavis soon discovered the realities of military life did not match his romanticized ideals. About this time, he accidentally discovered that he could accurately reproduce his commanding officer's signature. Using this new-found skill, Reavis began producing passes to avoid the <b>drudgery</b> of army life and instead spent time visiting his mother. When his fellow soldiers noticed the frequency and manner by which he obtained his passes, Reavis began selling forged passes to them. When some of his superiors became suspicious of Reavis, he obtained leave supposedly to get married. He used the leave to surrender to Union forces instead of getting married. Following his surrender, Reavis joined the Union Army and briefly served in an artillery regiment.|$|E

The hill-tops rejoicing will ere long be at their ruddiest, and blush Good-night.

60|$|This was {{probably}} the first light-point {{in the history of}} Luther, his purer will now first decisively uttering itself; but, for the present, it was still as one light-point in an element all of darkness. He says he was a pious monk, ich bin ein frommer Monch gewesen; faithfully, painfully struggling to work out the truth of this high act of his; but it was to little purpose. His misery had not lessened; had rather, as it were, increased into infinitude. The <b>drudgeries</b> he had to do, as novice in his Convent, all sorts of slave-work, were not his grievance: the deep earnest soul of the man had fallen into all manner of black scruples, dubitations; he believed himself likely to die soon, and far worse than die. One hears with a new interest for poor Luther that, at this time, he lived in terror of the unspeakable misery; fancied that he was doomed to eternal reprobation. Was it not the humble sincere nature of the man? What was he, that he should be raised to Heaven! He that had known only misery, and mean slavery: the news was too blessed to be credible. It could not become clear to him how, by fasts, vigils, formalities and mass-work, a man's soul could be saved. He fell into the blackest wretchedness; had to wander staggering as on the verge of bottomless Despair.|$|R

There stands their part of the contract fulfilled, stone on stone, port and pinnacle all faithfully finished from Wotan's design by their mighty labor. They have come undoubtingly for their agreed wage. Then there happens what is to them an incredible, inconceivable thing. The god begins to shuffle. There are no moments in life more tragic than those in which the humble common man, the manual worker, leaving with implicit trust all high affairs to his betters, and reverencing them wholly as worthy of that trust, even to the extent of accepting as his rightful function the saving of them from all roughening and coarsening <b>drudgeries,</b> first discovers that they are corrupt, greedy, unjust and treacherous. The shock drives a ray of prophetic light into one giant's mind, and gives him a momentary eloquence. In that moment he rises above his stupid gianthood, and earnestly warns the Son of Light that all his power and eminence of priesthood, godhood, and kingship must stand or fall with the unbearable cold greatness of the incorruptible law-giver. But Wotan, whose assumed character of law-giver is altogether false to his real passionate nature, despises the rebuke; and the giant's ray of insight is lost in the murk of his virtuous indignation.|$|R

But when Mr. Darwin passed away from this life, and some time after Darwin's Life and Letters came out, the Rev. Mr. Twichell procured an early copy of that work and found something in it which he considered applied to me. He came over to my house--it was snowing, raining, sleeting, but that did not make any difference to Twichell. He produced the book, and turned over and over, until he came to a certain place, when he said: [...] "Here, look at this letter from Mr. Darwin to Sir Joseph Hooker." [...] What Mr. Darwin said--I give you the idea and not the very words--was this: I do not know whether I ought to have devoted my whole life to these <b>drudgeries</b> in natural history and the other sciences or not, for while I may have gained in one way I have lost in another.

Large scale hydropower makes {{a significant contribution to}} the total generated power of the developed world. The means of harnessing water power for large flows and heads above three metres are efficient and well established. There remains however, the fact that many people, especially in developing countries live adjacent to water courses and tidal estuaries where heads of 2 metres or less exist but are not exploited. The reasons for this are often that practical machines do not exist or are insufficiently well developed to be used. Much effort has been made in recent years to develop equipment suitable for small, low-head sites in remote places. The writer has worked on three such devices in both the laboratory and on site - these are the Salford Transverse Oscillator, the AUR Water Engine and the Underwater Motor. This thesis describes these machines in detail together with other contemporary devices. The initial chapter contains an assessment of machines used in the past to exploit low head sites. There is little doubt that some of these older machines, suitably brought up to date in design and materials, would be more suited to the needs of developing peoples than many of the esoteric devices described in later chapters. The thesis is concerned mainly with the need to provide a means of generating power rather than the assessment or suitability of a site for power generation.
