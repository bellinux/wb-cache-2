25|$|Eighteen {{units are}} to be reintroduced on London Waterloo to Portsmouth <b>Harbour</b> <b>services</b> by South Western Railway in December 2018. These 18 units will be {{refurbished}} before their use on this service. South Western Railway has awarded Kiepe Electric UK the contract to undertake the £45m refurbishment. Work will include replacing the life-expired DC traction equipment with an AC package incorporating IGBT technology from Kiepe Electric Düsseldorf. New brake controls from Knorr-Bremse Rail Vehicle Systems will permit regenerative braking.|$|E
25|$|South West Trains {{announced}} that it would be withdrawing these units, and they last ran on 3 February 2007. This move coincided with SWT reinstating all Class 458s for the Waterloo–Reading line. As a result, the Class 444 inherited the Waterloo–Weymouth route and the Class 450 took over some Portsmouth <b>Harbour</b> <b>services,</b> while the Class 442 units went into storage at Eastleigh. From 2008 to 2017, Southern leased these trains for its Gatwick Express service and operated them on services from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport and Brighton. Eighteen Class 442 units will return to the franchise when the changeover to South Western Trains occurs.|$|E
