Athletes from 11 of the 28 {{participating}} NOCs won at least a bronze medal; athletes from eight countries won at least one gold.

5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, often <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> way. Copies of {{an arbitrary}} quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{reproduce}} asexually by binary {{or multiple}} fission, fragmentation, or budding; meiosis does not occur, so if {{a species of}} archaea exists <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> form, {{all have the same}} genetic material. Cell division is controlled in a cell cycle; after the cell's chromosome is replicated and the two daughter chromosomes separate, the cell divides. In the genus Sulfolobus, the cycle has characteristics that are similar to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. The chromosomes replicate from multiple starting-points (origins of replication) using DNA polymerases that resemble the equivalent eukaryotic enzymes.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, a {{minority}} of the club's supporters had {{a reputation as one of}} Britain's most prominent casuals groups, the Aberdeen Soccer Casuals. The rise of the Aberdeen Casuals coincided with the most successful period in the club's history, and has been chronicled <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> published account. Whilst numbers have steadily declined with the introduction of Football Banning Orders preventing hooligans from travelling to games, the Aberdeen Casuals still appear at big fixtures often away from home and in the UEFA Europa League. There were clashes at both fixtures against FC Groningen in 2014, as well as 13 arrests after violent clashes with Dundee United fans at a game in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|McCoy rose in {{the record}} books during the first four games of the season. On August 30, 2008, McCoy passed for 222 yards and rushed for 103 yards against FAU, {{becoming}} the 2nd player in UT history to pass for 200 and rush for 100 yards <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> game; the other being Vince Young. On September 20 Colt McCoy surpassed the Texas All-Time record for the most passing TD's with 62 while beating Rice 52–10. The record was previously held by Major Applewhite. Through the first four games of 2008, McCoy completed 80% of his passes and had a quarterback rating of 209.71.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{paintings}} were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces, for churches, hospitals, and convents, and for wealthy clerics and private donors. The richer {{cities and towns}} commissioned works for their civic buildings. Artists often worked <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> medium; van Eyck and Petrus Christus are both thought to have contributed to manuscripts. Van der Weyden designed tapestries, though few survive. The Netherlandish painters were responsible for many innovations, including the advancement of the diptych format, the conventions of donor portraits, new conventions for Marian portraits, and, through works such as van Eyck's Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin in the 1430s, laying {{the foundation for the}} development of landscape painting as a separate genre.|$|E
