25|$|After the battle, Albert of Bavaria {{remained}} at Kuinre {{for a few}} more days, but, as Juw Juwinga had predicted, he found it very difficult to operate in the marshy terrain with an army of knights. Furthermore, it started to rain all day, while the sea <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> tempestuous. On 6 September he gave up and went home, after a campaign of only ten days and with no gains other than revenge for the defeat of 1345 to show for it.|$|E

His peak came in 1933, when he beat Fred Perry in the French Open quarterfinal. He was ranked World No. 3 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph, behind Jack Crawford and Fred Perry. However, it <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> {{difficult for him to}} endure the enormous pressure from Japan. It is believed that pressure drove him to throw himself overboard into the Strait of Malacca on April 5, 1934, at 26 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{decision}} of the national court a campaign in defense of the house was started. The campaign had been going on ever since the house was sold, but it was only now when facing eviction that the campaign got organized and began focusing on mass-mobilization. As the campaign <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> attention in the media, the number of people started attending demonstrations in support of the house rapidly increased. The demonstrations grew from a couple of hundred people to numbering several thousands in just a few months. For {{the first time in its}} history, Ungdomshuset experienced massive support from people outside radical left-wing circles. Much of this support came from young people, some of whom had never even visited the house before. Many of these young people was later going to form the main bulk of protesters in the subsequent riots.|$|E

He also said of Enjolras that [...] "once I <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> familiar with the material and when I read the novel, I was like, 'Wow this is a really, really great role,' and I felt very much better suited for it."

A huge real estate boom was triggered soon after Infopark started to attract big MNC from around the globe. Infopark changed the landscape and lifestyle of Kochi and Kakkanad.

50|$|The Dakota Zoo {{began on}} a 67 acre farm owned by Marc and Betty Christianson on the {{northern}} edge of Bismarck. At first, the farm boarded domestic animals such as dogs, cats, and horses. At one point, the farm was used to raise mink for profit. Over time, people who knew of the Christiansons' love for animals began dropping off strays and injured animals, knowing that they would be well taken care of. As the number of animals increased, word <b>got</b> out <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> people came to see them.|$|R

2500|$|McCartney {{was living}} in Jane Asher's parents' house when he found the {{inspiration}} for the song: [...] "I was laying in bed in the Ashers' garret... I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived. It was pretty much my song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine." [...] The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.|$|E
2500|$|... "A well edited Amen Break {{alongside}} an 808 sub {{kick and}} some simple atmospherics just sounded so amazing all on its own, thus the speech sample [...] "strictly drum and bass". A {{whole new world}} of possibilities was opening up for the drum programming... It wasn't long before the amen break was being used by practically every producer within the scene, and as time progressed the Belgian style techno stabs and noises disappeared, and the edits and studio trickery <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> complex. People were at last beginning to call the music Drum and Bass instead of hardcore. This Amen formula certainly helped cement the sound {{for many of the}} tracks I went on to produce for Gwange, Q-Project and Spinback on Legend Records. After a while, tracks using the Amen break virtually had a genre all of their own. Foul Play, Peshay, Bukem, DJ Dextrous and DJ Crystl among others were all solid amen addicts back then too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carlos Hugo and {{his aides}} {{embarked}} on activist policy, launching new initiatives and ensuring that the young prince gets increasingly recognized in national media. In terms of political content the group started to advance heterodox theories, focused on society as means and objective of politics. In terms of strategy, until the mid-1960s it was formatted as advances towards the socially-minded, hard Falangist core; afterwards it started to assume an increasingly Marxist flavor. As orthodox Traditionalists <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> perturbed, they tried to alarm Don Javier about apparently dissident course of his son. However, Don Javier kept assuring them that he maintained full confidence in Carlos Hugo and that while the principles remained the same, new times required new practical concepts. He also kept endorsing subsequent waves of structural changes, which combined with personal decisions in the mid-1960s left the Comunión dominated by Carlos Hugo and his entourage. In the so-called Acto de Puchheim of 1965 {{for the first time}} Don Javier explicitly called himself [...] "rey" [...] and from this moment onwards he remained consistent repeatedly claiming the title.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to learn from past {{mistakes}} and, if possible not to repeat them, people responded pretty quickly, as the political events {{of the situation in}} Europe <b>got</b> worse <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more.</b> In time the war preventions measures were initiated.

500|$|Like many metalcore-labeled bands, Bleeding Through is {{influenced}} by Swedish melodic death metal. It is the most apparent on Dust to Ashes, while with time the band's music <b>got</b> gradually <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> melodic, with The Truth being the most melodic to date, even containing a power ballad, a novelty for the band. A keyboard player was introduced shortly before the band began performing as an unsigned act. According to former guitarist Scott Danough [...] "it adds a different element" [...] to their music.|$|R
2500|$|At the time, Lennon {{said of the}} album: [...] "You {{could call}} our new one a Beatles country and western LP." [...] Music critic Tim Riley views the album as a [...] "country excursion", while MacDonald {{describes}} it as being [...] "dominated by the [...] idiom". The impetus for this new direction came partly from the band's exposure to US country radio stations while on tour; in addition, it was a genre that Ringo Starr had long championed. Lennon's [...] "I Don't Want to Spoil the Party" [...] was an early example of country rock, anticipating the Byrds' work in that style. [...] "I'm a Loser" [...] was the first Beatles song to directly reflect the influence of Bob Dylan, {{and served as a}} precursor to the folk-rock explosion of 1965. Author Jonathan Gould highlights the influence of blues and country-derived rockabilly in both the album's original compositions and the inclusion of songs by Carl Perkins and Buddy Holly; he also comments that Dylan's acoustic folk sound was a style that the Beatles tended to identify as country music. McCartney considered that Beatles for Sale introduced a more mature phase for the band, marking a progression whereby [...] "We <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> free to get into ourselves. Our student selves rather than 'we must please the girls and make money' …" ...|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I <b>got</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E
