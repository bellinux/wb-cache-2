5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high perches. The songs are {{similar to that of}} the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly; <b>its</b> <b>voice</b> is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually different from one another.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One {{received}} mostly positive {{reception for}} its refined controller design, multimedia features, and voice navigation. Its quieter and cooler design was praised {{for making the}} console more reliable than its predecessor on-launch, but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4. Its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive, although changes made to it {{and other aspects of}} the console's software post-launch received positive reception. Its Kinect received praise for its improved motion-tracking accuracy, its face recognition logins, and <b>its</b> <b>voice</b> commands.|$|E
5|$|A 20-day study held by BirdLife International {{discovered}} 265 {{species of}} birds in the park. Of these, the yellow-bellied form of forest robin is widespread. In the study, a pair of Ja River scrub warblers was discovered in a 1 hectare patch of Rhynchospora marsh; its population must be small as there are few such marshes in Nki. Three species of forest nightjar have been observed in the park; Bate's and brown nightjars are common in southeastern Cameroon, while a rarer and unidentified third species' call has been heard twice. It is likely that this is Prigogine's nightjar, as <b>its</b> <b>voice</b> is identical {{to that of the}} only known specimen of this species which was found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Two small owls, Sjostedt's and African barred owlets coexist in Nki, due to similar habitat requirements.|$|E

5|$|The {{likeness}} of the Captain Scarlet character has, {{since his first}} appearance, been attributed to Francis Matthews, who voiced Scarlet in the series, Cary Grant and Roger Moore. Ed Bishop later claimed that Captain Blue had been modelled on his likeness, but sculptor Terry Curtis states that he made the puppet to resemble himself and simply added a blond wig when he learnt that Bishop was to voice Blue. Curtis, a James Bond fan, based the appearance of Captain Grey on Sean Connery and Destiny Angel on Ursula Andress, Connery's co-star in the 1962 Bond film Dr No. Meanwhile, the character of Lieutenant Green was sculpted on <b>its</b> <b>voice</b> actor, Cy Grant; Rhapsody Angel on model and actress Jean Shrimpton; Melody Angel on singer and actress Eartha Kitt; and Harmony Angel on actress Tsai Chin.|$|E
5|$|While The Legend of Korra was {{produced}} in the United States and therefore not a work of Japanese animation ("anime") in the strict sense, The Escapist magazine argued that the series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such: its protagonists (a superpowered heroine, her group of talented, supporting friends, a near-impervious villain who wants to reshape the world), its themes (family, friendship, romance, fear, and death) {{and the quality of}} <b>its</b> <b>voice</b> acting as well as the visual style {{are similar to those of}} leading anime series such as , Bleach or Trigun. A notable difference from such series is the absence of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to J-pop songs; to save broadcast time, The Legend of Korras openings and endings last only a few seconds. The series mostly abstains from using the visual tropes characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.|$|E

25|$|Cuban {{literature}} {{began to}} find <b>its</b> <b>voice</b> {{in the early}} 19th century. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by José Martí, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as Nicolás Guillén and José Z. Tallet focused on literature as social protest. The poetry and novels of Dulce María Loynaz and José Lezama Lima have been influential. Romanticist Miguel Barnet, who wrote Everyone Dreamed of Cuba, reflects a more melancholy Cuba.|$|E

In addition to K9 dolls, there were also talking K9 toys produced by Palitoy, the speech provided by a miniature record inside {{the body of the}} toy. John Leeson provided the voice for K9 in all its appearances, except for Season 17 (which included the unfinished Shada) when it was voiced by David Brierley. When Shada was remade by Big Finish Productions, Leeson provided <b>its</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E

25|$|Vice President José Alencar (2003–11) made {{controversial}} {{remarks in}} 2009, telling {{the press that}} Brazil should have nuclear weapons {{as a means to}} protect itself. According to Alencar, nuclear weapons were useful as a means of dissuasion, particularly {{in the case of a}} vast country with valuable natural resources such as Brazil. Additionally, Alencar linked the possession of a nuclear bomb to higher international relevance, stating that a poor country like Pakistan had <b>its</b> <b>voice</b> heard in international affairs because of its nuclear arsenal. Once his observations were mass-produced, Brasília affirmed that Alencar had expressed his own personal views, which did not reflect Brazil’s official position.|$|E
25|$|The {{first wave}} of post-classical music in Finland came about in the 1920s with young modernists Aarre Merikanto, Väinö Raitio and Sulho Ranta. However, this {{movement}} was tamed by the growing nationalistic tendency in the arts before the Second World War. In the 1940s, Erik Bergman and Joonas Kokkonen gained popularity and added important technical innovations to Finnish music. A new generation of Finnish composers turned into modernism, like Einojuhani Rautavaara and Usko Meriläinen, while the neoclassical style had <b>its</b> <b>voice</b> in the music of Einar Englund. The 1950s saw an increase in international attention on Finnish music and soon helped modernize Finnish composing.|$|E
25|$|In January 9, 1989, Warner Bros. Animation was {{choosing}} <b>its</b> <b>voice</b> actors {{from over}} 1,200 auditions and putting together its 100-person production staff. In April 13, 1989, full production of series episodes began with five overseas animation houses {{and a total}} budget of $25 million. The first 65 episodes of the series aired in syndication on 135 stations, beginning in September 1990. During that time, Tiny Toons was a huge success and got higher ratings than its Disney Afternoon competitors in some affiliates. After a successful run in syndication, Fox got the rights for season 3. Production of the series halted in late 1992 {{to make way for}} Animaniacs to air the following year.|$|E

The sketch later appeared on The Muppet Show where the Luncheon Counter Monster also ate a machine explaining its functions.|$|E
25|$|As a group, the {{students}} were {{under the influence of}} Romanian Symbolist clubs, which were at the time the more radical expressions of artistic rejuvenation in Romania. Marcel and Jules Janco's first moment of cultural significance took place in October 1912, when they joined Tzara in editing the Symbolist venue Simbolul, which managed to receive contributions from some of Romania's leading modern poets, from Alexandru Macedonski to Ion Minulescu and Adrian Maniu. The magazine nevertheless struggled to find <b>its</b> <b>voice,</b> alternating modernism with the more conventional Symbolism. Janco was perhaps the main graphic designer of Simbolul, and he may even have persuaded his wealthy parents to support the venture (which closed down in early 1913). Unlike Tzara, who refused to look back on Simbolul with anything but embarrassment, Janco was proud of this moment in life, depicting it as his first participation in artistic revolution.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} {{years of the}} ULFA {{movement}} (when it used to enjoy widespread public support in both {{urban and rural areas}} of Assam), cadres were recruited from rural areas as well as from many towns in Lower Assam, Upper and middle Assam districts. One of the most popular ULFA leader of all time, the late Heerak Jyoti Mahanta hailed from a place which is just a few kilometres from the state capital Guwahati. However, with the Assamese urban middle class becoming increasingly sceptical of ULFA's method of functioning, the ULFA targeted the remote villages and the tribal areas for recruitment. According to intelligence sources, the Paresh Baruah faction of the Ulfa, which have been continuously raising <b>its</b> <b>voice</b> against the ongoing peace process being initiated by the Arabinda Rajkhowa faction, is engaged in a massive recruitment drive in the rural areas of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur and Nalbari districts of Assam.
