50|$|Electronic Invoicing is not {{necessarily}} the same as EDI invoicing. Electronic invoicing in its widest sense embraces EDI as well as XML invoice messages as well as other format such as pdf.

50|$|Electronic Invoicing {{can be a}} {{very useful}} tool for the AP department. Electronic {{invoicing}} allows vendors to submit invoices over the internet and have those invoices automatically routed and processed. Because invoice arrival and presentation is almost immediate invoices are paid sooner; therefore, the amount of time and money it takes to process these invoices is greatly reduced. (Financial Operations Networks, 2008) These solutions usually involve a third party company that provides and supports an application which allows a supplier to submit an <b>electronic</b> <b>invoice</b> to their customer for immediate routing, approval, and payment. These applications are tied to databases which archive transaction information between trading partners. (US Bank, Scott Hesse, 2010) The invoices may be submitted in a number of ways, including EDI, CSV, or XML uploads. PDF files, or online invoice templates. Because E-invoicing includes so many different technologies and entry options, it is used as an umbrella term to describe any method by which an invoice is electronically presented to a customer for payment.|$|E

40|$|Electronic {{document}} handling {{was first}} used in the automotive industry in the early 1970 ’s, the way of communicating electronic {{at the time was}} concerned with the communication way of EDI (Hsieh, 2004). In the beginning of 2000 a new way of communicating electronic documents was introduced with the emergence of VAN-operators (Hsieh, 2004). This technology of communicating electronic invoices has shown to be less complex for the businesses than the previous EDI connections. The VAN-operators enable companies regardless of size, ERP, also known as Enterprise Resource Planning, system, formats or transaction volume to send and receive electronic invoices. The subject of <b>electronic</b> <b>invoice</b> handling have become increasingly debated, mainly because of the legislations taking place all over Europe, and as well as the environmental impact by business transactions being sent by paper. The objective of this thesis is to examine the challenges, solutions and outcomes for companies switching to <b>electronic</b> <b>invoice</b> handling. The data collected for the thesis is divided into two parts. The first part consist of information retrieved by previous literature as well as internet sources. The second part concerns the case studies conducted for the thesis in respect to our research questions. For this reason Scandinavian companies have been interviewed, with different precondition as in size, industry, transaction volume and IT structure. The findings from the first and second part have been analyzed and conclusion have been made, we suggest using a VAN-operators, which have shown to be the most appropriate alternative for companies that are implementing <b>electronic</b> <b>invoice</b> handling.

40|$|This paper {{aimed at}} {{exploring}} {{the transition to}} electronic invoicing in real business settings {{with a focus on}} the transition experiences and post-implementation benefits withdrawn up to the present. To obtain detail-rich findings, multiple case study research was preferred over other research methods. The results of the three case studies were analysed through the prism of IT business value literature and compared to other papers on benefits of e-invoicing. The cases showed that <b>electronic</b> <b>invoice</b> handling technology enhanced control over company invoicing, allowed better management of payables, and indeed increased labour productivity in invoice handling units. These and other realized benefits, such as processing time and cost savings, reduced interest on over due payments, decreased paper waste, etc., are expected to grow as the level of true e-invoice penetration and the development condition of the technology itself will mature. Due to insufficiency of data, the re-utilization patterns of labour released after the automation of invoicing in other more productive duties across the organization were found indecisive. As a transactional type of IT that is prone to network externalities, electronic invoicing system is posited to aid company financials largely through contracting costs, rather than boosting sales. Besides the theoretical implications, the paper also offers practical considerations for implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>invoice</b> processing technology and further promotion of e-invoicing...|$|E

In addition, this study aims to identify if the impact on the buyer-seller relationship differs depending on whether the company implementing <b>electronic</b> <b>invoicing</b> is an EDI-user or whether a non-EDI company is adopting digitalization from scratch. As a theoretical framework, this study applies the taxonomy designed by Cannon and Perreault. The framework has been tested and found appropriate in an earlier research examining the impact of <b>electronic</b> <b>invoicing</b> on buyer-seller relationships in the business-to-business market. The empirical part of this thesis focuses on identification of changes in the business-to-business relationships along the corresponding framework dimensions. RESEARCH METHODS The methodology applied in this thesis is qualitative. The research comprises the study of three case companies that operate in different fields, such as textile production and marketing, machinery and power plant building, and airlines. SOURCE MATERIAL The sources used for this thesis comprise relevant articles and publications available on the Internet, journals and magazines. The material for the empirical part of the research was gathered through in-depth interviews of key personnel, and additional questionnaire e-mailed to the case companies.

A NF-e Ã um modelo nacional, com validade jurÃdica garantida pela assinatura digital do remetente, reduzindo gastos na recepÃÃo, digitaÃÃo e armazenagem e permitindo, ao mesmo tempo, o acompanhamento, em tempo real, das operaÃÃes comerciais pelas entidades arrecadadoras. O Presente estudo se propÃs a abordar este tema, tendo por objetivo geral de analisar como a utilizaÃÃo da Nota Fiscal EletrÃnica impactou as atividades de monitoramento e fiscalizaÃÃo do ICMS na Secretaria da Fazenda do Estado do CearÃ. Pretendeu-se atingir essa finalidade identificando, em primeiro lugar, as mudanÃas nas atividades de monitoramento e fiscalizaÃÃo do ICMS no que se refere: ao perÃodo fiscalizado, a fiscalizaÃÃo presencial, a utilizaÃÃo da tÃcnica de amostragem e ao procedimento de conferÃncia de valores, quantidades ou saldos a partir da NF-e e, posteriormente, as alteraÃÃes nas atividades de monitoramento e fiscalizaÃÃo relacionadas com a regularidade da situaÃÃo {{cadastral}} do contribuinte e com as etapas de coleta de informaÃÃes econÃmico-fiscais, a partir da NF-e. Para fundamentar teoricamente este estudo foi realizada uma revisÃo de literatura abordando os temas arrecadaÃÃo no contexto da administraÃÃo pÃblica e tecnologia da informaÃÃo e governo eletrÃnico. A metodologia utilizada na pesquisa foi o estudo do caso Ãnico na Secretaria de Fazenda do Estado do CearÃ, pelo qual foram coletadas informaÃÃes acerca das atividades de monitoramento e fiscalizaÃÃo, a partir da implantaÃÃo da NF-e. Os resultados decorrentes apontam que houve impactos na utilizaÃÃo da nota fiscal eletrÃnica nas atividades de monitoramento e fiscalizaÃÃo do ICMS, na Secretaria da Fazenda do Estado do CearÃ, nos seguintes aspectos: a fiscalizaÃÃo das operaÃÃes comerciais terÃ como foco os fatos ocorridos no presente; a fiscalizaÃÃo presencial foi substituÃda pela fiscalizaÃÃo Ã distÃncia; a utilizaÃÃo da fiscalizaÃÃo total foi substituÃda pela a tÃcnica de amostragem; os procedimentos de conferÃncia manual passaram para o meio eletrÃnico; maior celeridade na identificaÃÃo antecipada de notas fiscais emitidas por contribuintes baixados ou inativos ou destinadas a contribuintes baixados ou inativos; e maior rapidez nos procedimentos para coleta de informaÃÃes econÃmico-fiscais.
