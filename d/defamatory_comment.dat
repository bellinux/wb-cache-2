40|$|Litigation {{involving}} {{social media}} {{is still very}} new in South Africa {{and only a few}} reported cases can be found. In this case discussion, a brief overview is given of the few cases already reported, but in the main the case of Isparta v Richter 2013 6 SA 4529 (GP) is discussed. In this case a South African court for the first time awarded damages to the plaintiff for <b>defamatory</b> <b>comments</b> made on Facebook. The questions that confronted the judge were whether the alleged defamatory statements did indeed relate to the plaintiff and whether the comments, individually or collectively, could be considered defamatory. The issue whether the "tagging" of another user of Facebook makes that user liable for the <b>defamatory</b> <b>comments</b> of the tagger is also addressed in the case. The case discussion concludes with a reference to other issues that could play a role in litigation involving Facebook, namely the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 25 of 2002 and foreign law...|$|R

40|$|Nearly {{forty years}} ago {{in the heat of the}} civil rights movement, the Supreme Court famously {{considered}} whether a Montgomery, Alabama Commissioner who supervised the Police Department was damaged by <b>defamatory</b> <b>comments.</b> In determining whether the false statements published in the New York Times article lowered the Commissioner 2 ̆ 7 s reputation and impeded his reelection chances, the court wrestled with defining the community in which these comments were published. Should the Supreme Court consider the allegedly <b>defamatory</b> <b>comments</b> within the scope of a national community, as the New York Times is a national publication, or was the correct community restrained to the registered voters in the Montgomery district upon whose votes the Commissioner would depend? Before social media allowed us to join forums, create identities with likeminded individuals, tweet, post, or text message statements instantaneously, globally and with little or no filter, the standards of community were often viewed through a geographic lens. This note proposes that the current legal system in which judges must speculate and arbitrarily determine a plaintiff’s community based on judge 2 ̆ 7 s own unconscious beliefs and individualized views, needs to be reformed...|$|R

40|$|Criminal {{defamation}} has {{for many}} years been considered an antiquated law - a dinosaur awaiting extinction. The main grounds for criticism have been the perceived lack of likelihood that <b>defamatory</b> <b>comments</b> can create a real risk of harm, and the propensity of the action to unduly suppress freedom of speech. As a consequence, the law has fallen out of favour and has had limited application in recent years.

50|$|Torstar {{appealed to}} the Ontario Court of Appeal. On the issue of {{responsible}} journalism, the Court of Appeal found that the trial court erred in not allowing the jury to consider the defence, and remanded {{the case for a}} new trial. The Court also found that the idea of a 'fair minded' person would need to believe in a comment was previously rejected by the court, thus the trial court did not properly instruct the jury on this issue. Finally, the Court found that the <b>defamatory</b> <b>comments</b> in the article were attributed to a resident, and unless the defendants had adopted them as their own, the defendants' 'honest belief' in them was irrelevant.|$|R
