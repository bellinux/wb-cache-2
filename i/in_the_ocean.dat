5|$|Fish are an {{important}} resource for humans worldwide, especially as food.

5|$|Hatchlings {{can lose}} up to 20% {{of their body}} mass due to {{evaporation}} of water as they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore. An iron compound, magnetite, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field, for navigation.|$|E
