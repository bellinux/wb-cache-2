40|$|Because coal auger working {{mechanism}} faces {{problems such}} as excessive vibration, serious deflection, and low drilling efficiency, a new five-bit coal auger working mechanism test model was established to explore the influence factor on vibration and deflection under different conditions. Additionally, a simulation model was built to further research the effect of partial load and stabilizer arrangement, the correctness of which was proved by experiments. The {{results show that the}} vibration and deflection increase with drilling depth in the x direction, and they first increase and then gradually become stable in the y direction. In addition, the vibration, deflection, and deflection force increase with the partial load. By arranging the stabilizer every five <b>drill-rod</b> section intervals, the vibration and deflection can be decreased by 30 % and 40 % in the x direction and by 14. 3 % and 65. 7 % in y direction, respectively...|$|E
