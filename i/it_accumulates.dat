5|$|Lithium fluoride, artificially {{grown as}} crystal, {{is clear and}} {{transparent}} and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications. It {{has one of the}} lowest refractive indexes and the furthest transmission range in the deep UV of most common materials. Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, <b>it</b> <b>accumulates</b> crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified. Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip face point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where <b>it</b> <b>accumulates</b> up to the angle of repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E
5|$|The {{capacitor}} is {{a development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as <b>it</b> <b>accumulates</b> charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E

5|$|Thorium is {{odourless}} and tasteless. The chemical {{toxicity of}} thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out {{before entering the}} body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic, especially {{in the presence of}} strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form. If thorium is ingested, 0.4% of it and 90% of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body. Out of the thorium that does remain in the body, three quarters of <b>it</b> <b>accumulates</b> in the skeleton. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's low solubility in water also means that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.|$|E
5|$|Type Ia supernovae, {{that involve}} helium {{accretion}} {{by a white}} dwarf, have been proposed to be a channel for transformation {{of this type of}} stellar remnant. In this scenario, the carbon detonation produced in a Type Ia supernova is too weak to destroy the white dwarf, expelling just a small part of its mass as ejecta, but produces an asymmetric explosion that kicks the star, often known as a zombie star, to high speeds of a hypervelocity star. The matter processed in the failed detonation is re-accreted by the white dwarf with the heaviest elements such as iron falling to its core where <b>it</b> <b>accumulates.</b> These iron-core white dwarfs would be smaller than the carbon-oxygen kind of similar mass and would cool and crystallize faster than those.|$|E
5|$|Enemies appear on-screen, and can {{be engaged}} by {{clicking}} on them. During the player's turn, three cards are randomly drawn from a deck of nine, each resulting in an attack. If the cards' combined strength and attached skills are insufficient to exhaust the enemy's HP, the heartless will counterattack. If the player survives this attack, or continues by spending additional AP, a new turn begins. Upon defeating an enemy, the player earns Lux (which unlocks rewards as <b>it</b> <b>accumulates,</b> but resets weekly), experience points (through which the player advances in level), and Munny (an in-game currency). The player also earns Fragments, cards based on the characters original to the Kingdom Hearts series and those from Disney and Final Fantasy franchises: the fragments are imbued with different properties depending on the character, such as physical or elemental strikes. Players can level up their cards to improve their attack and defense. Players can strengthen their Keyblade using materials found in each world, and new Keyblades are acquired as the story progresses. Each strengthens different types of cards; for example, Starlight is an all-around Keyblade offering boosts for Power-, Speed- and Magic-type cards, while the Snow White-inspired Treasure Trove is Power-type focused.|$|E

25|$|While the ciliae of {{the inner}} lining (endosalpinx) of the fallopian tube beat towards the uterus, tubal fluid is {{normally}} discharged via the fimbriated end into the peritoneal cavity from where it is cleared. If the fimbriated end of the tube becomes agglutinated, the resulting obstruction does not allow the tubal fluid to pass; <b>it</b> <b>accumulates</b> and reverts its flow downstream, into the uterus, or production is curtailed by damage to the endosalpinx. This tube then is unable {{to participate in the}} reproductive process: sperm cannot pass, the egg is not picked up, and fertilization does not take place.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{caffeine}} and {{when a person is}} awake and alert, little adenosine is present in (CNS) neurons. With a continued wakeful state, over time <b>it</b> <b>accumulates</b> in the neuronal synapse, in turn binding to and activating adenosine receptors found on certain CNS neurons; when activated, these receptors produce a cellular response that ultimately increases drowsiness. When caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.|$|E

25|$|Radioiodine (radioactive iodine-131) was {{developed}} in the early 1940s at the Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center. This modality is suitable for most patients, although some prefer to use it mainly for older patients. Indications for radioiodine are failed medical therapy or surgery and where medical or surgical therapy are contraindicated. Hypothyroidism may be a complication of this therapy, but may be treated with thyroid hormones if it appears. The rationale for radioactive iodine is that <b>it</b> <b>accumulates</b> in the thyroid and irradiates the gland with its beta and gamma radiations, about 90% of the total radiation being emitted by the beta (electron) particles. The most common method of iodine-131 treatment is to administer a specified amount in microcuries per gram of thyroid gland based on palpation or radiodiagnostic imaging of the gland over 24 hours. Patients who receive the therapy must be monitored regularly with thyroid blood tests to ensure they are treated with thyroid hormone before they become symptomatically hypothyroid.|$|E
25|$|This {{class of}} PGR is {{composed}} of one chemical compound normally produced in the leaves of plants, originating from chloroplasts, especially when plants are under stress. In general, it acts as an inhibitory chemical compound that affects bud growth, and seed and bud dormancy. It mediates changes within the apical meristem, causing bud dormancy and the alteration of the last set of leaves into protective bud covers. Since it was found in freshly abscissed leaves, it was thought {{to play a role}} in the processes of natural leaf drop, but further research has disproven this. In plant species from temperate parts of the world, it plays a role in leaf and seed dormancy by inhibiting growth, but, as it is dissipated from seeds or buds, growth begins. In other plants, as ABA levels decrease, growth then commences as gibberellin levels increase. Without ABA, buds and seeds would start to grow during warm periods in winter and be killed when it froze again. Since ABA dissipates slowly from the tissues and its effects take time to be offset by other plant hormones, there is a delay in physiological pathways that provide some protection from premature growth. <b>It</b> <b>accumulates</b> within seeds during fruit maturation, preventing seed germination within the fruit, or seed germination before winter. Abscisic acid's effects are degraded within plant tissues during cold temperatures or by its removal by water washing in out of the tissues, releasing the seeds and buds from dormancy.|$|E

500|$|But Hazlitt goes further, {{to develop}} an idea that only much later was seen to have radical {{implications}} for literary theory: he claims {{that it is of}} the very nature of poetry to glorify the aristocrat, the solitary hero, and the monarch, while being much less suited to represent, in ways that capture the imagination, the social problems of the common people. Poetic [...] "imagination naturally falls in with the language of power.
