5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the dog had failed to respond to the <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> or interferential current {{was more effective}} in reducing experimentally heat pain. Forty-eight young healthy subjects were randomly divided into the following groups: (i) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; (ii) interferential current; and (iii) no <b>stimulation.</b> A multi-function <b>electrical</b> stimulator was used to generate the transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> or interferential current. A thermal sensory analyser was used to record the heat pain threshold. The stimulation lasted for 30 minutes and the heat pain thresholds were measured before, {{during and after the}} <b>stimulation.</b> Transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> (p= 0. 003) and interferential current (p= 0. 004) significantly elevated the heat pain threshold, but "no stimulation" did not. The thresholds of the transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> and interferential current groups were significantly higher than that of the control group 30 minutes into the stimulation (p = 0. 017). Both transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> and interferential current increased the heat pain threshold to a similar extent during stimulation. However, the post-stimulation effect of interferential current lasted longer than that of transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation.</b> Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of naloxone {{on the effects}} of high frequency transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> in angina pectoris induced by atrial pacing was studied in 11 patients with severe coronary artery disease. The patients were catheterised and treated with transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> on two occasions, double blind and in random order, with a single intravenous dose of saline or with a single intravenous dose of 50 mg naloxone. Treatment with transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> increased tolerance to pacing and significantly improved lactate metabolism with placebo and with naloxone. The positive effects of transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> were thus reproducible and not reversed by single intravenous doses of naloxone. The results indicate that the effects of transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> on the heart are not mediated by beta endorphin but they do not exclude activation of more short-acting opioids such as delta or kappa receptor agonists (met-enkephalin or dynorphin or both) because naloxone has a low affinity for these receptors. Non-opioid mechanisms may also be important...|$|R
5|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the dorsal {{columns of}} {{the spinal cord}} can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by {{fluoroscopy}} and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} anal sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, {{inducing}} muscle contraction without traditional exercises (similar to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS). The evidence supporting its use is limited, and any benefit is tentative. In light of the above, intra-anal <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> (using an anal probe as electrode) appears to be more efficacious than intra-vaginal (using a vaginal probe as electrode). Rarely, skin reactions may occur where the electrodes are placed, but these issues typically resolve when the stimulation is stopped. Surgically implanted sacral nerve stimulation may be more effective than exercises, and <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> and biofeedback may be more effective than exercises or <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulation</b> by themselves. TENS is also sometimes used to treat FI by transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{aimed to}} examine the source of Ca 2 + mobilization {{that leads to the}} contractile response to either exogenously added histamine (1 μM– 1 mM) or <b>electrical</b> field <b>stimulation</b> (10 Hz, 0. 5 ms, 60 V). Removal of extracellular Ca 2 + by removal of Ca 2 + from the bathing medium reduced histamine (1 mM) induced responses by 34 % and responses induced by <b>electrical</b> field <b>stimulation</b> by 94 %. Similarly, blockade of L-type Ca 2 + channels by nifedipine (1 μM) reduced histamine (1 mM) induced responses by 43 % and responses induced by <b>electrical</b> field <b>stimulation</b> by 77 %. Application of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) (10 μM) to inhibit Ca 2 + reuptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum enhanced both histamine-induced and <b>electrical</b> field <b>stimulation</b> induced responses to a small degree, while the addition of the inosotol triphosphate (IP 3) receptor antagonist, 2 -aminophenoxyethane borane (2 -APB) (100 μM) inhibited histamine induced responses by 70 % and <b>electrical</b> field <b>stimulation</b> induced responses by 57 %. Ryanodine (1 μM) did not affect contractile responses to either histamine or <b>electrical</b> field <b>stimulation,</b> either in the absence or presence of 2 -APB (100 μM). During both histamine and <b>electrical</b> field <b>stimulation</b> induced contractions, prostate smooth muscle generates IP 3 receptor mediated Ca 2 + release in conjunction with Ca 2 + entry from the extracellular environment.

40|$|Objective: This is {{a double}} blind study that {{examined}} the optimal stimulation frequency of transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> in reducing pain due to knee osteoarthritis. Subjects: Thirty-four subjects were randomly allocated into 4 groups receiving transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> at either: (i) 2 Hz; (ii) 100 Hz; (iii) an alternating frequency of 2 Hz and 100 Hz (2 / 100 Hz); or (iv) a placebo transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation.</b> Methods: Treatment was administered 5 {{days a week for}} 2 weeks. The outcome measures included: (i) a visual analogue scale; (ii) a timed up-and-go test; and (iii) a range of knee motion. Results: The 3 active transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> groups (2 Hz, 100 Hz, 2 / 100 Hz), but not the placebo group, significantly reduced osteoarthritic knee pain across treatment sessions. However, no significant between-group difference was found. Similarly, the 3 active transcutaneous <b>electrical</b> nerve <b>stimulation</b> groups, but not the placebo group, produced significant reductions in the amount of time required to perform the timed up-and-go test, and an increase in the maximum passive knee range of motion.
