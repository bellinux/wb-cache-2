For <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> nine months of 2001, Enron reported $138.7 billion in revenues, which placed the company at the sixth position on the Fortune Global 500.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is unclear}} whether Lucas {{intended}} Palpatine to be the reigning Emperor or <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of a succession of Emperors. Michael Kaminski, author of The Secret History of Star Wars, claims that Lucas' initial notes discuss a line of corrupt Emperors, not just one. If Palpatine was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current. Later Lucas would abandon this idea, opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler.|$|E

5|$|In {{regards to}} {{bringing}} in P.A.Works as the animation studio, Toba had taken {{notice of the}} company from back when they provided in-between animation and production assistance for Fullmetal Alchemist (2003–4) and Darker than Black (2007), respectively; Aniplex helped produce both series. After watching <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> three episodes of P.A.Works' True Tears (2008), however, he was shocked at the high quality and immediately went to P.A.Works' studio in Toyama Prefecture {{to meet with the}} production staff in the hope that one day Aniplex could collaborate with them on a project together. The following week, Maeda brought up the subject of deciding on an animation studio for Angel Beats! and mentioned that he too had seen True Tears and had become interested in P.A.Works. Shortly after that, Toba formally made the proposal to P.A.Works to animate the project.|$|E
5|$|In {{the trail}} of the related {{negative}} publicity, Turner accepted the lead role in Ross Hunter's remake of Imitation of Life (1959) under the direction of Douglas Sirk. Universal Studios capitalized on her new-found notoriety; the result {{was one of the biggest}} hits of the year, and the biggest of Turner's career; she owned 50% of the earnings of the picture and during <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> year of the film's release she earned $11 million. According to Hunter, the film made an excess of $50 million in box office receipts. Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of Peyton Place and Imitation of Life each seemed to mirror certain parts of Turner's private life. Specifically, both films depicted the troubled, complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenaged daughter.|$|E
5|$|William Abb Cannon {{was born}} in Neshoba County, Mississippi to Harvey and Virgie Cannon. The family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father worked during World War II. While {{attending}} Istrouma High School in Baton Rouge, Cannon drew attention for his speed, strength and size; he exceled in football, basketball, and track. In football in 1955, his senior year, Cannon scored 39 touchdowns, was included in All-State and All-America teams, and led the Istrouma Indians to a state championship. Although generally appearing in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> half of games, he scored 229 points that season, a state record at the time. In track and field, he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds and threw the shot-put over 56 feet, setting what were state records at the time for both events. In the summer of 1955, Cannon received a 90-day suspended sentence for theft; he and some friends were caught extorting money from men whom they had seen with prostitutes. This {{was the first in}} a series of legal troubles in Cannon's life.|$|E

25|$|Aristobulus was {{not only}} <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> king from the Hasmonean lineage, but the first of any Hebrew kings to claim both the high priesthood and the kingship title.

The Pharisees began a massive rebellion, but Aristobulus died before any attempt to depose of him could occur.|$|E

25|$|PowerShell {{implements}} {{the concept}} of a pipeline, which enables piping the output of one cmdlet to another cmdlet as input. For example, the output of the Get-Process cmdlet could be piped to the Where-Object to filter any process that has less than 1MB of paged memory, and then to the Sort-Object cmdlet (e.g., to sort the objects by handle count), and then finally to the Select-Object cmdlet to select <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> 10 (i.e., the 10 processes based on handle count).|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} that all ten pins are felled by any one player in a single box, {{by no more than}} two throws (just as in tenpins) bonuses are awarded for a strike or spare. A strike is {{achieved}} with <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> delivery downing all ten pins, with a spare needing two throws, again just as in the tenpin sport. If all ten pins are felled by rolling all three balls in a box, the result is a Ten or ten-box, usually marked by an X (as in the Roman numeral for ten) but no additional points are awarded. (In tenpin bowling, a strike is often scored with an X).|$|E
25|$|Austen {{sold the}} {{copyright}} for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the Military Library, Whitehall {{in exchange for}} £110 (Austen had asked for £150). This proved a costly decision. Austen had published Sense and Sensibility on a commission basis, whereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher's commission. Unaware that Sense and Sensibility would sell out its edition, making her £140, she passed the copyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has calculated that Egerton subsequently made around £450 from <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two editions of the book.|$|E

25|$|In 1978 {{disability}} {{rights activists}} in Denver, Colorado, {{organized by the}} Atlantis Community, held a sit-in and blockade of the Denver Regional Transit Authority buses in 1978.

This action proved to be <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{in a series of}} civil disobedience demonstrations that lasted for a year until the Denver Transit Authority finally bought buses equipped with wheelchair lifts. In 1983, Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) was responsible for another civil disobedience campaign also in Denver that lasted seven years. They targeted the American Public Transport Association in protest of inaccessible public transportation; this campaign ended in 1990 when bus lifts for people using wheelchairs were required nationwide by the Americans with Disabilities Act.|$|E

25|$|For most of 1899, {{the revolutionary}} {{leadership}} had viewed guerrilla warfare strategically {{only as a}} tactical option of final recourse, not {{as a means of}} operation which better suited their disadvantaged situation. On November 13, 1899, Emilio Aguinaldo decreed that guerrilla war would henceforth be the strategy. This made American occupation of the Philippine archipelago all the more difficult over the next few years. In fact, during <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> four months of the guerrilla war, the Americans had nearly 500 casualties. The Philippine Army began staging bloody ambushes and raids, such as the guerrilla victories at Paye, Catubig, Makahambus, Pulang Lupa, Balangiga and Mabitac. At first, it even seemed as if the Filipinos would fight the Americans to a stalemate and force them to withdraw. This was even considered by President McKinley {{at the beginning of the}} phase.|$|E
