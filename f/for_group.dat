5|$|In the thelytokous ant Platythyrea punctata, colonies are clonal; therefore, {{workers are}} all equally related genetically, and worker {{policing}} {{is not expected}} {{as there is no}} genetic conflict.

In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers.

40|$|Let G be an {{additive}} finite abelian group. A sequence over G {{is called}} a minimal zero-sum sequence if {{the sum of its}} terms is zero and no proper subsequence has this property.

Northern Tamil society is generally categorised into two groups: those who are from the Jaffna peninsula in the north, {{and those who are}} residents of the Vanni to the immediate south. The Jaffna society is separated by castes. Historically, the Vellalar, who form approximately fifty percent of the population, were involved in agriculture, using the services of castes collectively known as Panchamar (Tamil <b>for</b> <b>group</b> of five). The Panchamar consisted of the Nalavar, Pallar, Parayar, Vannar, and Ambattar. Others such as the Karaiyar, existed outside the agriculture-based caste system. The caste of temple priests known as Iyers were also held in high esteem.|$|E

However, eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to lack an A–B bifurcation. Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.|$|E
