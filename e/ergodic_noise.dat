Signal-to-distortion gains of up to 2. 3 dB are obtained for only 2 bits of soft-decision quantization over COVQ schemes designed for a hard-decision (q = 1) demodulated channel. Furthermore, gains as high as 4. 6 dB can be achieved for a highly correlated channel, in comparison with systems designed for the ideally interleaved (memoryless) channel. Finally, the queue-based noise model is validated as an effective approximation of correlated fading channels by testing a COVQ trained using this model over the Rayleigh fading channel. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a simplified proof {{for the existence}} of nested lattice codebooks allowing to achieve the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise channel, as well as the optimal rate-distortion trade-off for a Gaussian source. The proof is self-contained and relies only on basic probabilistic and geometrical arguments. An ensemble of nested lattices that is different, and more elementary, than the one used in previous proofs is introduced. This ensemble is based on lifting different subcodes of a linear code to the Euclidean space using Construction A. In addition to being simpler, our analysis is less sensitive to the assumption that the additive noise is Gaussian. In particular, for additive <b>ergodic</b> <b>noise</b> channels it is shown that the achievable rates of the nested lattice coding scheme depend on the noise distribution only via its power.

40|$|International audienceConsider a real-valued discrete-time {{stationary}} and ergodic stochastic process, {{called the}} noise process. For each dimension n, we can choose a stationary point process in Rn and a translation invariant tessellation of Rn. Each point is randomly displaced, with a displacement vector being {{a section of}} length n of the noise process, independent from point to point. The aim {{is to find a}} point process and a tessellation that minimizes the probability of decoding error, defined as the probability that the displaced version of the typical point does not belong to the cell of this point. We consider the Shannon regime, in which the dimension n tends to ∞, while the logarithm of the intensity of the point processes, normalized by dimension, tends to a constant. We first show that this problem exhibits a sharp threshold: if the sum of the asymptotic normalized logarithmic intensity and of the differential entropy rate of the noise process is positive, then the probability of error tends to 1 with n for all point processes and all tessellations. If it is negative then there exist point processes and tessellations for which this probability tends to 0. The error exponent function, which denotes how quickly the probability of error goes to 0 in n, is then derived using large deviations theory. If the entropy spectrum of the noise satisfies a large deviations principle, then, below the threshold, the error probability goes exponentially fast to 0 with an exponent that is given in closed form in terms of the rate function of the noise entropy spectrum. This is obtained for two classes of point processes: the Poisson process and a Matérn hard-core point process. New lower bounds on error exponents are derived from this for Shannon's additive noise channel in the high signal-to-noise ratio limit that hold for all stationary and <b>ergodic</b> <b>noises</b> with the above properties and that match the best known bounds in the white Gaussian noise case...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We study a joint source-channel {{decoding}} {{scheme that}} exploits the channel’s statistical memory and soft-decision information in fading channels. The channel considered is a recently introduced binary input 2 q-ary output channel with Markovian <b>ergodic</b> <b>noise</b> {{based on a}} finite queue (called NBNDC-QB). This model {{has been shown to}} effectively represent softdecision demodulated correlated Rayleigh fading channels. The coding scheme consists of a scalar quantizer, a proper index assignment, and a sequence maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder designed to harness the redundancy left in the quantizer’s indices, the channel’s soft-decision output, and correlation in the channel noise process. We first consider the simple case where the quantized indices form a binary symmetric Markov source and establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the sequence MAP decoder is reduced to a simple instantaneous symbol-by-symbol decoder. We next assess the signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) performance of our general system. Our numerical results confirm that this system can successfully take advantage of the channel memory and outperforms systems that use channel interleaving by as much as 2. 6 dB in SDR. In addition, SDR gains of up to 2. 8 dB are achieved using as few as 2 bits for soft-decision quantization over hard quantized output schemes. Finally, the NBNDC-QB channel model is validated in terms of SDR performance by fitting the NBNDC-QB model to a discrete correlated Rayleigh fading channel, designing a system for this matched NBNDC-QB model, and comparing this system’s performance over both the NBNDC-QB and the Rayleigh fading channels.

In particular, it is shown that the feedback capacity is equal to _n→∞_p(x^n||y^n- 1) 1 /n I(X^n → Y^n), where I(X^n → Y^n) = ∑_i= 1 ^n I(X^i; Y_i|Y^i- 1) denotes the Massey directed information from the channel input to the output, and the supremum is taken over all causally conditioned distributions p(x^n||y^n- 1) = ∏_i= 1 ^n p(x_i|x^i- 1,y^i- 1).

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} detecting equal-shaped non-overlapping unimodal peaks {{in the presence of}} Gaussian <b>ergodic</b> stationary <b>noise,</b> where the number, location and heights of the peaks are unknown. A multiple testing approach is proposed in which, after kernel smoothing, the presence of a peak is tested at each observed local maximum. The procedure provides strong control of the family wise error rate and the false discovery rate asymptotically as both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the search space get large, where the search space may grow exponentially as a function of SNR. Simulations assuming a Gaussian peak shape and a Gaussian autocorrelation function show that desired error levels are achieved for relatively low SNR and are robust to partial peak overlap. Simulations also show that detection power is maximized when the smoothing bandwidth is close to the bandwidth of the signal peaks, akin to the well-known matched filter theorem in signal processing. The procedure is illustrated in an analysis of electrical recordings of neuronal cell activity. Comment: 37 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|A topological {{multiple}} {{testing scheme}} is presented for detecting peaks in images under stationary <b>ergodic</b> Gaussian <b>noise,</b> where tests are performed at local maxima of the smoothed observed signals. The procedure generalizes the one-dimensional scheme of Schwartzman et al. (2011) to Euclidean domains of arbitrary dimension. Two methods are developed {{according to two}} different ways of computing p-values: (i) using the exact distribution of the height of local maxima (Cheng and Schwartzman, 2014), available explicitly when the noise field is isotropic; (ii) using an approximation to the overshoot distribution of local maxima above a pre-threshold (Cheng and Schwartzman, 2014), applicable when the exact distribution is unknown, such as when the stationary noise field is non-isotropic. The algorithms, combined with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for thresholding p-values, provide asymptotic strong control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and power consistency, with specific rates, as the search space and signal strength get large. The optimal smoothing bandwidth and optimal pre-threshold are obtained to achieve maximum power. Simulations show that FDR levels are maintained in non-asymptotic conditions.

Necessary and sufficient conditions under which the sequence MAP detector becomes useless as well as simulation results are presented. A comparison between the performance of the proposed system with that of a (substantially more complex) traditional tandem source-channel coding scheme exhibits a better performance for the proposed scheme at relatively high channel bit error rates. The same detection problem is then analyzed for the case of a binary symmetric Markov source. Analytical and simulation results show the existence of a "mismatch" between the source and the channel. This mismatch is reduced by the use of a rate-one convolutional encoder. Finally, the detection problem is generalized for the case of a binary non-symmetric Markov source...|$|R

40|$|The {{reliable}} {{transmission of}} information bearing signals over a communication channel constitutes a fundamental problem in communication theory. An important objective in analyzing this problem is to understand and investigate its ﲩnformation theoretic aspects - i. e., to determine the fundamental limits to how efficiently one can encode information and {{still be able to}} recover it with negligible loss. In this work we address this problem for the case where the communication channel is assumed to have memory - i. e., the effect of noise lingers over many transmitted symbols. Our motivation is founded on the fact that most real-world communication channels have memory. We begin by proposing and analyzing a contagion communication channel. A contagion channel is a system in which noise propagates in a way similar to the spread of an infectious disease through a population; each ﲵnfavorable event (i. e., an error) increases the probability of future unfavorable events. A contagion-based model offers an interesting and less complex alternative to other models of channels with memory like the Gilbert-Elliott burst channel. We call the model set forth the Polya-contagion channel - discrete binary communication channel with additive errors modeled according to the famous urn scheme of George Polya for the spread of contagion. We nest consider discrete channels with arbitrary (not necessarily stationary <b>ergodic)</b> additive <b>noise.</b> Note that such channels need not be memoryless; in general, they have memory. We show that output feedback does not increase the capacity of such channels. The same result is also shown for a larger class of channels to which additive channels belong, the class of discrete symmetric channels with memory. These channels have the property that their inf-information rate is maximized for equally likely iid input processes. Finally, we impose average cost constraints on the input of the additive channels, rendering them non-symmetric. We demonstrate that in the case where the additive noise is a binary stationary mixing Markov process, output feedback can increase the capacity-cost function of these channels...|$|R
