25|$|Also in 1867, Jean-Henri Dunant {{was forced}} to declare {{bankruptcy}} due to business failures in Algeria, partly because he had neglected his business interests during his tireless activities for the International Committee. Controversy surrounding Dunant's business dealings and the resulting negative public opinion, combined with an ongoing conflict with Gustave Moynier, led to Dunant's expulsion from his position as a member and secretary. He was charged with <b>fraudulent</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Thus, he {{was forced to}} leave Geneva and never returned to his home city.|$|E

In the following years, national societies were founded in nearly every country in Europe. The project resonated well with patriotic sentiments that were on the rise in the late-nineteenth-century, and national societies were often encouraged as signifiers of national moral superiority. In 1876, the committee adopted the name [...] "International Committee of the Red Cross" [...] (ICRC), which is still its official designation today. Five years later, the American Red Cross was founded through the efforts of Clara Barton. More and more countries signed the Geneva Convention and began to respect it in practice during armed conflicts. In a rather short period of time, the Red Cross gained huge momentum as an internationally respected movement, and the national societies became increasingly popular as a venue for volunteer work.|$|E

50|$|The {{mandate of}} the Integrated Market Enforcement Team (IMET) is to {{investigate}} major cases of financial fraud involving large-cap companies for which allegations of fraud could significantly shake or undermine investor confidence in Canadian financial markets.

50|$|Victims {{are people}} in {{financial}} trouble who believe they are becoming clients of a professional operation. The fraudster promises to make the foreclosures, evictions, repossessions, high interest rates on loans, and other debt problems go away. The victim pays a large initial fee for the fraudster's services, and the fraudster usually has the victim sign blank documents. Sometimes the victim is also told to make their usual payments directly to the fraudulent advisor instead of the real creditors, or to transfer their real estate to the fraudster. The payments are stolen by the fraudster instead of being used to pay victims' debts, and real estate is often deeded in fractional shares to other victims unknowingly under bankruptcy, complicating ownership to make foreclosures even more difficult by having multiple (<b>fraudulent)</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> involved in the property.|$|R

25|$|<b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>fraudulent</b> {{transfer}} law {{is similar}} in practice to non-bankruptcy fraudulent transfer law. Some terms, however, are more generous in bankruptcy than they are otherwise. For instance, {{the statute of limitations}} within bankruptcy is two years as opposed to a shorter time frame in some non-bankruptcy contexts. Generally a fraudulent transfer action operates {{in much the same way}} as a preference avoidance. Fraudulent transfer actions, however, sometimes require a showing of intent to shelter the property from a creditor.|$|R
40|$|In the past, {{religious}} debtors {{have used}} the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to tithe to their churches {{at a time when}} they were insolvent and questions have arisen whether these tithes are fraudulent transfers, which should be repatriated to the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of all creditors. This case comment analyzes the first circuit court opinion to evaluate the intersection of religious tithing, <b>bankruptcy,</b> <b>fraudulent</b> conveyance law and RFRA. In light of the doubts as to RFRA 2 ̆ 7 s constitutionality, this comment argues for a narrow interpretation of RFRA and, when determining the scope of free exercise protection, courts should use a functional balancing test to weigh the competing interests of religious liberty against the need for effective government administration in the context of personal bankruptcy...|$|R
2500|$|On April 23, 2009, Picard said he wouldn't seek {{to recover}} funds from [...] "net losers" [...] in the fraud, {{referring}} {{to those who}} lost more than they withdrew over time, but those investors must prove it. 223 investors who have a direct personal relationship with the Madoff clan have received letters seeking the return of funds totaling $735 million they redeemed from the Madoff firm {{as many as six}} years before the firm collapsed—the time limit allowed under New York law. [...] Known as the legal doctrine of <b>fraudulent</b> conveyance in <b>bankruptcy</b> proceedings means that investors who withdrew their money before the fraud was revealed may be compelled to return their profits or even part of their initial investments. [...] Many of these 223 investors – Madoff’s relatives, employees, and their relatives, and those managers who fed billions of dollars of investors’ money to him, withdrew funds within the previous 90 days of Madoff's December 10, 2008, arrest.|$|R

50|$|The European Court of Justice {{held that}} the Danish authorities' refusal to {{recognise}} the company was contrary to articles 52 and 58, and that its rules on minimum capital were not justified by the aim of protecting creditors by anticipating the risks of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> due to the insolvency of companies having inadequate initial capitalisation.

5000|$|Bankruptcy is not {{the only}} legal status that an {{insolvent}} person may have, and the term bankruptcy is therefore not a synonym for insolvency. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, bankruptcy is limited to individuals, and other forms of insolvency proceedings (such as liquidation and administration) are applied to companies. In the United States, bankruptcy is applied more broadly to formal insolvency proceedings. In France, the cognate French word banqueroute is used solely for cases of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> whereas the term faillite (cognate of [...] "failure") is used for bankruptcy in accordance with the law.|$|E

50|$|In 1910 the {{financier}} Riccardo Gualino and {{his wife}} launched {{construction of a new}} castle with almost 150 rooms in Cereseto.The Castello di Cereseto, in Neo-Quattrocento Piemont-Lombardy style, was completed in 1913.In 1931 Gualino was confined to the Aeolian island of Lipari on charges of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> and suffered the confiscation of all his property.The castle went through various changes of ownership, and at one time hosted one of the most impressive illegal drug refineries and laboratories in Europe. Later it became property of the financier Carlo Mereta's Martina company. As of December 2014 that company was bankrupt, and new owners were being sought.|$|E

50|$|On August 14, 2009, {{the provincial}} {{legislature}} voted to expropriate the factory to the Zanon cooperative legally and indefinitely by {{a count of}} 26 for and 9 against. The state also agreed to pay the principal creditors still owed roughly 22 million pesos (around $7 million). Chief amongst these creditors are the World Bank, from whom Luis Zanon took a substantial loan to start the factory, and SACMY, an Italian company that produces ceramics machinery. However, the cooperative has resisted these moves, arguing that these creditors participated in a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> in 2001, and that Zanon himself should be liable for these debts, because the credits went to him personally, and not the plant.|$|E

50|$|The {{bankruptcy}} of the Scali was not exceptional; {{over the whole}} 13th and 14th centuries {{a long string of}} such events kept sending shock waves over the European financial scene. This certainly points to the difficulty bankers of the time faced when trying to safeguard the public's trust in their ability to repay (numerous cases of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> over the period made it all the more difficult). These repeated collapses {{had a profound impact on}} the public's perception of the financial world. In Italy they became bywords of the little faith one could put in a foreign sovereign; during the 1940s the Italian fascist cinema even used this theme as a propaganda weapon against the United Kingdom (Il Re d'Inghilterra non pagà, 1941).|$|E

Aldo Micciché, a businessman who moved to Venezuela after being convicted of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> in Italy, planned to fill in 50,000 blank ballot slips for Italian voters in Latin America obtained from corrupt officials. Micciché asked two leading members of the Piromalli clan to visit Marcello Dell'Utri - Berlusconi's right-hand man - at his Milan office. Dell'Utri was taped after the meeting complimenting Micciché for introducing him to two 'good picciotti,' a Sicilian expression used to describe low-level mafiosi.|$|E
