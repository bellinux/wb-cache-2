The present {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} carried out to establish the stability, compatibility and feasibility of working characteristics of DICI engine by using Jatropha biodiesel, Pongamia biodiesel and related water emulsion biodiesels. Experiments are carried out in two phases on a DICI engine test rig which includes CI engine, electric loading device, <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysers,</b> and a data-acquisition system. The performance and emission characteristics of the engine are studied by using neat diesel, Jatropha and Pongamia biodiesel in the first phase, and similar experiments are conducted by water – biodiesel emulsion fuels in the second phase.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was, to {{investigate}} and model the performance and characteristics of automotive catalytic converter formulations when subjected to a synthetic <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> mixture representative of that emitted by an ethanol-fuelled engine. A synthetic <b>gas</b> reactor and <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> were used to investigate the catalytic activity and chemical mechanisms exhibited by various catalytic converter formulations. Commercially available automotive after•treatment modelling software was used to simulate the behaviour of one specific formulation. The experimental work contained within this study includes investigations into the procedures of initial thermal stabilisation and periodic pre•treatment of catalytic converter test samples. Protocols were established for stabilisation and pre•treatment and were adhered to in the subsequent experimental work. Further experimental work investigated the performance of platinum, palladium and palladium/rhodium catalytic converter formulations when subjected to non•traditional <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> compounds as found from ethanol fuel combustion. In addition to catalytic activity these tests also revealed the chemical reaction pathways associated with each formulation. The final phase of testing was carried out using a 'Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle' specification catalytic converter sample provided by Jaguar Land Rover. This sample comprised of palladium and rhodium and was tested for catalytic performance and its chemical reaction pathway characteristics {{were found to be}} consistent with that of the original palladium and rhodium formulation tested. Further data was extracted from this sample with respect to the promoting and inhibiting compounds required for the purpose of structuring kinetic rate equations pertaining to the ethanol <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> species chemical reaction pathways.

The oxygenated oleic acid additives used for this experiment is fixed at 0. 2 % by volume due to limited quantity available.

The experimental results showed that the brake power increased by 2 %, torque by 2 %, brake thermal efficiency by about 7 % and specific fuel consumption decreased by about 10 %. The exhaust emissions analysed are carbon monoxide, (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx).
