40|$|AbstractVoluntary {{actions are}} {{accompanied}} by a distinctive subjective experience, so that they feel quite different from physically similar involuntary movements. However, the nature and origin of this experience of volition remain unclear. Voluntary actions emerge during early childhood, in parallel with reduction of involuntary movements. However, the available markers {{of the experience of}} volition, notably Libet's mental chronometry of intention, cannot readily be used in young children. In Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS), however, involuntary tic movements may coexist with voluntary control into adulthood. Therefore, adolescents with GTS could potentially confuse the two classes of movement. We have measured the temporal experience of voluntary action in a well-characterised group of adolescents with GTS, and age-matched controls. We replicated previous reports of a conscious intention occurring a few hundred milliseconds prior to voluntary keypress actions. Multiple regression across 25 patients' results showed that age and trait tic severity did not influence the experience of conscious intention. However, patients with stronger premonitory urges prior to tics showed significantly later conscious intentions, suggesting that the anticipatory experience of one's own volition involves a perceptual discrimination between potentially competing pre-movement signals. Patients who were more able to voluntarily suppress their tics showed significantly <b>earlier</b> <b>conscious</b> intention, suggesting that the perceptual discrimination between different action classes may also contribute to voluntary control of tics. We suggest that the brain learns voluntary control by perceptually discriminating a special class of internal ‘intentional’ signals, allowing them to emerge from motor noise...|$|R

South False Creek went from being an {{industrial}} park, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, to being the populous residential area that it is today. The development of this area, beginning anew in the 1970s, occurred at a critical time in Vancouver’s history when citizens were organizing support for a new picture of the city, one that {{broke away from the}} standardized utilitarian cities that were so popular in North America and, instead, pushed for a more livable and diverse built environment. This neighborhood, located on municipally and federally owned land, offered an opportunity for project leaders, often led by TEAM members, to create a new kind of space, what Ley calls a post-modern space. Architecture and urban planning that embrace diversity of design, human-scale proportions, open public spaces, historical and vernacular allusions, diverse demography and the trade of local goods reflect the post-modern goals of inclusion and tradition that were important to the project leaders behind South False Creek. The result is a medium-density area with a variety of architectural designs, ownership opportunities, recreational activities, and modes of transportation, which allows for easier mobility within the community and a more picturesque landscape to be enjoyed by residents and visitors alike. Bike paths, parks, unique three-story homes, a public market, and the intentional preservation of mountain-views, and other characteristics, distinguish the area of South False Creek as one of the <b>earliest</b> <b>conscious</b> attempts to create a more “livable” environment for Vancouverites rather than focusing on efficiency and profitability as modernists are often criticized for doing.|$|R

As with analogous studies performed on the incisor, three distinct reflex events were identified in the EMG before the <b>earliest</b> <b>conscious</b> subject reaction: <b>early</b> excitation, inhibition and late excitation. However, contrary to observations found during studies on the incisor, excitation, not inhibition was the primary reflex response. The application of a local anaesthetic block around the stimulated molar showed that the primary agents in eliciting the observed reflexes were not contained within the periodontium of the stimulated tooth. A diminished representation of periodontal mechanoreceptors around the molar teeth and more elaborate root structures, hence a more solid connection to the jaw and consequently less tooth movement, were deemed the likely reason for the distinction between the reflex responses of the incisal and molar regions. In addition to the reflex studies, the minimum reaction time of a number of subjects was determined to permit the distinction of a reflex event and an event that could be a conscious subject reaction. It was found that the reaction time of the temporalis muscles was significantly shorter than those of the masseter, while no significant difference was found between the left and right sides. Overall, the data showed that the presence or absence of background muscle activity and subject variability were the main causes of changes in the reflex response, provided the level of the stimulus was greater than 3 N. The application of local anaesthetic had no impact on the reflexes evokedRussell S. A. Brinkworth, Courtney Male and Kemal S. Türke...|$|R

40|$|In their seminal (1983) study, Libet {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that awareness of one’s intention to act has a postdictive character {{in that it}} occurs long after cerebral activity leading to action has been initiated. Crucially, Libet et al. further suggested that the time window (6200 ms) between the conscious experience of the intention to act and the action itself offers people the possibility of “vetoing” the unfolding action. This {{raises the question of}} whether there are individual differences in the duration of this “veto window” and which components of the readiness potential (RP) and the lateral- ized readiness potential (LRP) explain this variability. It has been reported that some psychiatric diseases lead to shorter intervals between conscious intentions and actions. However, it is unclear whether such patients suffer from impair- ment of the sense of volition, thus experiencing voluntary movements as involuntary, or whether voluntary inhibition of action is actually reduced, since conscious intention occurs later. We had two aims in the present paper. First, we aimed at clarifying the role of consciousness in voluntary actions by examining the relation between the duration of the veto window and impulsivity. Second, we sought to examine different components of the RP and LRP waveforms so as to attempt to explain observed variability in W judgments. Our results indicate (1) that impulsive people exhibit a shorter delay between their intention and the action than non-impulsive people, and (2) that this difference can hardly be attrib- uted to a difference in time perception. Electroencephalography indicated that the rate of growth of the RP is relevant to explain differences in W judgments, since we observed that the RP at the moment of conscious intention is lower for people with late conscious intention than for people with <b>early</b> <b>conscious</b> intention. The onset and the intercept of these waveforms were less interpretable. These results bring new light on the role that consciousness plays in voluntary action. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

60|$|Anthropologists {{demonstrate}} that the belief in this universal kinship, universal personality of things, which we find surviving only in the myths of civilised races, is even now to some degree part of the living creed of savages. Civilised myths, then, they urge, are survivals from a parallel state of belief once prevalent among the ancestors of even the Aryan race. But how did this mental condition, this early sort of false metaphysics, come into existence? We have no direct historical information on the subject. If I were obliged to offer an hypothesis, {{it would be that}} <b>early</b> men, <b>conscious</b> of personality, will, and life--conscious that force, when exerted by themselves, followed on a determination of will within them--extended that explanation to all the exhibitions of force which they beheld without them. Rivers run (early man thought), winds blow, fire burns, trees wave, {{as a result of their}} own will, the will of personal conscious entities. Such vitality, and even power of motion, early man attributed even to inorganic matter, as rocks and stones. All these things were beings, like man himself. This does not appear to me an unnatural kind of nascent, half-conscious metaphysics. 'Man never knows how much he anthropomorphises.' He extended the only explanation of his own action which consciousness yielded to him, he extended it to explain every other sort of action in the sensible world. Early Greek philosophy recognised the stars as living bodies; all things had once seemed living and personal. From the beginning, man was eager causas cognoscere rerum. The only cause about which self-consciousness gave him any knowledge was his own personal will. He therefore supposed all things to be animated with a like will and personality. His mythology is a philosophy of things, stated in stories based on the belief in universal personality.|$|R

One {{possible explanation for}} the results could be that conscious visual perception emerges progressively rather than appearing as a binary transition. In the present study, we used electrical neuroimaging to identify the stages of processing that lead to the successful conscious identification of a briefly presented degraded stimulus. Grayscale images of faces and butterflies were presented for 16 ms and their visibility was manipulated by means of random image structure evolution (RISE). Three levels of RISE image distortions were used for each image. First, we determined an individual detection threshold of 50 % for each subject. We then added two control conditions, namely fully degraded stimuli and stimuli that yielded 80 % detection. Topographic ERP analyses revealed distinct effects for identified and unidentified stimuli at the threshold of detection. Four stages were observed that distinguished successful from unsuccessful stimulus identification. This shows that the events associated with conscious perception occurs at several distinct stages in time starting as early as 220 ms after stimulus presentation, rather than translating as a single temporal event and includes marked top-down activations when identification becomes difficult...|$|R

In addition, the phenomenon of hemianopic completion and percepts induced by brain stimulation suggest that V 1 may not be necessary for conscious perception in all circumstances. Furthermore, that the visual abilities in the cat are associated with the recovery of normal extrastriate tuning properties rather than emulation of V 1 functions suggests that there is nothing unique about the functional properties of this region in visual awareness. Rather, the dramatic effect of a V 1 lesion on visual awareness may be due to its role in providing the majority of extrastriate visual input, the loss of which abolishes normal neural responsiveness throughout the visual cortex.

40|$|This {{interview}} {{study focused}} on urban <b>early</b> adolescents' <b>conscious</b> experiences of high density conditions. Thirty children residing in apartments in two boroughs of New York City (Brooklyn and Manhattan), participated in this study. Control variables included income level, age, family constellation, and length of residence. Sex, apartment density, building size and neighbourhood density served as classification variables. The interview lasted approximately forty minutes and addressed the following issues. Personal conceptualizations and definitions of crowding. Evaluation of the children's perceived neighbourhood. Peer relationships. Perceived social and physical opportunities and constraints. Interviews were tape recorded, transcribed and content analyzed. The children's conceptualizations of crowding emphasized large numbers of people, spatial restriction and an aversive experience of the situation as relevant components of the crowding construct. The restriction of behavioural choice {{as it relates to}} goal postponement and the child's efforts {{to come to terms with}} larger organizational social structures, underlined the interpretation of crowding as a socio-physical stressor. While information overload was depicted as another relevant characteristic of crowding situations, its aversive experience was mediated by the presence of known others. Even though this diversity on social and physical levels was often experienced as stressful, it was also positively viewed in situations where interpersonal contact or a sense of familiarity were not overriden by other situation demands. Boys tended to spend more time in their neighbourhood engaged in a broader range of activities than girls. In this sample, boys also took less part in structured group activities and rated their neighbourhoods somewhat more positively than girls. Girls experienced less freedom and more social restrictions in exploring and actively interacting with their extended surroundings than boys. The issues of movement and situationally imposed behavioural restriction were central themes in children's conscious experiences of high density situations. Emphasis was placed on physiological arousal linked to the perception of aversive social qualities of high density situations. It appears that an increase in the need to act out is more a function of the child's awareness of having to conform to external norms, or experiencing a loss of perceived social control in situations where vigilance is required, than a clear cognisance of spatial restrictions. The investigation of the impact of high density conditions on the child's sociocognitive development and identity formation is viewed as potentially fruitful directions for future research. © 1984 Academic Press Inc.

This study included 150 black children from segregated nursery schools in Washington, D.C. 50% {{of the participants were}} girls and 50% were boys. There were 50 three-year-old, 50 four-year-old, and 50 five-year-old children involved.

The participants were asked to point to the drawing that represented who or what they were asked about. An example of this procedure would be a black boy being asked to point to his cousin or brother. The results of this study showed that the group tended to choose the black drawing more than the white drawing. As age increased, there was an increase in the ratio of choosing the black boy in contrast to the white boy in favor of the black boy. This finding indicates that a great amount of self-conscious development and racial identity happens between ages three and fours years old. Once past four years old, this identification with the black boy plateaus. This plateau may imply that the picture study is not sensitive enough for children over four. It also suggests that maybe five-year old children have reached a self-awareness and now see themselves in an intrinsic way and are less capable of external representations.|$|R
50|$|The {{adaptive}} unconscious, first {{coined by}} Daniel Wagner in 2002, {{is described as}} a series of mental processes that is able to affect judgement and decision making, but is out of reach of the conscious mind. Architecturally, the adaptive unconscious is said to be unreachable because it is buried in an unknown part of the brain. This type of thinking evolved <b>earlier</b> than the <b>conscious</b> mind, enabling the mind to transform information and think in ways that enhance an organism's survival. It can be described as a quick sizing up of the world which interprets information and decides how to act very quickly and outside the conscious view. The adaptive unconscious is active in everyday activities such as learning new material, detecting patterns, and filtering information. It is also characterized by being unconscious, unintentional, uncontrollable, and efficient without requiring cognitive tools. Lacking the need for cognitive tools does not make the adaptive unconscious any less useful than the conscious mind as the adaptive unconscious allows for processes like memory formation, physical balancing, language, learning, and some emotional and personalities processes that includes judgement, decision making, impression formation, evaluations, and goal pursuing. Despite being useful, the series of processes of the adaptive unconscious will not always result in accurate or correct decisions by the organism. The adaptive unconscious is affected by things like emotional reaction, estimations, and experience and is thus inclined to stereotyping and schema which can lead to inaccuracy in decision making. The adaptive conscious does however help decision making to eliminate cognitive biases such as prejudice because of its lack of cognitive tools.|$|R

Interviews were conducted with six early adolescents in Attridgeville suburb located in Tshwane (then called Pretoria) in South Africa.

In this study the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET) was used to explore the processes involved in the buying patterns of clothing during early adolescence, particularly for black adolescents in an urban environment. Pictures, compiled in the format of a collage, were used as a projective technique to probe respondents’ constructions of their preferred buying patterns and consumer behaviour. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis as a procedure of qualitative research. Verification of transcripts and themes by an independent third party enhanced validity and reliability of findings. Themes indicate that early adolescents are quite involved in consumer behaviour and make decisions based on lifestyle, consumer socialisation, purchasing styles and filters. Both peers and family act as socialisation agents, and socio-structural factors such as birth order, financial aspects, attitudes, and retail outlets have an impact on the actual buying patterns of clothing. Further study is needed to determine the effect of media and learning styles on the consumer behaviour of black adolescents in a South African context.

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{in this thesis}} were designed {{to examine the effects}} of surgical reversal of 2 -kidney, 1 -clip hypertension on baroreflexes and vascular capacitance. In the first set of experiments, baroreflex function was studied using a 'steady state' technique in <b>conscious</b> <b>early</b> phase 2 -kidney, 1 -clip rats before and 24 hours after surgical reversal of hypertension by unclipping or after pharmacological reduction of blood pressure by an infusion of hydralazine or captopril. A further group was studied 3 weeks after unclipping. With reduction of the blood pressure, the baroreflex was reset within 24 hours, irrespective of the method of blood pressure reduction, the degree of resetting being dependant on the level of blood pressure achieved. This resetting occurs without a change in baroreflex sensitivity. However, at 3 weeks after unclipping, the baroreflex sensitivity had returned to normal. In the second set of experiments, vascular capacitance was studied in conscious 2 -kidney, 1 -clip hypertensive rats and sham-clipped controls. Two further groups of 2 -kidney, 1 -clip rats were studied before and 6 hours after unclipping or a sham operation. Mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) was measured during a brief circulatory arrest by inflation of a right atrial balloon. Blood volume (BV) was measured by a radioisotopic dilution method and vascular compliance derived from the MCFP-BV curve. There was reduced vascular capacity in 2 -kidney, 1 -clip hypertension. Within 6 hours of unclipping, there was a marked reduction in mean circulatory filling pressure, with no change in blood volume or compliance, indicting a rapid increase in vascular capacity and reduction in venous tone. The third set of experiments explored the possible contribution of the renomedullary vasodepressor mechanisms to changes in vascular capacitance The model of chemical renal medullary damage secondary to bromoethylamine was used. In this study no difference in vascular capacitance was demonstrated, suggesting the lack of renomedullary vasodepressor mechanisms in the long-term had no demonstrable effect on venous tone...|$|R
