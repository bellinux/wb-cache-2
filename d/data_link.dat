5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and <b>data</b> <b>link</b> protocol can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This {{is because the}} Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or <b>data</b> <b>link</b> protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E

5|$|The F-22 has {{integrated}} radio functionality, {{the signal}} processing systems are virtualized {{rather than as}} a separate hardware module. There have been several reports on the F-22's inability to communicate with other aircraft, and funding cuts have affected the integration of the Multifunction Advanced <b>Data</b> <b>Link</b> (MADL). Voice communication is possible, but not data transfer.|$|E
40|$|WS-BPEL is a {{standard}} language to model business processes. Control flow is modeled explicitly using <b>links.</b> <b>Data</b> is passed via shared variables {{and there is no}} notion of explicit <b>data</b> <b>links.</b> However, explicit <b>data</b> <b>links</b> are an important means to reason about business process models. We present an algorithm to derive explicit <b>data</b> <b>links</b> in WS-BPEL processes. By considering dead path elimination as defined in WS-BPEL, we reduce the number of derived <b>data</b> <b>links</b> when compared to existing approaches that ignore dead path elimination...|$|R

40|$|By specifying that {{published}} datasets must link {{to other}} existing datasets, the 4 th <b>linked</b> <b>data</b> principle ensures a Web {{of data and}} not just a set of unconnected data islands. The authors propose in this paper the term <b>data</b> <b>linking</b> to name the problem of finding equivalent resources on the Web of <b>linked</b> <b>data.</b> In order to perform <b>data</b> <b>linking,</b> many techniques were developed, finding their roots in statistics, database, natural language processing and graph theory. The authors begin this paper by providing background information and terminological clarifications related to <b>data</b> <b>linking.</b> Then a comprehensive survey over the various techniques available for <b>data</b> <b>linking</b> is provided. These techniques are classified along the three criteria of granularity, type of evidence, and source of the evidence. Finally, the authors survey eleven recent tools performing <b>data</b> <b>linking</b> and we classify them according to the surveyed techniques...|$|R

Phase 2.3 added the Electronic Warfare suite upgrade (Radar Warning Receiver, Radio Frequency Jammer) and phase 2.4 upgraded with the Target Designation System (HTDS). The following support systems will also be either upgraded or replaced, the Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) {{to be replaced by}} the Hornet Aircrew Training System (HACTS), the Integrated Avionics Software Support Facility (IASSF), the Mission Planning System (MPS), Miscellaneous Support Equipment (SE), Computer Based Training System (CBTS), Simulated Aircraft Maintenance Training System (SAMTS) to be replaced by the Integrated Maintenance Training System (IMTS).|$|E

5|$|A {{helmet-mounted sight}} (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical <b>data</b> <b>link</b> can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centres, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved situation awareness.|$|E

The <b>Linked</b> <b>Data</b> {{initiative}} {{promotes the}} publication of previously isolated databases as interlinked RDF datasets, thereby creating a global scale data space, known as the Web of <b>Data.</b> <b>Linked</b> <b>Data</b> Mashup applications, which consume data from the multiple <b>Linked</b> <b>Data</b> sources in the Web of Data, are confronted {{with the challenge of}} obtaining a homogenized view of this global data space, called a <b>Linked</b> <b>Data</b> Mashup view.
