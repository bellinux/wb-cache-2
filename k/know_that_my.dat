500|$|In the {{conventional}} sense, Cardus {{was not a}} religious man; Dennis Silk, a one-time MCC president, suggests that Cardus's religion was [...] "friendship". In Autobiography Cardus says he found his Kingdom of Heaven in the arts, [...] "the only religion that is real and, once found, omnipresent"—though his rationalism was shaken, he confesses, {{when he came to}} understand the late string quartets of Beethoven. He ends his autobiography by declaring: [...] "If I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Redeemer liveth it is not on the church's testimony, but because of what Handel affirms".|$|E
500|$|Another {{source of}} {{criticism}} by the Liberals involved PedroI's abolitionist views. The Emperor had indeed conceived a gradual process for eliminating slavery. However, the constitutional power to enact legislation {{was in the}} hands of the Assembly, which was dominated by slave-owning landholders who could thus thwart any attempt at abolition. The Emperor opted to try persuasion by moral example, setting up his estate at Santa Cruz as a model by granting land to his freed slaves there. PedroI also professed other advanced ideas. When he declared his intention to remain in Brazil on 9 January 1822 and the populace sought to accord him the honor of unhitching the horses and pulling his carriage themselves, the then-Prince Regent refused. His reply was a simultaneous denunciation of the divine right of kings, of nobility's supposedly superior blood and of racism: [...] "It grieves me to see my fellow humans giving a man tributes appropriate for the divinity, I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> blood is the same color as that of the Negroes." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Messiah {{is not in}} any {{particular}} key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as [...] "an aspiration towards D major", the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the [...] "trumpet" [...] movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In {{the absence of a}} predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the [...] "ascending fourth" [...] as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Redeemer liveth" [...] and on numerous other occasions. Nevertheless, Luckett finds this thesis implausible, and asserts that [...] "the unity of Messiah is a consequence of nothing more arcane than the quality of Handel's attention to his text, and the consistency of his musical imagination". Allan Kozinn, The New York Times music critic, finds [...] "a model marriage of music and text... From the gentle falling melody assigned to the opening words ("Comfort ye") to the sheer ebullience of the [...] "Hallelujah" [...] chorus and the ornate celebratory counterpoint that supports the closing [...] "Amen", hardly a line of text goes by that Handel does not amplify".|$|E

500|$|The opening soprano solo in E major, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Redeemer liveth" [...] is [...] {{one of the}} few {{numbers in}} the oratorio that has {{remained}} unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: [...] "Behold, I tell you a mystery", then the long aria [...] "The trumpet shall sound", marked [...] ("dignified but not fast"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of [...] "incorruptible" [...] may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he [...] "could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, [...] "O death, where is thy sting?" [...] The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata , and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus [...] "But thanks be to God".|$|E
500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, as the second-string quarterback, he saw {{his first}} action against [...] when he was {{substituted}} for injured starter Jordan Steffy. Turner executed a scoring drive and completed four of six passes, but also threw two interceptions. He sat out the next two games and then took one snap against Wake Forest. When the unranked Terps faced 10th-ranked Rutgers, Steffy suffered a concussion and Turner again filled in. He led drives for two touchdowns and two field goals in an upset of the Scarlet Knights, 34–24. About the then relatively unknown Turner, Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano said, [...] "I wish I would have seen this guy before." [...] Turner started for the remaining eight games of the season. In his career-first start, he passed for 255yards in a win against Georgia Tech, 28–26. In the game, he threw a 78-yard touchdown pass, which was caught by tight end Jason Goode rather than his intended receiver, Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a three-game losing streak, Turner led another upset win over a top-ten team, this time against eighth-ranked Boston College, 42–35. In the 24–16 loss to Florida State, Turner had his worst performance of the season. Late in the second quarter, he was benched and replaced by Steffy for two possessions. Turner said, [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> leash was that short in the first place, to be honest. I didn't think {{it would come to}} this. I guess I should have." [...] After an uneven performance by Steffy, Turner played the entire second half and showed improvement. The following week Maryland played their regular season finale against NC State and both teams needed an additional win to attain bowl eligibility. Maryland led in the second quarter, 3–0, but was struggling offensively. Turner, a generally immobile pocket quarterback, invigorated the offense when he executed a 41-yard option run for a first down. He completed 19 of 24 passes for 206 yards and led a shutout of NC State, 37–0. With the sixth win, Maryland was invited to the Emerald Bowl, where they were beaten by Oregon State, 21–14. Turner finished the season as the third-most efficient passer in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).|$|E

Because the low bell (B) is struck twice in quick succession, {{there is not enough}} time to pull a hammer back, and it is supplied with two wrench hammers {{on opposite sides of the}} bell.
