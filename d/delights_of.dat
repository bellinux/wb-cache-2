5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the <b>delights</b> <b>of</b> their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason for}} the gradual decline in the {{development}} of Sicily's Baroque and building in general was that the money was running out. During the 17th century, the aristocracy had lived principally on their landed estates, tending and improving them, and as a result their income also increased. During the 18th century, the nobility gradually migrated towards the cities, in particular Palermo, to enjoy the social <b>delights</b> <b>of</b> the Viceroy's court and Catania. Their town palazzi grew in size and splendour, {{to the detriment of the}} abandoned estates, which were still expected to provide the revenue. The land agents left to run the estates over time became less efficient, or corrupt, often both. Consequently, aristocratic incomes fell. The aristocracy borrowed money using the estates as surety, until the value of the neglected estates fell below the money borrowed against them. Moreover, Sicily was by now as unstable politically as its nobility were financially. Ruled from Naples by the weak Ferdinand IV and his dominant wife, Sicily had declined to the point of no return long before 1798 and again in 1806 when the King was forced by the invading French to flee Naples to Sicily. The French were kept at bay from Sicily only by an expeditionary force of 17,000 British troops, and Sicily was now ruled by Britain in effect if not in name. King Ferdinand then in 1811 imposed the first taxes, at a single stroke alienating his aristocracy.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} {{involution}} is Delight - the <b>Delight</b> <b>of</b> Being (the Spirit or Absolute) moving to <b>Delight</b> <b>of</b> Becoming (temporal existence, the cosmos).

Lycotas notes that the people in the countryside had continued to make music, in Corydon's absence. Lycotas dismisses such rustic entertainments and rites, in favour of the <b>delights</b> <b>of</b> the city. Lycotas asks Corydon to tell him more.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{tourism in}} Ireland {{was not a}} new development, {{it was in the}} last quarter of the nineteenth century that a great {{increase}} occurred with large numbers of tourists making the sea crossing from Great Britain to see the <b>delights</b> <b>of</b> Ireland's scenery. The railways saw that it would be to their advantage to encourage tourist development since this would bring them increased traffic. On the BNCR, its manager, Edward John Cotton, especially recognised the potential value of tourism and was influential in its development throughout the North of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|A pair of courtyards {{is found}} in the {{northern}} corners of the jilaukhana which provided quarters (Khawasspuras) for the tombs attendants and the Hafiz.

The Khawasspurs had fallen into a state of disrepair by the late 18th century but the institution of the Khadim continued into the 20th century. The Khawasspuras were restored by Lord Curzon as part of his repairs between 1900 and 1908, after which the western courtyard was used as a nursery for the garden and the western courtyard was used as a cattle stable until 2003.|$|E

500|$|The show {{revolves}} around a mouse named Mouse Fitzgerald (voiced by Matt Maiellaro), nicknamed [...] "Fitz", who {{is fond of}} beer and caught {{in a world of}} espionage, love, and the <b>delights</b> <b>of</b> odd jobs. The show employs a serial format, and its ongoing storyline developed from absurdist comedy to include mystery and thriller elements. Fitz begins to recover suppressed memories that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.|$|E
500|$|The {{first scene}} set to music occurs after Titania has left Oberon, {{following}} an argument over {{the ownership of}} a little Indian boy.

The stuttering has led many to believe the scene {{is based on the}} habits of Thomas d'Urfey. However, it may also be poking fun at Elkanah Settle, who stuttered as well and was long thought to be the librettist, due to an error in his 1910 biography.|$|E

500|$|The {{accusations of}} {{adultery}} were rampant. According to Pintoin's chronicle, [...] " [...] clung {{a bit too}} closely to his sister-in-law, the young and pretty Isabeau of Bavaria, the queen. This ardent brunette was twenty-two; her husband was insane and her seductive brother-in-law loved to dance, beyond that we can imagine all sorts of things". Pintoin said of the Queen and Orléans that they neglected Charles, behaved scandalously and [...] "lived on the <b>delights</b> <b>of</b> the flesh", spending {{large amounts of money}} on court entertainment. The alleged affair, however, is based on a single paragraph from Pintoin's chronicles, according to Adams, and is no longer considered proof.|$|E

500|$|The {{documentary}} {{was directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund.

Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles to become a less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person. The bonus live CD proves that she's a better singer." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic complimented the release saying [...] "as Madonna's first live CD, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining, {{and even if the}} excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours, it's also quite well done." [...] The release debuted at number33 on the Billboard 200 and the top ten in Canada and the European Top 100 Albums chart.|$|E

500|$|With {{his success}} as an {{editorial}} writer, Hay's duties expanded. In October 1871, he journeyed to Chicago {{after the great}} fire there, interviewing Mrs. O'Leary, whose cow {{was said to have}} started the blaze, describing her as [...] "a woman with a lamp [...] to the barn behind the house, to milk the cow with the crumpled temper, that kicked the lamp, that spilled the kerosene, that fired the straw that burned Chicago". His work at the Tribune came as his fame as a poet was reaching its peak, and one colleague described it as [...] "a liberal education in the <b>delights</b> <b>of</b> intellectual life to sit in intimate companionship with John Hay and watch the play of that well-stored and brilliant mind". In addition to writing, Hay was signed by the prestigious Boston Lyceum Bureau, whose clients included Mark Twain and Susan B.

500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{said that}} the album [...] "may be a return to core values, but there's still a bravery about Confessions on a Dancefloor.

[...] Peter Robinson from Observer Music Monthly declared that the album ranks alongside Madonna's other albums like True Blue (1986) and Like a Prayer (1989). He credited producer Stuart Price for the album, noting that [...] "Confessions clearly wouldn't exist without Madonna, but it's Price who steals the show." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork noted that with the album [...] "Madonna again reinvents herself, and it appears she's nearly lapped herself." [...] According to Deusner, the music also makes her appear young. However he felt that {{the first half of the}} album till [...] "I Love New York" [...] was strong, while the second half [...] "loses its delicate balance between pop frivolity and spiritual gravity." ...|$|E
