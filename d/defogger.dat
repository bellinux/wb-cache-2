25|$|Other {{changes would}} be a redesigned, more {{integrated}} sunshade and spoiler on the rear hatch. The rear spoiler was changed from a one-piece to a two-piece. The L-types of this year were not available with a leather interior, but P-types were. Toyota added a standard factory theft deterrent system and the outside mirrors were equipped with a <b>defogger</b> that activated with the rear defroster. All Supras this year received automatic-off lights that also encompassed an automatic illuminated entry and fade-out system.|$|E
25|$|The ZR1 special engine {{package was}} a $1,221.00 option {{available}} exclusively with the LT-1 engine option. It included the solid-lifter small-block engine, heavy-duty four-speed transmission, power brakes, aluminum radiator, and a revised suspension with special springs, shocks, stabilizer bar, and spindle-strut shafts. Since it was competition equipment, the ZR1 {{could not be}} ordered with power windows, power steering, air conditioning, a rear-window <b>defogger,</b> wheel covers, or a radio. Only 53 1970-1972 ZR1's were built (25 in 1970, including 8 convertibles, 8 in 1971, and 20 in 1972).|$|E
25|$|The DMC-12 {{was only}} {{available}} with two factory options; a no-cost manual transmission or automatic transmission ($650 extra) {{and the choice}} of a grey or black interior. Several dealer options were available, including a car cover; floor mats; black textured accent stripes; grey scotch-cal accent stripes; a luggage rack and a ski-rack adapter. The standard feature list included stainless steel body panels; gull-wing doors with cryogenically treated torsion bars; leather seats; air conditioning; an AM/FM cassette stereo system; power windows, locks and mirrors; a tilt and telescopic steering wheel; tinted glass; body side moldings; intermittent/constant windshield wipers; and an electric rear window <b>defogger.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At road courses, {{it is now}} {{permissible}} to run qualifying {{and race}} sessions under wet-weather conditions. Goodyear will supply wet-weather tires for use in Sprint Cup competition and teams {{will be required to}} bring cars with windshield wipers, <b>defoggers,</b> and wet-weather racing capabilities.|$|R
50|$|Secondary <b>defoggers,</b> such {{as those}} used on a vehicle's backglass and/or side view mirrors, often consist {{of a series of}} {{parallel}} linear resistive conductors in or on the glass. When power is applied, these conductors heat up, thawing ice and evaporating condensation from the glass. These conductors may be composed of a silver-ceramic material printed and baked onto the interior surface of the glass, or may be a series of very fine wires embedded within the glass. The surface-printed variety is prone to damage by abrasion, but can be repaired easily with a conductive paint material.|$|R
5000|$|But rumors {{surrounded}} DeSoto that Chrysler {{was ready}} to kill the brand and customers reacted by buying other brand cars. Also hurting DeSoto was its design, almost exactly like that of Chrysler, except for the grille and the blade styled tail lights, also drove consumers into Chrysler showroom where they bought the almost identical Chrysler Windsor without the fear {{that it would be}} an orphan like the DeSoto was bound to be, and soon. New was dual speed rear window <b>defoggers,</b> a drivers seat with five more inches added to the seat back, [...] the Hiway Hifi that played RCA 45rpm records, and Unibody construction.|$|R
25|$|Initially, 2500 Indy 500 replica pacers—100 {{for each}} year of production—were {{scheduled}} for sale. But {{it was decided that}} each of Chevrolet's 6502 dealers should have one for showroom display. Thus what was called the Limited Edition Indy Pace Car Replica Corvette made up some 15 percent of total production. Like the Silver Anniversary model, the Pace Car Replica was actually an option package-RPO Z78. Its main distinction was black over silver metallic with a bright red pinstripe in between with a spoiler added to each end to alter appearance more dramatically. Pace car interiors reflected Bill Mitchell's influence, with full silver leather or silver leather/gray cloth upholstery and gray carpeting. All replicas were equipped with new thin-shell design-lumbar support seats, new glass t-tops, alloy wheels, power windows, air conditioning, tilt/telescope steering wheel, power locks, rear <b>defogger,</b> sport mirrors, heavy-duty battery, and AM/FM stereo with either eight-track tape player or CB radio. The final touch was the Indy 500 decal set included uninstalled with each limited-edition car.|$|E
25|$|The 1988 Chevrolet Nova added a sporty {{model to}} its lineup of subcompact {{front-wheel-drive}} cars. This new 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam {{got its name}} from a double-overhead-cam version of the Toyota-built 1.6-liter four-cylinder. Novas continued to share their basic design with the Corolla, and this engine had previously {{been used in the}} Toyota FX-16, a performance version of the Corolla. The twin-cam produced , 36 more than its single-cam sibling. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, as in the regular Novas, but the Twin-Cam offered a four-speed automatic as an option versus the three-speed offered on other models. The more potent engine elevated the 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam into junior sport-sedan territory, but the advancement didn't come cheaply. The base Nova listed at about $8,800, the Twin-Cam went for $11,395. That price included fuel injection, sport suspension, power steering, leather-covered steering wheel, tachometer, four-wheel disc brakes, and wider tires on aluminum wheels, but it was a stiff tariff, and few were ordered (approximately 3,300 Twin-Cam models were built). There were no color choices; all 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cams wore black metallic paint with a grey interior; and there was no hatchback version offered. Every 1988 Chevrolet Nova got rear shoulder belts, rear window <b>defogger,</b> and AM/FM stereo radio as standard equipment. This was the last model year for the Nova name at Chevrolet. Starting with 1989, Chevrolet pushed this car into its new Geo division and renamed it the Prizm. Geo was Chevy's effort {{to come up with an}} import-sounding label to attract buyers who were not inclined to shop American.|$|E
2500|$|Innovations in 1969 {{included}} a radio antenna {{embedded in the}} windshield, flush-mounted [...] "pop-open" [...] exterior door handles, side-impact beams inside the doors, and an optional built-in {{electrically heated rear window}} <b>defogger.</b>|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{that other}} Japanese car makers were {{allowing}} their dealers in Puerto Rico to transship excess inventory to Latin America and the continental United States, Soler {{asked if it}} could do the same. Mitsubishi refused, saying the vehicles were customized for the Puerto Rican market. They lacked heaters and <b>defoggers</b> {{that they would have}} needed on the mainland, and their engines could not run on the lower-grade leaded gasoline sold in many Latin American countries at that time. Further, Soler had no experience with maritime shipping and would not been able to meet its service obligations under warranty for transshipped cars and trucks. Mitsubishi also was concerned that transshipments to the continental U.S. would be seen as skirting the voluntary import restraints Japanese automakers had been practicing in the American market to mitigate the potential political backlash from their distressed American counterparts.|$|R
2500|$|In 1939, Nash added a {{thermostat}} to its system, {{making it}} the first thermostatic automobile climate control system. [...] The Weather Eye [...] "was the first truly good heating and ventilating system." [...] Additionally, <b>defoggers</b> (defrosters) were incorporated {{with the introduction of}} the 3900 series cars that year. [...] The Nash HVAC system was designed by Nils Eric Wahlberg and it continues to be the basis for use in modern automobiles. Nash included the first automatic temperature control for the airside of the heating system with the thermostat sensing the temperatures of the incoming outside air, the heater's discharge, and interior of the car; so that a change in any of these three air temperatures resulted an automatic adjustment to maintain passenger comfort. [...] Nash's Conditioned Air System heater was now marketed as the [...] "Weather Eye" [...] and consumer sales literature explained that the thermostat's [...] "mechanical eye" [...] watched the weather, hence the name.|$|R
5000|$|The DLX, {{the entry}} level, has only power steering, {{and no other}} power features. This variant lacks a tachometer, and is {{equipped}} only with a tape deck/radio receiver, 2 speakers {{in the front row}} only, vinyl interior and it has 14-inch steel wheels with center ornament. The GL is the [...] "higher-end entry-level" [...] with radio-cd setup, fabric interior, tachometer, and steel wheels with hubcaps. The remaining lines has all-power features, CD player/radio receiver and six-speaker setup (but upgradable to a DVD player setup), as well as rear-window <b>defoggers.</b> The VX and SR-J lines have leather seats and TV screens mounted on the dashboard and on the headrests. Only the SR-J, a special version of the SR (distinct wheels, unique livery), the GSX and the VX200 and VX200J had 2.0 liter gasoline engines and power fender-mounted radio antennas. Front-facing third-row seats were made as an option albeit without three-point seatbelts, a rarity for the vehicle type at that time in the Philippines.|$|R
2500|$|In 1993, {{a special}} edition LeSabre was sold to commemorate Buick's 90th anniversary.

2500|$|Citroën SM non-US market {{vehicles}} were equipped with heating of the headlamp cover glasses, this heat supplied by ducts carrying warm {{air from the}} radiator exhaust to {{the space between the}} headlamp lenses and the cover glasses. This provided demisting/defogging of the entire interior of the cover glasses, keeping the glass clear of mist/fog over the entire surface. The glasses have thin stripes on their surfaces that are heated by the headlight beams; however, the ducted warm air provides demisting when the headlamps are not turned on. The glasses' stripes on both D and SM cars appear similar to rear windshield glass electric <b>defogger</b> heating strips, but they are passive, not electrified ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1987 Chevrolet Nova {{saw only}} minor changes after its {{introduction}} {{two years earlier}} as a near-twin to the front-wheel-drive Toyota Corolla. A rear-window <b>defogger</b> {{was added to the}} list of standard equipment, while visual changes were limited to lighter silver highlights on the vertical grille bars and a change of turn signal lens colors from amber to clear/white front and red rear. CL models also got red reflex panels carrying the [...] taillights onto the trunk/hatch, body-colored bumpers, and new aluminum wheels. [...] The 1987 Chevrolet Nova continued in two body styles, a four-door sedan and five-door hatchback. The four-door proved by far the more popular – by about three to one. Nova's only engine was again a 74-horsepower 1.6-liter four designed by Toyota, mated to either a five-speed manual transmission or four-speed automatic. Though Corollas were priced slightly below competing Novas, Chevy's version of the car could often be bought for less because slow sales encouraged dealers to discount prices. [...] "Slow sales," [...] however, meant slow by Chevy standards, for the Nova sold about as well as the Corolla, and buyers would find that their discounted Nova in turn had a lower resale value than the equivalent Toyota, a pattern that would persist for GM-branded NUMMI cars. Aside from some minor interior and exterior trim differences, the cars were much the same, though Novas had a slightly softer suspension that favored ride over handling.|$|E
5000|$|Saab {{offered the}} 2005 model year 9-2X with Subaru's {{naturally}} aspirated 2.5-liter EJ253 engine in the [...] "Linear" [...] trim level ( [...] and 166 lbft Nm), with the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine {{shared with the}} Impreza WRX offered in the [...] "Aero" [...] badged model ( [...] and 217 lbft Nm). All-wheel drive came standard with an optional four-speed automatic transmission available instead of the five-speed manual for both trims. For 2005, Saab offered three options packages. The first of these, the premium package, added leather upholstery and for the US model, xenon HID headlamps. When ordered on with the [...] "Linear" [...] trim, the premium package also included the in-dash six-CD changer, front fog lamps, vinyl door cards, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. The cold weather package added heated front seats, side view mirror <b>defoggers,</b> and front/rear wiper defrosters where the wipers park. In Canada, cars equipped with the cold package also included an engine block heater. The final combination, the sport package, added a sunroof, and for the [...] "Aero" [...] only, included 17-inch wheels.|$|R
50|$|Hindustan has a {{joint venture}} with Mitsubishi that began in 1998. The plant is located in Thiruvallur, Tamil Nadu. The {{mid-size}} SUV Pajero Sport was manufactured until 2016. In India, Mitsubishi had ruled the automotive industry in 2000 with the Mitsubishi Lancer Slxd diesel 2.0l engine and slxi 1.5l petrol with upscal ammenities like stereo systems with cassette and cd changers, automatic controllable/foldable mirrors, leather seats, cup holders, <b>defoggers,</b> 5-speed manual transmissions, rally based body chassis as it was based on the legendary Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution which exceeded what Indian manufacturers were offering, but as time went by, their sales trended down due to poor engine/ transmission combinations for the Indian market. But since launching a redesigned Pajero sport in 2012, Mitsubishi has managed to retain their fame. This new SUV hosts a 2.5l DI-D Variable Geometrical Turbo Diesel engine mated to a 5-speed AT or MT. But 4WD was available only on the manual version, and 2WD is offered on the automatic version. Though the redesigned Pajero Sport was initially launched in 2010 for other worldwide markets, its design still retains a modern quality in the Indian market. The Pajero Sport received a cosmetic update in late 2014 with refreshed bumpers, front grille, tailgates and interior. The Mitsubishi Pajero Sport is a competitor to SUVs like the Toyota 4Runner, Ford Endeavour, etc.|$|R
50|$|Soler did {{excellent}} {{business in}} its first two years, selling {{more than twice the}} amount of vehicles set in its quota. As the market began to slow down in late 1981, the relationship between Soler and Mitsubishi began to break down. The dealer had trouble meeting sales targets under a higher quota, and Mitsubishi withheld shipments of new vehicles. Eventually 966 destined for Soler were stored near its factories in Japan. Soler began having trouble financing its purchases of new vehicles.Seeing that other Japanese car makers were allowing their dealers in Puerto Rico to transship excess inventory to Latin America and the continental United States, Soler asked if it could do the same.

These steel floor panels weighed {{less than the}} previous fiberglass floor and reduced interior noise levels. Horsepower rose to [...] for the base L-48 engine; [...] for the optional L-82. To further reduce cabin noise levels, cowl induction was dropped {{in favor of the}} air cleaner ducted over the radiator, picking up outside air {{from the front of the}} car, thus reducing wind turbulence at the base of the windshield. The hood was carried over, with its cowl vent grille and induction system opening becoming non-functional. The optional cast aluminum wheels were finally made available, which reduced the unsprung weight of the car by 32pounds. Nearly 15% of the cars were ordered with the new wheels at a cost of $299. A standard steel rim spare was used. This was the last year for optional white striped tires, as 86% of the cars were being delivered with the optional white lettered tires. A new rear nameplate for the rear bumper cover was introduced, eliminating the individual [...] "Corvette" [...] letters used since 1968. An unwelcome change was the [...] "Vega GT" [...] 4-spoke steering wheel, although its smaller diameter did provide extra room and eased entry/exit.
