5|$|Two major {{incidents}} {{occurred in}} 1972. The Fatah subgroup Black September hijacked Sabena Flight 572 {{en route to}} Vienna and forced it to land at the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel. The PFLP and the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> carried out a shooting rampage at the same airport, killing twenty-four civilians. Israel later claimed that the assassination of PFLP spokesman Ghassan Kanafani {{was a response to}} the PFLP's involvement in masterminding the latter attack. Two days later, various PLO factions retaliated by bombing a bus station, killing eleven civilians.|$|E

25|$|On 28 September 1977, a Japan Airlines Flight 472 {{en route}} from Mumbai to Tokyo was hijacked by 5 <b>Japanese</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> terrorists shortly after takeoff, and forced the plane to land at then Zia International Airport.

25|$|In 1975, Allmand {{signed a}} warrant {{requested}} by Michael Dare, the Director-General of Royal Canadian Mounted Police Security Service, to authorize them to intercept the mail of a Toronto couple.

25|$|Beginning in the 1960s and the 1970s, {{paramilitary}} {{extremist groups}} such as the Red Army Faction in Germany, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> and the Shining Path Maoist movement in Peru used red as their color. But in the 1980s, some European socialist and social democratic parties, such as the Labour Party in Britain and the Socialist Party in France, moved away from the symbolism of the far left, keeping the red color but changing their symbol to a less-threatening red rose.|$|E

There are reports that PLO forces were additionally joined by militiamen from Syria, Jordan, Libya, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and possibly even <b>Japanese</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> terrorists who were then undergoing training by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|In February 1966, Nathan was {{transferred}} to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He served as Assistant Secretary and rose to be Deputy Secretary before being appointed Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs in January 1971. On 6 August of the same year, Nathan moved to the Ministry of Defence where he was Director of the Security and Intelligence Division (SID). In the Laju incident on 31 January 1974, members of the terrorist <b>Japanese</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine bombed petroleum tanks on Pulau Bukom off the coast of Singapore; Nathan was among a group of government officers who volunteered to be held hostage by the JRA and flown to Kuwait to secure the release of civilian hostages and ensure the terrorists' safe passage. For his bravery, in August 1974 he was awarded the Pingat Jasa Gemilang (Meritorious Service Medal).|$|E
25|$|Rizk {{was born}} in Beirut in a Christian household, to a Lebanese father and Hungarian mother. Her mother was married to Rossi, an Italian prior to marrying Rizk's father. That union {{produced}} a daughter (Rizk's half-sister), fashion designer Felicina Rossi. She was crowned in the Miss Universe pageant in 1971 in Miami Beach, Florida, United States. She {{was the first woman}} from the Middle East and the fourth woman from Asia to win the title. In the pageant, she made a memorable fashion statement by wearing a very revealing top and hotpants. The 1972 Miss Universe pageant was held in Cerromar Beach Hotel in Dorado, Puerto Rico. On 30 May 1972, a month before the pageant telecast, 17 Christian pilgrims from Puerto Rico along with other victims, were killed during an attack at the Lod Airport in Israel (now Ben Gurion International Airport). The massacre was perpetrated by three members of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). Due to the possible retaliation from the massacre, Rizk was not allowed to attend the Miss Universe Pageant to crown her successor in Puerto Rico.|$|E

25|$|While Ben Gurion Airport {{has been}} a target of Palestinian attacks, the {{adoption}} of strict security precautions has ensured that no aircraft departing from Ben Gurion airport has ever been hijacked. On the other hand, airliners hijacked from other countries have landed at Ben Gurion, contributing to two major incidents in the airport's history. In the first, on 8 May 1972, four Palestinian Black September terrorists hijacked a Sabena flight en route from Vienna and forced it to land at Ben Gurion airport. Sayeret Matkal commandos led by Ehud Barak stormed the plane, killing two of the hijackers and capturing the other two. One passenger was killed. Later that month, on 30 May 1972, in an attack known as the Lod Airport Massacre, 24 {{people were killed and}} 80 injured when three members of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> sprayed machine gun fire into the passenger arrival area. The victims included Aharon Katzir, a prominent protein biophysicist and brother of Israel's 4th president. Those injured included Efraim Katzir and a group of twenty Puerto Rican tourists who had just arrived in Israel. The only terrorist who survived was Kozo Okamoto, who received a life sentence but was set free in a prisoner exchange with the PFLP-GC.|$|E

[...] Bandō later {{is believed to have}} assisted in the hijacking of Japan Airlines Flight 472 from Paris to Tokyo in 1977, forcing the jet to land in Dhaka. [...] Bandō remains at large and reportedly spent time between 1997 and 2007 in Russia, China, the Philippines, and Japan.|$|E
500|$|Gaddafi financially {{supported}} other {{militant groups}} across the world, including the Black Panther Party, the Nation of Islam, the Tupamaros, the 19th of April Movement and the Sandinista National Liberation Front in Nicaragua, the ANC among other liberation {{movements in the}} fight against Apartheid in South Africa, the Provisional Irish Republican Army, ETA, Action directe, the Red Brigades, and the Red Army Faction in Europe, and the Armenian Secret Army, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Army,</b> the Free Aceh Movement, and the Moro National Liberation Front in the Philippines. Gaddafi was indiscriminate in the causes which he funded, sometimes switching from supporting one side in a conflict to the other, as in the Eritrean War of Independence. Throughout the 1970s these groups received financial support from Libya, which came {{to be seen as a}} leader in the Third World's struggle against colonialism and neocolonialism. Though many of these groups were labelled [...] "terrorists" [...] by critics of their activities, Gaddafi rejected this characterization, instead he considered them to be revolutionaries who were engaged in liberation struggles.|$|E

2500|$|In late September 1977, a {{group of}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> terrorists hijacked an {{aeroplane}} and forced it to land in Dhaka. On 30 September, while {{the attention of the}} government was riveted on this event, a mutiny broke out in Bogra. Although the mutiny was quickly quelled on the night of 2 October, a second mutiny started in Dhaka, led by disgruntled airmen of Bangladesh Air Force (BAF). The mutineers unsuccessfully attacked Zia's residence, captured Dhaka Radio for a short time and killed a good number of air force officers and airmen at Tejgaon International Airport, where they were gathered for negotiations with the hijackers. Wing Commander M. Hamidullah Khan BP (Sector Commander Bangladesh Defense Forces Sector 11), then BAF Ground Defense Commander, quickly put down the rebellion within the Air Force, but the government was severely shaken. Chief of Air Staff AVM AG Mahmud reappointed Wing Commander Hamidullah as Provost Marshal of BAF. Government intelligence had failed and Zia promptly dismissed the DGFI chief, AVM Aminul Islam Khan BAF, of 9th GD(P) formerly of PAF, and also the DG-NSI. In the aftermath at least 200 soldiers involved in the coup attempt were executed following a secret trial, prompting some critics to call Zia [...] "ruthless".|$|E
