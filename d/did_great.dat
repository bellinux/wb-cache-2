5|$|As Austria {{was short}} of {{experienced}} military commanders, Maria Theresa released Marshall Neipperg, {{who had been}} imprisoned by her father for his poor performance in the Turkish War. Neipperg took command of the Austrian troops in March. The Austrians suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Mollwitz in April 1741. France drew up a plan to partition Austria between Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Spain. Marshall Belle-Isle joined Frederick at Olmütz. Vienna was in a panic, as none of Maria Theresa's advisors expected France to betray them. Francis Stephen urged Maria Theresa to reach a rapprochement with Prussia, as <b>did</b> <b>Great</b> Britain. Maria Theresa reluctantly agreed to negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{had wanted}} to {{organize}} the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this. Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator Salmon P. Chase and Massachusetts' Charles Sumner, who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, {{and the influence of}} slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that <b>did</b> <b>great</b> damage to Pierce's presidency.|$|E

Evelyn inherited the estate and the family seat Wotton House {{on the death of}} his brother in 1699. Sayes Court was made available for rent. Its most notable tenant was Russian Tsar Peter the Great, who lived there for three months in 1698 (and <b>did</b> <b>great</b> damage to both house and grounds).

25|$|The ADF was not {{sufficiently}} prepared for integrating women into all units. Integration was hindered by entrenched discriminatory attitudes, {{sexual harassment and}} a perception that less demanding standards were applied to women. This led {{to a number of}} scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment on board , and the RAN's mishandling of these complaints. These scandals <b>did</b> <b>great</b> harm to the ADF's reputation at the time when it most needed servicewomen. The Defence Equality Organisation was established in 1997 in response to these problems, and it developed frameworks to facilitate the acceptance of women throughout the ADF.|$|E

25|$|During much of {{the twentieth}} century, Australian governments had removed many {{aboriginal}} children from their families.

Since the publication in 1997 of a federal government report, Bringing Them Home all state governments have followed {{the recommendation of the}} report in issuing formal apologies for their past practices to the Aboriginal people, as have many local governments. The Howard government refused to make such an apology on behalf of the federal government, despite pleas from the Aboriginal people and from many sections of the wider community, saying that it implied intergenerational guilt on modern non-indigenous Australia. However, the new government under Kevin Rudd led a formal bi-partisan apology on 13 February 2008.|$|E
25|$|Alex Woolf {{noted that}} the {{previous}} year, 993, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle related that Scandinavians (apparently led by Óláfr Tryggvason) had invaded Northumbria and sacked Bamburgh, whereupon the southern English raised an army:(s.a. 993) In this year Bamburgh was sacked and much booty was captured there, and after that the army came {{to the mouth of}} the Humber and <b>did</b> <b>great</b> damage there, both in Lindsey and in Northumbria. Then a very large English army was collected, and when they should have joined battle, the leaders Fræna, Godwine and Frythegyst, first started the flight. Woolf thought that both Northman and Waltheof were in the south for this reason. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported that, in 994, the year of this charter and the year following the attack on Northumbria, Óláfr Tryggvason and Sveinn Forkbeard attacked London and southern England.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{threat from}} Polish forces generated calls for attacks on Warsaw. This {{had been planned}} for the first day, codenamed Wasserkante, or Operation Seaside. Just after midnight on 12/13 September, the Luftwaffe chief of staff Hans Jeschonnek ordered Löhr to prepare to attack ghettos in northern Warsaw, in retaliation for unspecified war crimes against German soldiers in recent battles. Richthofen's airmen flew 183 to 197 sorties, dropping Equal quantities of high explosives and incendiaries. Some bombs fell close to German forces conducting the Siege of Warsaw, and smoke {{made it impossible to}} assess damage. Richthofen confronted Hermann Göring over the need for a united air command for the Warsaw campaign, and hinted he was the man for the job. He did not get his way until 21 September. Weather delayed the attack, which began on 22 September. Richthofen did not get the aircraft he wanted for the operation, in particular the Heinkel He 111, and instead was handed old Junkers Ju 52 transports, which delivered bombs by airmen throwing them out of the doors. His Ju 87s were also banned from using bomb loads greater than 50kg. On 22 September, Richthofen's command flew 620 sorties. German air units dropped 560 tonnes of high explosive and 72 tonnes of incendiaries. The bombing <b>did</b> <b>great</b> damage, causing 40,000 casualties and destroying one in ten of the buildings in the city, while only two Ju 87s and one Ju 52 were lost.|$|E

500|$|The {{group of}} composers who now congregated with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov {{became known as}} the Belyayev circle, named after their {{financial}} benefactor. These composers were nationalistic in their musical outlook, as The Five before them had been. Like The Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike The Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition—which Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in his years at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Compared to the [...] "revolutionary" [...] composers in Balakirev's circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be [...] "progressive... attaching as it <b>did</b> <b>great</b> importance to technical perfection, but... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily..." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} prevent this the Allied Air Forces—the RAF and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF)—were ordered to conduct {{operations}} against Axis air power by day and night in {{order to prevent}} their resupply or withdrawal. Owing to bad weather and the need to gather intelligence, the operation, codenamed [...] "Flax", did not begin until 5 April. Although the Axis put up determined resistance and large scale air battles took place, the Allied Air Forces succeeded in destroying the aerial link between Axis-held Sicily and Italy. During the course of the interdiction operation, an air battle known as the 18 April Palmsonntag Massaker ("Palm Sunday Massacre") took place, in which the German Junkers Ju 52 transport fleets suffered heavy losses over Cape Bon, while evacuating Heer (German Army) forces escaping from the Allied ground offensive Operation Vulcan. The air operation continued until 27 April. The operation <b>did</b> <b>great</b> harm to Axis logistical support.

500|$|Ælfhelm's {{apparent}} promotion in 994 {{is thought}} by some historians, for instance Richard Fletcher, {{to have been}} due to the Scandinavian attack on Northumbria in 993. Under the year 993, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle relates that Vikings had invaded Northumbria and sacked Bamburgh, whereupon the southern English raised an army:Bamburgh was sacked and much booty was captured there, and after that the army came to the mouth of the Humber and <b>did</b> <b>great</b> damage there, both in the Kingdom of Lindsey and in Northumbria. Then a very large English army was collected, and when they should have joined battle, the leaders Fræna, Godwine and Frythegyst, first started the flight. Fletcher speculated that Ælfhelm's predecessor Thored, who disappeared from the records at this time, was removed from office and replaced by Ælfhelm by King Æthelred II {{as a result of his}} failure against the Scandinavians. Another historian, William Kapelle, believed Thored was removed because of his Scandinavian descent, an argument based on the Worcester Chronicles claim, added to the text borrowed from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, that Fræna, Godwine and Frythegyst fled because [...] "they were Danish on their father's side".|$|E
