5000|$|AOL {{is one of}} {{the largest}} online service {{providers}} in the United States who had 10 million members at the time when this lawsuit was filed. Spammers kept targeting AOL members because they tended to be newer to the internet and more receptive to <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail.</b> Besides, their e-mail addresses were readily available by either plucking them off the service themselves, or buying one of the many lists of AOL members being sold. <b>Junk</b> <b>e-mail</b> senders found that it cost them nearly nothing to make money through spamming. All they needed was a handful of responses that the AOL members might make. As a result, AOL members who spent some time in AOL's chat rooms quickly found their e-mail boxes flooded with <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail</b> advertising, everything from get-rich-quick schemes to links to pornographic pages.|$|E

5000|$|The {{court also}} found that the {{defendant}} diluted AOL's trademark and service mark in violation of Lanham Act. The court recognized that AOL owned the famous [...] "AOL" [...] mark and defendants' conducts had tarnished AOL's mark because AOL members made negative associations between AOL and defendants' <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail</b> practices.|$|E
50|$|Ralsky {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prolific}} sources of <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail</b> worldwide. Unlike most spammers, he has provided interviews to various newspapers, although he claimed to be a commercial e-mailer rather than a spammer. He claimed that his was a legitimate business which complied with all laws, but was convicted of spamming and other fraudulent activities in June 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Besides, many of defendant's <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail</b> {{contained}} the letters [...] "aol.com" [...] in their headers, thereby creating a false designation. AOL subscribers were deceived {{into believing that}} AOL sponsored or approved of defendant’s bulk e-mailing activities. This caused damage to AOL. Therefore, {{the court ruled that}} defendants were in violation of the Lanham Act for false designation of origin.|$|E
5000|$|To avoid {{anti-spam}} filters, {{based on}} a list of “dirty words”, the <b>junk</b> <b>e-mails</b> dealing with medicines could simply just contain an image. Since the filters are also designed to protect from certain types of images, the spammers have learnt how to create pictures which do not come out as jpeg files or similar thus being able to elude filters once again.|$|R

50|$|Many {{computer}} worms, such as Sobig and Mydoom, {{install a}} backdoor on the affected computer (generally a PC on broadband running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Outlook). Such backdoors {{appear to be}} installed so that spammers can send <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail</b> from the infected machines. Others, such as the Sony/BMG rootkit, placed secretly on millions of music CDs through late 2005, are intended as DRM measures—and, in that case, as data-gathering agents, since both surreptitious programs they installed routinely contacted central servers.|$|E
40|$|The task of {{junk mail}} {{filtering}} is {{to rule out}} unsolicited bulk <b>e-mail</b> (<b>junk)</b> automatically from a user's mail stream.

50|$|Boe {{was also}} in the {{forefront}} of the legal battle against <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail.</b> Under his direction, AOL began filing a series of civil lawsuits, developing novel theories that would lead to the collection {{of millions of dollars in}} damages from spammers. Boe has testified before Congress on the issue and helped craft the tough Virginia Anti-Spam law, as well as the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. He favored strategies that imposed unacceptable costs on spammers, including the seizure of their assets. In 2003, Boe gave an AOL subscriber the keys to a Porsche Boxster that had been seized by AOL from a spammer.|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{electronic}} mail system in the 1970 s, a new opportunity for direct marketing using unsolicited electronic mail became apparent. In 1978, Gary Thuerk compiled a list of those on the Arpanet and then sent out a huge mailing publicising Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC—now Compaq) systems. The reaction from the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), who ran Arpanet, was very negative, and it was this negative reaction that ensured that {{it was a long time}} before unsolicited e-mail was used again (Templeton, 2003). As long as the U. S. government controlled a major part of the backbone, most forms of commercial activity were forbidden (Hayes, 2003). However, in 1993, the Internet Network Information Center was privatized, and with no central government controls, spam, as it is now called, came into wider use. The term spam was taken from the Monty Python Flying Circus (a UK comedy group) and their comedy skit that featured the ironic spam song sung in praise of spam (luncheon meat) —“spam, spam, spam, lovely spam”—and it came to mean mail that was unsolicited. Conversely, the term ham came to mean e-mail that was wanted. Brad Templeton, a UseNet pioneer and chair of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, has traced the first usage of the term spam back to MUDs (Multi User Dungeons), or real-time multi-person shared environment, and the MUD community. These groups introduced the term spam to the early chat rooms (Internet Relay Chats). The first major UseNet (the world’s largest online conferencing system) spam sent in January 1994 and was a religious posting: “Global alert for all: Jesus is coming soon. ” The term spam was more broadly popularised in April 1994, when two lawyers, Canter and Siegel from Arizona, posted a message that advertized their information and legal services for immigrants applying for the U. S. Green Card scheme. The message was posted to every newsgroup on UseNet, and after this incident, the term spam became synonymous with <b>junk</b> or unsolicited <b>e-mail.</b> Spam spread quickly among the UseNet groups who were easy targets for spammers simply because the e-mail addresses of members were widely available (Templeton, 2003) ...|$|R
5000|$|Jeremy Jaynes (born 1974) was a {{prolific}} e-mail spammer, broadcasting <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail</b> {{from his home}} in North Carolina, United States.

His conviction was later overturned by the Virginia Supreme Court ruling unanimously the law Jaynes was prosecuted under violated the First Amendment. On March 30, 2009, the Supreme Court of the United States refused the Virginia Attorney General's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Supreme Court of Virginia overturning the anti-spam statute.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} genetic programming as a novel approach {{to the problem of}} filtering <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail.</b> We benchmark our results against the common standard: the Nave Bayes classifier. While the genetically programmed classifier demonstrated a precision comparable to that of Nave Bayes, it was slightly outperformed in recall. Since both learning methods gave similar results, it is recommended that a larger study be undertaken to ascertain whether these differences are indeed statistically significant. Further it is recommended that the performance of these classifiers be tested in a richer feature space more typical of real-world classifiers. Although the genetically programming classifier greatly outperformed the Nave Bayes classifier in speed, it is concluded that a more efficient implementation of Nave Bayes needs to be used in order to provide a fair comparison. We show that when left unabated, e-mail signatures also known as taglines reduce the value of several important features in <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail</b> detectio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of the Lucent Personalized Web Assistant (LPWA). LPWA is a software system that enables a user to browse the Web in a personalized, simple, private, and secure fashion and to filter <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail</b> (spam). LPWA generates secure, consistent and pseudonymous aliases (personae) for Web users. Each alias consists of an alias username, an alias password and an alias e-mail address. The alias e-mail addresses allow web-sites to send messages to users and enable effective filtering of <b>junk</b> <b>e-mail</b> (spam). LPWA forwards mail addressed to the alias e-mail address to the actual user. LPWA allows users to filter incoming messages based on the recipient address (the alias e-mail), which is an effective method for detecting and blocking spam. A trial version of LPWA became available to the public at [URL] in June, 1997. It has so far (as of May, 1998) attracted more than 21000 users. 1 Introduction In recent years the World-Wide Web (WWW) ha [...] ...|$|E

Our contributions are threefold: First, we identify the components {{of a system that}} realizes the concept of extended e-mail addresses and investigate the functionality of these components in a manner which is backwards compatible to current e-mail tools. Secondly, we specify an adversarial model, and give the necessary properties of extended e-mail addresses and of the procedure to obtain them {{in the presence of the}} adversary. Finally, we design cryptographic functions that enable realizing extended e-mail addresses which satisfy these properties...|$|E
40|$|In {{addressing}} the growing problem of <b>junk</b> <b>E-mail</b> on the Internet, we examine methods for the automated construction of filters to eliminate such unwanted messages from a user's mail stream. By casting {{this problem in}} a decision theoretic framework, {{we are able to}} make use of probabilistic learning methods in conjunction with a notion of differential misclassification cost to produce filters which are especially appropriate for the nuances of this task. While this may appear, at first, to be a straight-forward text classification problem, we show that by considering domain-specific features of this problem in addition to the raw text of E-mail messages, we can produce much more accurate filters. Finally, we show the efficacy of such filters in a real world usage scenario, arguing that this technology is mature enough for deployment.
