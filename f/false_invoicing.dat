However on 9 October 2014, {{at the end of}} the proceedings of first instance, he was fully acquitted ("the fact did not occur") of international corruption and bribery allegations in the helicopter case, and was sentenced to two years in prison (sentence has been suspended) for <b>false</b> <b>invoicing.</b> Orsi's lawyer, Giuseppe Amodio, has appealed against this punishment and affirmed that “with regard to the two-year sentence for <b>false</b> <b>invoicing,</b> a part of those invoices is linked to non-existent transactions. We are confident that this judgment will be reversed on appeal.” [...] However, in April 2016 an Italian appeals court sentenced Giuseppe Orsi to four and a half years in prison for corruption and falsifying invoices, overturning the previous lower court ruling. Orsi remains free pending an appeal to Italy's Supreme Court.|$|E

5000|$|Commissioner Heydon {{found that}} {{corruption}} was widespread and deepseated, and recommended {{a new national}} regulator with the same powers as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission be established to combat corruption in the trade union movement.

50|$|Silvio Berlusconi, billionaire, media mogul, {{and prime}} {{minister}} of Italy for three periods (1994-5, 2001-6, and 2008-11), was frequently accused of corruption.

In 2011, the U.S. State Department named Berlusconi as participating in the “commercial sexual exploitation of a Moroccan child.” Convicted of tax fraud in 2012, he was removed from the Italian Senate after the Supreme Court confirmed the verdict the next year, but not imprisoned. In June 2013 he was found guilty of paying a teenage girl for sex, and of abusing his political power, but the verdict was overturned in 2014.|$|E

In 2011, during a struggle {{over control of the}} firm between chairman Pier Francesco Guarguaglini and Giuseppi Orsi, who succeeded him in November of that year, Italian authorities began investigating allegations of bribery in connection with the contract, and concluded that in order to process the bribes, massive slush funds had been established by means of a complex system of <b>false</b> <b>invoicing,</b> several sham firms had been set up in Delaware and other tax havens, and secret bank accounts had been opened in Switzerland. Borogni was one of the Finmeccanica officials who were targets of the investigation.|$|E

Both men were accused of “paying bribes and siphoning money off to foreign bank accounts.” The arrest had nothing to do with the helicopter scandal. Two entrepreneurs were also arrested at the same time in connection with the probe. Borgogni was placed under house arrest. Rome businessmen Vincenzo Angeloni and Luigi Malavisi had already been arrested for playing a part in the bribery, while Guarguaglini remained under investigation. According to The Local, “Borgogni and the others were believed to have created a system of <b>false</b> <b>invoicing</b> between Selex and other companies, and in order to cover this up they had created false businesses in Delaware and deposited money in Switzerland.” In addition to arresting Borgogni and his alleged accomplices, police “seized 28 bank accounts and two safe-deposit boxes.” According to Defense News, Italian magistrates suspected that money in large slush funds related to the Sistri matter had ended up “in the coffers of Italian political parties.” ...|$|E
5000|$|PRC {{authorities}} {{have recently been}} pursuing measures to reduce the official number of crimes punishable by death, and limit how often {{the death penalty is}} officially utilized. Since 2005, China has experienced significant reforms on the death penalty system. In 2011, China abolished the death penalty for 13 crimes in Amendment VIII to the Criminal Law of PRC, which was the most important amendment passed since 1997. The National People's Congress Standing Committee adopted an amendment {{to reduce the number of}} capital crimes from 68 to 55.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine the impact of Switzerland's money laundering law on the movement of money through <b>false</b> <b>invoicing</b> in international trade. This study evaluates every reported import and export transaction between the USA and Switzerland during the period 1995 - 2000. The study indicates that there were significant changes in the degree of abnormal international trade pricing subsequent to the enactment of Switzerland's antimoney laundering law. The study supports the view that individuals and companies will find substitute techniques and channels to launder money when central banking authorities enact legislation that only focuses on financial institutions. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries use preshipment inspection (PSI) firms {{to counter the}} adverse effects on their foreign trade of certain pricing and business practices. These firms may also perform some national customs functions, but their key responsibility is normally to verify that imports (and sometimes exports) meet quality and quantity standards and that prices are within established norms. Developing countries make substantial payments for PSI - charges appear to average about 1 percent {{of the value of}} the goods inspected - but have undertaken no comprehensive cost-benefit studies of PSI. Using data from Madagascar's experience, the author analyzes the impact of PSI on Madagascar's relative import prices. The results suggest that Madagascar paid considerably higher prices than other developing and industrial countries both before and after PSI was adopted. In other words, preshipment inspection failed to reduce Madagascar's import prices to the level of those paid by other importers. Extreme prices occur for all types of goods imported by Madagascar but are clustered in chemicals and basic manufactures. Evidence suggests that collaborative <b>false</b> <b>invoicing</b> by Madagascar importers and industrial country exports is one reason for the excessive prices both before and after adoption of PSI.
