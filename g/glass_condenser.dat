The dynamics of pressure fluctuations occurring in flow boiling in a minichannel with diameter of 1 mm, which consists of the heated section and <b>glass</b> <b>condenser</b> has been experimentally investigated and analysed. The recurrence plot and PCA of recurrence plot quantities have been applied. High speed digital video camera {{has been used to}} identify two-phase flow patterns in the <b>glass</b> <b>condenser.</b> The low frequency pressure fluctuations with relatively high amplitude which are caused by presence of compressible volume in the system have been observed. These fluctuations are accompanied by high frequency pressure oscillations. It has been found that during those fluctuations the dominant frequency of pressure fluctuations changes chaotically in time. Such pressure oscillations are accompanied by the flow patterns changes in the condenser. In the paper the new method of two-phase flow identification has been presented. The method is based on the analysis of dynamics of signal recorded from the pressure sensor. It has been shown that in the plots of two first components the points are grouped in the six separated clusters, which correspond to different flow patterns. dc 201...|$|E

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{analysis of}} a solar still with an inverted V-shaped <b>glass</b> <b>condenser</b> is presented. Results {{are based on a}} new mathematical model obtained from a lumped-parameter analysis of the still, with an approach that makes each glass plate of the condensing system sensitive to orientation and depicts its thermal differences. Numerical computations are made to evaluate productivity and temperature differences between the condensing plates as a function of condenser orientation, extinction coefficient and thickness. From this study it was found a significant influence of incident solar radiation on the thermal performance of each condensing plate. Large extinction coefficients and thick glass plates increase absorption losses that result in an appreciable temperature difference. An extinction coefficient of 40 m- 1 produces a temperature difference of 2. 5 °C between both condensers. A glass thickness of 10 mm may increase this temperature difference up to 3. 5 °C. With respect to the production, due to the still orientation, a difference of 8. 7 % was found for the condensing plates facing an east-west direction. The proposed model is able to reproduce the temperature and distillate production differences that arise between both condensers in good agreement with experimental data. The overall performance of the still, studied with this new approach, was also in accordance with the widely used traditional models for solar distillation. In addition, the condensing plates parameters of the still can be used to force a differential heating such that for the whole day the temperature of one condensing plate is always higher.

40|$|Wheeze is {{a common}} symptom in {{preschool}} children. The role of bacteria, regulatory T (T(reg)) cells and their association with airway inflammation in preschool wheeze is largely unknown. We evaluated inflammatory markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), bacterial colonization and circulating T(reg) cells in preschool children with and without recurrent wheeze. We recruited 252 children (aged two to four years) with (N = 202) and without (N = 50) recurrent wheeze. EBC was collected using an efficient closed <b>glass</b> <b>condenser.</b> Inflammatory markers in EBC (Interleukin(IL) - 2, IL- 4, IL- 8, IL- 10, IL- 13) were assessed using multiplex immunoassay. Nasal and throat swabs were analysed for presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus (para) influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. Proportions of T(reg) cells (CD 4 (+) CD 25 (high) CD 127 (-)) were quantified by flow cytometry. Recurrent wheezing children had elevated EBC levels of IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 10 and IL- 13 compared to non-wheezers (odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) : 1. 67 (1. 23 - 2. 27) : 1. 58 (1. 15 - 2. 18) : 1. 47 (1. 14 - 1. 90) : 1. 55 (1. 16 - 2. 06), p < 0. 05, respectively). Bacteria were frequently present in children with and without wheeze, with no difference in prevalence (16 - 52 % versus 16 - 50 %, respectively). Moreover, the proportion of T(reg) cells did not differ between both groups. Wheezing children with bacterial colonization did not significantly differ in exhaled levels of inflammatory markers or proportion of T(reg) cells compared to wheezing children without colonization. The analysis of EBC might serve as a helpful non-invasive tool to early assess airway inflammation in wheezing children. The various elevated exhaled inflammatory markers indicate increased airway inflammation in wheezing preschool children. In the presence of wheeze, we found no evidence for bacterial induced airway inflammation...|$|E

The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate: (i) the ability of fractional exhaled nitric oxide and inflammatory markers (IM) [exhaled breath condensate (EBC) acidity, nitrite, nitrate, hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)), 8 -isoprostane, Th 1 /Th 2 cytokines] to indicate (exacerbations of) CF; and (ii) the ability of these non-invasive IM to indicate CF disease severity. In 98 children (48 CF/ 50 controls), exhaled nitric oxide was measured using the NIOX, and condensate was collected using a <b>glass</b> <b>condenser.</b> In CF interferon (IFN-gamma) and nitrite concentrations were significantly higher, whereas exhaled nitric oxide levels were significantly lower compared with controls (3. 3 +/- 0. 3 pg/ml, 2. 2 +/- 0. 2 microM, 10. 0 +/- 1. 2 p. p. b. vs. 2. 6 +/- 0. 2 pg/ml, 1. 4 +/- 0. 1 microM, 15. 4 +/- 1. 4 p. p. b. respectively). Using multivariate logistic regression models, the presence of CF was best indicated by 8 -isoprostane, nitrite and IFN-gamma [sensitivity 78 %, specificity 83 %; area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0. 906, p < 0. 001]. An exacerbation of CF was best indicated by 8 -isoprostane and nitrite (sensitivity 40 %, specificity 97 %, AUC curve 0. 838, p = 0. 009). Most indicative biomarkers of CF severity were exhaled nitric oxide, and condensate acidity (sensitivity 96 %, specificity 67 %; AUC curve 0. 751, p = 0. 008). In this cross-sectional study, the combination of different exhaled IM could indicate (exacerbations of) CF, and severity of the disease in children. Longitudinal data are necessary to further confirm the role of these markers for the management of CF in children...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{extensive}} {{amount of data}} suggesting the hazards of these compounds, 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Priority Pollutant List. Emissions of these PAHs in the flue gas from the combustion of four coals were measured during four 1000 h combustion runs using the 0. 1 MW heat-input (MWth) bench-scale fluidized bed combustor (FBC). An on-line sampling system was designed for the 16 PAHs, which consisted of a <b>glass</b> wool filter, <b>condenser,</b> <b>glass</b> fiber filter, Teflon filter, and a Tenax trap. The filters and Tenax were extracted by methylene chloride and hexane, respectively, followed by GC/MS analysis using the selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode. In this project, the effects of operating parameters, limestone addition, chlorine content in the coal, and Ca/S molar ratio on the emissions of PAHs were studied. The {{results indicated that the}} emissions of PAHs in an FBC system are primarily dependent on the combustion temperature and excess air ratio. The injection of secondary air with high velocity in the freeboard effectively reduces PAH emissions. The addition of extra limestone can promote the formation of PAHs in the FBC system. Chlorine in the coal can possibly lead to large benzene ring PAH formation during combustion. The total PAH emission increases with an increase in the sulfur content of coal. Incomplete combustion results in PAHs with four or more benzene rings. High efficiency combustion results in PAHs with two or three benzene rings. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|To {{investigate}} transient binary nucleation, both qualitatively and quantitatively, we numerically {{solved the}} birth-death equations for vapor-to-liquid phase transitions. We {{found that in}} its early transient stages, binary nucleation rarely, if ever, occurs via the saddle point. Instead most binary systems pass through a temporary stage in which the region of maximum flux extends over a ridge on the free energy surface before reaching the state of saddle point nucleation. Both the number of particles formed and their composition may be affected, and this could be very important for nucleation in <b>glasses</b> and other <b>condensed</b> mixtures for which timescales are very long. In order to plan experiments, accurate estimates of the time lag are important. We therefore directly calculated the time lag for the saddle point flux using our numerical results and compared it with the available analytical predictions. Although the analytical results over-estimate the time lag by factors of 2 - 6, the numerical results followed the predicted analytical trends quite closely under most conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{population}} of Algeria {{is expected to}} double in the next thirty years, by then it will clearly face serious water shortages. The demand in water for drinking, agriculture and industry largely exceeds the amount that fresh sources can meet, especially in the Saharan regions where rainfall is the lowest, with years of total drought. To overcome this serious water scarcity, solar desalination could be an effective solution. Solar distillation {{is one of the}} simplest techniques used in water desalination. This investigation presents an experimental study using a double slope solar still. This choice is justified firstly by the abundance and low price of solar energy, and by the simplicity of installation and easy maintenance of these devices. The main aim of the present work has been to enhance the yield of the still by improving the performance of its condenser. This was achieved by cooling its outer surface. Small-scale solar powered distillation pilot units have been constructed and operated. The tests were conducted in the town of Ouargla, south of Algeria. Two series of experiments were performed. In the first series, the condenser was cooled by flowing water on the north glass cover throughout the run. This enhanced the still productivity by 11. 82 %. The second series consisted of lowering the <b>glass</b> temperature (<b>condenser),</b> and this was realised by an intermittent shading (12 h. 00 - 14 h. 00) of the north glass cover. The shade was assured by placing a rectangular screen at 90 cm above {{the north side of the}} still. This procedure improved the yield by just 2. 94 %...|$|R
40|$|In this study, for {{a series}} phosphate-based glasses ((P 2 O 5) (0. 45) (CaO) (0. 3) (Na 2 O) (0. 25 -x) (TiO 2) (x) 0 <= x <= 0. 15), their degradation, ion release, surface and thermal {{properties}} have been determined. The results show that adding TiO 2 {{was associated with a}} significant increase in density and glass transition temperature, but a decrease in degradation rate and ion release. P- 31 solid-state magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) showed that the local structure of the glasses changes with increasing TiO 2 content. As TiO 2 is incorporated into the glass, the phosphate connectivity increases as Q(1) units transform to Q(2), confirming that an increase in the nominal TiO 2 content correlates unequivocally with an increase in glass stability. As reported for titania-silica gets, Ti 4 + is clearly adopting a network former role in these phosphate-based glasses. Na- 23 MAS-NMR results corroborate this phenomenon with a marked upfield trend of the Na- 23 isotropic chemical shift suggesting that the local Na-O bond distances are decreasing within a more <b>condensed</b> <b>glass</b> network upon increased incorporation of TiO 2.

The aim is to find out which material causes the lowest ozone decomposition and that is why it is the most suitable material for pipelines used for ozone transportation from a place of production to a place of application. In the theoretical part important properties of ozone, possibilities of its production, methods of ozone determination and relation of ozone to different solid surfaces were described. In the experimental part there was investigated how much ozone is decomposed by five commonly available metal materials (stainless steel, yellow brass, copper, aluminium and iron). Measurements were realized in the <b>glass</b> tube (Liebig <b>condenser).</b> Hollow pipes made of particular material were inserted into this tube. Ozone passed through this glass tube and ozone concentration was determined on its output by two methods: the iodometric titration and spectrophotometry. Several series were measured and compared by different set-up conditions like reaction time, experimental parameters (flow rate of air, input power of the ozone generator) and two types of gas – technical and synthetic air (because moisture contained in technical air can cause ozone decomposition) were used. The most suitable materials – stainless steel and aluminium were determined according to gained results...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the thermal {{behavior}} of metakaolin-based geopolymer cements using sodium waterglass (NWG) from rice husk ash and waste glass as alternative alkaline activators. Metakaolin-based geopolymer cements were obtained by adding freshly prepared NWG and metakaolin. The geopolymer cements obtained using sodium waterglass from rice husk ash and the one obtained with sodium waterglass from the waste glass were treated {{at room temperature for}} 28  days and then heated at 200, 400, 600 and 800  °C. The results show that the metakaolin-based geopolymer cements lose their compressive strength from room temperature to 400  °C. At 600  °C, the compressive strength of geopolymer cements increases relative up to 200 and 400  °C. At 800  °C, the reduction of compressive strength of geopolymer cements is assigned to the total evaporation of the rest of structural water. However, it is higher than that measured at ambient temperature for geopolymer cement obtained using the sodium waterglass from waste glass but lower for the sample obtained with sodium waterglass from rice husk ash. The total mass loss of geopolymer cements obtained with sodium waterglass from rice husk ash and one obtained with sodium waterglass from waste glass are about 12. 57 and 15. 04  %, respectively. This suggests that geopolymer cement obtained using sodium waterglass from waste <b>glass</b> are more <b>condensed</b> geopolymer structure indicating that it could a very suitable material for fire resistant application. The results indicate that NWG from rice husk ash and waste glass could be served as suitable alternative activators for producing metakaolin-based geopolymer cements with high-temperature performance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis covers {{some of the}} {{development}} of a novel vapour growth system for the production of large, high quality crystals of cadmium telluride, focusing in particular on ampoule development, flow calibration, and mass transport studies. The Multi Tube Physical Vapour Transport system is an evolution of the Markov design, the unique feature being a U-Tube ampoule configuration which allows direct viewing of the crystal surface, and in-situ, non invasive vapour pressure monitoring. The system incorporates a capillary flow restrictor between source material and the growing crystal which allows the mass transport rate to be controlled almost independently of crystal temperature. The growth tube section of the ampoule has been modified to allow hardened platinum wires of well defined diameter to be inserted between the crystal holder (a conical plug with polished upper surface which fits into a ground glass socket in the growth tube) and ampoule wall, allowing the aimulus gap to be defined by the thickness of the wire. A shielding system for the vapour pressure monitoring system has been developed and tested which prevents cadmium or cadmium telluride (which has escaped from the growth ampoule via non perfect ground <b>glass</b> joints) from <b>condensing</b> on the sapphire windows of the outer vacuum jacket. The capillary flow restrictor has been calibrated for viscous, molecular and mixed flow regimes using several test gasses. This information has been used to model the mass transport of CdTe in 3 growth runs of the MTPVT system by integrating viscous and molecular flow rates with respect to time. The mass of CdTe transported from source to crystal during each run selected for study was in good agreement with the mass transport of CdTe predicted by the flow model...|$|R

And if we take a glass, or any other cold thing, and hold it over this steam, see how soon it gets damp with water; it will condense it until the <b>glass</b> is warm--it <b>condenses</b> the water which is now running {{down the sides of}} it. I have here another experiment to shew the condensation of water from a vaporous state back into a liquid state, {{in the same way as}} the vapour, one of the products of the candle, was condensed against the bottom of the dish, and obtained in the form of water; and to shew you how truly and thoroughly these changes take place, I will take this tin flask, which is now full of steam, and close the top. We shall see what takes place when we cause this water or steam to return back to the fluid state by pouring some cold water on the outside. [The Lecturer poured the cold water over the vessel, when it immediately collapsed.] You see what has happened. If I had closed the stopper, and still kept the heat applied to it, it would have burst the vessel; yet, when the steam returns to the state of water, the vessel collapses, there being a vacuum produced inside by the condensation of the steam. I shew you these experiments for the purpose of pointing out that in all these occurrences there is nothing that changes the water into any other thing--it still remains water; and so the vessel is obliged to give way, and is crushed inwards, as in the other case, by the further application of heat, it would have been blown outwards.|$|R
