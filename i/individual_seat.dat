5|$|Evanton is {{in close}} {{proximity}} to the site of Balconie Castle, an old seat of the Mormaers and Earls of Ross. By the early modern period, the area was dominated by the Munros of Foulis (Foghlais), who had their Foulis Castle just a few kilometres away. Indeed, the latter began to bury their family at Kiltearn after 1588. The Cille place-name in Kiltearn tells us {{that there had been a}} very ancient Gaelic church near Evanton, like all Cille place-names, founded before 800. The current Gaelic name Cill Tighearna ("Church of the Lord") is probably a corruption of an older form, both because the name formation is unusual in being dedicated to the Lord Himself, and because the form given in 1227 is Kiltierny, suggesting some kind of connection to Tigernach in Ireland. Other suggestions have included a dedication to St Ternan. The church lay next to the lordly residence of Balconie. By the later Middle Ages, Balconie was one of the five lordships of Ross, as well as an <b>individual</b> <b>seat</b> of the Earls of Ross. Place-name evidence suggests that the site may once have been a Pictish residence. A charter granted by Aodh, Earl of Ross in 1281 records the name Petkenny, but a charter of 1333 refers to a location called Balkenny. The development of the name Pitlochry, where Pictish Pit- is replaced by Gaelic Baile, suggests the names are the same, but the great early twentieth century toponymist William J. Watson was doubftful.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called surtitles) {{began to}} appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally {{condemned}} as a distraction, today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's proscenium arch, or <b>individual</b> <b>seat</b> screens where spectators {{can choose from}} more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a RAI broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung discourse is much harder to understand than a spoken one—even in the ears of native speakers. Subtitles in one or more languages have become standard in opera broadcasts, simulcasts, and DVD editions.|$|E
25|$|On board, multi-course meals were {{designed}} by Continental's Congress of Chefs, beverages were selected by Continental's Wine Masters, and service was provided by flight attendants from separate International crew bases at Newark and Houston. Most flights had at least two meal services. Entertainment was offered at each <b>individual</b> <b>seat,</b> and passengers on Boeing 777 and 757 aircraft had access to a new Audio-Video On Demand system with touch-screen controls. 767 aircraft featured older, looped-video multi-channel entertainment systems, generally with a wider programming selection than Economy Class. 767 aircraft were expected to receive AVOD in the near future. Customers also were provided headphones, a large pillow, wool blanket, and amenity kit prior to departure. Upon arrival, BusinessFirst customers have access to shower facilities and arrival lounges at most airports.|$|E

2500|$|The Gremlin X {{version was}} added in 1976 as a {{separate}} model rather than an optional package. The X models included VAM's larger [...] I6, a 6000 RPM tachometer, sports steering wheel, 7.00X14 radial tires, Hurst linkage with T-shaped shifter for the manual transmissions, courtesy lights on parcel shelf, heater, power steering, tinted windshield, bright molding package (drip rails, wheel arches, rocker panels), wheel trim rings, and an in-house two-color rally stripe that was unique to the Mexican market. The 1976 VAM Gremlin X also came with an interior featuring the [...] "Navajo" [...] pattern cloth upholstery that was optional on AMC's Pacer DL models built for the Canadian and U.S. markets. The base VAM Gremlin now also included luxurious seating with a center armrest that was never available in the U.S. models. Due to the debut of the Gremlin X and its sportier focus, the base Gremlin switched back to the standard column-mounted shifters for either transmission, but keeping the <b>individual</b> <b>seat</b> configuration. Both versions included revised gauges with a 160km/h speedometer, new side panel designs, longer folding sun visors, and a styled round dome light lens. Sales for 1976 increased to over 6,000 units.|$|E
2500|$|The 1980 VAM Americans {{incorporated}} all changes {{designed by}} AMC for the Concord that included C-pillar {{windows on the}} ECD, opera windows on the GFS, full-length tail lights, a standard flexible seven-blade fan in all engines, [...] speedometer. For the first time, the cars came with a VAM-designed grille made of aluminum. The American ECD came with the [...] six as standard equipment, meaning that all high-trim VAM Americans were powered by the largest six engine from this point ahead. The American GFS switched to column-shifted transmission control (retaining the <b>individual</b> <b>seat</b> configuration) and the American DL wagon was available {{for the first time}} with simulated wood bodyside trim. A lighted vanity mirror was now standard equipment for the three top end models. All three base models included the heater as standard equipment regardless of transmission type, as well as high back front seats with adjustable headrests. All models featured a locking gas cap and high trim models had safety reflectors fixed onto the door armrests. The high trim 1980 models were the first VAM cars ever to be available with intermittent wipers, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, electric antenna, and an AM/FM stereo radio (instead of the previous monaural units).|$|E
