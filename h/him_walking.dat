Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen <b>him</b> <b>walking</b> from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house.

5|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot {{for the single}} by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, respectively. Hernandez's version opens with busy streets and the dawn of Los Angeles, California. Hamasaki begins singing the song {{on top of a}} skyscraper, whilst several intercut scenes of people walking around Los Angeles during a time lapse are shown. She is then seen {{painting}} a picture of an unidentified man, who raps Verbal's part. It then shows intercut scenes of traffic, a carosuel and couple standing near a bridge. Several parts of these scenes are revised throughout the entire video, which ends with Hamasaki again on top of the skyscraper. For Yokoyama's video, only shots featuring Verbal were only filmed, alongside scenes of <b>him</b> <b>walking</b> through a city in Japan, and residing in a neon-lit club. Parts of Hernandez's version, with the scenes of Hamasaki painting a man and scenes of Los Angeles city and public, were removed in order to merge the first video and Verbal's appearance together. This version premiered one week before the album's release on July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{literally}} lost my mind {{while we}} were recording," [...] stated Bemis regarding the breakdown. The breakdown was precipitated by a mockumentary discussed by Bemis and O'Heir. Bemis' condition led him {{to believe he was}} being secretly filmed for the mockumentary; the situation culminated in <b>him</b> <b>walking</b> the streets of Brooklyn thinking he was being filmed while encountering friends (who were actually strangers). After recovering, Bemis decided to focus solely on the music and dropped the idea of a script. Around July 2003, the band began recording ...Is a Real Boy, their first album with Doghouse Records. Bemis said the two people he wanted to [...] "outdo with ...Is a Real Boy were Andy Warhol and Jesus."

Rowling said the name [...] "seemed to suit the headmaster, because one of his passions is music and I {{imagined}} <b>him</b> <b>walking</b> around humming to himself".

500|$|The Beatles hired Michael Lindsay-Hogg {{to shoot}} a promotional clip for [...] "Hey Jude", after he had {{previously}} directed a clip for [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] in 1966. They settled {{on the idea of}} shooting with a live, albeit controlled, audience. In the clip, the Beatles are first seen by themselves, performing the initial chorus and verses, and then are joined by the audience who appear as the last chorus concludes and coda begins; the audience sings and claps along with the Beatles through the song's conclusion. Hogg shot the clip at Twickenham Film Studios on 4 September 1968, with McCartney himself designing the set. Tony Bramwell, a friend of the Beatles, later described the set as [...] "the piano, there; drums, there; and orchestra in two tiers at the back." [...] The event marked Starr's return to the group, after McCartney's criticism of his drumming had led to <b>him</b> <b>walking</b> out during a session for the White Album track [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R." [...] During his two-week absence, Starr announced that he had left the band.|$|E
500|$|... "Training Day" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. IGN writer Cindy White wrote that Deangelo {{was not given}} a proper introduction {{and that he was}} not distinguished from Michael's character. She also went on to criticize Jim, Pam and Dwight's reaction to Deangelo as the new manager, particular that of Jim and Pam, writing that [...] "it's becoming painfully obvious that the longtime writers don't {{know what to do with}} them anymore". However, she concluded that the episode continued the seventh season's improvement over the sixth, and that it showed potential for future episodes of the season. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt praised Michael's reactions to the office easily ignoring him for Deangelo, calling the final shot of <b>him</b> <b>walking</b> into his office alone [...] "quite effective", and that Dwight's reaction to not being suggested to be Michael's replacement made it more [...] "meaningful". Despite this, he continued by saying that the series was not [...] "sophisticated" [...] enough to use this plotline effectively and criticized the writing for the cast, which made them look [...] "stupid" [...] for [...] "cheap humor" [...] and a [...] "enormously shallow laughter". He ultimately gave the episode a [...] "C+". Alan Sepinwall, a columnist for HitFix, complimented the chemistry between Ferrell and Carell, but criticized the storyline which eventually came down to Michael [...] "being petulant about not being the center of attention every minute of every day", negatively comparing it to [...] "Viewing Party". Despite this, he noted that Ferrell's presence did involve several funny moments.|$|E
2500|$|Rowling stated {{she chose}} the name Dumbledore, {{which is an}} Early Modern English [...] word for [...] "bumblebee", because of Dumbledore's love of music: she {{imagined}} <b>him</b> <b>walking</b> around [...] "humming to himself a lot".|$|E

2500|$|Debauchery is {{a primary}} theme {{throughout}} the album, stemming from Wainwright's struggles with addiction and quest for fame.

The song has been called an [...] "ode to subtle addictions and the way our compulsions rule our lives." [...] The music video for [...] "Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk", directed by Giles Dunning and released by DreamWorks in 2001, features Wainwright performing the song at a piano inside a warehouse and scenes of <b>him</b> <b>walking</b> around New York City.|$|E
