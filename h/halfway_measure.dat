The increased competitive cost pressure, availability of three different existing wire solutions, smart grid deployment requirements (as in Chattanooga), and better hybrid networking tools (with major vendors like Alcatel-Lucent and Qualcomm Atheros, and Wi-Fi solutions for edge networks, IEEE 1905 and IEEE 802.21 protocol efforts and SNMP improvements) all make FTTC deployments more likely in areas uneconomic to serve with FTTP/FTTH.

Commanding General William Westmoreland rejected the use of the U.S. army to pacify rural areas, instead utilizing U.S. superiority in mobility and firepower to find and combat Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers. Intensification of the conflict caused many peasants and rural dwellers to flee to the cities for safety. The number of internal refugees increased from about 500,000 in 1964 to one million in 1966.

In countries where a culture of reform has taken hold, there is consensus that <b>halfway</b> <b>measures</b> do not suffice, that managers either are free to act or are not.

After the collapse of the peasant revolt of Horea, 1784-85, in which over a hundred nobles were killed, the emperor acted. His Imperial Patent of 1785 abolished serfdom but did not give the peasants ownership of the land or freedom from dues owed to the landowning nobles. It did give them personal freedom. Emancipation of the peasants from the kingdom of Hungary promoted the growth of a new class of taxable landholders, but it did not abolish the deep-seated ills of feudalism and the exploitation of the landless squatters. Feudalism finally ended in 1848.|$|R

50|$|In 1893, Voorhees came in {{for serious}} {{controversy}} when President Grover Cleveland called Congress into extra session to repeal the silver purchase clause of the 1890 Sherman Act. As chair of the Senate Finance Committee, the senior senator from Indiana could prevent action, and three years before, he had stood among the leading supporters for an unlimited coinage of silver. His views, in fact, had not changed. He remained, {{to the end of}} his days, a believer in bimetallism: the use of both silver and gold to back up the United States currency. But Indiana was less friendly to an inflated currency than it had been twenty years before, and manufacturers and industrialists were much more decisive in their demand for a gold standard. From members of the Indiana House delegation, Voorhees found an intense desire that he do nothing to risk their own political futures, as any blockage of the repeal bill would be sure to do. Finally, the senator had to reckon with the other big issue pending, on which he and the president would have to part company: tariff reduction. Realizing that he would have to pick his fights, and sweetened with great dollops of patronage by the Administration, Voorhees agreed to carry the repeal bill through, and he kept absolute faith. In late October, when a compromise was proposed that would delay the silver purchase act's repeal until July 1, 1894, thirty seven of the forty-four Democratic senators signed a letter endorsing it. Voorhees's name was not among them. He refused to consider any <b>halfway</b> <b>measures,</b> and saw to it that unconditional repeal went through within the month.|$|R

Renouvin wrote that for German elites, the High Seas Fleet mutiny was the final straw, and as such, they were determined to end the war while something could be saved for the Reich rather than see Germany destroyed forever as a great power and/or swept from power by the revolution that the High Seas Fleet mutiny had sparked. Renouvin noted that such was the determination of German elites to salvage something out of the catastrophe of 1918 that the German officer corps, until then a bastion of monarchism, turned against the monarchy with Wilhelm's generals ordering him to abdicate, as the Allies {{made it clear that they}} would not sign an armistice with him, under any conditions. renouvin wrote that [...] "Wilson did not know Europe", as the president ignored the wishes of his Allies and American public opinion, which did not want any <b>halfway</b> <b>measures</b> that might allow Germany to fight again. Renouvin argued that Wilson had no master plan for the peace, improvised his diplomacy in response to events, and vastly overrated his personal powers of persuasion when it came to dealing with both friends and foes. Renouvin maintained that the armistice of 11 November 1918 was a muddled affair on both sides; the Germans signed the armistice only to end a losing war and prepared to resume the struggle if an opportune moment occurred. The French and the British had insisted on an armistice so harsh that Germany could never resume the war for exactly that reason. Renouvin stated that Wilson in his turn wanted the Reich to continue to exist as a state because as long as Germany remained, his allies needed American assistance, which gave Wilson leverage in negotiating a peace that would be favorable to American interests. Renouvin argued that at the same time, Wilson did not want Germany to resume its quest for [...] "world power status" [...] that might one day threaten the United States, which meant that Wilson was not the advocate of a generous peace towards Germany that English-speaking historians often liked to claim that he was.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the early word decoding development of 73 children at genetic risk of dyslexia and 73 matched controls.

In kindergarten, vocabulary, phonological awareness, lexical retrieval, and verbal and visual short-term memory were assessed.

During the first 5  months of reading instruction, children at risk were less efficient in word decoding and the discrepancy increased over the months. In subsequent months, the discrepancy prevailed for simple words but increased for more complex words. Phonemic awareness and lexical retrieval predicted the reading development in children at risk and controls to the same extent. It is concluded that children at risk are behind their typical peers in word decoding development starting from the very beginning. Furthermore, it is concluded that the disadvantage increased during phonics instruction and that the same predictors underlie the development of word decoding in the two groups of children...|$|R

We investigated whether voluntary control processes can also stop recollection of unwanted memories that {{would otherwise have been}} automatically recollected.

Avoiding recollection of particularly prepotent memories was associated with an additional, earlier ERP negativity that was separable from the later voluntary modulation of conscious recollection.

40|$|Mayor Baker {{issued an}} order {{yesterday}} that commands all downtown stores {{to close at}} 3 : 30 PM and all offices to close at 4 PM. The mayor hopes that this order will prevent crowds on streetcars, thereby limiting the spread of influenza and shortening {{the length of the}} ban on public gatherings. The order encompasses City Hall. The order goes into effect after Monday, November 4 th and will remain in place until otherwise directed. • Health officials and “those directly interested in the closing order” met all day yesterday. They drafted the latest orders {{and came up with a}} list of rules to prevent the spread of influenza. • Mayor Baker stated that the conference was not called because there has been a drastic increase in the influenza epidemic. Instead, it was called out of a desire to enact the correct precautions that will shorten the epidemic (and therefore the inconvenience of the closure order) as much as possible. • Mayor Baker: “Preventative measures promulgated at the beginning of the epidemic resulted in Portland suffering less from the illness than any other city of like population in the Nation, and the present step is taken with the view that the sacrifices and loss entailed will be more than compensated by the early ending of the epidemic. In other words, it will save lives, prevent suffering and lessen economic hardships if all of us for a short time do our utmost to stamp out this epidemic than to use only <b>halfway</b> <b>measures</b> over a long period of time. ”• Mayor Baker appeals to the public to observe health precautions. • Mayor Baker: “The people will appreciate that the continuance of the epidemic in Portland and other cities in the United States will go far to seriously cripple the output of ships and to otherwise impede in many ways the successful furtherance of the Nation’s war programme. It is not merely a local problem; it is a National question, and as in the past we must work shoulder to shoulder for our mutual interests. ”• Mayor Baker claims that statistics prove influenza thrives where people are allowed to gather. • The order that requires employees are released from office buildings at 4 : 00 PM does not apply to janitors, elevator operators, or “those employed by persons engaged in rendering medical assistance of any kind. ”• These rules were decided upon by health authorities and officials at Vancouver Barracks: 1. “All schools, churches, lodges, public places of meetings, and places of amusement shall be closed. 2. Avoid crowding at cafeterias or similar places and maintain an interval of at least four feet between individuals. No food must be handled by the public but only by the proper attendants. 3. Food exposed for consumption should be protected. 4. Where there is sickness in the family, allow but one member to wait on the patient who shall at all times while in contact the patient wear a mask and remove it before they enter the room. The patient shall also be screened by hanging sheet across the room or whatever way is practical. The room shall be kept thoroughly ventilated at all times. 5. Consult your physician immediately should your bodily symptoms be in any way below par, as experience has shown that many people are quite ill and yet have symptoms which ordinarily would be disregarded. 6. The public should observe absolutely the recommendations with regard to spitting in public places. 7. Avoid needless crowding; influenza is a crowd disease. 8. Smother your coughs and sneezes, others do not want the germs which you would throw away. 9. Your nose, not your mouth, was made to breathe through—get the habit. 10. Remember the three C’s—a clean mouth, clean skin, and clean clothes. 11. Try to keep cool when you walk and walk a great deal for exercise and to maintain bodily vigor. Keep warm when you ride and sleep. 12. Open the windows always at home at night; at the office when practicable. 13. Your fate may be in your own hands. Wash your hands before eating. 14. Don’t let the waste product of digestion accumulate—drink a glass or two of water on getting up, before meals, and on retiring. 15. Don’t use a napkin, towel, spoon, fork, glass or cup which has been used by another person and not washed. 16. When the air is pure, breathe all of it you can.

Specifically, I {{explore the influence of}} gossip at multiple levels of analysis: individual, dyadic and group. In Study 1, a laboratory experiment that looks at the short-term benefits of engaging in gossip (versus two control conditions, self-disclosure and task discussion), I find that individuals who engage in gossip experience higher positive emotions, energy and motivation but lower levels of state self-esteem. These gossiping dyads also experience dyadic benefits of relationship closeness and cooperation. Study 2 explored both the reputational and team-level outcomes of gossip. This study showed that team members who engaged in gossip were seen as being less trustworthy. Furthermore, gossip centrality had an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship with perceptions of competence. Study 2 showed that gossip about team members negatively influenced team outcomes such as psychological safety, cooperation and viability and increased team-level perceptions of politics while gossip about individuals outside the team has a positive effect on these outcomes, enhancing levels of team cooperation and decreasing perceptions of politics at the team-level.
