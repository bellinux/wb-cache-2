5|$|Some <b>freshwater</b> <b>bivalves</b> {{have very}} {{restricted}} ranges. For example, the Ouachita creekshell mussel, Villosa arkansasensis, is known {{only from the}} streams of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and like several other freshwater mussel species from the southeastern US, it {{is in danger of}} extinction. In contrast, a few species of <b>freshwater</b> <b>bivalves,</b> including the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), are dramatically increasing their ranges. The golden mussel has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina, where it has become an invasive species. Another well-travelled freshwater bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) originated in southeastern Russia, and has been accidentally introduced to inland waterways in North America and Europe, where the species damages water installations and disrupts local ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this small}} group have either a single divided sucker or a row of suckers that cover the underside. They infest the guts of bony or {{cartilaginous}} fish and of turtles, and the body cavities of marine and <b>freshwater</b> <b>bivalves</b> and gastropods. Their eggs produce ciliated swimming larvae, and the life cycle has one or two hosts.|$|E
5|$|After the iguanodontian Lurdusaurus, Nigersaurus was {{the most}} {{numerous}} megaherbivore. Other herbivores from the same formation include Ouranosaurus, Elrhazosaurus, and an unnamed titanosaur. It also lived alongside the theropods Kryptops, Suchomimus, and Eocarcharia, and a yet-unnamed noasaurid. Crocodylomorphs like Sarcosuchus, Anatosuchus, Araripesuchus, and Stolokrosuchus also lived there. In addition, remains of a pterosaur, chelonians, fish, a hybodont shark, and <b>freshwater</b> <b>bivalves</b> have been found. Grass did not evolve until the late Cretaceous, making ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms (which had evolved by the middle Cretaceous) potential food for Nigersaurus. It is unlikely the dinosaur fed on conifers, cycads, or aquatic vegetation, due respectively to their height, hard and stiff structure, and lack of appropriate habitat.|$|E

5|$|Bivalves {{appear in}} the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of living species is about 9,200. These species are placed within 1,260 genera and 106 families. Marine {{bivalves}} (including brackish water and estuarine species) represent about 8,000 species, combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 genera. The largest recent marine families are the Veneridae, with more than 680 species and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 species. The <b>freshwater</b> <b>bivalves</b> include seven families, the largest of which are the Unionidae, with about 700 species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Freshwater</b> <b>bivalves</b> in {{the order}} Unionoida have a {{different}} lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.|$|E
