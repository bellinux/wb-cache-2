500|$|From a gate inside Clock Tower, Link and Tatl enter Clock Town {{while its}} {{population}} prepares for the town's annual Carnival of Time also {{scheduled to take}} place in three days.

Meeting with the Happy Mask Salesman again, he sees that Link has retrieved his ocarina, and hence teaches him the [...] "Song of Healing", which breaks the curse, returns Link to his human form and seals his Deku Scrub form into a mask which has the power to turn him back into a Deku Scrub if needed. After he finds out Link did not bring back the mask, he panics and explains that the mask conceals an evil, apocalyptic power that was once used by an ancient tribe in hexing rituals. The troubles caused by the mask were so great, that the ancient ones [...] "sealed the mask in shadow forever" [...] to prevent it from being misused. Link must then travel between the four cardinal regions of Termina: Woodfall, Snowhead, the Great Bay, and Ikana Canyon, for each region conceals one of the Four Giants who will be able, once reunited, to halt the moon's crashing. At the same time, each region has been struck with a terrible curse by the Skull Kid which plagues its inhabitants and seals away its giant. To lift the curse and free the giants, Link must enter a dungeon in each region and defeat its boss, after doing so, obtaining the power to summon the giant <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>set</b> free. To accomplish this, he uses the [...] "Song of Healing" [...] to create a mask that can turn him into a Goron from the spirit of a deceased Goron hero, and a mask that can turn him into a Zora from the spirit of a brave deceased Zora.|$|E
