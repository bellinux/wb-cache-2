However, this was the highest awareness rating in the Democratic field outside of the frontrunners (Clinton, Obama, and Edwards) and non-declared but highly discussed Al Gore. A September 18 poll found that 56% of respondents had not <b>heard</b> <b>enough</b> about Biden to form an opinion about him.|$|E

When David Geffen stopped by the studio for a preview, he was warned {{that it was a}} work in progress, but it was almost done. That was a mistake, because only a few tracks had been finished, and most of them were in demo phase. He <b>heard</b> <b>enough</b> to tell {{producers}} that it was not good enough; the project was canceled. It would be released years later in 1996, under the title I'm a Rainbow.|$|E
500|$|As Reverend Proctor was {{appealing}} for calm, {{a prisoner}} brandishing two sticks shouted out [...] "You've <b>heard</b> <b>enough,</b> let's do it, get the bastards". Other prisoners responded by donning masks and brandishing weapons, and three prison officers started {{to leave the}} chapel as earlier instructed. A set of keys was taken from a prison officer when a number of officers were attacked by prisoners wielding fire extinguishers, table legs and fire buckets. A number of prisoners attempted to leave the chapel via the vestry; at the same time, the seven prison officers there attempted to gain entry to the chapel. Once they managed to do so, the officers were attacked by prisoners, and {{a second set of}} keys was taken from one of them. Some prisoners helped to get injured officers and Reverend Proctor to a place of safety via the vestry, while others barricaded entrances to the chapel or attempted {{to gain access to the}} roof.|$|E

500|$|On 7 July {{the court}} adjourned for four months. When it resumed, Ballantine called more witnesses, {{including}} Bogle and Francis Baigent, a close family friend. Hawkins contended that Bogle and Baigent were feeding the Claimant with information, but in cross-examination {{he could not}} dent their belief that the Claimant was genuine. In January 1872 Coleridge began {{the case for the}} defence with a speech during which he categorised the Claimant as comparable with [...] "the great impostors of history". He intended to prove that the Claimant was Arthur Orton. He had over 200 witnesses lined up, but it transpired that few were required. Lord Bellew, who had known Roger Tichborne at Stonyhurst, testified that Roger had distinctive body tattoos which the Claimant did not possess. On 4 March the jury notified the judge that they had <b>heard</b> <b>enough</b> and were ready to reject the Claimant's suit. Having ascertained that this decision was based on the evidence as a whole and not solely on the missing tattoos, Bovill ordered the Claimant's arrest on charges of perjury and committed him to Newgate Prison.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} summary {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states, [...] "A poor widow who supports her two children, one a baby and the other girl of six, by scrubbing, weakens under her hard work, and finally dies. Marie, the 'little mother,' anxious that her home may not be broken up, calls {{on one of her}} mother's employers and requests that she be given a chance to take the dead woman's place. The artist, a wealthy, good-hearted man, pleased with the child's pluck, laughingly employs her, and makes her believe that she is really doing all the 'chores.' The artist's kindness, much to his surprise, brings him recompense one [...] One of his models plots to fleece him. She calls at his studio, faints in his arms, and when her confederate rushes in with a policeman, she makes charges that lead to the arrest of the innocent artist. Just as the policeman is leading her benefactor away, the little scrub woman sees what is happening. She follows the party to the police station, but is afraid to enter. When the complainant and her husband come out, the child is impressed with the fact that they seem to be on the best of terms. Her suspicions are aroused, and she shadows them like a regular detective. What crook would ever imagine that a little girl, wheeling a baby carriage, was a sleuth? This pair certainly did not, for when they meet a new friend in the park, they stop to tell him how they successfully arranged to trim a rich artist, never doubting that he would pay liberally to have the case dropped. The little girl, from her place in hiding, heard the story. So the little girl found a policeman, and told him about it. And the policeman went with her to the hiding place, and <b>heard</b> <b>enough</b> to warrant him in making what he afterward described as a 'two handed collar.' The adventurous and her confederate were hailed to the police station and locked up, while the artist was set free in a hurry. The result is that there is now a 'scrub woman' whose duties are a sinecure although the wages are high, {{and the future of the}} 'little mother' and her baby are assured." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kramer, however, {{had several}} caveats about Perry. He says that Bill Tilden once called Perry [...] "the world's worst good player". Kramer says that Perry was [...] "extremely fast; {{he had a}} hard body with sharp reflexes, and he could hit a {{forehand}} with a snap, slamming it on the rise—and even on the fastest grass. That shot was nearly as good as Segura's two-handed forehand." [...] His only real weakness, says Kramer, [...] "was his backhand. Perry hit underslice off that wing about 90 % of the time, and eventually {{at the very top}} levels—against Vines and Budge—that was what did him in. Whenever an opponent would make an especially good shot, Perry would cry out 'Very clevah.' I never played Fred competitively, but I <b>heard</b> <b>enough</b> from other guys that 'Very clevah' drove a lot of opponents crazy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his race}} against Emerson, one {{newspaper}} remarked [...] "on Carnahan’s tactics of deliberate misinformation and distortion of facts" [...] and his [...] "negative and demagogic {{approach to the}} 8th District race." [...] The Sikeston Standard-Democrat said, [...] "Democrat Russ Carnahan has brought more mud into a congressional campaign than the days of Bill D. Burlison." [...] According to the Rolla Daily News, [...] "We have already <b>heard</b> <b>enough</b> from Carnahan, whose loose interpretation of Mr. Emerson’s record is grossly misleading. [...] Mostly B.S., in other words. [...] Couple that with Carnahan’s wild accusations of what Emerson is to be blamed for, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Carnahan doesn’t soon attribute Missouri’s recent fifth-down loss to Colorado to Emerson." [...] Responding to this criticism, Carnahan alleged [...] "that the Sowers family, which publishes the Rolla Daily News, has endorsed Emerson because the congressman rents district office space from the family." [...] The Southeast Missourian described Carnahan's claim as [...] "amateurish." [...] In {{the final days of}} the campaign, [...] "frustrated by ads being run by ," [...] Carnahan [...] "lashed back by calling Emerson a ‘damn liar.’" [...] Emerson defeated Carnahan, 57% to 43%.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{resumption}} of the inquest, {{it was announced that}} a public inquiry was to be held into the accident. An allegation that Imperial Airways had attempted to interfere with a witness was not upheld by the Coroner. Evidence was then given about the manner of the take-off, and the firmness of the grass runway.

On {{the resumption}} of the inquest, the Coroner announced {{that as a result of}} fresh evidence being available, coupled with Major Woods-Humphreys, the general manager of Imperial Airways, being taken ill, the inquest would be further adjourned until 12 February. When the inquest resumed, the Public Inquiry had concluded. The Coroner remarked that evidence from the Public Inquiry showed that there was no case for criminal negligence verdicts to be given. Major Cooper was then re-called and gave evidence confirming the result of the public inquiry. The jury stated that they had <b>heard</b> <b>enough</b> evidence to be in a position to give a verdict.
