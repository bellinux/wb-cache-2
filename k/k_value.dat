40|$|Computer-assisted {{simulation}} is {{a promising}} approach for clarifying complicated signaling networks. However, {{this approach is}} currently limited by a deficiency of kinetic parameters determined in living cells. To overcome this problem, we applied fluorescence cross-correlation spectrometry (FCCS) to measure dissociation constant (<b>Kd)</b> <b>values</b> of signaling molecule complexes in living cells (in vivo Kd). Among the pairs of fluorescent molecules tested, that of monomerized enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP) and HaloTag-tetramethylrhodamine was most suitable for the measurement of in vivo Kd by FCCS. Using this pair, we determined 22 in vivo <b>Kd</b> <b>values</b> of signaling molecule complexes comprising the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. With these parameters, we developed a kinetic simulation model of the EGFR-Ras-ERK MAP kinase pathway and uncovered a potential role played by stoichiometry in Shc binding to EGFR during the peak activations of Ras, MEK, and ERK. Intriguingly, most of the in vivo <b>Kd</b> <b>values</b> determined {{in this study were}} higher than the in vitro <b>Kd</b> <b>values</b> reported previously, suggesting the significance of competitive bindings inside cells.

5000|$|Four {{values that}} {{represent}} clot formation {{are determined by}} this test: the reaction time (R value), the <b>K</b> <b>value,</b> the angle and the maximum amplitude (MA). The R value represents the time until the first evidence of a clot is detected. The <b>K</b> <b>value</b> is the time {{from the end of}} R until the clot reaches 20mm and this represents the speed of clot formation. The angle is the tangent of the curve made as the K is reached and offers similar information to K. The MA is a reflection of clot strength. A mathematical formula determined by the manufacturer can be used to determine a Coagulation Index (CI) (or overall assessment of coagulability) which takes into account the relative contribution of each of these 4 values into 1 equation.The G-value is a log-derivation of the MA and is meant to also represent the clot strength using dynes/sec as its units. There are some studies which suggest that an elevated G-value is associated with a hypercoagulable state and therefore increases the risk for venous thromboembolic disease. However, there are no studies dosing of prophylactic heparin products based on the G-value. TEG also measures clot lysis which is reported as both the estimated percent lysis (EPL) and the percentage of clot which has actually lysed after 30 minutes (LY 30,%). Although a normal EPL can be as high as 15% and a normal LY 30 can be has high as 8%, some studies in the trauma population suggest that a LY30 greater than 3% is associated with risk of hemorrhage.|$|E
