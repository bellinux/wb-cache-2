50|$|In the 1960s, {{the fiber}} or <b>{{felt-tip}}ped</b> <b>pen</b> {{was invented by}} Yukio Horie of the Tokyo Stationery Company, Japan. Papermate's Flair {{was among the first}} felt-tip pens to hit the U.S. market in the 1960s, and it has been the leader ever since. Marker pens and highlighters, both similar to felt pens, have become popular in recent times.|$|E
5000|$|Pentel Co., Ltd. (...) is {{a privately}} held Japanese company which {{produces}} stationery products. The {{name is a}} combination of the English words pen and tell (as in, telling a story). Pentel is also the inventor of non-permanent marker technology. Most Pentel products are manufactured in Japan, Taiwan and France. Yukio Horie, who was the President of the company until his death in 2010, invented the fibre- or <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>pen</b> in the 1960s.|$|E

50|$|Pudlo's art is {{characterized}} by a playful sense of humour and a fascination with the trappings of modern life, especially airplanes. His early drawings are simple outlines made with lead pencil. In the mid-1960s, Pudlo began to work with coloured pencils and <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>pens,</b> and his art became more elaborate. In many ways Pudlo's work symbolizes the paradoxes of the encounter between traditional Inuit culture and modern life.|$|R
50|$|The first rough {{drawings}} {{were made}} with a <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>pen,</b> and then photographically reduced {{to be able to}} judge the design at the right size. The editors of the dictionary were happy with the results, and accepted the offer to produce the typeface. De Does worked together with Peter Matthias Noordzij, who used Ikarus to digitize the drawings that De Does made. The first version of 1992 was optimized for legibility at the point sizes that were used in the dictionary. The version that is published by The Enschedé Font Foundry (TEFF) was released in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|The ink {{is applied}} to the {{photocatalyst}} coating, usually using either a <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>pen,</b> air-brush, rubber stamp or paint brush, and then exposed it to sunlight or an alternative, appropriate (invariably UVA) light source. The ink identifies the presence of the photocatalyst coating by changing colour upon irradiation of the latter at a rate (usually < 10 min) which provides a measure of the film's activity. For example, it has been established that the rate of change in colour of an Paii on commercial self-cleaning glass {{is directly related to the}} rate at which the glass is also able to photo-oxidatively mineralise, via reaction (1), the wax-like, natural fatty acid, stearic acid, found in finger prints. [...] By making the dyes in the ink increasing difficult to reduce chemically, for example by using: basic blue 66, resazurin, and acid violet 7, respectively, it is possible to make Paii's which are effective on photocatalyst coatings which exhibit, respectively: low (most self-cleaning tiles), moderate (self-cleaning glass) or high (self-cleaning paints) activities. Currently Paii's are used as quality control and marketing tools in commerce and as a quick and easy way to assess and/or map the activities of new photocatalytic materials in research.|$|E
40|$|Landscape Montage Technique (LMT) {{is one of}} {{the drawing}} methods in {{psychotherapy}} and consists of two processes. One is the composing process, in which a man draws with a <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>pen.</b> Another process is painting process and he paint by crayon and so after drawing by a <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>pen.</b> The themes of earlier studies about LMT can be classified into three:, "drawing LMT," "seeing LMT," and "arriving LMT". 'Drawing LMT" is thought to resemble the formation of sentences, and the point of it is composing. T here are various aspects about "Seeing LMT". The aspects are grouped into three, to see relations to pathology, to follow developmental changes, and to search effective indicators. Studies about "arriving LMT" are mainly reported in case studies. Those about "drawing LMT", "seeing LMT", and "arriving LMT" reveal dimensions of one occurrence and viewed in earlier studies at the issue from the point that there is importance in the composing process. But there are many special experiences in the painting process, and they must be discussed in the future...|$|E

5000|$|Lee Newman {{patented}} a <b>felt-tipped</b> marking <b>pen</b> in 1910. In 1926, Benjamin Paskach patented a [...] "fountain paintbrush" [...] as {{he called}} it which consisted of a sponge-tipped handle containing various paint colors. Markers of this sort began to be popularized with the sale of Sidney Rosenthal's Magic Marker (1953) which consisted of a glass tube of ink with a felt wick. By 1958, use of felt-tipped markers was commonplace for a variety of applications such as lettering, labeling, and creating posters. The year 1962 brought the development of the modern fiber-tipped pen (in contrast to the marker, which generally has a thicker point) by Yukio Horie of the Tokyo Stationery Company (which later became Pentel).|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the inter- and intra-examiner reliability of pain pressure threshold algometry at various points of the abdominal wall of healthy women. Twenty-one healthy women in menacme with a mean age of 28 +/- 5. 4 years (range: 19 - 39 years) were included. All volunteers had regular menstrual cycles (27 - 33 days) and were right-handed and, to the best of our knowledge, none were taking medications at the time of testing. Women with a diagnosis of depression, anxiety or other mood disturbances were excluded. Women with previous abdominal surgery, any pain condition or any evidence of inflammation, hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, or inflammatory disease were also excluded. Pain perception thresholds were assessed with a pressure algometer with digital traction and compression and a measuring capacity for 5 kg. All points were localized by palpation and marked with a <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>pen</b> and each individual was evaluated over a period of 2 days in two consecutive sessions, each session consisting of a set of 14 point measurements repeated twice by two examiners in random sequence. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean pain threshold obtained by the two examiners on 2 diferent days (examiner A: P = 1. 00; examiner B: P = 0. 75; Wilcoxon matched pairs test). There was excellent/good agreement between examiners for all days and all points. Our results have established baseline values to which future researchers will be able to refer. They show that pressure algometry is a reliable measure for pain perception in the abdominal wall of healthy women...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{behaviour}} of three photocatalyst indicator inks, {{based on the}} redox dyes: methylene blue (MB), resorufin (Rf) and 2, 6 -dichloroindophenol (DCIP), and assess their performance {{in comparison to the}} pioneering resazurin (Rz) -based ink for the rapid assessment of the activity of very thin, photocatalyst films, such as Activ™ self-cleaning glass. From a commercial 'demonstrator of photocatalysis' perspective, all three redox dyes appear more attractive compared to Rz since all generate colourless products in the ink formulation when photoreduced on Activ™ under anaerobic conditions, whereas, the reduced product from Rz, the redox dye resorufin, Rf, is pink in colour. However, the ink based on Rf is far too slow to effect the rapid measurement of photocatalytic activity {{even in the absence of}} oxygen, and in the presence of oxygen the latter inhibits the overall kinetics of photoreduction by re-oxidising the reduced product, dihydroresorufin, HRf, back to Rf. Similarly, despite the attractive rapid rate of photobleaching for MB under anaerobic conditions, compared to the other redox dyes, the reduced product of the MB-based ink, leuco-MB, is so oxygen-sensitive that the ink cannot be photoreduced under aerobic conditions, thus rendering the ink unsuitable for use in the field. The DCIP-based ink is slightly less easy to photoreduce under both anaerobic and ambient atmospheric conditions compared to the Rz-based ink. However, in addition to its more attractive colour change, the DCIP-based ink is unaffected by the ambient level of oxygen present (%O 2) and the relative humidity (%RH), whereas, for the Rz-based ink, both parameters effect the photoreduction kinetics. By incorporating the DCIP ink into a <b>felt-tipped</b> <b>pen,</b> the ink is suitable for use in the laboratory and field to perform not only a qualitative test, but also to allow a semi-quantitative analysis of photocatalytic activity by eye...|$|E
5000|$|The {{light pen}} allows {{the user to}} [...] "draw", to create images and to indicate, on the screen. It has a {{photo-detector}} that can see the bright spot of the vector-drawing display monitor when it goes by under the light pen's position where it is being held to the screen. The photo-detector feeds internal pulse-catching circuits that tell the Vectrex and its software of the event. The prototype {{was made in the}} plastic casework of a Marks-A-Lot <b>felt-tipped</b> marker <b>pen.</b> The Vectrex draws a spider-web-like search-pattern to track the pen's location. The software changes the pattern size as the pen changes motions and velocity in an attempt keep a continuous lock on the pen's position. The Vectrex light pen was invented by John Ross.|$|R
