Using this improved technique, recombination was attempted with two serologically distinct strains of influenza B virus, B/Lee/ 40 and B/Massachusetts/ 1 / 71. After mixed infection, two virus clones were selected and characterized in detail.

Bats also harbour group A rotaviruses, but the genetic backgrounds of bat rotavirus strains are usually distinct from those of human rotavirus strains. We identified a new strain of group A rotavirus in the intestinal contents of a horseshoe bat in Zambia. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the identified virus, named RVA/Bat-wt/ZMB/LUS 12 - 14 / 2012 /G 3 P[3], possessed the genotype constellation G 3 -P[3]-I 3 -R 2 -C 2 -M 3 -A 9 -N 2 -T 3 -E 2 -H 3.

Through active in-fluenza A virus surveillance in US exhibition swine and whole-genome sequencing of 380 isolates, we demon-strate that exhibition swine are {{actively involved in}} the evolution of influenza A viruses, including zoonotic strains. First, frequent introduction of influenza A viruses from commercial swine populations provides new genetic diversity in exhibition pigs each year locally. Second, <b>genomic</b> <b>reassortment</b> between viruses cocirculat-ing in exhibition swine increases viral diversity. Third, viral migration between exhibition swine in neighboring states demonstrates that movements of exhibition pigs contributes to the spread of genetic diversity. The unex-pected frequency of viral exchange between commercial and exhibition swine raises questions about the under-studied interface between these populations.

40|$|Accepted (Day Month Year) Influenza A {{virus is}} a {{negative}} stranded RNA virus, composed of eight segmented RNA molecules, including polymerases (PB 2, PB 1, PA), haemaglutin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (MP), and nonstructure gene (NS). The influenza A viruses are notorious for rapid mutations, frequent <b>genomic</b> <b>reassortments,</b> and possible recombinations. Among these evolutionary events, genetic reassortments refer to exchanges of internal fragments (PB 2, PB 1, PA, NP, MP, NS) between co-infected viruses, {{and they have been}} responsible for generating pandemic and epidemic strains. Thus, identification of reassortments will be critical for pandemic and epidemic prevention and control. This paper presents a reassortment identification method based on distance measurement using complete composition vector (CCV) and segment clustering using a minimum spanning tree algorithm. By applying this method, we identified 34 potential reassortment clusters among 2, 641 PB 2 segments of influenza A viruses. Among the 83 serotypes tested, at least 56 serotypes (67. 46 %) exchanged their fragments with another serotype of avian influenza viruses. These identified reassortments involve 1957 H 2 N 1 and 1968 H 3 N 2 influenza pandemic strains as well as H 5 N 1 avian influenza virus isolates, which have generated a threat for a future pandemic...|$|R

In this study, {{we describe the}} obstacles in developing LAIV strains while {{taking into account the}} phenotypic peculiarities of WT viruses used for <b>reassortment.</b> <b>Genomic</b> composition analysis of 849 seasonal LAIV reassortants revealed that over 80 % of reassortants based on inhibitor-resistant WT viruses inherited WT NA, compared to 26 % of LAIV reassortants based on inhibitor-sensitive WT viruses. In addition, the highest percentage of LAIV genotype reassortants was achieved when WT parental viruses were resistant to non-specific serum inhibitors. We demonstrate that NA {{may play a role in}} influenza virus sensitivity to non-specific serum inhibitors. Replacing NA of inhibitor-sensitive WT virus with the NA of inhibitor-resistant master donor virus significantly decreased the sensitivity of the resulting reassortant virus to serum heat-stable inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Influenza A(H 3 N 2) viruses became {{widespread}} in humans during the 1968 H 3 N 2 virus pandemic {{and have been}} a major cause of influenza epidemics ever since. These viruses evolve continuously by <b>reassortment</b> and <b>genomic</b> evolution. Antigenic drift is the cause for the need to update influenza vaccines frequently. Using two data sets that span the entire period of circulation of hu-man influenza A(H 3 N 2) viruses, it was shown that influenza A(H 3 N 2) virus evolution can be mapped to 13 antigenic clusters. Here we analyzed the full genomes of 286 influenza A(H 3 N 2) viruses from these two data sets to investigate the <b>genomic</b> evolu-tion and <b>reassortment</b> patterns. Numerous reassortment events were found, scattered over the entire period of virus circulation, but most prominently in viruses circulating between 1991 and 1998. Some of these reassortment events persisted over time, and one of these coincided with an antigenic cluster transition. Furthermore, selection pressures and nucleotide and amino acid sub-stitution rates of all proteins were studied, including those of the recently discovered PB 1 -N 40, PA-X, PA-N 155, and PA-N 182 proteins. Rates of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions were most pronounced for the hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and PB 1 -F 2 proteins.

40|$|Influenza A virus (IAV) has a {{segmented}} genome {{that allows for}} the exchange of genome segments between different strains. This reassortment accelerates evolution by breaking linkage, helping IAV cross species barriers to potentially create highly virulent strains. Challenges associated with monitoring the process of reassortment in molecular detail have limited our understanding of its evolutionary implications. We applied a novel deep sequencing approach with quan-titative analysis to assess the in vitro temporal evolution of <b>genomic</b> <b>reassortment</b> in IAV. The combination of H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 strains reproducibly generated a new H 1 N 2 strain with the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein segments originating from H 1 N 1 and the remaining six segments from H 3 N 2. By deep sequencing the entire viral genome, we monitored the evolution of reassortment, quantifying the relative abundance of all IAV genome segments from the two parent strains over time and measuring the selection coefficients of the reassorting segments.

Sandfly fever group viruses have been isolated from various vertebrate species and from phlebotomines and occasionally alternative arthropods, e. g. mosquitoes, or ceratopogonids {{of the genus}} Culicoides. Uukuniemi serogroup viruses have been isolated from various vertebrate species and from ticks. Despite the public health importance of some viruses of the genus, the genomic diversity of phleboviruses that could be incriminated as causative of human or veterinary diseases remains underestimated. Here we describe the nearly complete sequences and genomic characterization of two phleboviruses belonging to the Bujaru antigenic complex: the prototype species and the Munguba virus. Furthermore, six previously unclassified phleboviruses isolated in Brazil were also sequenced and characterized: Ambe, Anhanga, Joa, Uriurana, Urucuri and Tapara viruses.

Increased age may have provided some degree of immunity, but vaccines against seasonal influenza viruses seldom yield cross-reactive immunity, exemplified by 2009 /H 1 N 1. Nonetheless, about 33 % of individuals, {{over the age of}} 60, had cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against 2009 /H 1 N 1, whereas only 6 - 9 % young adults had these antibodies. Children characteristically had no detectable immunity against 2009 /H 1 N 1.

Because internal influenza proteins may exhibit less antigenic variation, it is possible that prior exposure to diverse strains of influenza virus provide some immunity to novel strains, including the recent pandemic strain (swine-avian A/H 1 N 1). Current trends in immunological studies – specifically the modulation of cellular immune surveillance provided by TH 17 and Tregs – also support the need for additional proteomic research for characterizing novel translational evidence-based treatment interventions based on cytokine function to help defeat the virus.

40|$|Agricultural fairs are {{associated}} with bidirectional, interspecies transmission of infl uenza virus A between humans and pigs. We examined pigs exhibited at agricultural fairs in Ohio during 2009 – 2011 for signs of infl uenza-like illness and collected nasal swab specimens from a representative subset of these animals. Infl uenza virus A was recovered from pigs at 12 / 53 (22. 6 %) fairs during the 3 -year sampling period. Pigs at 10 / 12 (83. 3 %) fairs from which infl uenza virus A was recovered did not show signs of infl uenza-like illness. Hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix gene combinations of the isolates were consistent with infl uenza virus A concurrently circulating among swine herds in the United States. Subclinical infl uenza virus A infections in pigs at agricultural fairs may pose a risk to human health and create challenges for passive surveillance programs for infl uenza virus A in swine herds. Awareness of bidirectional zoonotic transmission of influenza virus A between pigs and humans was heightened {{by the emergence of}} the influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 virus, which resulted in an influenza pandemic among humans starting in 2009.

The primary reservoir host of Sin Nombre virus is the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), which is widely distributed in North America. We investigated the prevalence of intramolecular changes and of <b>genomic</b> <b>reassortment</b> among Sin Nombre viruses detected in deer mice in three western states. Methods Portions of the Sin Nombre virus small (S) and medium (M) RNA segments were amplified by RT-PCR from kidney, lung, liver and spleen of seropositive peromyscine rodents, principally deer mice, collected in Colorado, New Mexico and Montana from 1995 to 2007. Both a 142 nucleotide (nt) amplicon of the M segment, encoding {{a portion of the}} G 2 transmembrane glycoprotein, and a 751 nt amplicon of the S segment, encoding part of the nucleocapsid protein, were cloned and sequenced from 19 deer mice and from one brush mouse (P. boylii), S RNA but not M RNA from one deer mouse, and M RNA but not S RNA from another deer mouse. Results Two of 20 viruses were found to be reassortants. Within virus sequences from different rodents, the average rate of synonymous substitutions among all pair-wise comparisons (π s) was 0. 378 in the M segment and 0. 312 in the S segment sequences. The replacement substitution rate (π a) was 7. 0 × 10 - 4 in the M segment and 17. 3 × 10 - 4 in the S segment sequences. The low π a relative to π s suggests strong purifying selection and this was confirmed by a Fu and Li analysis. The absolute rate of molecular evolution of the M segment was 6. 76 × 10 - 3 substitutions/site/year. The absolute age of the M segment tree was estimated to be 37 years. In the S segment the rate of molecular evolution was 1. 93 × 10 - 3 substitutions/site/year and the absolute age of the tree was 106 years. Assuming that mice were infected with a single Sin Nombre virus genotype, phylogenetic analyses revealed that 10 % (2 / 20) of viruses were reassortants, similar to the 14 % (6 / 43) found in a previous report. Conclusion Age estimates from both segments suggest that Sin Nombre virus has evolved within the past 37 – 106 years. The rates of evolutionary changes reported here suggest that Sin Nombre virus M and S segment reassortment occurs frequently in nature. </p...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{mutability}} {{of influenza}} virus {{in conjunction with}} <b>genomic</b> <b>reassortment</b> between viral strains promotes the virus’ ability to evade vaccines and to become resistant to antiviral drugs. Therefore, novel anti-influenza therapeutics utilizing new targets and creative strategies are essential. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the virus consists of PA, PB 1, and PB 2 subunits. Biological and structural investigations of the functional domains of these subunits have broadened the target reservoir for drug screening. With the wealth of knowledge from these studies, identification of small-molecule inhibitors that specifically disrupt the polymerase assembly or abrogate polymerase activities has emerged as an innovative and promising approach. In an attempt to facilitate the discovery of antiviral agents that target viral polymerase, isolated functional domains such as the PA endonuclease domain, the PB 2 cap-binding domain, and the PA-PB 1 interaction domains were expressed as screening targets. Based on the biochemical and structural properties of individual targets, a variety of platforms were established for the effective screening of inhibitors, including systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, fluorescence polarization (FP) assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antiviral efficacies of selected inhibitors were examined in vitro and in vivo, followed by verification of their antiviral mechanisms. Clinical merits of selected inhibitors were further evaluated, focusing mainly on their cross-protection abilities among influenza virus subtypes and their potential synergetic antiviral effects when used {{in combination with other}} drugs. A number of small-molecule compounds, i. e. PA- 30, ANA- 0, PB 2 - 19, PAC- 3 and ANA- 1, together with the aptamer PAN- 2, were identified as potent inhibitors against the replication of multiple subtypes of influenza A virus, including H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2, H 5 N 1, H 7 N 7, H 7 N 9, and H 9 N 2, in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell cultures. The intranasal administration of the identified compounds enhanced survival rates and reduced lung viral loads in BALB/c mice infected with H 1 N 1 virus. The docking analyses predicted the compounds targeting PA or PB 2 interacted with enzyme active sites to abolish endonuclease or cap-binding activity of the polymerase, whereas the compound targeting the PA-PB 1 interaction likely induced configurational changes that impeded polymerase assembly. In addition, the combined treatment of zanamivir with the PA- or PB 2 -targeted compounds exerted synergistic antiviral effects in vitro. This study underscores the medical importance of polymerase functional domains as druggable targets, which {{may be due to the}} fact that these targeted areas are not only highly conserved among virus subtypes but also key to viral fitness. The identified antivirals exhibit substantial promise for clinical applications and provide new additions to the arsenal of drugs that are already used for chemoprophylaxis and treatment of influenza. Importantly, the established screening platforms for PA endonuclease inhibitors, PB 2 cap-binding inhibitors, and PA-PB 1 interaction disrupters should advance the development of a category of anti-influenza drugs that target viral polymerase. published_or_final_versionMicrobiologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
