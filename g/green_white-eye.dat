50|$|The forest white-eye or Cameroon <b>green</b> <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops stenocricotus) is {{a species}} of bird in the Zosteropidae family. It is found from southeastern Nigeria to southwestern Central African Republic and {{northern}} Gabon.|$|E
50|$|There are two subspecies. The western {{nominate}} {{group is}} now treated as separate species; the Orange River white-eye (Z. pallidus) and the Cape white-eye (Z. virens). The latter {{can be further}} divided into two subgroups, the south-western capensis subgroup and the eastern virens subgroup (the so-called <b>green</b> <b>white-eye).</b> All subspecies interbreed where they come into contact (including members of the nominate group {{with members of the}} capensis group of both subgroups in Free State).|$|E
40|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} bioaccumulation of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) in terrestrial ecosystem. Eggs of light-vented bulbul, yellow-bellied prinia, plain prinia, and dark <b>green</b> <b>white-eye</b> were collected from an ecological station in the Pearl River Delta, South China to investigate the occurrence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and several alternative HFRs, including decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), dechlorane plus (DP), hexabromobenzene (HBB), pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB), 1, 2 -bis(2, 4, 6 -tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), pentabromotoluene (PBT), and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrab-romo-p-xylene (pTBX). Concentrations of PBDEs, DBDPE, DP, HBB, PBEB, BTBPE, PBT, and pTBX ranged from 53 - 423, 6. 1 - 609, 4. 6 - 268, not detected (nd) - 10, nd- 1. 4, nd- 1. 7, nd- 7. 5, and nd- 3. 2 ng g(- 1) lw, respectively. Light-vented bulbul exhibited significantly lower levels of PBDEs, DBDPE, DP, and HBB than other three bird species due to its phytophagy and the other three bird species' insectivores. PBDEs were the predominant HFRs in bird eggs, followed by DBDPE and DP. Significant negative relationship between the fraction of anti-DP and DP concentrations was observed in bird eggs, suggesting that DP levels {{play an important role in}} determining the isomeric composition. Anti-Cl- 11 -DP, the dechlorinated products of DP, was found in bird eggs with concentrations ranging from nd to 0. 86 ng g(- 1) lw and its source is worth further research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Various {{species of}} forest birds are found here including; <b>green</b> twinspot, Cape <b>white-eye,</b> {{southern}} boubou, spotted ground-thrush, purple-crested turaco and African paradise-flycatcher. The black sparrowhawk breeds here annually. Another bird that is seldom seen {{but that is}} generally present is buff-spotted flufftail. Unusual sightings of note in recent years include European nightjar, lemon dove, mountain wagtail, black-throated wattle-eye and black cuckoo. The current bird list for Pigeon Valley includes 152 species.|$|R
5000|$|The Japanese <b>white-eye</b> is olive <b>green</b> on its back, from {{anterior}} to posterior, and is pale green on its underside. Its feet, legs, and bill range from black to brown. It has a green forehead {{and a yellow}} throat. The white-eye has rounded wings and a long, slender bill - both of which indicate this bird to be very acrobatic. Its wings are dark brown, but outlined in <b>green.</b> Like other <b>white-eyes,</b> this species exhibits the distinctive white eyering that gives it its name (mejiro also meaning [...] "white eye" [...] in Japanese). Adults range from 4 to 4.5 inches in length, and weigh between 9.75 and 12.75 grams.|$|R
