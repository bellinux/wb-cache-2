5|$|Skorokhod {{function}} {{spaces are}} frequently {{used in the}} theory of stochastic processes because it often assumed that the sample <b>functions</b> of continuous-time stochastic processes belong to a Skorokhod space. Such spaces contain continuous <b>functions,</b> which correspond to sample <b>functions</b> of the Wiener process. But the space also has <b>functions</b> with discontinuities, which means that the sample <b>functions</b> of stochastic processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the real line), are also members of this space.|$|E
5|$|Trying {{to extend}} these <b>functions</b> {{to the general}} case of noninteger powers of complex numbers that are not {{positive}} reals leads to difficulties. Either we define discontinuous <b>functions</b> or multivalued <b>functions.</b> Neither of these options is entirely satisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} <b>functions</b> in {{different}} taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite <b>functions</b> in marine organisms the following: defensive <b>functions</b> of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive <b>functions</b> of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following <b>functions</b> are reasonably well established in the named organisms.|$|E

The cryptographic hash <b>function</b> is generalized to uncertain <b>function</b> which has various specific <b>function</b> forms.
