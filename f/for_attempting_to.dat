5|$|King William {{appointed}} his friend, the Duchess of Northumberland, as Victoria's official governess in 1831, but {{the role}} was mostly ceremonial, and the princess continued {{to depend on}} Lehzen. The Duchess was dismissed in 1837 by Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, <b>for</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> become more influential in Victoria's education. During this time, Lehzen held no official position at court; despite her recently acquired title, her commoner status {{continued to be a}} hindrance.|$|E

5|$|Later {{the same}} year, it was {{revealed}} that large quantities of infant formula had been tainted with melamine, causing 300,000 infants to fall ill and resulting in several deaths. A group of parents of the victims were reportedly detained <b>for</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> draw media attention to their plight. Dozens of lawyers—particularly from the provinces of Hebei, Henan and Shandong—offered pro-bono legal services to victims, but their efforts were obstructed by authorities.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{people were}} arrested for looting or {{attempting}} to loot from evacuated or abandoned homes {{as a result of}} the fire.

5|$|The now-common trope {{of dinosaurs}} {{existing}} in isolated locations in today's world {{appeared at the}} same time, with Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 book The Lost World and the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs as pioneers. The Lost World crossed into the movies in 1925, setting heights for special effects and attempts at scientific accuracy. It is unusual, even today, <b>for</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> portray dinosaurs as something other than monsters that spent their lives in combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} in the semi-finals were Scottish champions Dundee United. The first leg was held at Dundee United's home ground, Tannadice Park. Dundee United won the match 2–0, meaning that Roma had to win by three clear goals to progress to the final.

30|$|For the {{critical}} debate on this point, see Talen (2002, 2003), Thompson-Fawcett and Bond (2003), Richardson and Gordon (2004) and Moore and Wilson (2009). <b>For</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> test certain New Urbanists’ assumptions, see for instance Audirac (1999), Cabrera and Najaran (2013) and Jabareen and Zilberman (2016).|$|R
5|$|Writer Rhianna Pratchett {{has said}} that the game's story {{examined}} why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal choices were very limited. It also looked at reasons people might have <b>for</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> live outside the system and what could result from this. The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between what George Orwell described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.|$|E
5|$|After the conflict, the Pakistani {{government}} {{decided on a}} policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare {{an account of the}} circumstances surrounding the atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions <b>for</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy {{that he is}} dating Squeaky Fromme {{and says}} {{that she is a}} handful. Fromme {{is a member of the}} Manson Family, and was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} <b>for</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975. Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Tottenham's Pat van den Hauwe was cautioned by Holbrook for getting tangled with Arsenal's David Rocastle, in spite Rocastle {{indicating}} that the player used an elbow– a bookable offence. Moments after, Rocastle was shown a yellow card <b>for</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> get his own back on Van Den Hauwe, by tackling the player without intent. Van Den Hauwe was later booked for a wild challenge on Lee Dixon. Arsenal dominated possession during the second half, with Tottenham infrequently troubling their opponent's defence and relying on counterattacks to fashion goal-scoring chances. Smith had a chance saved in the 75th minute by goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, when the ball was back-passed across the penalty area by Steve Sedgley. In the final seconds of the match substitute Andrew Cole, who had replaced Campbell, shot from 20 yards and into the side-netting.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Filipino Associated Broadcasting Company leased its airtime to the Malaysian {{broadcaster}} Media Prima (through {{the local}} subsidiary MPB Primedia) similar to an LMA – with MPB Primedia providing entertainment programming, and ABC handling news programming and operations. Soon afterward, ABC and Media Prima were sued by rival media company GMA <b>for</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> use the partnership to skirt laws requiring domestic ownership of broadcasters. In response, ABC's media relations head Pat Marcelo-Magbanua reiterated that the subsidiary was a Filipino company which was self-registered and Filipino-run. The concerns became moot in 2010, when Media Prima {{announced it would}} divest its ownership in the network to PLDT's broadcasting subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings.|$|E
