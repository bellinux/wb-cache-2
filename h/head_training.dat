50|$|Other {{properties}} {{that are part}} of CFB Esquimalt include the Albert <b>Head</b> <b>training</b> area near Albert Head, Metchosin, located approximately 30 km by road southwest of downtown Victoria. It occupies approximately 88 ha, 4 of which are developed as training facilities. Fort Albert Head was established in the late 1800s along with Fort Rodd Hill and other installations, to provide shore defence for the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Victoria Harbour. The training area is used for Regular and Reserve Force training throughout nine months of the year and is home to the Regional Cadet Instructor School (Pacific) that trains Canadian Forces Cadet Instructors Cadre (CIC) Branch that deliver the cadet program. During the summer months of June, July and August the area houses the Albert Head Air Cadet Summer Training Centre. Canadian Forces Maritime Experimental Test Range at Nanoose Bay is also part of CFB Esquimalt. The facility provides non-explosive technical testing of sonobouys, torpedoes and other equipment. Naval Radio Station Aldergrove in the Fraser Valley houses transmitting and receiving equipment for long distance communications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{high-speed}} <b>train</b> <b>head</b> shape on its aerodynamic performance is very important. In order {{to prove the}} effect of longitudinal profile shape of <b>train</b> <b>head</b> on aerodynamic performance, using CFD method, a two dimension model is developed to investigate outer flow field of high speed <b>train</b> <b>head.</b> Three types of <b>train</b> <b>head</b> profile schemes are calculated. The effects of longitudinal profile shape of high speed <b>train</b> <b>head</b> on aerodynamic performance are analyzed. The results show that different head profile curves cause different surface pressure distributions of body, different airflow velocities of outer flow field and different turbulent distributions. If the longitudinal profile shape of <b>train</b> <b>head</b> is spindle and streamline length of <b>train</b> <b>head</b> is 8 m, aerodynamic drag of the train will well reduce...|$|R
30|$|Based on the train-track {{coupling}} {{dynamics and}} high-speed train aerodynamics, this paper deals with an improved algorithm for fluid-structure interaction of high-speed trains. In the algorithm, the data communication between fluid solver and structure solver is avoided by inserting {{the program of}} train-track coupling dynamics into fluid dynamics program, and the relaxation factor concerning the load boundary of the fluid-structure interface is introduced to improve the fluctuation and convergence of aerodynamic forces. With this method, the fluid-structure dynamics of a high-speed train are simulated {{under the condition that}} the velocity of crosswind is 13.8 m/s and the train speed is 350 km/h. When the relaxation factor equals 0.5, the fluctuation of aerodynamic forces is lower and its convergence is faster than in other cases. The side force and lateral displacement of the <b>head</b> <b>train</b> are compared between off-line simulation and co-simulation. Simulation results show that the fluid-structure interaction has a significant influence on the aerodynamics and attitude of the <b>head</b> <b>train</b> under crosswind conditions. In addition, the security indexes of the <b>head</b> <b>train</b> worsen after the fluid-structure interaction calculation. Therefore, the fluid-structure interaction calculation is necessary for high-speed trains.|$|R

40|$|Farmer {{satisfaction}} with using an irrigation service {{can be used}} as a measure of performance of an irrigation scheme. An investigation was instituted to determine factors that significantly influence the satisfaction status of farmers at the Mooi-River Irrigation Scheme (MRIS) in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. A multinomial Logit regression model was employed to analyse the response of the farmers. It was established that about 57 % of the farmers are satisfied with using the irrigation service, 30 % are not and 13 % are neutral. The majority of farmers, accounting for 85 %, either never went to school or had only primary level schooling and these are mostly women, who own close to 80 % of the plots in the scheme. Statistically significant results show that 6 household-level factors affect the satisfaction of farmers with using an irrigation service, i. e., gender of head of household, level of education attained by the household <b>head,</b> <b>training</b> received in water management, farmers ’ perception of the fairness of water distribution, the number of days in a week that plotholders receive water, and the participation of farmers in the inspection of irrigation infrastructure on the scheme.

40|$|Based on {{analysis}} of credit supply in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Nigeria, it is shown that public credit institutions {{do not have}} sufficient funds {{to meet the demand}} for livestock credit and cannot mobilize savings from their clients or other commercial sources for one reason or another. In addition, available credit does not reach those who need it the most and with whom it could have the greatest impact due to the application of inappropriate screening procedures and criteria to determine creditworthiness. The {{analysis of}} demand based on borrowing and nonborrowing sample households using improved dairy technology, it is shown that not all borrowers borrowed due to liquidity constraint while some borrowers and some nonborrowers had liquidity constraint but did not have access to adequate credit. Logistic regression analysis show that sex and education of the household <b>head,</b> <b>training</b> in dairy, prevalence of outstanding loan and the number of improved cattle on the farm had significant influence on both borrowing and liquidity status of a household, though the degree and direction of influence were not always the same in each study country. Based on the findings it is suggested that combining public and commercial finance could solve the problem of inadequate credit supply while inventory finance to community level input suppliers and service providers might help in getting credit to worthy and needy smallholders at lower cost than providing credit to smallholders directly...|$|E
