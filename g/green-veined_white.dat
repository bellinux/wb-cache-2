25|$|The {{effect of}} mating on female fitness may vary {{depending}} upon the kind of benefit that the females receive from males through of their choices. Direct benefits include nutritional resources {{to be used by}} females, donation of foods to mates, males offering prey to the female, seen in scorpion flies and dance flies. Several orthopteran species, butterflies, flies, and beetle males can donate secretions or nutritional substances to the females which are transferred in the ejaculate or produced by male glands which can contribute to increase female fecundity. In the <b>green-veined</b> <b>white</b> (Pieris napi), a virgin male can transfer an ejaculate containing 14% nitrogen by dry mass. Females utilize the nutrients transferred from the male in order to increase their nutrients. These nutrients essentially contribute to ensure successful egg production. A positive relationship between the amount of ejaculate material received and lifetime reproductive output, as male-transferred material increases female longevity. Male-transferred material also increases female longevity. In some insect species, males can donate some body parts to females such as the leg spurs or the fleshy hindwings of jumped-winged crickets, or they may be completely cannibalized, as occurs in mantis and some dipterous, as well as in some Arachnida scorpions and spider species.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, Leicestershire County Council {{took over}} clay {{workings}} and coal pits in the Sence Valley between Ravenstone, Ibstock and Heather and later transferred {{them to the}} Forestry Commission, which reclaimed the area as the Sence Valley Forest Park. It contains woodland, lakes linked to the River Sence, grassland and a wild flower meadow. An artificial nesting wall for sand martins has also been constructed alongside Horseshoe Lake. In this varied habitat, 150 species of bird have been recorded. The lakes provide habitat for heron, coot, tufted duck, pochard, wigeon and great-crested grebe. Kestrels nest each year and, though less evident in daytime, there are barn owls and short-eared owls. Raptors, marsh, hen and Montague's harrier, osprey, red-footed falcon, merlin, peregrine and buzzard have all been seen. The bird list for the park currently stands at 101 species. Long grassy areas have become home for many wild mammals including field vole, shrew, stoat, rabbit and fox. Water voles are present on streams feeding the river. Otters too are once again using the river. Among the species of bats are pipistrelle, Daubenton's bat and noctule. Insects in summer include gatekeeper butterfly, meadow brown, speckled wood, small skipper, <b>green-veined</b> <b>white,</b> peacock butterfly and small tortoiseshell. Around the lakes, damselflies such as common blue, blue-tailed and azure as well as dragonflies such as the southern hawker and brown hawker are also fairly abundant.|$|E

The present survey was conducted to determine the biology and distribution of butterfly fauna of Hazara University, Garden Campus, Mansehra, Pakistan during March-June 2012. The study area was divided into 3 quadrates, i. e., residential area, administration area and main campus. A total of 170 specimens were collected, 10 species were identified belonging to 3 different families and falling in 8 genera. The species were identified. The painted lady, Cynthia cardui (Linnaeus); blue pansy, Junonia orithya Linnaeus; and plain tiger, Danaus chrysippus (Linnaeus) were belonging to family Nymphalidae. The lime butterfly, Papilio demoleus Linnaeus and com-mon mormon, P. polytes Linnaeus were belonging to family Papilionidae.

40|$|Taxonomic Orders vary {{in their}} degree of {{chromosomal}} conservation with some having high rates of chromosome number turnover despite maintaining some core sets of gene order (e. g.

In contrast, here we report extensive chromosomal rearrangements in the genome of the <b>green-veined</b> <b>white</b> butterfly (Pieris napi, Pieridae, Linnaeus, 1758). This unprecedented reshuffling is cryptic, micro-synteny and chromosome number do not indicate the extensive rearrangement revealed by a chromosome level assembly and high resolution linkage map.

40|$|Visual {{features}} of the wing colour, with special reference to the intensity of UV reflectance of the <b>Green-veined</b> <b>White</b> (Pieris napi) were investigated. Several studies revealed that only females of Pieris napi possess UV reflectance on dorsal wing surface. Based on UV sensitive photography, we analysed correlation between environmental conditions (productivity and climate) and 3 patches on forewing of 347 specimens of P. napi from Palaearctic region. Males significantly differ in level of intensity of UV reflectance from females. UV intensity in females is 25 % higher in comparison with males. This phenomenon is explained by different deposition of wing pterins. Further, environment significantly affects UV intensity on the forewings of females, but not males. Moreover, we accomplished the analysis of fluctuating asymmetry. First we subjected the environmental variables to PCA. In females, the first PCA axis (temperature seasonality, temperature annual range and longitude) significantly correlated with UV intensity. In males, the second PCA axis (latitude and altitude) was significantly correlated with FA.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the white coloration of Pieridae butterflies is a warning signal and therefore all white Pieridae could profit from a mimetic resemblance. We tested whether <b>green-veined</b> <b>white</b> (Pieris napi) and orange-tip (Anthocharis cardamines) butterflies benefit from white coloration. We compared their relative acceptability to wild, adult pied flycatchers (Ficedula hyp-oleuca) by oering live A. cardamines and P. napi together with two non-aposematic butterflies on the tray attached to birds â nesting boxes. Experienced predators equally attacked white and non-white butterflies, and the order of attack among the Pieridae was random. If anything, there was a slight indication that the female A. cardamines was the least favoured prey. Since birds did not avoid white coloration, we compared the palatability of these two species against known palatable and unpalatable butterflies by presenting them to great tits (Parus major). Pieris brassicae, which has been earlier described as unpalatable, was also included in the palatability test. However, there were no significant dierences in the palatability of the butterflies to birds, and even P. brassicae was apparently palatable to the great tits. Our results do not unambiguously support the hypothesis that the white coloration of Pieridae would signal unpalatability. Nevertheless, in our last exper-iment, pied flycatchers often rejected or left untouched free flying P. napi and A. cardamines. This suggests that other features in a more natural situation, such as the agile flight pattern or odours might still make them unprofitable to birds...|$|E
