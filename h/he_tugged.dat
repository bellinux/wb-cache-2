25|$|Led {{from the}} front by Steve Waugh, Australia began the day at a {{precarious}} 291/8 but that {{would prove to be}} the high of the day for India. The 35 yr old Waugh batted well with Gillespie and then Glenn McGrath – and crossed numerous landmarks on the way – as he took Australia to a total of 445. In the process the Australian captain notched up his 25th Test century, crossing Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 24 hundreds at the time. Having never made a Test hundred in India, Waugh was more emotional than normal as <b>he</b> <b>tugged</b> at the red handkerchief in his pocket, took off his helmet and raised his bat to a full house Eden crowd. He also passed Javed Miandad to become the (then) 4th highest run getter in test cricket.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tugged</b> at his neckbands and {{his hand}} fell heavily against the trestle-table.|$|E
60|$|Kipps' face became portentously {{careful and}} <b>he</b> <b>tugged</b> at his moustache, {{such as it}} was, hard.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} should wish," [...] Burton protested mildly, [...] "that {{he was more}} suitably dressed. A plain sailor-suit, or a tweed knickerbocker suit with a flannel collar, {{would be better than}} those velveteen things with that lace abomination. And why is <b>he</b> <b>tugging</b> at your skirt so?" ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{used for}} {{a story in the}} Daily Oklahoman newspaper. Caption: "W. W. Woodworth, Ringling, banker and one of the trustee group which raised the Elmer Morriss fund, chats with Elmer and his wife, Velma, at the gate of the new Morriss home. Meanwhile, <b>he's</b> <b>tugging</b> at the toe of Danny Jay, the Morriss' 6 -month-old son. ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You've got me on {{your own}} ground,' said <b>he,</b> <b>tugging</b> at his {{overcoat}} pocket. He pulled out his copy, with the cable forms--for he had written out his telegram--and put them all into my hand, groaning, 'I pass. If I hadn't come to your cursed country--If I'd sent it off at Southampton--If I ever get you west of the Alleghannies, if----' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{put up the}} gun and saw {{the brown}} fierce face {{at the other end}} of the barrel. <b>He</b> <b>tugged</b> at the trigger, but the face grew larger and fiercer with every stride. Again and again <b>he</b> <b>tugged.</b> A revolver-shot rang out at his elbow, then another one, and he saw a red spot spring out on the Arab's brown breast. But he was still coming on.|$|E
60|$|Bibot {{tried to}} speak; <b>he</b> <b>tugged</b> at {{the collar of}} his ragged shirt; an awful curse escaped him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tugged</b> at {{the ropes}} around his body, {{and after a}} hard {{struggle}} he managed to free his left arm.|$|E
50|$|They {{arrive at}} a long-abandoned {{prospecting}} settlement which is said to contain miles of underground tunnels, some of which lead to the Mexican border {{less than a mile}} away. The four friends climb down into the tunnels, and are observed by a mysterious old man (Steve Railsback) from a short distance away. <b>He</b> <b>tugs</b> on a mysterious amulet hanging from a chain around his neck and pours what appears to be blood on the ground.|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tugged</b> violently at the bell-handle, and {{the rusty}} jangling of a bell sounded {{from a distant}} kitchen. He rang again.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tugged</b> {{till the}} thin hide rope stretched, while Leonard clawed and kicked at the ice with his toes, knees, and {{disengaged}} hand.|$|E
60|$|Segrave's hand wandered {{mechanically}} {{to his own}} neck; <b>he</b> <b>tugged</b> at the fastening of his lace collar, as if, in truth, he were choking.|$|E

5000|$|No one {{except the}} two {{children}} could see the ghost [...] "Nobody". The ghost wore grey Victorian workhouse or street urchin clothes and {{when he wanted to}} [...] "ghost" [...] in or out of sight <b>he</b> would <b>tug</b> on his neck-scarf.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> was <b>tugging</b> to {{withdraw}} the boot, but no skill that he could exercise would move it without tearing. At last she said: 'Don't try any longer. It is not far to the house. I can walk in my stocking.' ...|$|R
60|$|A swift {{lifting of}} his brows {{was his only}} answer. <b>He</b> <b>tugged</b> the cord. From the {{distance}} the peal of the bell reached them faintly.|$|E
60|$|But Wright was crazed by fury. <b>He</b> <b>tugged</b> at his hip, {{his face}} corded with purple welts, malignant, murderous, while {{he got to}} his feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi! hi!" [...] yelled Granbury Lapham, {{in quick}} alarm. [...] "They are running away! Stop them! Whoa! whoa!" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>tugged</b> helplessly at the lines.|$|E
60|$|The Prince, enraged, {{drew his}} sword of adamant, {{and at one}} blow thrust it through the lock, but the door did not open, and the sword was fixed immovably. In vain did <b>he</b> <b>tug</b> and {{struggle}} at it. He could not move it an inch. Hearing greater and wilder cries of derision, he turned towards the crowd and shook his fist at them, {{and then went back}} under the window of the Princess, but she was not visible. He called her again and again, {{at the top of his}} voice, but she did not answer him nor make her appearance. The night was fast coming on, and overcome with sorrow and despair, and weak with hunger, the Prince fell upon the ground.|$|R
60|$|The rope {{was thrown}} to Fred, {{and with a}} great <b>tug</b> <b>he</b> was finally brought out of the ooze.|$|R
60|$|Lewisham's {{face flushed}} irregularly. He did not answer. <b>He</b> scowled and <b>tugged</b> at the still {{by no means}} ample moustache.|$|R
6000|$|They crept on {{against the}} tide, Whitney panting as <b>he</b> <b>tugged</b> at the oars, {{for he had}} enough; and it was with keen {{satisfaction}} that he heard Andrew call out presently: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Becky, it's all done--all {{over but}} the kiss. Don't you {{be afraid of}} that--it ain't {{anything}} at all. Please, Becky." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>tugged</b> at her apron and the hands.|$|E
60|$|With might {{and main}} <b>he</b> <b>tugged</b> at the rope which bound his hands. At first it {{remained}} tight, {{but at last}} it loosened sufficiently {{to allow him to}} slip out his right hand.|$|E
50|$|Then Tom {{is forced}} to carry the heavy load of {{equipment}} to the boat as a punishment, not knowing that Jerry is hiding in the picnic basket. As Tom loads the boat, the owner's sour anger gradually becomes a smile, and the cat is back on his master's good graces. While on the boat, Tom spots Jerry in the basket and uses an air pump to suck him out into the water. In retaliation, Jerry swims under the boat and ties Tom’s fishing hook to the owner's foot before <b>he</b> <b>tugs</b> Tom’s line. Tom, believing he caught the fish, reels in his catch, and making the owner go into the water, only with Tom's joy turns into horror when he sees caught his owner and he once again gets thrashed as Jerry looks on.|$|R
6000|$|... "By Heaven, {{they are}} men on camels!" [...] cried Cochrane, his {{troubles}} all forgotten as he strained {{his eyes to}} catch sight of these new-comers. [...] "I do {{believe that it is}} our own people." [...] In the confusion <b>he</b> had <b>tugged</b> his hands free from the halter which bound them.|$|R
60|$|I think Raja sensed their antagonism, for <b>he</b> kept <b>tugging</b> at his leash and {{growling}} ominously. They {{were a bit}} in awe of him, {{and kept}} at a safe distance. It was evident {{that they could not}} comprehend why it was that this savage brute did not turn upon me and rend me.|$|R
60|$|But Lawson was crazed with fury. <b>He</b> <b>tugged</b> at his hip, {{his face}} corded with purple welts, malignant, murderous. Duane kicked {{the gun out}} of his hand. Lawson got up, raging, and rushed out.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>tugged</b> swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in {{farewell}} and, running {{forward to}} a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: ...|$|E
60|$|Archie {{followed}} the earl's retainer to where, behind his pavilion, the great dog was chained up. He leapt {{to his feet}} with a savage growl on hearing footsteps approaching. His hair bristled and <b>he</b> <b>tugged</b> at his chain.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{in order}} to have a man apply heartily, and pursue earnestly, the {{business}} he is engaged in, there is yet another thing necessary, namely, that he should delight in it: to follow a trade, and not to love and delight in it, is a slavery, a bondage, not a business: the shop is a bridewell, and the warehouse a house of correction to the tradesman, if he does not delight in his trade. While he is bound, as we say, to keep his shop, he is like the galley-slave chained down to the oar; <b>he</b> <b>tugs</b> and labours indeed, and exerts the utmost of his strength, for fear of the strapado, and because he is obliged to do it; but when he is on shore, and is out from the bank, he abhors the labour, and hates to come to it again.|$|R
60|$|He was {{a little}} on edge, that she knew. <b>He</b> gave another <b>tug</b> at the boot, and {{while she was still}} hesitating, he began again.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> swayed, <b>tugging</b> forward. She jerked at him {{till the}} button gave way, {{and then he}} slipped half out of his jacket and, turning round, {{remained}} strangely motionless. His heart seemed to beat in his throat. He choked--tried to speak--could not find any words. He thought with fury: I will kill both of them.|$|R
