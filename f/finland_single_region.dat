Additionally, the minimum relief costs increase from 1190.38 to 1190.39, and this value is 0.5 larger than in the <b>single</b> <b>region.</b> Finally, its generalized emergency costs are all less than the single ones (39.5 [*]>[*] 35.9, 58.6 [*]>[*] 54.6), and the degree of generalized emergency costs’ decrease is more than 3.5.
