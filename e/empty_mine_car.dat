But influence evaluation of <b>empty</b> <b>mine</b> mined-out area factor multitudinous, this paper selected seven factors associated with the system. Based {{on the principle of}} BP neural network, we build a 3 layer BP neural network model suitable for grid {{risk evaluation}}. The BP neural network model was trained by collected samples of <b>empty</b> <b>mine</b> mined-out area and the logical parameters of BP neural network were acquired and tested by the testing samples for accuracy, and finally we proposes preventive measures based on the evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{view of the}} {{problems}} existing in the present transportation ways of coal mine, a kind of new auxiliary haulage system has been designed, which can achieve the going there and back transportation only by using one winch in the multi-slope and undulating roadway. And {{according to the requirements}} of safety production of coal mine, the non-wheeled supply <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> without anti-car device and the safety interlock system of wheeled supply <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> have been designed. Meanwhile, finite element analysis software is adopted to check and analyze the locking pawl strength of the safety interlock system with wheeled supply <b>mine</b> <b>car.</b> The analyzing result shows that the locking pawl can completely stand the impact loading when the <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> sliding down. The haulage costs and the occurrence of security incidents have been reduced when the designed system is applied to coal mine. Engineering practice shows that the good results have been achieved...|$|R

40|$|Muck {{conveyors}} are {{a potential}} source of airborne dust. Muck from the excavated face, which is usually fairly wet when placed on the conveyor, dries out as it travels on the conveyor through the airstream. Water sprays placed at intervals along the conveyor will minimize dust from the conveyor contaminating the airstream. Conveyor transfer and drop points should be enclosed and provided with water sprays. Scraper and spray wash will wash return belts and idlers. 7. 5. 11 Airways, Haulage Ways, <b>Mine</b> <b>Cars</b> and Dumping Stations a) Airways and rail haulage ways Cleaning the walls and floors of airways and rail haulage ways, by periodically washing down or vacuuming, will remove many potential dust sources. Concrete lined openings facilitate cleaning. Residual dust and dirt {{should not be allowed}} to accumulate in the airways and haulage ways as these represent potential dust sources. b) <b>Mine</b> <b>cars</b> Keeping the muck in the <b>mine</b> <b>cars</b> wet reduces the potential for creating dust. Overloading cars must be avoided as it can lead to spillage which then becomes another potential dust source. Washing <b>mine</b> <b>cars</b> regularly will keep them free of dirt and dust, and parking a loaded <b>mine</b> <b>car</b> for a long periods should be avoided as this allows the muck to dry out. If feasible, major route of <b>mine</b> <b>cars</b> should not be along primary intake airways. c) Dumping Stations Subsurface muck car dumping stations represent major potential dust sources. Enclosure and bypass airways can be installed to avoid high velocity air/dust contact. Water spray at dump activated during dumping will wet the muck and suppress dust. Local dust scrubbers located at the dumps will clean dusty air that escapes from the dump station enclosures. Choice of location and equipment for dump stations must prioritize dust control. 7. 5. 12 Leakage and Recirculation of Contaminated Air from Exhaust Ducts Leakage from exhaust ducts containing contaminated air and subsequent recirculation of the leakage contributes to dust problems.

5000|$|Tipples were {{initially}} used with minecarts, also called tubs or tram <b>cars,</b> or <b>mine</b> <b>cars</b> in the U.S. These were small hopper cars {{that carried the}} product on a mine railway out of the mine.

At some facilities, each car was tipped over manually—thus the name, [...] "tipple".
