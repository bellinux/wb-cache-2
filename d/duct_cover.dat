30|$|The {{clinical}} features of patients are also {{crucial for the}} diagnostic approach. For instance, PASH is commonly encountered in premenopausal women (Ferreira et al. 2008; Wieman et al. 2008). Hormonal irregularities, gynecomastia (in males), the use of oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy have been considered {{to play a role}} in its etiology (Virk and Khan 2010). PASH is a benign lesion that consists of stromal myofibroblastic cells and anastomosing vascular <b>ducts</b> <b>covered</b> with spindle cells (Lakhani et al. 2012). Hemangioma and low-grade AS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of PASH. In cases of hemangiomas, endothelial cells that cover the cleft-like vascular ducts are positive for CK and CD 31. In low-grade AS, an infiltrative pattern is seen, and merging vascular <b>ducts</b> are <b>covered</b> with atypical endothelial cells that have hyper chromatic nuclei. PASH is a benign lesion, and does not contain atypia; it is possible to treat PASH with wide local excision, and CD 34 positivity has diagnostic features. Myofibroblastic cells are very dense in some cases, and form bands and fascicles. It is possible to confuse these cases with myofibroblastoma. In addition, it should be discriminated from low-grade AS. In cases of AS, true vascular <b>ducts</b> are <b>covered</b> with malignant endothelial cells (Rosen 2001).|$|R

40|$|A Local Island Divertor (LID) {{has been}} {{proposed}} to enhance energy confinement through neutral particle control. For {{the case of the}} Large Helical Device (LHD), the separatrix of an m/n = 1 / 1 magnetic island, formed at the edge region, will be utilized as a divertor configuration. The divertor head is inserted in the island, and the island separatrix provides connection between the edge plasma region surrounding the core plasma and the back plate of the divertor head through the field lines. The particle flux and associated heat flux from the core plasma strike the back plate of the divertor head, and thus particle recycling is localized in this region. A pumping <b>duct</b> <b>covers</b> the divertor head to form a closed divertor system for efficient particle exhaust. The advantages of the LID are ease of hydrogen pumping because of the localized particle recycling and avoidance of the high heat load that would be localized on {{the leading edge of the}} divertor head. With efficient pumping, the neutral pressure in the edge plasma region will be reduced, and hence the edge plasma temperature will be higher, hopefully leading to a better core confinement region. A LID configuration experiment was done on the Compact Helical System (CHS) to confirm the effect of the LID. The typical effects of the LID configuration on the core plasma are reduction of the line averaged density to a half, and small or no reduction of the stored energy.

In this study, we propose a new method for gaining acoustic access to the ureters and extrahepatic bile duct to help determine the nature of obstruction to these structures when conventional transabdominal ultrasound fails. Methods: The normal saline retention enema method, that is, using normal saline-filled colons to gain acoustic access to the bilateral ureters and extrahepatic bile duct and detecting the lesions with transabdominal ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, was applied to 777 patients with obstructive lesions, including 603 with hydroureter and 174 with dilated common bile duct, which were not visualized by conventional ultrasonography.

40|$|Developed and {{developing}} countries need electricity, and this usage is increasing everyday. This constant increase cannot {{be satisfied with the}} current ways of electricity generation that have shown themselves to be out of phase with environmental concerns. Oceans yield great amount of energy that could be converted into electricity and the current research deals with one portion of ocean energy, wave energy. The wave energy converter studied in this thesis is a bottom-mounted, liquid-filled rectangular <b>duct,</b> <b>covered</b> with a rubber membrane and aligned head to the waves propagation direction. Two types of membrane were tested. The behaviour of this device beneath waves was investigated with two configurations: one with both its ends closed, the other one with a power take-off connected at its stern. The pressure at both ends was characterised by means of pressure transducers and the pressure inside the duct by means of laser sensors measuring the membrane displacement. Results from experiments carried out on the closed version of the duct pointed out a resonant behaviour of the system for wave frequencies at which bulges, propagating in the rubber membrane, could travel an integer number of times along the ductâs length. This resonance was characterised by pressure magnitudes at the stern up to 2. 8 times that acting on the membrane from the incident wave. Moreover, the membrane displacement was for the first time mapped and the profile obtained showed characteristic nodes and antinodes. The performance of this device in harnessing wave power was evaluated by connecting a linear dashpot at its stern. Capture widths of up to 2. 2 times the device width were obtained and the bandwidth of maximum power capture not limited to a single frequency. The pressure behaviour in both configurations was explained with a one dimensional theory of bulges propagating in distensible tubes with good agreement for the thicker tested membrane. On the contrary, {{this was not the case}} for the thinner membrane, suggesting that this model could not be used for configurations where bulge wavelengths are much shorter than that of the incoming wave...|$|R

The resonator {{takes the form}} of a side-branch cavity which is attached to a rigid <b>duct</b> and <b>covered</b> by a pre-stretched Dielectric Elastomer (DE) in the neck area. A three-dimensional, analytical model based on the sub-structuring approach is developed to characterize the complex structure-acoustic coupling between the DE membrane and its surrounding acoustic media. We show that such resonator provides sound attenuation in the medium frequency range mainly by means of sound reflection, as a result of the membrane vibration. The prediction accuracy of the proposed model is validated against experimental test. The pre-stretched DE membrane with fixed edges responds to applied voltage change with a varying inner stress and, by the same token, its natural frequency and vibrational response can be tuned to suit particular frequencies of interest. The peaks in the transmission loss (TL) curves can be shifted towards lower frequencies when the voltage applied to the DE membrane is increased. Through simulations on the effect of increasing the voltage level, the TL shifting mechanism and its possible tuning range are analyzed. This paves the way for applying such resonator device for adaptive-passive noise control. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

The governing conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy were solved using a finite volume method, {{and the range of}} the Prandtl number was from 7 to 15000. The present numerical results of local Nusselt numbers for oil showed 70 - 80 % enhancement over those of a constant property fluid and 40 - 50 % enhancement over water, and gave excellent agreement with recent experimental results [Int.

The distribution of myoepithelial cells expressing podoplanin and Î±-SMA was examined by immunofluorescent staining, and the localization of reaction products of anti-podoplanin antibody was investigated by pre-embedded immunoelectron microscopic method. In immunohistochemistry, the surfaces of both the mucous acini terminal portion and <b>ducts</b> were <b>covered</b> by a number of extensive myoepithelial cellular processes expressing podoplanin, and the immunostaining level with anti-podoplanin antibody to myoepithelial cells completely coincided with the immunostaining level with anti-Î±-SMA antibody.

40|$|The angularis oris gland, an avian {{salivary gland}} that lies beneath the {{zygomatic}} arch, was {{studied in the}} house sparrow by means of light and electron microscopy. The gland consists of lobules composed of epithelial tubules and folds on a delicate connective tissue framework. The lobules are drained by large channels to form an intraglandular duct, which becomes the main extraglandular duct. The tubules, folds, and all <b>ducts</b> are <b>covered</b> by pseudostratified epithelium that shows progressive changes from the blind ends of tubules to the duct system. At the closed end of the tubules, the tall cells contain an aggregation of closely packed mucous droplets; their mitochondria are long and slender.

40|$|Two {{mathematical}} {{models were}} developed to study the air distribution normal to and along an aeration duct. The airflow distribution normal to the duct was analyzed using a finite element model. Example simulations of airflow in grain piles were performed on triangular and trapezoidal pile cross sections because of their widespread use in flat storage. The equivalent radial grain depth representative of the triangular pile cross section was determined. ^ A model to predict the air distribution along the aeration duct was developed from basic principles of fluid mechanics and from experimental data for static pressure regain coefficients reported in the literature. The model handles both negative and positive pressure systems. ^ Experimental tests on a <b>duct</b> <b>covered</b> with grain were performed to verify the model for static pressure distribution along an aeration duct. ^ The predicted results using the same input data of the experimental test agreed favorably with the experimental results for both negative and positive pressure systems. ^ The effects of the various duct parameters on the uniformity of air discharge along grain aeration ducts were studied. ^ The performed analyses indicate that {{the problems of the}} static pressure distribution along aeration ducts operated under positive or negative pressure should be looked at as two different mathematical problems. This is due to the effect of the air intake or discharge on the velocity distribution across the duct diameter. ^ The total airflow delivered in a system is influenced by the duct length, duct diameter, air velocity in the duct, and grain depth. Increasing the air velocity at the duct entrance increases the airflow but contributes to the deterioration of the uniformity of air discharge along an aeration duct. The effect of the air velocity in the duct on the uniformity of air discharge is more pronounced on the negative pressure system than on the positive pressure one. ^ To deliver equal volumes of air, a large diameter duct is preferred to a small diameter one with regard to air discharge uniformity and power requirement. ^ Increasing the duct length while keeping the air delivered constant results in low airflow rate per metric ton of grain. It also results in deterioration of air distribution along a perforated duct operated under negative pressure. The air distribution along a duct operated under positive pressure may improve depending on the relative magnitudes of the friction loss and the static pressure regain. However, the airflow rate per ton of grain decreases with increase of duct length. ^ An increase in wall roughness results in deterioration of uniformity of air discharge along a duct operated under negative pressure. It slightly improves the air discharge distribution along a duct operated under positive pressure. Excessive increase in wall roughness reverses the problem of the air distribution without solving it, the end result being waste of energy. The increase in roughness of both duct wall and the perforations increases the static pressure requirement sharply. ^ Increasing the grain depth improves the air discharge uniformity for both negative and positive pressure systems. Delivering the recommended average airflow rate may be the limiting factor for increasing the grain depth beyond a certain depth using a particular duct diameter. ^ The main concern when operating positive or negative pressure systems should be the total airflow delivered together with the uniformity of air discharge and the power requirement. ^ Comparing the positive and negative pressure systems, it has been concluded that the positive pressure system gives better air uniformity at lower power requirement, assuming all other variables are the same. ...|$|R

40|$|Usually for {{verification}} of compliance, the fatigue resistance of prestressing steel is determined from tests of naked specimens at 2 million cycles. However, for design the fatigue resistance of tendons cast into concrete, is substantially lower. To verify {{the resistance of}} existing older prestressed concrete bridges and {{for the design of}} new bridges, S-N curves of prestressing steel in curved steel ducts embedded into concrete are needed. In bridges, the load cycles due to heavy vehicles may rise up to about 10 E 8 cycles or even more. Previous tests with curved tendons in steel <b>ducts</b> primarily <b>cover</b> a range of up to about 20 million cycles. Thereby no real endurance strength has been estimated jet. Hence the S-N curves given in Eurocode 2 and Model Code 2010 are defined hypothetically for a range from 10 ^ 6 up to 10 ^ 8 and are not based on test results. The reason is that experimental investigations in a range up to 10 8 cycles are very expensive and also demand a very long duration. Essential progress results from the development of an optimized test setup that allows a frequency of 10 Hz for the applied load cycles. Therewith, the experimental investigations up to 10 ^ 8 cycles have been done by means of prestressed concrete beams with embedded curved tendons in steel ducts.

40|$|The project {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the potential of a large scale, inexpensive, solar thermal facade in the UK climate. Profiled steel cladding was utilised as a solar absorber, with the channels used to form a series of parallel <b>ducts</b> when <b>covered</b> by a glass surface. Air was considered to flow through the ducts in two modes forced or buoyant convection. The factors affecting air flow were investigated in a laboratory experiment. The factors affecting solar heat transfer to the air were investigated using prototypes in field conditions. Three models for forced convection and two for buoyant were found in the literature. These were developed and compared against the experimental results to establish appropriate design models. The design models were used to optimise the duct geometry for three desirable outputs mass flow, temperature output or power output. Optimal duct geometry was found to depend on the flow mode assumed. In addition, the optimal geometry also depended on the required output. Thus it was determined that an optimal hybrid system which could switch modes as required, could not be configured the function and utility of the system must be decided at the design stage and not reconfigured afterwards. The annual performance of a building-scale south facing facade fitted with such a system optimised for power output was modelled for forced and buoyant convection modes. It was found that both flow modes had the potential to generate significant amounts of heat energy which could be used, for instance, to preheat ventilation air. The buoyant system also showed the potential for the generation of significant natural ventilation. However the forced convection system would have the advantage of being more controllable, have a better seasonal distribution of performance and have a greater potential for higher air exit temperatures to be achieved in winter.

40|$|A {{spectral}} method of Chebyshev collocation with domain decomposition is introduced for linear interaction between sound and structure in a duct lined with flexible walls backed by cavities {{with or without}} a porous material. The spectral convergence is validated by a one-dimensional problem with a closed-form analytical solution, and is then extended to the two-dimensional configuration and compared favorably against a previous method based on the Fourier-Galerkin procedure and a finite element modeling. The nonlocal, exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary condition is embedded in the domain decomposition scheme without imposing extra computational burden. The scheme is applied to the problem of high-frequency sound absorption by duct lining, which is normally ineffective when the wavelength is comparable with or shorter than the duct height. When a tensioned membrane covers the lining, however, it scatters the incident plane wave into higher-order modes, which then penetrate the duct lining more easily and get dissipated. For the frequency range of f= 0. 3 - 3 studied here, f= 0. 5 being the first cut-on frequency of the central <b>duct,</b> the membrane <b>cover</b> is found to offer an additional 0. 9 dB attenuation per unit axial distance equal to half of the duct height.

Circular transverse ribs on the absorber plate are placed as usual. The analysis {{is done to}} investigate the effect of inserting additional vortex generator on the heat transfer and flow friction characteristics inside the solar air heater <b>duct.</b> This investigation <b>covers</b> relative roughness pitch {{in the range of}} 10 â¤ P/e â¤ 25 and relevant Reynolds numbers in the range of 3800 â¤ Re â¤ 18000. Relative roughness height (e/D) is kept constant as 0. 03 for analysis. The turbulence created due to additional circular vortex generator increases the heat transfer rate {{and at the same time}} there is also increase in friction factor values. For combined arrangement of ribs and vortex generator, maximum Nusselt number is found to be 2. 05 times that of the smooth duct. The enhancement in Nusselt number with ribs and additional vortex generator is found to be 1. 06 times that of duct using ribs alone. The maximum increase in friction factor with ribs and circular vortex generator is found to be 2. 91 times that of the smooth duct. Friction factor in a combined arrangement is 1. 114 times that in a duct with ribs alone on the absorber plate.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Standards requirements for mechanical systems is to reduce energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. These goals are achieved by: 1. Maximizing equipment efficiency, both at design conditions and during part load operation 2. Minimizing distribution losses of heating and cooling energy 3. Optimizing system control to minimize unnecessary operation and simultaneous use of heating and cooling energy The Standards also {{recognize the importance of}} indoor air quality for occupant comfort and health. To this end, the Standards incorporate requirements for outdoor air ventilation that must be met during all operating conditions. This chapter summarizes the requirements for space conditioning, ventilating, and service water heating systems. It is organized in 11 sections including this overview. The other sections are as follows: Section 4. 2 Equipment Requirements addresses the requirements for HVAC and service water heating equipment efficiency and equipment mounted controls.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the liver of Yellow tail, Seriola quinqueradiata was studied by the anatomical and histological methods in the research of its pathological histology. Physiologically speaking, the liver is composed of many ducts and vessels that work together to perform its function. These <b>ducts</b> and vessels <b>cover</b> the liver complicatedly, fulfilling the functions of anabolism, catabolism and secretion. Commonly the liver has right and left lobes embracing the stomach and gathering many blood vessels on their visceral side. On these blood vessels, three afferent veins of the liver arising {{from each of the}} different organs can be seen with the naked eye. And in the liver, major branched capillaries can be seen by the anatomical and histological methods. The venous blood, pouring into the vena centralis and being carried in the hepatic veins, flows through the sinusoids radiately surrounding these capillaries. But the hepatic proper arteries, which lead to the liver through its hilums, go forward into the walls of portal vein and hepatic vein. On the ground plan of its secretory duct, the extrahepatic bile duct consists of a long gall bladder which is on the intestine, and a cystic duct having the large folds of mucous membrane, i, e. "spiral valves of Heister", and a common bile duct whose tract wall of the opening side becomes thick as ampulla. On the other hand, branched intrahepatic bile ducts which independently run through the liver are collected to hepatic ducts. And those mucous membranes are the layer of cylindrical cells and they are surrounded by the connective tissue. Besides, the other secretory organ is pancreas, especially its exocrine organs scatter along the connective tissue of intrahepatic portal veins in the form of smaller and larger nodules of the pancreatic tissue. But the endocrine organ is in the interstitial connective tissue of the hilum of right lobeï»¿ããªã®çççµç¹å­¦çç ç©¶ã®åºç¤ã¨ãã¦ãã®èèæ§é ãè§£åå­¦çã«ãããã¯çµç¹å­¦çã«è¿½ç©¶ãã. æ¬ç ç©¶ã§ã¯ã²ã¨ã¾ã¥ãã®æ¦è¦³çãªæ§é ã«ã¤ãã¦å ±åãã¦ãã. 1. èèã¯é¡èã«å·¦å³ã®åèã«åããã¦ããããç­ãèé¨ããã ãããã«ãã¦ãã. ã¾ããã®åèããã«ã¯å¤æ°ã®èç®¡ãéä¸­ãã¦ããã®ãã¿ããã. 2. èèã«é²å¥ããéèç®¡ã¯ãã®ä¸»ãªãã®ã ãã§ã 3 ç®æèªãããããããç°ã£ãå¨å®ããéèè¡ãéä¸­ãã¦ãã. 3. èèåã«å°ãããééèè¡ã¯èèã®åæ¹ä¸­å¤®ä¸ã«ãã 2 ç®ã®èéèãçµç±ãã¦ç´ã¡ã«éèç«ã«æåºããã¦ãã. 4. åèã¯åºæèåèã§ããèèåã«é²å¥ããééèã«ä»éãã¦é²å¥ãã¦ããããããã®èéãçµç±ãã¦ãã. ã¾ãèéèã«ãåºæåèã®åå¸ãã¿ããã. 5. èå¤èç®¡ã«ã¯ç¹å¾´çã«é·ãèå¢ã¨å³èåã³ä¸­å¤®é¨ã®èåèç®¡ãéåããèç®¡ããã³ãããåæµããèå¢ç®¡ããã«ã¯ããã¨æ¥å±ãã¦ããç·èç®¡ã¨ããã. ã¾ãç·èç®¡ã®ä¸é¨ã¯ç¶ç¶ã¨ãªãç­èå±¤ãçºéãã¦ããç·èç®¡ã®è¸éå£é¨ã®å°å­ã¨ã¨ãã«èæ±ã®è¸ååæ³ãã¤ããã©ã£ã¦ãã. 6. å³èã«ãããä¸»èéä»è¿ã«ã¯èµèãä»çãã¦ãããããã¯å¤§é¨åååæ³ç³»ã§å¤éã®èèªçãå«ãéè³ªã«ã¨ãã¾ããã¦ãã. ã¾ã,å¤åæ³é¨ã¯çµç¹å­¦çã«è¦ã¦å³èåã³å·¦èã®ä¸»èéããé²å¥ããééèã®ç®¡å£ã®ã¨ããã©ããã§åæ£çã«ã¿ã¨ãããã. 7. çµç¹å­¦çã«è¦ãã¨,èåééèã¯æ¬¡ç¬¬ã«åæãæ¯ç´°ç®¡ã¯ãããã¨ãã¾ãæ´æ§è¡ç®¡ã«åæ£çã«éèè¡ãæ³¨ãã§ãã. ããã«èéèç³»ã®å°è¡ç®¡ã¯ãã®ããã«åæ£ãããè¡æ¶²ããªãã¨ãªãéä¸­ãã¦ãã. ãããã£ã¦ããç¥ããã¦ããèå°èã«ãããæ´æ§è¡ç®¡ã®æ¨¡æ§ã¯ãããééèæ¯ç´°ç®¡ãä¸­å¿ã¨ãã¦ããããã¦ãã,èå°èã®å½¢æãå¤å¥ãããã¨ã¯ãã¤ããã. 8. èåèç®¡ã¯çµåçµç¹ããã®å¤å¨ãã¨ãããã¿åå±¤ã«ã¯åæ±ä¸ç®ç´°èãç«æ¹ä¸ç®ç´°èãä¸¦ãã§ãã. ã¾ãèç®¡ã®æ§é ãããã«æºãã¦ãã. 9. èå¢ç®¡ã¯ããã«ãã®å¤å´ã«ç­ç·ç¶­å±¤ãããåå±¤ã®ç²èå±¤ã¯ãã®å¤å´ã®çµåç·ç¶­å±¤ã¨ã¨ãã«é«çºå£ãã¤ãã£ã¦ãã¤ã¹ãã«å¼ãå½¢æãã¦ãã. ç·èç®¡ãçµç¹çã«ã¯èå¢ç®¡ã¨ä¼¼ã¦ãããç²èå±¤ã¯æ¯è¼çå¹³æ»ã§ãã. ã¾ã,ããã«é²å¥ããèç®¡ã¯ç²èå±¤ã¨ç­å±¤ã¨ã«ã¯ãã¾ãçµåç·ç¶­å±¤ã®éãéã£ã¦åå±¤ã«éå£ãã¦ãããã®éå£é¨ã¯å¼ã®ããã«ãªã£ã¦ãã. 10. èµèã®å¤åæ³é¨ã¯èç¶èºã«å±ãç´°èã¯éä½å½¢ããªããã®èªç±é¢ã«é¢ããç´°èè³ªåã«ã¯å¥½é¸æ§ã®å°é¡ç²ãã¿ããã...|$|R
