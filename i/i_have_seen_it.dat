25|$|Titus Andronicus is by {{no means}} the most brutal of Shakespeare's plays. More people die in Richard III. King Lear is a much more cruel play. In the whole Shakespearean {{repertory}} I can find no scene so revolting as Cordelia's death. In reading, the cruelties of Titus can seem ridiculous. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> on the stage and found it a moving experience. Why? In watching Titus Andronicus we come to understand – perhaps more than by looking at any other Shakespeare play – the nature of his genius: he gave an inner awareness to passions; cruelty ceased to be merely physical. Shakespeare discovered the moral hell. He discovered heaven as well. But he remained on earth.|$|E
500|$|Much {{criticism}} was leveled against the ambiguous ending. Tim Roth, who portrayed General Thade, said [...] "I cannot explain that ending. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> twice and I don't understand anything." [...] Helena Bonham Carter, who played Ari, said, [...] "I thought it made sense, kind of. I don't understand why everyone went, 'Huh?' It's all {{a time warp}} thing. He's gone back and he realizes Thade's beat him there." [...] Although the ending was ambiguous, it was closer to {{the ending of the}} actual Pierre Boulle book than was the ending of the 1968 Charlton Heston movie version. In the first of two twist endings of the Pierre Boulle book, the astronaut escapes back to planet Earth, only to be greeted by a gorilla in a jeep on the landing strip. Burton claimed the ending was not supposed to make any sense, but {{it was more of a}} cliffhanger to be explained in a possible sequel. [...] "It was a reasonable cliffhanger that could be used in case Fox or another filmmaker wanted to do another movie," [...] he explained.|$|E
500|$|Playwright Alan Bennett was {{particularly}} repulsed by Witchfinder. In his regular column in The Listener, published eight {{days after the}} film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be [...] "punctuated by belly laughs" [...] and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as [...] "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>It</b> was a degrading experience by which I mean {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such– and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. I wish I could have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that Witchfinder General works as intended." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu asked eight Tamil film {{directors}} to list their all-time favourite Tamil films; twoJ. Mahendran and K. Balachandernamed Chandralekha. Mahendran said, [...] "If anybody tries to remake this black-and-white film, {{they will make}} a mockery of it." [...] According to Balachander, [...] "Just like Sivaji today, people talked about Chandralekha in the past. Produced {{at a cost of}} 30 lakhs ( [...] , a huge sum at that time), it has grand sets. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> 12 times." [...] In December 2008, Muthiah said: [...] "Given how spectacular it wasand the appreciation lavished on it from 1948 till well into the 1950s, which is when I caught up with itI'm sure that if re-released, it would do better at the box office than most Tamil films today." [...] In a 2011 interview with Indo-Asian News Service (IANS), South Indian Bollywood actor Vyjayanthimala said that although people consider that she [...] "paved the way" [...] for other South Indian female actors in Hindi cinema, [...] "the person who really opened the doors was S. S. Vasan ... When [...] released, it took the North by storm because by then they haven't seen that kind of lavish sets, costumes and splendour. So Vasan was the person who opened the door for Hindi films in the South." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{started the}} 2003–04 season at Rochdale, making 16 {{appearances}} and scoring five goals in League Two. Rochdale's new manager Steve Parkin criticised McEvilly's fitness level {{to play and}} had described him as [...] "too heavy", and that he needed [...] "to get his physique down to an acceptable weight where he can get around the pitch". Conference National club Accrington Stanley signed McEvilly on a one-month loan in January 2004, making his debut in their 3–0 home win against Tamworth on 20 January. Despite playing out of position in wide right, McEvilly commented; [...] "I was playing out of position but it was okay". He went on to describe the drop in level he said; [...] "I have never played in the Conference but, from what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>it</b> is no different to Division Three." [...] After a month at Accrington and making three appearances scoring one goal, his loan was extended in February for a further month, with manager John Coleman praising him as [...] "a great acquisition to the squad". McEvilly went on to make a further three appearances, scoring once more before returning to Rochdale. On his return to Rochdale, he scored a further one goal in 14 appearances. At {{the end of the}} season, McEvilly was released by Rochdale on 10 May, signing a dater for Accrington Stanley on a permanent basis after a previous loan spell. On 13 November 2004, McEvilly scored a hat-trick in Accrington's 5–0 home victory over Northwich Victoria. During the 2004–05 season he made 39 appearances in the Conference National, scoring 15 goals.|$|E
500|$|Still, {{the film}} {{received}} mixed praise from trade publications. The Mirror commended the film for the clever adaptation which preserved coherency in the story, the good acting and adequate costuming despite a few {{flaws in the}} production. Among the errors highlighted by the Mirror was Eliza's ice scene and another scene where the black actors wore inaccurate attire such as a laborer who wore a fine shirt and tie. The Morning Telegraph reviewer did not care for the production much, finding issues with the adaptation, the acting and the scenes. The Moving Picture News was more positive in its review, praising the photography and the sensible adaptation of the book to the film format. Three different reviews in The Moving Picture World were published, each of which were positive. In contrast to the fault found in the Mirror, one of the reviewers specifically praised the ice scene by stating, [...] "This {{part of the picture}} seems to have been conceived and carried out with extraordinary realism. You see the snow falling, the ice floes cracking and moving, you felt the danger that the woman and child were running as they made their escape across the ice, pursued by their remorseless enemy through the blinding snowstorm. This is one of the finest effects I have seen on the moving picture screen, and the whole story, so far as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it,</b> is worked out with wonderful realism, effect and verisimilitude. It's as good a rendering of the subject as I have ever seen, and I have seen Uncle Tom's Cabin played several times." [...] The Leavenworth Times of Leavenworth, Kansas had an article reviewing the production and offered much praise for adaptation.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Screams of Abel webzine, former Antestor member Morten Mageroy reacted with caution to the proliferation of unblack bands: [...] "I really hope that people (who play Christian black metal) {{know what they are}} doing. I know this sounds very rough, but I have seen people being pulled into something they do not know. I am not saying that I know that these musicians are going to mess their lives up, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> happen to some people and it frightens me very much." [...] Mageroy, however, defends the unblack metal bands' intentions: [...] "A lot of Christian bands have done amazing things being led by God. I know that God is using many types of communication, and it is important that Christians is [...] present in every field, in every genre, privately and in work. God might just as well use heavy metal to bring salvation to people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Johan Derksen {{claimed in}} VI that Cambuur had paid {{a large sum}} of money to keep Oeki Hoekema from being suspended. According to Derksen Vlaardingen player and chief witness of the case Herman den Haag had {{received}} a few banknotes for the trouble {{out of the hands}} of a Cambuur official whilst on the toilet. De Volkskrant wanted to get to the bottom of it and called KNVB official Van Zon, who stated he had laughed very hard when he heard the claims. [...] "Money handed out on the toilet? How did he come up with that? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> with my own eyes: the Cambuur representative gave the cash to the witnesses. No, not on the toilet but in public in the bar of our restaurant. It wasn't much money either, If I recall correctly it was fl. 50. Those few ten-guilder notes aren't even enough to cover the witnesses' expenses, since all the witnesses had to travel from Rotterdam to here. The KNVB pays fl. 0.35 per kilometre." [...] "Quite a crappy story indeed, Derksen wrote, but then again, that's what we're accustomed to. You wanna know who were present in court at the time? Me, another journalist and a man with a tape recorder. Derksen wasn't there. Probably on the toilet." ...|$|E
