To prevent these injuries, prophylactic devices are commonly worn during recreation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the peak inversion angle amongst four different ankle prophylactic devices. Participants had 3 D ankle kinematics recorded during sudden inversion with four prophylactic devices (Ankle Roll Guard, <b>External</b> <b>Brace,</b> Taped Ankle, and Control). For the sudden inversion, participants stood on the trap doors of a wooden platform, which could be randomly released to rotate the ankle inward 30 °. Average peak ankle inversion was calculated from five trials that were recorded with each condition and submitted to statistical analysis. The research is ongoing, but expect all prophylactic devices to reduce peak ankle inversion when compared to control condition. However, we expect no significant difference in the peak inversion between the three prophylactic devices. The prophylactic devices appear to prevent excessive ankle inversion, but further research is needed to determine if they effect physical performance and mobility...|$|E

Seismic response of structure in terms of base shear and roof displacement corresponding to performance point were evaluated using nonlinear static analysis and the results are compared.

The technical details of surgical stabilization are described, and the different types of stainless steel struts are shown. Type I was originally used either as an intramedullary nail or as an <b>external</b> <b>brace.</b> Types II and III were designed for external fixation of the strut to the rib. Treatment of 29 patients with severe flail chest, classified into four groups is shown: group I was treated by IPPR, group II by IPPR plus surgical stabilization, group III by surgical stabilization only, and group IV by surgical stabilization after exploratory thoracotomy. The clinical results are discussed. We conclude that surgical stabilization of the paradoxial movement of the chest wall can avoid the use of the respirator or at least reduce the interval of IPPR to a short period during the initial recovery from trauma. Using type III struts, we have obtained stabilization of the flail chest in all cases even in patients with severe anterior paradoxical movement.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. A case report. OBJECTIVE. To {{report the}} {{successful}} nonoperative management {{of a patient}} with progressive ankylosing spondylitis who sustained a three-column flexion-distraction injury of the upper thoracic spine with an intact sternal-rib complex, thereby emphasizing the existence and clinical relevance of the fourth-column concept in such patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Three-column injuries of the cervical and lumbar spine are typically unstable and require surgical stabilization. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis are at an increase risk to sustain three-column injuries of the spine due to their progressive inflammatory disease, a state that renders the spine brittle and alters its biomechanical function. A fourth-column model of the thoracic spine has been proposed and incorporates the sternal-rib complex; however, such a model has rarely been addressed in the literature and its role regarding three-column upper thoracic spine injury with an intact sternal-rib complex in patients with ankylosing spondylitis is unknown. METHODS. A 68 -year-old white man with ankylosing spondylitis and Pickwickian body habitus sustained a three-column flexion-distraction injury at T 5 following a ground-level fall. The patient complained of midthoracic back pain; however, he was neurologically intact and ambulated without aids. RESULTS. Because of the patient's numerous active medical issues that substantially increased his perioperative risks combined with symptomatic improvement of his pain, the patient refused surgical stabilization. In addition, because of the patient's body habitus and pulmonary issues, <b>external</b> <b>brace</b> immobilization was not tolerated. At 17 months of follow-up, the patient remained neurologically intact, ambulated well, his midthoracic back pain had subsided, and no progressive kyphosis was noted. CONCLUSIONS. This case confirms the existence and clinical relevance of the fourth column of the thoracic spine {{and its role in}} providing added spinal stability in the patient with ankylosing spondylitis. As such, it is still possible to achieve a favorable clinical outcome in a select subpopulation of patients with ankylosing spondylitis that sustain three-column flexion-distraction injuries who are neurologically intact and are not candidates for surgical stabilization. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

50|$|In general, bracing {{allows a}} stronger, lighter {{structure}} than {{one which is}} unbraced, but <b>external</b> <b>bracing</b> in particular adds drag which slows down the aircraft and raises considerably more design issues than internal bracing.

The first version, the Ba.33 Serie 1, was a two-seat low-wing monoplane with <b>external</b> <b>bracing</b> between the wings and the fuselage. It was powered by an 89-kilowatt (120-horsepower) de Havilland Gipsy III four-cylinder air-cooled inline engine.

50|$|Consolidated's XP3Y-1 design (company Model 28) had a {{parasol wing}} with <b>external</b> <b>bracing</b> struts, {{mounted on a}} pylon over the fuselage.

The two-step hull design {{was similar to that}} of the P2Y, but the Model 28 had a cantilever cruciform tail unit instead of a strut-braced twin tail. Cleaner aerodynamics gave the Model 28 better performance than earlier designs.|$|R
50|$|Often, {{providing}} sufficient internal bracing {{would make}} a design too heavy, {{so in order to}} make the airframe both light and strong the bracing is fitted externally. This was common in early aircraft due to the limited engine power available and the need for light weight in order to fly at all. As engine powers rose steadily through the 1920s and 30s, much heavier airframes became practicable and most designers abandoned <b>external</b> <b>bracing</b> in order to allow for increased speed.|$|R
5000|$|Amongst the {{highlights}} of his career were the Junkers J 1 of 1915, the world's first practical all-metal aircraft, incorporating a cantilever wing design with virtually no <b>external</b> <b>bracing,</b> the Junkers F 13 of 1919 (the world's first all-metal passenger aircraft), the Junkers W 33 (which made the first successful heavier-than-air east-to-west crossing of the Atlantic Ocean), the Junkers G 38 [...] "flying wing", and the Junkers Ju 52, affectionately nicknamed [...] "Tante Ju", {{one of the most}} famous airliners of the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|Early {{aeroplane}} engines {{had little}} power and light weight was very important. Also, early aerofoil sections were very thin, {{and could not}} have strong frame installed within. So until the 1930s most wings were too light weight to have enough strength and <b>external</b> <b>bracing</b> struts and wires were added. When the available engine power increased during the 1920s and 1930s, wings could be made heavy and strong enough that bracing was not needed any more. This type of unbraced wing is called a cantilever wing.|$|R

5000|$|An arch {{is a pure}} {{compression}} form. It can span a {{large area}} by resolving forces into compressive stresses and, in turn eliminating tensile stresses.
