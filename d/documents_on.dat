5|$|According to Australian court <b>documents,</b> <b>on</b> 10 January 2006, the Šibenik County Court {{ordered that}} a warrant be issued for Vasiljković's arrest. The {{offences}} listed were two alleged war crimes against prisoners of war, and one alleged war crime against the civilian population. The latter {{are related to}} {{his role in the}} attack on Glina which caused civilian deaths and injuries. He was arrested in Australia in 2006, but as an Australian national, he appealed against extradition to Croatia claiming that he would not get a fair trial there. The appeal was granted by the Federal Court in 2009, and Vasiljković was released. However, the High Court of Australia overturned the decision and Vasiljković was arrested after a 43-day search for him by the police. Subsequently, Vasiljković appealed against his extradition citing other grounds. His extradition was approved by the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare in November 2012, however Vasiljković appealed that decision as well. In December 2014, the Federal Court upheld Clare's decision.|$|E
