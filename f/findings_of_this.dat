25|$|The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{study may}} be {{applicable}} to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment {{are not likely to}} be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.|$|E

25|$|Abelardo Lafuente Garcia-Rojo (Madrid 1871 – Shanghai 1931) was a Spanish {{architect}} and entrepreneur {{who had his}} own studio in colonial Shanghai. Between 1913 and 1931 {{he was the only}} Spaniard to have an architect studio registered in the city; Lafuente collaborated with several contemporary architects. Lafuente blended the mozarab and moorish styles from Spain into Chinese architecture. In 2009, the Spanish architect Alvaro Leonardo Perez established the Lafuente Research Project. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> project were first presented at the Shanghai World Expo in 2010 in collaboration with the Instituto Cervantes. The Lafuente Research Project is ongoing.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{research}} within the last decade outlining some studies that {{have looked at the}} effectiveness of forgiveness interventions on young children. There have also been several studies done studying this cross culturally. One study that explored this relationship, was a study conducted in 2009 by Eadaoin Hui and Tat Sing Chau. In this study, Hui and Chau looked at the relationship between forgiveness interventions and Chinese children who were less likely to forgive those who had wronged them. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study showed that there was an effect of forgiveness interventions on the young Chinese children.|$|E
25|$|A study {{performed}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.|$|E

25|$|In a 1997 {{paper on}} the effect of police hiring on crime rates, Levitt used the timing of mayoral and gubernatorial {{elections}} as an instrumental variable to identify a causal effect of police on crime. Past studies had been inconclusive because of the simultaneity inherent in police hiring (when crime increases, more police are hired to combat crime). The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> paper were found {{to be the result of}} a programming error. This was pointed out in a comment by Justin McCrary published in the American Economic Review in 2002. In a response published with McCrary's comment Levitt admits to the error and then goes on to offer alternative evidence to support his original conclusions.|$|E
25|$|In the study, {{researchers}} created {{two versions}} of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20 minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered {{the second half of the}} newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.|$|E
25|$|Although {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy has}} helped {{to improve the quality}} of life of people living with HIV, there is still a need to explore other ways to further address the disease burden. One such potential strategy that was investigated was to add interleukin 2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV. A Cochrane review included 25 randomized controlled trials that were conducted across six countries. The researchers found that interleukin 2 increases the CD4 immune cells, but does not make a difference in terms of death and incidence of other infections. Furthermore, there is probably an increase in side-effects with interleukin 2. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> review do not support the use of interleukin 2 as an add-on treatment to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV.|$|E
30|$|The {{essential}} <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{study is}} that the diameter of aortic root is a significant factor to increase the catheter placement time (Tables 2 and 3).|$|R
30|$|The most {{important}} <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{study was that}} repairs performed with non-absorbable braided sutures resulted in less separation than with absorbable monofilament sutures when subjected to a loading protocol.|$|R

25|$|The {{existence}} {{of both the}} proto-Parthenon and its destruction were known from Herodotus, and the drums of its columns were plainly visible built into the curtain wall north of the Erechtheon. Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of Panagiotis Kavvadias of 1885–90. The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> dig allowed Wilhelm Dörpfeld, then director of the German Archaeological Institute, to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by Dörpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed. Dörpfeld's observation was that the three steps of the first Parthenon consisted of two steps of Poros limestone, {{the same as the}} foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of the Periclean Parthenon. This platform was smaller and slightly {{to the north of the}} final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885–90 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.|$|E
25|$|During an {{expedition}} in 1980, paleontologists of the Texas Tech University {{discovered a new}} geological site rich in fossils near Post Town, Garza County, Texas, US, where a dozen of well-preserved specimens belonging to a new rauisuchid were found. In the following years further excavation in the Post Quarry, in Cooper Canyon Formation (Dockum Group), unearthed many remains of late Triassic terrestrial fauna. The holotype of P. kirkpatricki (TTUP 9000), representing a well-preserved skull and a partial postcranial skeleton, was described along with other <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new genus by paleontologist Sankar Chatterjee in 1985. A paratype, TTU-P 9002, representing a well-preserved skull and a complete skeleton was also assigned to this species. Chatterjee named the species after Mr. and Mrs. Jack Kirkpatrick who helped during his fieldwork. Subsequently, some specimens (such manus and toe bones) were re-assigned to Chatterjeea and Lythrosuchus; Long and Murry pointed out {{that many of the}} juvenile skeletons (TTUP 9003-9011), which Chatterjee assigned to P. kirkpatricki, belong to a distinct genus, named Chatterjeea elegans. Furthermore, in 2006 Nesbitt and Norell argued that Chatterjeea is a junior synonym of Shuvosaurus.|$|E
25|$|Microcephalic osteodysplastic {{primordial}} dwarfism (MOPD) type II is an autosomal multisystem disorder including severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly with Seckel syndrome-like facial appearance, {{and distinctive}} skeletal alterations. Usually those affected have {{mild to moderate}} mental retardation. This female child is the first born of nonconsanguineous parents at 35 weeks gestation through a cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation. She had a retarded psychomotor development and was repeatedly hospitalized during her {{first six months of}} life due to recurring respiratory infections. Her electroencephalography, auditory brainstem response evaluation, and chromosomal analysis were relatively normal. A brain MRI revealed thickened cerebral cortices with few and large gyri prominently in the frontal and posterior temporal regions, incomplete development of the Sylvian fissures, and dilatation of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles (colpocephaly). Usually only mild brain malformations are associated with MOPD type II. The imaging <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> child’s brain most likely represent diffuse pachygyria, a mild form of lissencephaly. This child’s neurodevelopmental findings were mild when compared to previous reports of a well-defined chromosome 17-linked and X-linked lissencephaly in a bedridden patient with severe developmental delays.|$|E

30|$|The main <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{study is}} that PERCIST 1.0 {{provides}} a higher overall agreement between observers than when using the qualitative approach in categorizing early treatment response in NSCLC patients with FDG-PET/CT.|$|R
30|$|The primary <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{study was}} that {{augmented}} EMG activity was observed during VH exercise, which was accompanied by muscle deoxygenation. These finding supports our hypothesis that VH during exercise enhances EMG responses.|$|R
500|$|On {{the basis}} of the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study, the 10th CGPM in 1954 decided that an {{international}} system should be derived from six base units to provide for the measurement of temperature and optical radiation in addition to mechanical and electromagnetic quantities. Six base units were recommended: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin (later renamed kelvin), and candela. In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units, abbreviated SI from the French name, [...] The BIPM has also described SI as [...] "the modern metric system". The seventh base unit, the mole, was added in 1971 by the 14th CGPM.|$|E

2500|$|As with CBT, patient organisations {{have long}} criticised {{the use of}} {{exercise}} therapy, most [...] notably GET, {{as a treatment for}} CFS. In 2012 the MEA commenced an extensive opinion survey of patients who had received GET.

2500|$|Experts {{including}} the Independent Levee Investigation Team (ILIT) from the University of California, Berkeley have countered his accusations. The {{report from the}} ILIT said [...] "The <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> panel are that the overtopping of the levees by flood waters, the often sub-standard materials used {{to shore up the}} levees, and the age of the levees contributed to these scour holes found at many of the sites of levee breaks after the hurricane." ...|$|E
