25|$|The {{intended}} {{date for}} the beginning of the civil war was October 20, 1899. However, due to the <b>imprudence</b> of some of the Liberal generals who wished to begin the war on October 17, it was changed. The reaction of many Liberals was hesitant, since they believed {{that they did not have}} sufficient numbers or organization. Despite this, the rebellion began in the municipality of Socorro, Santander, and the rebels awaited military reinforcements from Venezuela.|$|E

25|$|While Spain, The Holy See, and the United States {{recognized}} Miguel as king, in England and France {{there was}} little {{public support for the}} regime. The <b>imprudence</b> that the Miguelist government showed in harassing English and French foreign nationals provoked them to protest. Eventually Admiral Albin Roussin, was ordered by Louis Philippe I (who, like England, could not obtain any diplomatic satisfaction), to take action; he sailed up the Tagus, captured eight Portuguese ships and forcibly imposed a treaty (July 14, 1831). But, Miguelist reprisals on liberals continued; most sentences were carried out within 24 hours. The 4th Infantry, in Lisbon, registered 29 executions on August 22 and 23, 1831, alone.|$|E

He discovered surrealism (André Breton, René Char and also Antonin Artaud), and founded a review at 18 years old, along with Pierre Nora, <b>Imprudence.</b> The 1949 Rajk trial definitively took out his will to adhere to the French Communist Party (PCF).|$|E

25|$|If {{it should}} be {{declared}} that contraception is not evil in itself, then we should have to concede frankly that the Holy Spirit {{had been on the}} side of the Protestant churches in 1930 (when the encyclical Casti Connubii was promulgated), in 1951 (Pius XII's address to the midwives), and in 1958 (the address delivered before the Society of Hematologists in the year the pope died). It should likewise have to be admitted that for a half century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error. This would mean that the leaders of the Church, acting with extreme <b>imprudence,</b> had condemned thousands of innocent human acts, forbidding, under pain of eternal damnation, a practice which would now be sanctioned. The fact can neither be denied nor ignored that these same acts would now be declared licit on the grounds of principles cited by the Protestants, which popes and bishops have either condemned or at least not approved.|$|E

It shows {{a scene from the}} Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying, and challenges him to either kill himself or Candaules as a punishment; Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and to take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, at this point unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes.|$|E

Allen and about 100 men crossed the Saint Lawrence that night, but Brown and his men, who were to cross the river at Laprairie, did not. General Carleton, alerted to Allen's presence, mustered every man he could, and, in the Battle of Longue-Pointe, scattered most of Allen's force, and captured him and about 30 men. His capture ended his participation in the revolution until 1778, as he was imprisoned by the British. General Schuyler, upon learning of Allen's capture, wrote, [...] "I am very apprehensive of disagreeable consequences arising from Mr. Allen's <b>imprudence.</b> [...] I always dreaded his impatience and imprudence." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{reading the}} third volume of Constable's Memoirs (3 vols. 8vo, 1873), one cannot {{fail to see}} that all the three parties--printer, publisher, and author--were equal sharers in the <b>imprudences</b> {{that led to the}} {{disaster}} in 1826. Whether Mr. Constable was right in recommending further advances to the London house is doubtful; but if it was an error of judgment, it was one which appears to have been shared by Mr. Cadell and Mr. James Ballantyne. It must be admitted that the three firms were equally culpable in maintaining for so many years a system of fictitious credit. Constable, at least, from a letter to Scott, printed in vol. iii. p. 274, had become seriously alarmed as early as August 8, 1823.|$|R
500|$|Like Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, {{the story}} of The Flopsy Bunnies is about rabbits intruding upon the human domain and {{bringing}} the threat {{of death and destruction}} upon themselves by their own <b>imprudence.</b> M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh indicates in Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code that the tale's principal theme is the trickster animal, though she is careful to point out that, even then, the animals are subordinate to the exquisite garden backgrounds. The reader's interest in the tale, she believes, lies in following the joke played upon McGregor rather than in the dull personalities of the rabbits. Although the trickster qualities of the rabbits are evident but muted in the earlier Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, in Flopsy Bunnies these qualities are brought to center stage. Kutzer notes that The Flopsy Bunnies belongs not to the title characters but to their parents [...] it is they who save the baby bunnies [...] and thus the story is often of less interest to children.|$|E

60|$|Many light-hearted days {{followed}} this joyous evening. No eidolons haunted Alford's horizon, perhaps because Mrs. Yarrow filled his whole heaven. She was very constantly with him, guiding his wavering steps {{up the hill}} of recovery, which he climbed {{with more and more}} activity, and keeping him company in those valleys of relapse into which he now and then fell back from the difficult steeps. It came to be tacitly, or at least passively, conceded by the other ladies that she had somehow earned the exclusive right to what had once been the common charge; or that if one of their number had a claim to keep Mr. Alford from killing himself by all sorts of <b>imprudences,</b> which in his case amounted to impieties, it was certainly Mrs. Yarrow. They did not put this in terms, but they felt it and acted it.|$|R
6000|$|To the Court of Vienna, {{especially}} to the Hungarian Majesty, this wonderful reconquest of Bohemia, without battle fought,--or any cause assignable but Traun's excellent manoeuvring and Friedrich's <b>imprudences</b> and trust in the French,--was a thing of heavenly miracle; blessed omen that Providence had vouchsafed to her prayers the recovery of Silesia itself. All the world was crowing over Friedrich: but her Majesty of Hungary's views had risen to a clearly higher pitch of exultation and triumphant hope, terrestrial and celestial, than any other living person's. [...] "Silesia back again," [...] that was now the hope and resolution of her Majesty's high heart: [...] "My wicked neighbor shall be driven out, and smart dear for the ill he has done; Heaven so wills it!"

60|$|And as to Goldsmith himself, and his life, and the tracing {{of it out}} in his own writings, and the manful {{and dignified}} {{assertion}} of him without any sobs, whines, or convulsions of any sort, it is throughout a noble achievement, of which, apart from any private and personal affection for you, I think (and really believe) I should feel proud, as one who had no indifferent perception of these books of his--to {{the best of my}} remembrance--when little more than a child. I was a little afraid in the beginning, when he committed those very discouraging <b>imprudences,</b> {{that you were going to}} champion him somewhat indiscriminately; but I very soon got over that fear, and found reason in every page to admire the sense, calmness, and moderation with which you make the love and admiration of the reader cluster about him from his youth, and strengthen with his strength--and weakness too, which is better still.|$|R
2500|$|A skilled {{commander}} of Süleyman's army, Ibrahim eventually fell from grace after an <b>imprudence</b> committed during {{a campaign against}} the Persian Safavid empire during the Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–55), when he awarded himself a title including the word [...] "Sultan". Another conflict occurred when Ibrahim and his former mentor, İskender Çelebi, repeatedly clashed over military leadership and positions during the Safavid war. These incidents launched {{a series of events}} which culminated in his execution in 1536 by Süleyman's order. It is believed that Hürrem's influence contributed to Süleyman's decision. After three other grand viziers in eight years, Süleyman selected Hürrem's son-in-law, Damat Rüstem Pasha, husband of Mihrimah, to become the grand vizier. Scholars have wondered if Hürrem's alliance with Mihrimah Sultan and Rüstem Pasha helped secure the throne for one of Hürrem's sons.|$|E
2500|$|An ambitious young detective with a {{complicated}} personal life", {{the character of}} Rachel developed as a strong-willed, initiative and able detective. However, she possesses flaws, which manifest themselves in Bailey's personal life, such as her tempestuous relationship with Nick Savage. Rachel Bailey, who is portrayed as a single woman in her early thirties, contrasts the character of Janet, {{who is in a}} failing marriage and has two daughters. Janet, in her forties, is also wiser than Rachel; Janet is astounded that Rachel has discussed the details of a case with Nick Savage, highlighting Rachel's <b>imprudence</b> regarding her personal life and its effects on her professional life. As one reviewer opined, the character [...] "seemed to lurch from one crisis to another, putting her career – and eventually her life – in danger".|$|E
2500|$|At {{about the}} same time the Mosul missionaries began to report [...] disquieting rumours about his {{performance}} of his duties. [...] He was said, among other things, to have released a monk from his vows for a payment of 73 piastres, to have used liturgical books full of errors, to have visited families without a companion, and to have feasted in the house of a newly-wed couple. [...] Although each of these incidents was relatively minor in itself, and could equally have been explained by mere <b>imprudence</b> rather than active corruption, their frequency was disturbing. [...] For his part, Yohannan accused the missionaries of arrogance and mischief-making, and on his request the apostolic vicar of Baghdad, Fulgence de Sainte Marie, was sent to Mosul as apostolic vicar in 1796 to report on the situation.|$|E

There is the jolly prince, shrewd, selfish, scheming, loving his cups and his ease (I think his good humour makes the tragedy but darker); his princess, who speaks little but observes all; his old, painted Jezebel of a mistress; his son, the Electoral prince, shrewd too, quiet, selfish, not ill-humoured, and generally silent, except when goaded into fury by the intolerable tongue of his lovely wife; there is poor Sophia Dorothea, with her coquetry and her wrongs, and her passionate attachment to her scamp of a lover, and her wild <b>imprudences,</b> and her mad artifices, and her insane fidelity, and her furious jealousy regarding her husband (though she loathed and cheated him), and her prodigious falsehoods; and the confidante, of course, into whose hands the letters are slipped; and there is Lothario, finally, than whom, as I have said, one can’t imagine a more handsome, wicked, worthless reprobate.|$|R
