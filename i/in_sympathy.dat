5|$|After their {{defeat the}} Royalists {{effectively}} abandoned Northern England, losing {{much of the}} manpower from the northern counties of England (which were strongly Royalist <b>in</b> <b>sympathy)</b> and also losing access to the European continent through the ports on the North Sea coast. Although they partially retrieved their fortunes with victories {{later in the year}} in Southern England, the loss of the north was to prove a fatal handicap the next year, when they tried unsuccessfully to link up with the Scottish Royalists under the Marquess of Montrose.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{began to}} cross from Southwark onto London Bridge on the {{afternoon}} of 13 June. The defences on London Bridge were opened from the inside, either <b>in</b> <b>sympathy</b> for the rebel cause or out of fear, and the rebels advanced into the city. At the same time, the rebel force from Essex made its way towards Aldgate {{on the north side of}} the city. The rebels swept west through the centre of the city, and Aldgate was opened to let the rest of the rebels in.|$|E
5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War {{broke out}} between the Royalist {{supporters}} of Charles I and those of Parliament. South Wales was predominantly Royalist <b>in</b> <b>sympathy,</b> and during the conflict, a sconce, or small fort, was built overlooking Caerphilly Castle to the north-west, {{on the site of}} the old Roman fort. It is uncertain if this was built by Royalist forces or by the Parliamentary army that occupied the area during the final months of the war in March 1646, but the fort's guns would have dominated the interior of the castle. It is also uncertain whether or not Caerphilly Castle was deliberately slighted by Parliament to prevent its future use as a fortification. Although several towers had collapsed by the 18th century, possibly as a result of such an operation, it is probable that this deterioration was actually the result of subsidence damage caused when the water defences retreated, as there is no evidence of deliberate destruction having been ordered.|$|E
50|$|Marcantonio III Borghese, 5th Prince of Sulmona (16 September 1730-26 March 1800) was {{the head}} of the Borghese family of Rome.

5|$|Leopold's {{decision}} to surrender was seized {{on by the}} British and French press who blamed him for the military situation. The Belgian government met in Paris on 26 May and invoked Article 82 of the Constitution, declaring the monarch unable to reign (dans l'impossibilité de régner), and resolved to continue the fight against Germany. The following day, Pierlot held an important meeting with the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, in which the French premier called for the Belgian government to publicly denounce the King and his surrender. Following the meeting, Pierlot gave a radio speech denouncing the King whom he accused of acting unconstitutionally and <b>in</b> <b>sympathy</b> with the Germans. Before being broadcast, Pierlot's speech was heavily edited by the French minister Georges Mandel to ensure a position favorable to the French. The denunciation of the King, who was popular across most strata of Belgian society {{and supported by the}} church, led to a big loss of public support and alienated Pierlot from his supporters and party.|$|E
5|$|Violence peaked {{the next}} evening, {{the night of}} September 10–11. Businesses were better prepared. Some had boarded up and others stayed open all night with armed guards visible to {{discourage}} thieves {{taking advantage of the}} strike. Gamblers played dice in open view, and women had their handbags snatched. But the Guard's inexperience at handling crowds resulted in dangerous attempts to assert control. Gunfire in South Boston left two dead and others wounded. One person died in a riot at Scollay Square, a center of amusement halls and theaters. Whether the crowds were threatening property or making trouble because they were <b>in</b> <b>sympathy</b> with the strikers is unknown. The death total ultimately reached nine.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings <b>in</b> <b>sympathy</b> with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{having been}} {{conceived}} as a Democratic Party bastion during the U.S. Civil War, in its later days, {{the members of the}} Manhattan Club were often decidedly Republican <b>in</b> <b>sympathies.</b> <b>In</b> 1954, a survey of the men's social clubs of Manhattan noted that the club had become [...] "ninety percent Republican." [...] A half-century earlier, the significant majority of members supported Republican William McKinley's bid for President of the United States, triggering letters of resignation from members who wanted it to be a Democratic Club.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 18th century the electors were mostly Tory.

Oxford University, where the King {{did not have the}} same prerogative power, remained safely Tory (indeed often Jacobite) <b>in</b> <b>sympathies.</b>|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine how the {{parenting}} dimensions of both mothers and fathers independently and together predict adolescent outcomes <b>in</b> three domains: <b>sympathy,</b> self-worth, and social competence. One-hundred eight adolescents completed self report measures on their perceived relationship with parents, sympathy, social competence, and self-worth. Perceived maternal support and rigid control were the most consistent predictors of adolescent adjustment. High levels of perceived maternal support and low levels of maternal rigid control were related to adolescents’ reports of sympathy, social competence, and self-worth. In contrast, support and control from fathers was generally unrelated to adolescent adjustment. The one exception was <b>in</b> predicting <b>sympathy,</b> where father support interacted with maternal support <b>in</b> predicting <b>sympathy.</b> When perceived support from fathers was high, maternal support was unrelated to <b>sympathy.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, when perceived support from fathers was low, perceived maternal support was a statistically signifi cant predictor of sympathy...|$|R
