5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve {{returned}} to ABC the following New Year's Eve {{for the arrival}} of 2001. The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E

No one has come close to that since, and I don't think anybody ever will. I think he will forever be the {{greatest}} drummer of all time.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local students did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on with their peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E

500|$|Ryan Britt, {{while writing}} for Tor.com, thought more favourably of [...] "Home", {{including}} it in {{a list of}} six episodes from Enterprise which are comparable {{to the best of}} the other Star Trek series. It was described as [...] "the sort of episode that either rewards someone who liked the characters on this show, or could potentially get you to like them if you didn’t really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on." [...] Britt's only complaint was that the romance between T'Pol and Tucker wasn't further developed as it brought out the best in Blalock and Trinneer.|$|E

After creating a simple poll for users of the site, she left work and took the subway back to her Brooklyn home. When she got off the train and checked her phone, it was overwhelmed by the messages on various sites. [...] "I couldn't open Twitter because it kept crashing. I thought somebody had died, maybe. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on." [...] Later in the evening the page set a new record at BuzzFeed for concurrent visitors, which would reach 673,000 at its peak.|$|E

500|$|In July 2014, Lucy Lawless was {{revealed}} {{to be involved in}} the second season. At the San Diego Comic Con 2014, Lawless' role {{was revealed}} to be that of Isabelle Hartley, a longtime S.H.I.E.L.D. veteran. About the decision to cast Lawless as Hartley, who was always intended to be killed off at the end of the episode, Whedon said [...] "We wanted you to invest in the character and feel like this person was a real equal to Coulson. She definitely fit the bill on that front. Lucy has such a strength to her. We didn’t want people to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen. We wanted it to feel like a big deal." ...|$|E
500|$|When Gatski graduated, Sam Clagg, a {{teammate}} at Marshall, helped {{get him a}} tryout with the Cleveland Browns after contacting John Brickels, an assistant coach with West Virginia ties. The Browns were a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and were set to begin play in 1946. Gatski, who {{was working in the}} mines after graduating from Auburn, hitchhiked to Bowling Green, Ohio for the team's training camp. He did not consider a football career a certainty, and returning to the coal mines where his father had died in an accident was a distinct possibility. [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen," [...] he said later. [...] "I just went up there to see what would happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen to me. I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E

500|$|The first writers {{assigned}} to the script were twins Julius and Philip Epstein who, against the wishes of Warner Brothers, left at Frank Capra's request early in 1942 {{to work on the}} Why We Fight series in Washington, D.C. While they were gone, the other credited writer, Howard Koch, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were re{{assigned to}} Casablanca and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. Koch later commented, [...] "When we began, we didn't have a finished script... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen!" [...] In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, and Koch earned $4,200.|$|E
500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|Mercedes McNab, {{well known}} for portraying the vampire Harmony Kendall on the {{television}} series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, guest starred as the recently turned vampire Lucy. Although hesitant to play another vampire, McNab {{came to realize that}} the character was less of a vampire and more of a [...] "girl who woke up and was basically drugged or was changed and didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on". The actress also noted that Harmony was generally used for comic relief, whereas Lucy was intended to be [...] "serious and more dramatic". Her previous experience with director Kim Manners on the television series The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. also influenced her decision. Because many of her recent characters tended to die, McNab was delighted by Lucy's offscreen death. The actress was also working on an episode of Reaper during the filming of [...] "Fresh Blood", and the Supernatural production staff was able to fit her into the shooting schedule. The actress found them to be [...] "really helpful" [...] in making sure that her scenes did not take too long to film. Her portion of the opening scene only took a few hours to shoot, allowing her to return to Reaper the next morning.|$|E

500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Martin's {{brilliance}} in evoking atmosphere through {{description is}} an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings {{much more than}} just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with [...] "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters". CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor advised reading the novels with an A Song of Ice and Fire encyclopedia at hand to [...] "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [...] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{extensive}} connections of Kangura to {{the ruling}} elite appeared to give the magazine inside knowledge.

2500|$|A 2012 {{report in}} The Economist said: [...] "The {{operating}} company was poorly regulated {{and did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on. The operators made mistakes.

The establishment repeatedly played down the risks and suppressed information about {{the movement of the}} radioactive plume, so some people were evacuated from more lightly to more heavily contaminated places." ...|$|E

When asked about {{the first time she}} performed an Amanar in competition, Maroney said, [...] "The first time I did it was at Visa Championships and I was just thirteen years old.
