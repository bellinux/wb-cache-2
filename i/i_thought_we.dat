25|$|In early 2011, {{eight of}} the more {{prominent}} editorial and technology staff members left AOL {{to build a new}} gadget site with CEO Jim Bankoff at SB Nation. On leaving, Joshua Topolsky, former Editor-in-chief, is quoted having said, “We have been working on blogging technology that was developed in 2003, we haven’t made a hire since I started running the site, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could be more successful elsewhere”.|$|E

500|$|Heated discussions {{during the}} writing of Lions were rare, owing to the Robinson brothers' usual method in which Rich writes the music and Chris writes the lyrics. [...] "Soul Singing" [...] was the only song to cause disagreement; [...] "I'd written this part where {{although}} the vocals changed the music stayed the same throughout. [...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> should add something or just not finish it, but Chris thought it was already a song, and a good one.

The hour-long show consisted primarily of material from Graveyard Mountain Home, which was accompanied by projections of the corresponding scenes from Age 13. [...] "I {{thought that it would}} be good for the first show to be sort of small and comfortable... so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> [...] just have a hundred people," [...] Moore said. [...] "Everybody can see, everybody can be comfortable and sort of enjoy themselves. And if something goes horribly wrong, it only happens in front of a hundred people." [...] Moore hoped the show would form the basis of more elaborate, longer shows. He planned on playing more shows in Turkey, before touring Europe and the rest of the world.|$|E

Kelly, Sinatra and Munshin play three sailors on a 24-hour shore {{leave in}} New York whose romantic ambitions get {{them more than}} they bargained for. The film was a success both financially and critically. It won the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and screenwriters Comden and Green won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. Like Orson Welles, Donen made his directorial debut at 25. Donen stated that Kelly was [...] "responsible {{for most of the}} dance movements.

500|$|Hugh Syme {{provided}} the artwork for Octavarium. The idea of depicting a giant Newton's cradle was {{born out of}} discussions between Syme and Portnoy. The two talked about how [...] "for everything you do in music you create either a cluster or triad", according to Syme. [...] "And then it became evident that for every action there is an opposite reaction. So <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could do something based on the Newton's cradle." [...] There are numerous references to the numbers five and eight throughout the artwork, alluding to the album's concept. For example, the Newton's cradle has eight suspended balls, and there are five birds on the cover. The album booklet features an octagonal maze, spider and octopus, among other references. The landscape on the cover is made up of a sky and grass from Indiana, and a background from the Lake District.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 19, 1976 on the South Fork of Long Island with {{the scene in}} which Alvy and Annie boil live lobsters; filming continued periodically {{for the next ten}} months, and deviated frequently from the screenplay. There was nothing written about Alvy's childhood home lying under a roller coaster, but when Allen was scouting locations in Brooklyn with Willis and art director Mel Bourne, he [...] "saw this roller-coaster, and... saw the house under it. And <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>we</b> have to use this." [...] Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters a trove of cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.|$|E

[...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>we</b> are at the point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread."

500|$|Gygax {{wrote the}} {{supplements}} Greyhawk, Eldritch Wizardry, and Swords & Spells {{for the original}} D game. With Brian Blume, Gygax also designed the wild west-oriented role-playing game Boot Hill. In the same year, Gygax created the magazine The Strategic Review with himself as editor. But wanting a more industry-wide periodical, he hired Tim Kask as TSR's first employee to change this magazine to the fantasy periodical The Dragon, with Gygax as writer, columnist, and publisher (from 1978 to 1981). The Dragon debuted in June 1976, and Gygax commented on its success years later: [...] "When I decided that The Strategic Review was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce The Dragon, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide...

Berridge commented on the casting: [...] "After a search which has taken more than two years, and in which we have met literally hundreds of people, we have finally found the perfect cast for our dynamic new family. We're delighted to welcome the Ferreiras to Albert Square and I'm sure the viewers will be too." [...] Berridge also claimed the show didn't set out to look for an Asian family, saying: [...] "We wanted a new family as there were various elements missing from the show. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were short on males and needed a surge of testosterone," [...] and said that the characters were formed around the actors: [...] "We didn't set out knowing exactly what we wanted. We workshopped constantly, trying out different improvisations with the actors and the characters evolved." ...|$|E

[...] after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, [...] "it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
500|$|Gunn {{appointed}} a backroom staff of former Norwich colleagues, making Ian Crook first-team coach and John Deehan chief scout. However, the initial turnaround in form {{could not be}} maintained; having lost their last three games of the season, Norwich were relegated from the Championship. Gunn labelled his players as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] after the 4–2 defeat to Charlton Athletic that sealed relegation to League One. Despite relegation to the third tier of English football {{for the first time}} in nearly 50 years, Writing in Tales from the City, Gunn said of the match [...] "Even going to Charlton on the last day, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could survive… We lost 4-2 and were relegated to the third tier. I was shell-shocked; the emptiest I have ever felt in a sporting or professional context. The directors went on the field to face the fans and to thank them for their support and I had tears in my eyes when I saw Delia and Michael doing that. I told them how sorry I was." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Trust No 1" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Chris Carter along with {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz; it was directed by Tony Wharmby. The episode features former leading star David Duchovny via the use of previously shot footage. According to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode includes themes [...] "about Orwellian surveillance." [...] "Trust No 1" [...] was written in response to fans who felt that, during season eight, Mulder's abduction was not dealt with until his miraculous return in [...] "This is Not Happening"/"DeadAlive". Despite this, series director Kim Manners was critical of this take on Mulder, noting, [...] "The only thing <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> didn't do right during seasons eight and nine was {{that a lot of}} the shows were about Mulder, and I thought it was a mistake to make a series about a man that wasn't standing in front of the camera." [...] The email addresses that Mulder and Scully use to communicate with each other were real addresses, created and maintained by Ten Thirteen Productions. The tagline for the episode is [...] "They're Watching", changed from the usual [...] "The Truth is Out There".|$|E

I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> had one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E
