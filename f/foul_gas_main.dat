40|$|In this paper, the {{potential}} of recovering waste heat from the fryer section and exhaust stream sent to the stack of a typical potato crisps or chips manufacturing plant and using the heat to drive an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system for power generation has been presented. Five different ORC system Options (A, B, C, D and E) were considered. The first two options (A and B) {{make use of the}} waste heat from the <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> and exhaust to stack respectively for power generation using a single ORC system each while the third option (option C) makes use of a novel dual heat source single ORC system where the low temperature waste heat from the <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> is used to provide preheating and the high temperature waste from the exhaust to the stack used to provide the evaporation. Option D also shows a dual heat source ORC system where the high temperature waste heat to the exhaust stack is used to provide the preheating while the lower temperature <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> is used for the evaporation (reverse of option C in terms of waste heat usage) while option E makes use of a reheat cycle where the waste heat from the <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> is used to provide the reheating of the working fluid exiting the turbine. In terms of waste heat usage, the combination of options A and B can be compared with options C, D and E. The simulation result shows that in terms of net power generation, cooling water requirement, and working fluid (R 245 fa) requirement, the combination of Options A and B gives the best power generation result and this is similar as the result produced by Option C. Following option C is option E which gave a better result than option D. The entropy generation analysis showed that the entropy generation is inversely proportional to the power output. It was also observed that the net power generation for the ORC configuration adopted in this paper (option C) meets the average daily power requirement of the crisps manufacturing process as well as 98. 58...|$|R

40|$|Strong {{electromagnetic}} fields are radiated during {{the operation of}} the intense electron-beam accelerator (IEBA), which may lead to the nearby electronic devices out of order. In this paper, the research on the electromagnetic radiation characteristic of the <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> switch of a capacitive IEBA is carried out by the methods of theory analysis and experiment investigation. It is obtained that the <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> switch is the dominating radiation resource. In the absence of electromagnetic shielding for the <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> switch, when the pulse forming line of the IEBA is charged to 700 kV, the radiation field with amplitude of 3280 V/m, dominant frequency of 84 MHz and high frequency 100 MHz is obtained at a distance of 10 meters away from the <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> switch. The experimental results of the radiation field agree with the theoretical calculations. We analyze the achievements of several research groups and find that there is a relationship between the rise time (T) of the transient current of the <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> switch and the dominant frequency (F) of the radiation field, namely, F*T= 1. Contrast experiment is carried out with a metal shield cover for the <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> switch. Experimental results show that for the shielded setup the radiation field reduces to 115 V/m, the dominant frequency increases to 86. 5 MHz at a distance of 10 away meters from the <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> switch. These conclusions are beneficial for further research on the electromagnetic radiation and protection of the IEBA...|$|R

40|$|Odour {{control in}} Hong Kong has been {{addressed}} {{as an important}} issue by the authorities, since odour pollution is generated from many sources including wastewater treatment plants. Although a number of existing technologies are available for odour abatement and control, biological technique is still more attractive due to its low operating cost and ease of maintenance. A newly innovated fibrous bed bioreactor with twin columns was specially designed and constructed in our laboratory, in which an inner column was centred in an outer column. The bioreactor was fully filled with water in order to absorb the odorous components from <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> and also contained both suspended and attached biomass to degrade the absorbed odorous pollutants. In this study, hydrogen sulphide (H?S) and butyric acid (C?H?O?) were used as odorous components and successfully removed from synthetic <b>foul</b> <b>gases.</b> Many factors affecting the H?S and butyric acid removal efficiency and maximum elimination capacity, such as pH of water solution, gas flow rate and its fluctuation, and sulphate content in solution have been studied. The experimental results demonstrated that the reduction rates of 97. 8 % for H 2 S and 99. 9 % for butyric acid were achieved in this experimental condition. It is proved that this bioreactor was a compact odorous gas treatment system with an application potential for treating foul air with high odour strength and low airflow rate such as the offensive gases from sludge treatment processes in a wastewater treatment plant.

40|$|Methyl {{mercaptan}} (CH 3 SH) is {{a representative}} odorous pollutant from various odor emission {{sources such as}} sewage and municipal solid wastes. This study confirms that CH 3 SH in a synthetic <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> can be effectively decomposed by UV-C (< 280 nm) photolysis using germicidal lamps, but is resistant to destruction under UV-A (365 nm) irradiation using black-light lamps. This study also demonstrates that CH 3 SH in <b>foul</b> <b>gas</b> can be successfully degraded by photocatalytic oxidation under UV-A irradiation using TiO 2 -based photocatalysts. In this study, two new catalysts, NH 4 +-modified TiO 2 (NH 4 +-TiO 2) and SO 4 2 [...] modified TiO 2 (SO 4 2 [...] TiO 2), were prepared by a precipitate-refluxing method and a hydrothermal method, respectively. These two catalysts {{as well as the}} commercially available catalyst Degussa P 25 (P 25 -TiO 2) were used for the photocatalytic degradation of CH 3 SH. It was found that the NH 4 +-TiO 2 catalyst achieved a better performance than P 25 -TiO 2, whereas SO 4 2 [...] TiO 2 demonstrated a poorer performance. The high photocatalytic activity of NH 4 +-TiO 2 for CH 3 SH degradation results from its basic characteristics and the presence of an ammonium (NH 4 +) group on the NH 4 +-TiO 2 catalyst surface. The photocatalytic degradation of CH 3 SH was further studied using the P 25 -TiO 2 catalyst under different experimental conditions. The experimental results showed that catalyst loading, relative humidity, and initial concentration could influence the efficiency of CH 3 SH photocatalytic degradation significantly. It was found that a catalyst loading of 3. 93 mg cm - 2 and a relative humidity of 43 % are two essential factors for achieving the best performance under these experimental conditions. This work provides new insights into the removal of a sulfur-containing organic substance (CH 3 SH) from the gas phase by both photolysis and photocatalytic oxidation processes.

40|$|Pressure {{variation}} in drainage stack {{is one of}} the key design parameters for a healthy drainage system in high-rise residential buildings as it might deplete the water seals of any connected appliances that prevent the ingress of <b>foul</b> <b>gases</b> into a habitable space.

With the survey data of occupant load variations and diurnal WC flushing patterns collected from a number of similar local buildings, a significant association between the expected hourly WC flushes in the building and the air pressure variations in the stack was reported. Mathematical expressions were proposed to correlate the occurrence of maximum air pressure at certain locations in a stack with the expected hourly WC flushes in high-rise residential buildings.
