40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{enhanced}} protective and wear (flexibility, less bulkiness) properties of ballistic and stab protecting panels the investigation of chemical surface modification of woven p-aramid fabrics was performed applying different chemical composition shear thickening fluid (STF) which improves friction <b>inside</b> <b>fabric</b> structure. For the chemical treatment silicic acid and acrylic dispersion water solutions were used and influence of their different concentrations on panels’ protective properties were investigated. Results of ballistic tests of multilayer protective panel have revealed that shear thickening effect was negligible when shooting at high energy range (E > 440 J). Determination of stab resistance of p-aramid panels has shown that different chemical composition of STFs had different influence on protective properties of the panels. Application of low concentrations of silicic acid determined higher stab resistance values comparing to higher concentrations of acrylic dispersion water solutions. At this stage of research stab tests results as ballistic ones determined that STF application for multilayer p-aramid fabrics protective panels is more efficient at low strike energy levels.

40|$|Goal of {{this work}} is the {{development}} of a new package to be integrated into large-area smart textiles. The benefits of the well-known crimp technology are transferred to a new field. The so-called Crimp Flat Pack (CFP) is a lead-frame based electronic package that features crimp terminals instead of standard leads. The module can be directly attached to different types of substrates, in particular to fabric circuits. Its size and complexity can reach from a simple two-terminal package to larger multi-terminal devices. The standard sized module has a circuit board area of 2 cm × 2 cm and 10 crimp terminals. Eight of them are used for the communication between other modules and for mechanical attachment. Two terminals are used to attach a sensor that collects data <b>inside</b> the <b>fabric.</b> Mainly two tools were developed for the process. At first, a forming tool that bends the contact pins upwards and brings the crimp barrels into shape as well as the actual crimping tool that allows parallel crimping. On the system's side of view the module carries a simple micro-controller and passives. Communication between neighboring modules is done via I 2;C-protocol. Measurement of sensor date <b>inside</b> the <b>fabric</b> can be realized. The new package opens opportunities to the manufacturing of smart textiles as it uses standard manufacturing technologies as well as a robust, low-cost, and low-temperature interconnection technology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- A VLSI {{implementation}} of a multistage selfrouting ATM switch fabric is presented. The size of the switch is 16 x 16 and can handle the OC- 12 (622 Mbps) link rate. Based on a bit-slice architecture, the entire 16 x 16 switch is implemented using four identical chips. The switch has multiple paths, created by a randomizer {{in front of the}} routing stages, between each input-output pair. The switch uses an input/output-buffering scheme and contains no buffers <b>inside</b> the <b>fabric.</b> A priority structure, which supports four levels, allows the delay sensitive ATM cells to be switched with the shortest latency. It also enables the non-interleaving routing scheme of IP cells.

40|$|Multistage {{switches}} {{consisting of}} a number of stages of small switching elements (SE) are often used in ATM switch fabrics. An ATM switch fabric performs the functions of switching and buffering of cells. The location of buffers <b>inside</b> a <b>fabric</b> is critical in the performance of the switch. Output buffered SEs have a higher throughput than input buffered SEs. Moreover, output buffered SEs do not suffer from buffer hogging as found in shared buffered SEs operating in a nonuniform traffic environment.

However, crosspoint buffering enjoys the advantages of output buffering without requiring an internal speedup of its buffers.
