500|$|Chester Bennington {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with MTV News, which referred to Linkin Park's new style as being less technical and more organic: [...] "When it came to doing things that felt very much like older Linkin Park, like mixing hip-hop with a rock chorus, [...] felt like, {{if we were going to}} do it, we need to really <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that felt natural and felt original and felt like it was something we hadn't done in the past... there are hip-hop songs on the album—'Wretches and Kings', 'When They Come for Me'—they're like nothing the band have tried before: snarling, raw, dark and...strangely organic." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Gregg {{stated that}} the season resumes [...] "months later" [...] {{from the end of}} season one, adding, [...] "The monumental nature of [...] is made very clear almost immediately, because you realize {{everyone}} – US government, US military and other wise – wants to arrest us.

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that also {{sent a message to}} the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ... This is a man with amazing instincts." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 25, 2012, Weill {{apparently}} reversed {{course on}} the financial supermarket. [...] "What we should probably do is go and split up investment banking from banking, have banks be deposit takers, have banks make commercial loans and real estate loans, have banks do something that’s not going to risk the taxpayer dollars, that's not too big to fail," [...] Weill said on CNBC.

2500|$|In 1981, Styx {{was accused}} of putting the {{backward}} message [...] "Satan move through our voices" [...] on the song [...] "Snowblind", from Paradise Theatre. Guitarist James Young called these charges [...] "rubbish," [...] and responded, [...] "If {{we want to make}} a statement, we'll <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that people can understand us and not in a way where {{you have to go out}} and buy a $400 tape player to understand us." [...] The vinyl reproduction of Paradise Theater had laser etching on side one, spelling out Styx at the top, and two ladies facing each other on the sides. But on side two, the side with the song (Snow Blind) it had a black label with a small hole cut out where you could place the eraser side of a pencil, and play the album backwards to hear the backward message. In 1983, the band released a concept album, Kilroy Was Here, satirizing the Moral Majority.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{series that}} Moore began for Taboo was Lost Girls, which he {{described}} {{as a work of}} intelligent [...] "pornography". Illustrated by Melinda Gebbie, with whom Moore subsequently entered into a relationship, it was set in 1913, where Alice from Alice in Wonderland, Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz and Wendy from Peter Pan – who are each of a different age and class – all meet in a European hotel and regale each other with tales of their sexual encounters. With the work, Moore wanted to attempt something innovative in comics, and believed that creating comics pornography was a way of achieving this. He remarked that [...] "I had a lot of different ideas as to how {{it might be possible to}} do an up-front sexual comic strip and to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that would remove a lot of what I saw were the problems with pornography in general. That it's mostly ugly, it's mostly boring, it's not inventive – it has no standards." [...] Like From Hell, Lost Girls outlasted Taboo, and a few subsequent instalments were published erratically until the work was finished and a complete edition published in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Also in April, Michael Keaton entered {{talks to}} play a villain, but dropped out of discussions shortly {{thereafter}} due to scheduling conflicts with The Founder. He soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for that film, and closed the deal in late May. In June, Michael Barbieri was cast {{as a friend of}} Parker's, Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal, and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character, while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles. Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as [...] "one of [...] most diverse places in the world", with Feige adding that [...] "we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [...] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue." [...] This is also different from the previous films, which Feige described as being [...] "set in a lily-white Queens". Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included The Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, [...] "We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn’t want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a Daily Bugle, we want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that feels contemporary." [...] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials [...] "MJ" [...] as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is [...] "to have fun with [...] {{while at the same time}} having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic." ...|$|E

I just spoke up in a quite natural way of {{pleasing}} surprise, and not as if I was dreaming of conveying information, and said, [...] "Well, I do declare, if there isn't the dodo!" [...] I explained--without seeming to be explaining--how I know it for a dodo, and although I thought maybe he was a little piqued that I knew the creature when he didn't, it was quite evident that he admired me. That was very agreeable, and I thought of it more than once with gratification before I slept. How little a thing can make us happy when we feel that we have earned it! ...|$|E
2500|$|Literary historians argued {{later that}} Turgenev's {{overnight}} success {{might have seemed}} totally undeserved for Goncharov, who, for quite a while, {{felt like he was}} the only master of his field.

60|$|Thus {{the soul}} is {{preserved}} that hath sinned; thus the God of heaven is content {{that he should be}} saved; thus Satan is put to confusion, and Jesus applauded and cried up by the angels of heaven, and by the saints on earth. Thus have I showed you how Christ doth advocate it with God and his Father for us; and I have been the more particular in this, because the glory of Christ, and the comfort of the dejected, are greatly concerned and wrapped up in it. Look, then, to Jesus, if thou hast sinned; to Jesus, as an Advocate pleading with the Father for thee. Look to nothing else; for he can tell how, and that by himself, to deliver thee; yea, and will <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of justice, which is a wonder; and to the shame of Satan, which will be his glory; and also to thy complete deliverance, which will be thy comfort and salvation.|$|E
