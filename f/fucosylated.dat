The biosynthesis of core <b>fucosylated</b> Man 5 GlcNAc 2 glycans was enhanced in CHO Lec 3. 2. 8. 1 cells by the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), leading to the increase in core <b>fucosylated</b> Man 5 GlcNAc 2 glycans and the biosynthesis of a novel core <b>fucosylated</b> monoglucosylated oligomannose glycan, Glc 1 Man 7 GlcNAc 2 Fuc. Furthermore, no <b>fucosylated</b> Man 9 GlcNAc 2 glycans were detected following inhibition of alpha-mannosidase I with kifunensine. Thus, core fucosylation is prevented by the presence of terminal alpha 1 - 2 mannoses on the 6 -antennae but not the 3 -antennae of the trimannosyl core. <b>Fucosylated</b> Man 5 GlcNAc 2 glycans were also detected on recombinant glycoprotein from HEK 293 T cells following inhibition of Golgi alpha-mannosidase II with swainsonine. The paucity of <b>fucosylated</b> oligomannose glycans in wild-type mammalian cells is suggested to be due to kinetic properties of the pathway rather than the absence of the appropriate catalytic activity.

40|$|<b>Fucosylated</b> glycans {{have many}} {{critical}} biological roles, from leukocyte adhesion to host-microbe interactions. However, {{a molecular level}} understanding of these sugars has been lacking, {{in part due to}} the chemical and structural diversity of glycans that make them challenging to study. In order to gain a deeper understanding of <b>fucosylated</b> glycans, we have explored the use of chemical probes to study these structures. In Chapters 1 and 2, we apply a metabolic labeling technique for the investigation of <b>fucosylated</b> glycans in neurons, where they have been implicated in learning and memory processes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these sugars influence neuronal processes are not well understood, and only a handful of <b>fucosylated</b> glycoproteins have been identified. In order to facilitate our understanding of these processes, we exploit non-natural fucose analogs to identify the fucose proteome in rat cortical neurons, identifying proteins involved in cell adhesion, neuronal signaling, and synaptic transmission. Moreover, we track <b>fucosylated</b> glycoproteins in hippocampal neurons, and show that <b>fucosylated</b> glycoproteins localize to the Golgi, axons, and dendrites, and are enriched in synapses. In Chapter 4, we report a new chemoenzymatic strategy for the sensitive detection of the Fucα(1 - 2) Gal epitope, which has been implicated in tumorigenesis as a potential biomarker of cancer progression. We demonstrate that the approach is highly selective for the Fucα(1 - 2) Gal motif, detects a variety of complex glycans and glycoproteins, and can be used to profile the relative abundance of the motif on live cells, discriminating malignant from normal cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Antibody-dependent {{cellular}} cytotoxicity (ADCC) {{has recently}} been identified {{as one of the}} critical mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of therapeutic antibodies, especially anticancer antibodies. Therapeutic antibodies fully lacking the core fucose of the Fc oligosaccharides have been found to exhibit much higher ADCC in humans than their <b>fucosylated</b> counterparts. However, data which show how fully non-fucosylated antibodies achieve such a high ADCC in human whole blood have not yet been disclosed. The precise mechanisms responsible for the high ADCC mediated by fully non-fucosylated therapeutic antibodies, even in the presence of human plasma, should be explained based on direct evidence of non-fucosylated antibody action in human blood. Methods Using a human ex vivo B-cell depletion assay with non-fucosylated and <b>fucosylated</b> anti-CD 20 IgG 1 s rituximab, we monitored the binding of the therapeutic agents both to antigens on target cells (target side interaction) and to leukocyte receptors (FcγR) on effector cells (effector side interaction), comparing the intensities of ADCC in human blood. Results In the target side interaction, down-modulation of CD 20 on B cells mediated by anti-CD 20 was not observed. Simple competition for binding to the antigens on target B cells between <b>fucosylated</b> and non-fucosylated anti-CD 20 s was detected in human blood to cause inhibition of the enhanced ADCC of non-fucosylated anti-CD 20 by <b>fucosylated</b> anti-CD 20. In the effector side interaction, non-fucosylated anti-CD 20 showed sufficiently high FcγRIIIa binding activity to overcome competition from plasma IgG for binding to FcγRIIIa on natural killer (NK) cells, whereas the binding of <b>fucosylated</b> anti-CD 20 to FcγRIIIa was almost abolished in the presence of human plasma and failed to recruit NK cells effectively. The core fucosylation levels of individual serum IgG 1 from healthy donors was found to be so slightly different that it did not affect the inhibitory effect on the ADCC of <b>fucosylated</b> anti-CD 20. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that removal of <b>fucosylated</b> antibody ingredients from antibody therapeutics elicits high ADCC in human blood by two mechanisms: namely, by evading the inhibitory effects both of plasma IgG on FcγRIIIa binding (effector side interaction) and of <b>fucosylated</b> antibodies on antigen binding (target side interaction). </p...|$|E

In 32 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in 19 subjects with benign liver diseases, total AFP was assayed using an enzyme immunoassay, while AFP fractions (L(1), L(2) and to cathode L(3) <b>fucosylated)</b> were separated using lectin-affinity electrophoresis followed by antibody-affinity blotting.

Alpha 1 - 2 -fucosylated glycoconjugates of human milk are {{component of the}} innate immune system and provide an additional defense for infants. Participation of <b>fucosylated</b> glycotopes in the inhibition of infections caused by some bacteria and/or viruses rely on blocking of lectin-receptors of pathogen.

So far, the efficacy of <b>fucosylated</b> glycoconjugates of human milk in the inhibition of adhesion has been confirmed for Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Rotaviruses, HIV, and Noroviruses. In this process the secretor/nonsecretor status of mother plays an important role.

N-Glycosidic oligosaccharides of the oligomannosidic (OM) and of the N-acetyllactosaminic type have been found, the latter type comprising biantennary structures, without (A) or with (E) bisecting N-acetylglucosamine, and triantennary (C) structures. Analysis of the tryptic and thermolytic glycopeptides of the hemagglutinin allowed the allocation of these oligosaccharides to the individual glycosylation sites. Each attachment site contained {{a unique set of}} oligosaccharides.

40|$|AbstractThree {{glycoprotein}} N-glycans, namely, a disialylated diantennary {{carbohydrate chain}} linked to Asn. a monosialylated, <b>fucosylated</b> diantennary glycopeptide with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine, and a tetrasialylated, <b>fucosylated</b> tetra-antennary oligosaccharide. {{have been investigated}} by two-dimensional NOE and HOHAHA spectroscopy in 1 H 2 O as solvent. The amide protons of all N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid residues could readily be assigned. The large chemical-shift dispersion of the amide resonances of the N-acetylglucosamine residues, allowed the unambiguous assignment of every N-acetyl methyl signal, via strong NOEs. Subspectra could be obtained of all N-acetylglucosamine residues in HOHAHA spectra. These results have as main implication that several biologically important large glycans, will not become amenable for conformational studies by multidimensional NMR in 1 H 2 O solution...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTerminal <b>fucosylated</b> motifs of glycoproteins and {{glycolipid}} {{chains are}} often altered in cancer cells. We investigated {{the link between}} fucosylation changes and critical steps in cancer progression: epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lymph node metastasis. Using mammary cell lines, we demonstrate that during EMT, expression of some <b>fucosylated</b> antigens (e. g. : Lewis Y) is decreased {{as a result of}} repression of the fucosyltransferase genes FUT 1 and FUT 3. Moreover, we identify the fucose-binding bacterial lectin BC 2 L-C-Nt as a specific probe for the epithelial state. Prolectin (CLEC 17 A), a human lectin found on lymph node B cells, shares ligand specificities with BC 2 L-C-Nt. It binds preferentially to epithelial rather than to mesenchymal cells, and microfluidic experiments showed that prolectin behaves as a cell adhesion molecule for epithelial cells. Comparison of paired primary tumors/ lymph node metastases revealed an increase of prolectin staining in metastasis and high FUT 1 and FUT 3 mRNA expression was associated with poor prognosis. Our data suggest that tumor cells invading the lymph nodes and expressing <b>fucosylated</b> motifs associated with the epithelial state could use prolectin as a colonization factor...|$|E
