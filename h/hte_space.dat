40|$|High Temperature Events (HTEs) like {{vegetation}} fires, peat/coal seam burning, {{and active}} volcanoes emit {{large quantities of}} radiative active gases and aerosols into the atmosphere. Quantification of these is required to determine their influence on atmospheric processes. For this purpose a sensor/data fusion technique has been developed to investigate <b>HTEs</b> from <b>space.</b> It combines high spatial, low spectral resolution infrared image and high spectral, low spatial resolution spectrometer data in order to derive parameters such as: HTE type and area, plume gas concentration and temperature, total plume gas contents, etc [...] Simulations of the method rendered promising results. Currently there is no dedicated sensor system in space. Application to AIRS/MODIS data of Portugal 2003 fires have confirmed the need for high spectral resolution The superior spectral resolution of IASI encourages to investigate the IASI/AVHRR combination. ...|$|R

This classic integer programming problem consists of partitioning a sequence of N positive real numbers {a_ 1, a_ 2, [...] ., a_N (the instance) into two sets such that the absolute value of the difference of the sums of a_j over the two sets is minimized. We {{show that there is}} an upper bound α_c N to the number of perfect partitions (i. e. partitions for which that difference is zero) and characterize the statistical properties of the instances for which those partitions exist. In particular, in the case that the two sets have the same cardinality (balanced partitions) we find α_c= 1 / 2. Moreover, we show that the disordered model resulting from <b>hte</b> instance <b>space</b> approach {{can be viewed as a}} model of replicators where the random interactions are given by the Hebb rule.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{measures}} of hip morphology have been recognised as biomechanical {{risk factors for}} the development of osteoarthritis (OA) in the hip. Few studies have examined the relationship between pelvic morphology and OA in a cohort of healthy volunteers with prolonged follow-up. The present study validates a new method for quantifying morphological parameters of the hip and pelvis and looks for relationships between these parameters and 19 -year risk of total hip arthroplasty (THA) due to OA. In order to conduct this investigation, we developed and validated a new software program specifically designed for measuring 23 selected morphological parameters in the pelvis, acetabulum and proximal femur. We tested inter-user reproducibility using 6 investigators, each of whom measured the same group of 10 blinded radiographs. Intra-user reproducibility was measured by the primary investigator measuring 10 blinded radiographs on three separate occasions. Following validation of the new software, a nested case-control study was used with individuals from a well-described cohort of 1003 caucasian women who were recruited in 1989 and followed up for 20 years. A group of 157 individuals (31 THAs & 126 randomly-selected controls) were selected for morphological analysis. Pelvis radiographs taken at study-year two were analyzed for variations in hip morphology using the software. Morphological measurements were then compared between the THA case group and the control group in search of significant associations. THA was used as the clinical outcome measure for severe OA. Most morphological measures were reproducible, with the exception of horizontal toit externe (<b>HTE)</b> and joint <b>space</b> width. The alpha-angle was significantly greater in the THA cases than in the controls (60. 7 degrees vs 48. 1 degrees; p < 0. 001). The lateral centre edge angle (LCE) was significantly smaller in the cases than the controls (30. 0 degrees vs 33. 4 degrees; p = 0. 002). The Extrusion Index (Ext Ind) was significantly greater in the THA cases than in the controls (30 % vs 20 %; p < 0. 001). Significant morphological measures were then adjusted for epidemiological covariates (baseline age, height, weight & radiographic osteoarthritis) using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Alpha angle (Odds ratio 1. 040, degrees; p = 0. 01), LCE (Odds ratio 0. 871, degrees: p < 0. 001) and Ext Ind (Odds ratio 1. 079, percent; p < 0. 001) each remained significantly associated with THA. This investigation demonstrates measurements that provide a useful tool in predicting a woman's risk of THA before she develops radiographic hip OA. These measurements can be made on an AP pelvis radiograph which is cheap, accessible and commonly used as a clinical investigation tool. </p...|$|R
