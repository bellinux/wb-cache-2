The block and associated parts were largely unchanged, but an <b>idler</b> <b>shaft</b> replaced the camshaft in the block, which necessitated plugging the remaining camshaft bearing oiling holes.|$|E
50|$|Many {{transmissions}} and {{gears used}} in automotive and truck applications {{are contained in}} a cast iron case, though more frequently aluminium is used for lower weight especially in cars. There are usually three shafts: a mainshaft, a countershaft, and an <b>idler</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pulleys were {{constructed}} of wood, iron, steel {{or a combination}} thereof. Varying sizes of pulleys were used in conjunction to change the speed of rotation. For example a 40" [...] pulley at 100 rpm would turn a 20" [...] pulley at 200 rpm. Pulleys solidly attached ("fast") to the shaft could be combined with adjacent pulleys that turned freely ("loose") on the <b>shaft</b> (<b>idlers).</b> In this configuration the belt could be maneuvered onto the idler to stop power transmission or onto the solid pulley to convey the power. This arrangement was often used near machines to provide a means of shutting the machine off when not in use. Usually at the last belt feeding power to a machine, a pair of stepped pulleys {{could be used to}} give a variety of speed settings for the machine.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{small scale}} {{sugarcane}} juice extractor using a screw pressing system was designed, constructed and tested. Consideration {{was given to}} the techno-economic status of the micro and small scale sugarcane farmers and juice processors who are the intended users of the machine. The functional parts of the machine included grating unit, extraction unit, prime mover, pulley, transmission belts, bearings and frame. The machine was tested with two varieties of sugarcane each at three levels of moisture content and results showed that average grating efficiency and juice yield of 87. 8 % and 2. 5 % respectively were obtained. Powered by a 3 hp single-phase electric motor, the machine was constructed with materials being available locally at affordable costs. A cottage sugarcane juice extraction plant based on this technology could provide employment {{and at the same time}} produce sugarcane juice and bagasse at low costs for sugar and biofuel industries. An improvement in the design, analysis and optimization of the worm shaft and press cage is expected to improve the juice yield and extraction efficiency; hence, this is highly recommended.
