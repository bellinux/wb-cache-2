50|$|The {{difference}} in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines {{is a result}} of differences in hose construction. Where rubber hoses typically consist of a rubber inner <b>hose</b> <b>wrapped</b> in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional rubber outer sheath, braided stainless steel hoses typically consist of a Teflon® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner <b>hose</b> <b>wrapped</b> in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The stainless wire braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to brake friction surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically coated or covered with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated braided stainless steel hoses have the same essential construction as rubber hoses in terms of an inner <b>hose</b> <b>wrapped</b> in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the braided stainless steel hoses offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system.|$|R
50|$|The new women dance {{throughout}} {{the majority of}} the video. At one point the acrobat woman explodes butt-first into confetti that rains down on the other women. The woman in pigtails continues leading the dancing, unaware that one of the giantess' hoses is coming up behind her. The <b>hose</b> <b>wraps</b> around her waist and violently yanks her off the dance floor. The dancer struggles in the grip of the hose as she is pulled into the giantess' mouth and eaten. After swallowing the woman alive Buttzilla flies away as the video ends.|$|R
5000|$|A {{monument}} [...] "To Honor All the Courageous Volunteer Firefighters of Chicago" [...] {{was erected}} in Rosehill Cemetery in 1864. The monument, designed by Leonard Volk, features a vigilant fireman standing atop a tall column. A fire <b>hose</b> is <b>wrapped</b> around the base. Four old-style hydrants {{make up the}} corners of the memorial. The granite marker at the base contains the names of all firefighters killed in the line of duty.|$|R
40|$|Observing {{the way a}} {{watering}} <b>hose</b> is <b>wrapped</b> on {{a rotating}} cylinder, a catenary shape is detected for the suspended portion of the hose. We calculate the angle α the tangent to the curve at the highest point of the suspended portion makes with the horizontal. By means of this quantity, {{the length of the}} suspended and dragged portions of the hose and the work done to retrieve the hose can be found. The problem may be solved by means of Newtonian mechanics, adopting elementary notions of calculus and trigonometry...|$|R
50|$|Following the {{invention}} of the vulcanization process as a means of curing raw soft rubber into a harder, more useful product, the fire service slowly made the transition from bulky and unreliable leather hose to the unlined linen hose, then to a multi-layer, rubber lined and coated hose with interior fabric reinforcement. This rubber hose was as bulky, heavy, and stiff as a leather hose, but was not prone to leaking. It also proved more durable than unlined linen <b>hose.</b> Its <b>wrapped</b> construction resembled some hoses used today by industry, for example, fuel delivery hoses used to service airliners.|$|R
50|$|Commercially {{available}} {{nitrous oxide}} permitted, including for supercharged and turbocharged engines. Nitrous bottle(s) in driver compartment must {{be equipped with}} a relief valve and vented outside of driver's compartment. Bottle(s) must be stamped with a DOT-1800-pound rating and permanently mounted (no hose clamps or tie <b>wraps).</b> <b>Hoses</b> from bottle(s) to solenoid must be high-pressure steel-braided or NHRA-accepted hoses.|$|R

This discovery can be found in many forms of consumer products including plastic wine corks; shoe and sneaker insoles; casual plastic footwear (such as Crocs); [...] automobile parts (dashboards, bumpers, <b>hoses,</b> gaskets); food <b>wraps</b> and films like poultry bags; [...] synthetic EPDM rubber, hot melt adhesives and more.|$|R
50|$|Unable to find {{a working}} vehicle, the four make {{their way out of}} town on foot. They {{encounter}} Becca's boyfriend, Scotty, at his farm. Soldiers raid the farm, shoot Scotty and his mother, and burn the bodies. They learn that the soldiers have been ordered to shoot all civilians. The group repair an older patrol car in David's garage, and are ambushed by the infected family of Rory. After a struggle, Russell furiously shoots the infected multiple times. This greatly disturbs Judy, who argues with David about Russell's state of mind. On the road, they are spotted by an attack helicopter and drive into a car wash for cover. The workers attack the car and drag Becca out with a <b>wrapped</b> <b>hose,</b> breaking her neck. When {{the rest of the group}} leaves the car to help her, the helicopter destroys the car.|$|R
40|$|Follow {{the steps}} below {{to install the}} Conifer Chamber, and read the {{operational}} considerations for information on configuring the LI- 6400 software to compute leaf temperature using energy balance. Figure 2. Unscrew the knurled adjustment nut. Installation The sensor head handle must be removed to accomodate the 6400 - 05, so a tripod is usually required for making measurements. 1. Remove the male end of the leaf temperature thermocouple connec-tor by pulling straight out, and pull the air hose from {{the underside of the}} leaf chamber. 2. Unplug the log switch (not used with the conifer chamber). If the log switch wires are threaded underneath the bottom cover of the sensor head, this cover must be removed to free the log switch con-nector. a. Turn the sensor head over and remove the 3 Phillips head screws as shown in Figure 1. b. Remove the hose barbs, if necessary. You may be able to slide the cover out from underneath the hose barbs; be careful not to damage the PC board under the cover. If you remove the hose barbs, be sure and note the position of the sample and reference air hoses; the sample <b>hose</b> is <b>wrapped</b> with a piece of black shrink wrap. c. Free the wires. d. Re-assemble the cover {{on the bottom of the}} sensor head. 3. Remove the handle assembly: a. Unscrew the knurled leaf chamber adjustment nut (turn clock-wise) until it is free of the handle (Figure 2). b. With the handle latching mechanism in the closed position, wrap tape or string around the handle (where your hand would nor-mally be) so that it will stay together. Failure to do so may result in the spring coming out. Leave the handle secured in this manner. c. Remove the 2 screws (3 on some instruments) on the back side of the handle, as shown in Figure 3, using a # 1 Phillips head screwdriver. Figure 1. Remove the 3 screws on the sensor head bottom cover...|$|R
40|$|Coil pump is {{considered}} one of non-conventional water pumping devices which use non-conventional energy sources. It is a self supporting system for pumping water. The performance of coil pump under different operating parameters is the main objective concerned of present study. The parameters considered in the present study are submerged ratios, rotational speed and number of coils of the <b>wrapped</b> <b>hose.</b> The experimental results showed significant effects on the pump performance due to the variation in submerged ratio Sr and the pump rotational speed as well. The presence of air with water for submerged ratios 0 Sr 100 % gives the coil pump its pumping action. Increasing the submerged ratio increases the pump flow rate until it reaches its maximum depending on the pump rotational speed, then decreases to zero when the pump is fully immersed. Submerged ratio has a minor effect on the pump maximum static head, it is nearly constant but decreases drastically to zero when the pump submerged ratio reaches 100 %. Increasing the pump rotational speed increases water flow rate until it reaches its maximum depending on the working submerged ratio, then the discharge decreases by increasing the rotational speed. Meanwhile slight changes are obtained for the pump static head when the pump rotational speed changes. The number of pump coils is also one of most effective parameters on the coil pump performance. Increasing number of coils increases the pump head while pump discharge is nearly constant. Good agreement is obtained between the present experimental results and theoretical results developed by other investigators...|$|R
