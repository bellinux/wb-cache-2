40|$|International audienceThe {{representativity}} of the European driving cycles (ECEl 5 and EUDC) was analysed {{with respect}} to speed and acceleration from the results obtained in different instrumented studies carried out in Europe on about a hundred private cars. Then for 70 gas or diesel engined in-use vehicles, emission levels determined according to the applicable standard were compared to CO, HC and NOx emission values measured according to the standard or on in-use vehicles. Thus, the standard values are often exceeded, in particular for CO and HC emissions. ln addition {{it should be noted}} that American, Japanese and <b>European</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> are far behind the current environmental problems relating to air pollution. The relative significance of the different environment elements (population health, forest decline, greenhouse effect, [...] .) changes very rapidly, as weIl as the number of related pollutants. A single standard taking into account a weighted set of pollutants could better and more obviously meet the environment challenge and could provide car manufacturers with a larger choice of "clean" technologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the following: 1) the exposure levels of municipal household waste (MHW) workers to diesel particulate matter (DPM) using elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), total carbon (TC), black carbon (BC), and fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) as indicators; 2) the correlations among the indicators; 3) the optimal indicator for DPM; and 4) factors that influence personal exposure to DPM. A total of 72 workers in five MHW collection companies were assessed over a period of 7 days from June to September 2014. Respirable EC/OC samples were quantified using the thermal optical transmittance method. BC and PM 2. 5 were measured using real-time monitors, an aethalometer and a laser photometer. All results were statistically analyzed for occupational and environmental variables to identify the exposure determinants of DPM. The geometric mean of EC, OC, TC, BC and PM 2. 5 concentrations were 4. 8, 39. 6, 44. 8, 9. 1 and 62. 0 μg/m 3, respectively. EC concentrations were significantly correlated with the concentrations of OC, TC and BC, but not with those of PM 2. 5. The exposures of the MHW collectors to EC, OC, and TC were higher than those of the drivers (p< 0. 05). Workers of trucks meeting Euro 3 emission standard had higher exposures to EC, OC, TC and PM 2. 5 than those working on Euro 4 trucks (p< 0. 05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the job task, European engine emission standard, and average driving speed were the most influential factors in determining worker exposure. We assessed MHW workers' exposure to DPM using parallel sampling of five possible indicators. Of these five indicators, EC was shown to be the most useful indicator of DPM exposure for MHW workers, and the job task, <b>European</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standard,</b> and average driving speed were the main determinants of EC exposure...|$|E
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> is an EU {{directive}} {{which describes}} what emission limits car manufactures {{are required to}} meet. In order to meet these requirements car manufacturers use different techniques and components. In a modern diesel automobile a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) is used to gather soot from the exhausts. As soot accumulates in the DPF, the back pressure increases and the capability to hold more soot decreases. Therefore the DPF continuously needs {{to get rid of}} the stored soot. The soot is removed through a process called regeneration. In order to optimize when to perform regeneration, it is vital to know the amount of soot in the filter. A method for estimating the soot mass in a DPF using a radio frequency-based sensor has been developed. The sensor that has been studied is the Accusolve soot sensor from General Electric. A parameter study has been performed to evaluate the parameters that affects the sensor’s output. Parameters that have been studied include positioning of the sensor, temperature in the DPF, flow rate through the DPF and distribution of soot in the DPF. Different models for estimation of soot mass in the DPF has been developed and analyzed. An uncertainty caused by removing the coaxial cable connectors when weighing the DPF has been identified and methods for minimizing this uncertainty has been presented. Results show that the sensor output is sensitive to temperature, soot distribution and position, and also show some sensitivity to the flow rate. An ARX model, with only one state, is proposed to estimate the soot mass in the DPF, since it gives the best prediction of soot mass and showed good resistance to bias errors and noise in all the input signals...|$|E

40|$|In September 2015, the Volkswagen Group (VW) {{admitted}} {{the use of}} "defeat devices" designed to lower emissions measured during VW vehicle testing for regulatory purposes. Globally, 11 million cars sold between 2008 and 2015 are affected, including about 2. 6 million in Germany. On-road emissions tests have yielded mean on-road NOx̳, emissions for these cars of 0. 85 g. km-¹, over four times the applicable European limit of 0. 18 g. km- 1. This thesis estimates the human health impacts and costs associated with excess emissions from VW cars driven in Germany. A distribution of on-road emissions factors is derived from existing measurements and combined with sales data and a vehicle fleet model to estimate total excess NOx̳ emissions. These emissions are distributed on a 25 by 28 km grid covering Europe, using the German Environmental Protection Agency's (UBA) estimate of the spatial distribution of NOx emissions from passenger cars in Germany. I use the GEOS-Chem chemistry-transport model to predict the corresponding increase in population exposure to fine particulate matter and ozone in the European Union, Switzerland, and Norway, {{and a set of}} concentration-response functions to estimate mortality outcomes in terms of early deaths and of life-years lost. Integrated over the sales period (2008 - 2015), I estimate median premature mortality impacts from VW excess emissions in Germany to be 1, 200 premature deaths in Europe, corresponding to 13, 000 life-years lost and 1. 9 billion EUR in costs associated with life-years lost. Approximately 60 % of mortality costs occur outside Germany. For the current fleet, I estimate that if on-road emissions for all affected VW vehicles in Germany are reduced to the applicable <b>European</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> by the end of 2017, this would avert 29, 000 life-years lost and 4. 1 billion 2015 EUR in health costs (median estimates) relative to a counterfactual case with no recall. by Guillaume P.
