5|$|In August 1931, Amazing was {{acquired}} by Teck Publications, a subsidiary of Bernarr Macfadden's Macfadden Publications. Macfadden's deep pockets helped insulate Amazing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> strain caused by the Great Depression. The schedule of Amazing Stories Quarterly began to slip, but Amazing did not miss {{an issue in the}} early 1930s. However, it became unprofitable to publish over the next few years. Circulation dropped to little more than 25,000 in 1934, and in October 1935 it switched to a bimonthly schedule.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} two-track {{connection is}} planned between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves and to provide a connection to the Jamaica subway yard. The connection would allow for trains to run <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Financial</b> District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. Plans include provisions for an extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street to the Bronx, and an extension south to Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} half of Letcher's term, the state was still {{struggling}} to recover <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> Panic of 1837. Consistent with his Whig views, Letcher blamed the crisis on the federal government's failure to recharter the Second Bank of the United States. To ameliorate the state's dire financial situation, Letcher drastically cut spending, including the suspension of turnpike construction and improvements on the Green, Kentucky, and Licking rivers. These actions greatly reduced the state's deficit and improved its credit. In each of Letcher's years in office, the state showed a small but growing budget surplus.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, Letcher {{was chosen}} as the Whig nominee for {{governor}} of Kentucky over William Owsley. In the general election, Letcher won by landslide over Judge Richard French. Letcher's fiscally conservative policies helped Kentucky recover <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> Panic of 1837. By the end of his term, the state was experiencing budget surpluses and state banks had resumed specie payments. After Letcher left office, he was appointed Minister to Mexico by President Zachary Taylor. Following this, he made an attempt to return to the U.S. House, but was defeated by Democrat John C. Breckinridge. Letcher's defeat in Henry Clay's home district was a strong indication of the decline of Whig influence in Kentucky. Though he remained active in politics, Letcher never again sought public office. He died on January 24, 1861.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1940s, {{the club}} invented {{the notion of}} penyes, a mix between a fan club and a {{financial}} support club, {{during a time when}} the club was in need of financial and public support in face of the hostility of Francisco Franco's dictatorship. The first Penya Solera, was formed in 1944 by a group of supporters and former players of the team. The penyes would later exhibit their financial prowess in 1953, when they proposed the building of the Camp Nou. Inspiration was drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> plan Athletic Bilbao, a rival team, used to build San Mamés, where an association of penyes pledged to finance the construction. As a result, the subsequent construction of the stadium put the club into its supporters' hands, giving the penyes political influence over the club, which still lasts today.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation was optioned in Hollywood, but Coyle was displeased when {{industry}} officials {{wanted him to}} change the ending and make the sex scenes more risque. Due to complications <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> crisis of 2007–2010, the Hollywood discussions eventually collapsed. It did not receive a national release, but played at theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, Fargo, North Dakota, and several cities throughout Minnesota, including Minneapolis and Duluth. Coyle first publicly showed the film on December 26, 2008, at the Omaha hospice where his father Jim was staying for an audience of about 15 people. Jim Coyle, who died {{a few weeks after}} the screening, loved the film, describing it as very powerful and truthful. It officially premiered on April 26, 2009, at the Newport Beach Film Festival in Newport Beach, California.|$|E

5|$|Most {{information}} about the carucage comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> records associated with its collection, {{but there is no}} detailed description of the way it was collected or assessed, unlike the account of the workings of the Exchequer given in the Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer, written in about 1180. Government records such as the Pipe Rolls, the Memoranda Rolls, and other financial records, some of which are specific to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea behind}} the episode came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> crisis of Northern Rock in late 2007; the {{producers}} wanted {{to set up a}} story about a bank collapse so severe it could result in an economic collapse.

About six million viewers saw the episode from both BBC One and Three broadcasts; the BBC One ratings were steady despite heavy competition from I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! on ITV1.

5|$|S.S.C. Napoli was {{expelled}} from the professional league in 2004. Thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., the sports title was transferred to Napoli Soccer (later the new Napoli) in the same year, while the old Napoli was liquidated. On the eve of bankruptcy, the club was in deep financial trouble to achieve positive operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading). At that time the club was using cash plus player swap to boost short term profit (€28,329,090 in 2000–01; €17,721,534 in 2001–02 season), but also increased the long term cost (as amortization) by purchasing players. In the second last season before bankruptcy, the club was partially saved by the non-standard accounting practice of amortization. {{it was due to}} Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Milan and prime minister of Italy, introducing Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B. Napoli dramatically reduced the amortization from €33,437,075 to €1,659,088 + €4,660,123, due to €46,601,225 of the intangible asset (player contracts), which was deferred to amortize in 10-year installments, instead of varying from 1 to 5 years by the length of player contract. However, the practice was unable to save the club <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> aid from a sugar daddy, when the owner withdrew.|$|E
