5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{reduction}} or deficiency {{can also}} be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically {{in the treatment of}} copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on copper ions. This is a promising avenue for investigation of treatments for cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and other diseases that involve a pathologic proliferation of blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{basis for}} binding of RNA to the argonaute protein was examined by X-ray crystallography of the binding domain of an RNA-bound argonaute protein. Here, the phosphorylated 5' {{end of the}} RNA strand enters a conserved basic surface pocket and makes contacts through a divalent cation (an atom with two positive charges) such as magnesium and by aromatic stacking (a process that allows more than one atom to share an electron by passing it back and forth) between the 5' nucleotide in the siRNA and a conserved tyrosine residue. This site is thought to form a nucleation site for the binding of the siRNA to its mRNA target. Analysis of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> of mismatches in either the 5’ or 3’ end of the guide strand has demonstrated that the 5’ end of the guide strand is likely responsible for matching and binding the target mRNA, while the 3’ end is responsible for physically arranging target mRNA into a cleavage-favorable RISC region.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe potent inhibitors {{of protein}} kinase C (PKC), H 7, {{staurosporine}}, and staurosporine derivatives, were examined for their <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> on novel PKC (nPKC) isozymes δ and ε. H 7 and staurosporine, usually used as selective inhibitors of PKC, showed similar <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> on cPKC (a mixture of cPKCα,β, and γ) and nPKCδ and ε. The <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of K 252 a, a non-selective protein kinase inhibitor, on cPKC was 3. 2 - and 22 -fold {{higher than those}} on nPKCε and δ, respectively. The staurosporine derivatives UCN- 01 and UCN- 01 -Me also showed selective inhibition of cPKC...|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of aspirin's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties was unknown through the drug's heyday in the early- to mid-twentieth century; Heinrich Dreser's explanation, widely accepted since {{the drug was}} first brought to market, was that aspirin relieved pain by acting on the central nervous system. In 1958 Harry Collier, a biochemist in the London laboratory of pharmaceutical company Parke Davis, began investigating the relationship between kinins {{and the effects of}} aspirin. In tests on guinea pigs, Collier found that aspirin, if given beforehand, inhibited the bronchoconstriction effects of bradykinin. He found that cutting the guinea pigs' vagus nerve did not affect the action of bradykinin or the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> of aspirin—evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation, rather than on the central nervous system. In 1963, Collier began working with University of London pharmacology graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise {{mechanism of}} aspirin's effects. However, it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings-on in live research animals, and in vitro tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like in vivo tests.|$|E

30|$|A {{previous}} {{study on the}} effects of monoterpenoids on the germination of Lactuca sativa seeds showed that the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of alcohols, phenols and ketones were larger than those of the corresponding hydrocarbons [16]. Alicyclic monoterpene compounds containing a keto group conjugated with a double bond in particular were highlighted as showing the largest <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> against the germination of L. sativa seeds [17]. We have proposed that the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of terpinen- 4 -ol and α-terpineol on the germination of R. sativus and B. rapa seeds were greater than those of bornyl acetate, α-pinene and β-pinene [13].|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, it was {{recognized}} that hydrocarbons and phenols showed weak to no <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> against the germination of {{both types of}} seeds, whereas alcohols and ketones, {{with the exception of}} sobrerol, exhibited stronger <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects.</b> Although any correlation between the effects and the number of hydroxyl groups present in these compounds cannot be used as a definitive indication of their activities, these data are in good agreement with previous investigations carried out on activity [16, 17]. In particular, the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of alcohols and ketones against the germination of R. sativus seeds were relatively larger than those encountered against B. rapa.|$|R

A group of adult readers showed <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> on pseudowords based on high-frequency words only in lexical decision.

40|$|Sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P), {{a product}} of sphingosine kinases (SphK), mediates diverse {{biological}} processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, motility, and apoptosis. In an effort to search and identify specific inhibitors of human SphK, the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of synthetic sphingoid analogs on kinase activity were examined. Among the analogs tested, we found two, SG 12 and SG 14, that have specific <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> on hSphK 2. N,N-Dimethylsphingosine (DMS), a well-known SphK inhibitor, displayed <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> for both SphK 1 and SphK 2, as well as protein kinase C. In contrast, SG 12 and SG 14 exhibited selective <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> on hSphK 2. Furthermore, SG 14 did not affect PKC. In isolated platelets, SG 14 blocked the conversion of sphingosine into sphingosine 1 -phosphate significantly.

40|$|<b>Inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of DSCG, tranilast, ketotifen, azelastine, {{antiallergic}} agents, and nicardipine, a {{calcium ion}} antagonist, on (45) Ca uptake and histamine release by rat peritoneal mast cells were examined when {{the cells were}} stimulated with antigen and com. 48 / 80. All of these agents inhibited both (45) Ca uptake and histamine release by mast cells stimulated with antigen in a dose-dependent manner. When the cells were stimulated with both antigen and phosphatidylserine (PS), <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of DSCG and tranilast on (45) Ca uptake decreased, although effets of ketotifen and nicardipine were not affected {{by the addition of}} PS. Only the effect of DSCG on the release of histamine decreased in the experiments in which PS was added. When the cells were stimulated with com. 48 / 80, <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of DSCG and tranilast on (45) Ca uptake and histamine release decreased, although the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of ketotifen and nicardipine did not decrease. The effects of the preincubation time with the agents on (45) Ca uptake and histamine release of mast cells were examined.
