5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{can swim}} rather slowly by {{opening and closing}} its valves. It {{advances}} in this way with {{the rim of the}} shell to the front. It can detect the movement of nearby objects with its rudimentary eyes and, in order to escape predators, can move much more swiftly umbones first, by clapping its valves shut. A remotely controlled camera stationed on the sea bed <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> find that all the scallops that were originally in its field of view have moved off to other locations.|$|E
25|$|He is {{essentially}} a satirist without any stable point of view from which to aim his satire. He <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> turn his back on what he has been sniping at to demolish what he has just been defending. He is contemptuous of everybody except the opportunist and the unscrupulous little woman who, {{at some point in}} every picture, labels the hero a poor sap. That the invariable fairy godfather of each picture is not only expressive of his own cold-blooded cynicism but of typical Hollywood fantasy {{is an example of how}} this works. Another phase of his attack is shrouding in slapstick the fact that the godfather pays off not for perseverance or honesty or ability but merely from capriciousness.|$|E

I am glad to hear you say that a man would <b>be</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> decide in this manner; for it shows his identity with a monikin. We hold that all of us <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> think most of ourselves on such occasions." ...|$|R
500|$|Watson {{concludes that}} (a) [...] "most moves have {{disadvantages}} {{as well as}} advantages, so an extra move is not always an unqualified blessing"; (b) [...] "with his extra information about what White is doing, Black can better react to the new situation"; and (c) because a draw {{is likely to be}} more acceptable to Black than to White, White <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> avoid lines that allow drawish simplifications, while Black may not object to such lines.|$|E
500|$|In dissent, Justice Gummow {{recognised}} that [...] "the focusing {{of attention}} on whether detention is 'penal or punitive in character' <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> mislead", and emphasised {{the purpose of}} detention as the fundamental criterion by which non-judicial detention was allowed in previous cases. He said that [...] "it cannot be for the executive government to determine the placing {{from time to time}} of that boundary line which marks off a category of deprivation of liberty from the reach of Ch III." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{cosmopolitan}} {{and widespread}} species, S.flavida {{is common in}} temperate regions such as the Pacific Northwest region of North America, extending north to Alaska; it is, however, unknown in Mexico. In Europe, it has been collected from Britain, Germany, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Scandinavia, and Italy; in Asia, {{it has been reported}} from India Japan, and Turkey. Spathularia flavida is considered a protected species in Slovakia. One field guide says of this species, [...] "that one <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> see [...] while down on the ground looking for something else." ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} three supplements to a design lingua franca [1]: extensions, enclaves, and exotic ideas (EEE). The goal of EEE {{is to be}} able to decide upon novel suggestions for improving the established design conceptualization of an application. Extension ideas <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful because they fit within the existing conceptualizations, whereas enclave ideas, now matter how valid on their own, <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> conflict. And exotic ideas might be valuable but <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> lead to complexity, being as they are, additions to the existing conceptualization. The simplicity of EEE allows designers and non-designers (e. g. stakeholders, business analysts, managers, etc.) to communicate design ideas in a more neutral and productive way...|$|R

One knows from experience in trial cases that natives <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> take up the attitude [...] "that is their business", and that the principal actors in such a scene <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> resent the interference of outsiders. In any event, nobody is ambitious to overpower an aggressor armed with a lethal weapon.|$|R
500|$|Stanley's {{achievements}} in office were mixed. He established various specialist departments to manage output in numerous industries and reorganised {{the structure of}} the Board. However, despite previous successes with unions, his negotiations were ineffective. Writing to Leader of the House of Commons and future Prime Minister Bonar Law in January 1919, Lloyd George described Stanley as having [...] "all the glibness of Runciman and that <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> take in innocent persons like you and me... Stanley, to put it quite bluntly, is a funk, and {{there is no room for}} funks in the modern world." [...] Stanley left the Board of Trade and the government in May 1919 and returned to the UERL.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{received}} conflicting reviews by both The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The reviewer for the World said, [...] "This well known story is rendered into a motion picture {{in a way}} that will please the most exacting. ... The picture proves that a good rendering of even an old story is attractive. The audience apparently delights in the character of John Halifax. He is quite as good on the curtain as he is in the book, and there he has always been a favorite. The different parts are played to perfection. The character of the daughter and the ill son are both faithfully reproduced and seem to live before the audience." [...] The Mirror reviewer The film is not as well acted as Thanhouser pictures usually are. The strict character of the old Quaker is insufficiently expressed and <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> leave the audience to guess why John is ordered out, and the strike scene is far from impressive. The mob to a man wave their sticks incessantly, instead of portraying intense rage as should have been done." [...] Bowers noted that the Mirror was not a neutral party in respect to the works of the Independent producers.|$|E
2500|$|Every {{precaution}} was to {{be taken}} against aerial attacks. Mounted formations should adopt open formations and move off tracks or roads. Camouflaging tents with khaki and dark green paint, was suggested. [...] "Hospitals should have a cross with red lamps, the lights now used not being sufficiently distinctive. Hospitals should not be within [...] of justifiable targets as the red lights form a good landmark and bomb dropping from a height <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> be inaccurate." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{everlasting}} {{and eternal}} mean something which has neither beginning nor end. That is certain. The wisest of the heathen knew that: but we <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> forget it. We <b>are</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> think a thing may be everlasting, {{because it has}} no end, though it has a beginning. We are careless thinkers, if we fancy that. God is eternal because he has neither beginning nor end.|$|R

2500|$|... "We {{are having}} a {{particularly}} hungry period and [...] can quite truthfully say that our mouths water, and that we 'slaver' as dogs do before meals. Some of us find it advisable to rise slowly after lying down, as due to malnutrition, any rapid movement <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> cause dizziness or even a black-out ... one morning recently I awoke and discovered to my horror that my sight had become very dim. Later I realised {{this was due to}} vitamin deficiency in our poor diet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The only {{negative}} {{review of}} the musical appeared in the New York Post: The critic wrote that [...] "it all seemed just a trifle too cute", stating that the score consisted of [...] "a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation." [...] She concluded that the show was [...] "very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> become a little tiresome." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of Churchill's colleagues {{hoped that}} he might retire after the Queen's Coronation in May 1953. Eden wrote to his son on 10 April [...] "W gets daily older & <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> ... waste {{a great deal of}} time ... the outside world has little idea how {{difficult}} that becomes. Please make me retire before I am 80!" [...] However, Eden's serious illness (he nearly died after a series of botched operations on his bile duct) allowed Churchill to take control of foreign affairs from April 1953.|$|E

2500|$|West Indies {{retained}} the Wisden Trophy against England 3–0: [...] "A third factor <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> be overlooked {{because of the}} brilliance of the batting and bowling. [...] It was Lloyd's captaincy. He led his men with a sure touch, kept them together, maintained discipline and began to act as the father figure of the side" [...] (Manley). [...] Clyde Walcott resumed as team manager, [...] "As a manager who had played the game, he lent credibility to {{what he was trying to}} instill in the players," [...] said Deryck Murray ...|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt justifies his own {{contrary}} attitude at length: [...] "When one {{is found}} fault with for nothing, or for doing one's best, one <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> give the world their revenge. All the former {{part of my}} life I was treated as a cipher; and since I have got into notice, I have been set upon as a wild beast. When this is the case, and you can expect as little justice as candour, you naturally in self-defence take refuge in a sort of misanthropy and cynical contempt for mankind." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, Michael {{published}} a novel, Never Say Die, about a morganatic marriage, written in resentment at not being allowed back into Russia. In the preface he wrote: [...] "Belonging, as I do, to the Imperial Blood, {{and being a}} member of one of the reigning houses, I should like to prove to the world how wrong it is in thinking - as the majority of mankind <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> do - that we are the happiest beings on this earth. There is no doubt that we are well situated, but is wealth the only happiness in the world?" [...] While remaining [...] "devoted" [...] to Sophie, Michael nevertheless often fell in love with pretty girls.|$|E

2500|$|Karen <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> {{point out}} the ignorant prejudices {{of most of the}} staff, as they, in turn, tease her {{for not being able to}} find a date. Findlay {{suspects}} her of being a lesbian after she is featured in a feminist magazine as one of ten women in the news who make a difference. He [...] "connects the dots" [...] of her different personality traits to arrive at this conclusion, including observations of her not being able to sustain a male-female relationship, the fact that she knows the editor of a women's magazine, and that she is aggressive, argumentative, sure of herself and moralistic. Karen, however, is not a lesbian, as this only illustrates Findlay's way of thinking.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{is for the}} reader, in {{the light}} of {{subsequent}} events, to judge how far the Councillors were right or wrong, and to see for himself who really did the pioneer work of building up the prosperity of Perak. In the published accounts of British rule in Malaya, sufficient prominence has not always been given to the efforts of these early pioneers; the reaper, intent on his own work, <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> forget the man who sowed. These Council Minutes are the record of the work of the sowers. A study of that record will show how much the State owes to Sir Hugh Low and to his fellow-Councillors, especially Raja Dris (the present Sultan), Sir William Maxwell, and the Chinese , Ah Kwi [...] and Ah Yam." ...|$|E
2500|$|Congressman Grayson {{states that}} Killswitch is [...] "One {{of the most}} honest {{accounts}} of the battle to control the Internet -- and access to information itself.". Richard von Busack of the Metro Silicon Valley, writes of Killswitch, [...] "Some of the most lapidary use of found footage this side of The Atomic Café". Fred Swegles of the Orange County Register, remarks, [...] "Anyone who values unfettered access to online information <b>is</b> <b>apt</b> <b>to</b> be captivated by Killswitch, a gripping and fast-paced documentary." [...] Kathy Gill of GeekWire asserts that [...] "Killswitch {{is much more than}} a dry recitation of technical history. Director Ali Akbarzadeh, producer Jeff Horn, and writer Chris Dollar created a human centered story. A large part of that connection comes from Lessig and his relationship with Swartz." ...|$|E
