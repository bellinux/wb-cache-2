50|$|At {{the end of}} 1997, {{the rights}} to operate Kentucky Kingdom were sold to Premier Parks for $64 million. Following the acquisition, Batman and DC Comics themes were added to Kentucky Kingdom. As a result, T2 was painted black for the 1999 season. This was due to a plan by Six Flags to retheme part of the park as Gotham City, and rebrand T2 as Batman: The Ride and its next <b>door</b> <b>roller</b> coaster, Chang, as Riddler's Revenge. However, these plans never came to fruition, while T2 {{retained}} its new coat of black paint.|$|E
50|$|Roller doors ("Sheet Doors"-USA) {{are usually}} {{constructed}} of corrugated steel. They evolved from cover window and door coverings. Other materials {{can be used}} (e.g.; transparent corrugated fibreglass) where strong impact resistance is not required. Corrugations give the door strength against impacts. A typical single car garage roller door has a preloaded spring inside the rolling mechanism. The spring reduces the effort required to open the door. Larger roller doors in commercial premises are not sprung (except USA) and use a manual pulley and chain system or a geared motor to raise and lower (roll up and roll down) the <b>door.</b> <b>Roller</b> doors cannot be effectively insulated.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{model was}} applied to the passenger door unit of a fleet of 38 Class 380 trains operating on Scotland’s railway network. The data required for the analysis were collected from the literature, the company’s maintenance management software system called EQUINOX, the UK’s railway performance management software DATASYS BUGLE and the UK’s train movements monitoring system called TRUST. The five why’s technique was used to identify the potential failure modes of door unit components and their root causes, including the defects in relation to pushbuttons, door control unit (DCU), mechanical failures, light barrier, door drive, guard operating panel (GOP), limit switches, loose plugs, obstructions, <b>door</b> <b>roller</b> and lubrication. The results of the risk evaluation showed that the nine failure modes (12  % {{of the total number of}} failure modes identified) are “high critical” to door system functionality. The results of this study were used not only for assessing the performance of current maintenance practices, but also to plan a cost-effective preventive maintenance (PM) programme for different components of rolling stock. To avoid the recurrence of the failure modes, a new mileage-based preventive maintenance (PM) programme including 14 tasks was proposed.|$|E
50|$|The main factory {{building}} is two stories high, rectangular, and runs parallel to George Street, on a north-south axis. It is constructed of concrete, with a brick extension to the north, and has fibrous cement sheeting and battens {{on the upper}} levels {{to the north and}} south. It has a gabled roof of galvanised iron with skylights, and a clerestory runs along the apex of {{the southern part of the}} roof. The western side of the building facing George Street has been stuccoed. There are four <b>doors,</b> a high-set <b>roller</b> <b>door,</b> and two hatches on the western side of the factory, five <b>roller</b> <b>doors</b> on the south side, and a <b>roller</b> <b>door</b> on the north side. There is a high-set loading bay with <b>roller</b> <b>door</b> on the southern end of the east side, and a concrete loading dock juts out between this and the engine room to the north. Windows are generally steel-framed with wire-covered panes, or consist of panelled glass louvres.|$|R

The original station is constructed of multi-coloured red bricks in a stretcher bond, and a modern one-storey extension, constructed with similar materials, protrudes {{to the south of}} the station. A large V-shaped metal billboard stands just to the south of the station building, on the Oxley Avenue frontage.|$|R
5000|$|A unique [...] "roll-up" [...] system {{generally}} {{defines a}} high-speed door from a conventional <b>roller</b> <b>door.</b> The door's main {{objective is to}} produce a high opening speed and the guiding system must allow smooth operations with minimal friction. Effortless movement will ensure the longevity of the door's moving parts and operating soundness. The latest versions of high quality high-speed doors use a spiral guiding system, thus keeping the door blade apart through a whole operating cycle, ensuring effortless movement of the <b>door's</b> <b>roller</b> devices in the guiding system and contributing to the excessive high speed. Excessive because these doors, by opening so fast and closing very slowly, {{are just trying to}} avoid getting their rigid closing edge caught by a forklift, {{at the expense of the}} insulation.|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of high-speed <b>roller</b> <b>door</b> with water film has improved in this study. The flameproof water film system {{is equipped with}} a water circulating device to reduce the water consumption of water film system. The water film is generated at the roller box of the high-speed <b>roller</b> <b>door</b> in this study. The heating test is done with the full-scale heating furnace. Both cases of the water film on unexposed surface and water film on exposed surface passed the fire resistance test based on ISO 834, proving that the high-speed <b>roller</b> <b>door</b> with water film system has 120 A fire resistance period. The main findings indicate that the water film on exposed surface shows that as the amount of water film evaporated by high temperature inside the furnace must be greater than the evaporation capacity of water film on unexposed surface, the required water supply is 660 [*]L more than the water film on unexposed surface...|$|R
5000|$|The modest, {{freestanding}} single-storey pavilion {{is constructed}} of 200mm cement blocks, painted white, with recessed infill panels of colonial-bond red brick. It {{stands on a}} plinth of rusticated concrete blocks, and on the street elevation the concrete floor is 600mm above ground level. The timber-framed hipped roof is clad in corrugated iron, and is truncated on the street elevation by a curved Flemish-influenced gable. Insulators protrude from the upper centre of the gable screen, and two conduit holes remain {{on the north side}} of the street elevation. Underneath the gable screen is a steel <b>roller</b> <b>door,</b> inset with a smaller door, or [...] "wicket". Crude timber stairs have been added in front of the wicket. To each side of the <b>roller</b> <b>door</b> there is a metal-framed six-pane obscure wire-glass window, set within a recessed brick panel.

40|$|Tropical Cyclone Yasi (TC Yasi) made {{landfall}} in {{the early}} hours of Thursday 3 rd February 2011 with the eye passing over the Mission Beach region in northern Queensland. The range of wind speeds across the impacted region was equivalent to 55 % to 90 % of V 500 which is the appropriate design wind speed for housing in this region and is nominally 69 m/s. The Cyclone Testing Station (CTS) undertook a detailed study of the region, (Boughton et al, 2011) and found that across the whole study area, in general, housing that had been properly designed and constructed to the current building regulations performed well, but houses built prior to the 1980 s had more significant damage. The CTS study reinforced the need to design the whole low rise building envelope, including cladding, <b>doors,</b> windows, <b>roller</b> <b>doors,</b> eaves lining and skylights to resist the expected ultimate limit states wind forces. It also highlighted the role of dominant openings in realising the internal pressures in buildings and made recommendations for changes to wind specification of <b>roller</b> <b>doors,</b> tiled roofs, and water penetration. This paper presents key finding from the CTS study. Implementation of many of these recommendations has commenced...|$|R
5000|$|Approached {{across a}} {{concrete}} driveway from Dayboro Road, {{the building has}} two entrances - the main entrance which is defined by recessed brickwork is a timber door shielded by a decorative metal door {{and the other is}} a <b>roller</b> <b>door</b> defined by a projecting surround in darker brick. Lettering over the main entrance doorway identifies the building as [...] "Pine Shire Council Pumping Station" [...] and a plaque commemorating the turning of the sod ceremony is fixed between the main and <b>roller</b> <b>door</b> entrances. A bank of narrow louvres sits over the <b>roller</b> <b>door.</b> The long elevations contain five bays defined by plain projecting pilasters with a six-light frosted wire-glass steel framed window to the middle of each bay. The river elevation is divided into three bays by projecting pilasters with the end bays accommodating sets of windows matching those found on the long elevations. The window to the south bay accommodates a metal exhaust vent to the upper half. The sets of six-light windows have a fixed tilted lower middle light.|$|R

50|$|High-speed {{doors are}} door systems, mainly used in {{industrial}} applications. They are technical enhancements of the generally known sectional doors, PVC fabric <b>doors</b> or <b>roller</b> shutters. The main {{difference is that}} the durable construction provides a higher operating speed and they are able to sustain a higher number of cycles (opening and closing cycles) and require lower maintenance and repair cost. Depending on the intended field of application, horizontal or vertical operating door types are available.|$|R
50|$|The Department of Works plans {{show the}} {{ambulance}} station as comprising a plant room (for the ambulance and equipment), casualty room, bearers' room, board room and superintendent's room. The building was lowset to allow vehicular access from Randall Street. Pedestrian access was via a porch with seating accommodation from Churchill Street. Set {{to one side}} and {{to the rear of the}} station was the superintendent's residence linked to the station through the casualty room. Changes have been minor and include an addition to the northern elevation of the plant room (a possibility indicated in the original plans), replacement of the garage <b>doors</b> with a <b>roller</b> <b>door</b> and the replacement of the timber picket fence with a wire fence.|$|R
