After the operation, all patients had compression stockings, 65 were treated with calcium heparin and 67 with the intermittent plantar pump. DVT was diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound and thermography, followed by phlebography. There were 23 cases of DVT (35. 4 %) in the heparin group, with 16 m&jor and seven minor thromboses. In the <b>impulse</b> <b>pump</b> group there were nine cases (13. 4 %) with three major and six minor thromboses. The differences for all thromboses and for major thromboses were both significant at p < 0. 005.

Both the oxygen and carbon monoxide were evaluated as turbine working fluids for a full expander engine cycle used in the MAV. Two oxygen working fluid engines and four carbon monoxide engines were investigated. The maximum hot-gas-side wall temperature was limited to either 445 K (800 R) or 556 K (1000 R) over a range of working fluid mass flows. An engine thrust of 44. 5 kN (1, 000 lb(sub f)) was assumed. The engine characteristics of coolant inlet pressure, total engine length, specific <b>impulse,</b> <b>pump</b> efficiencies, and turbine power required were optimized. Of the six engines evaluated, the study showed that either type of working fluid was feasible for a MAV engine.

However, constraints complaints by the people are easily damaged on its rubber of waste valve and delivery valve of the hydram pump. In addition, the reliability of the plate valve models is also awfully where its rubber of the valve is quickly worn or damaged. It has been reducing the interest of the community in utilizing hydram pumps. Moreover, there is no yet a comprehensive procedure in planning and making dimensions of hydram pump. Then, design of a spherical shaped delivery valve model on the hydram pump has been made and tested. Considering that hydram pump is also called <b>impulse</b> <b>pump</b> which work due to the effects of water hammer, therefore, it need to know the forces that take place in the hydram pump. Then, from these forces can be calculated dimensions of hydram pump and its performance can be predicted. From {{the results of the study}} shows that dimensions and performance of the hydram pump is very close to the results of assessment that has been done. Finally, a procedure in planning a hydram pump has been recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the work was to {{describe}} the physical principles of <b>impulse</b> <b>pumping</b> and investigate its potential applications in petroleum engineering. Investigations of the potential applications of <b>impulse</b> <b>pumping</b> were based on analysis of head, flow rate and efficiency performances for pumping of hydrocarbon fluids. The secondary purpose of the work was to analyse pressure wave propagation and attenuation models in fluid-filled production tubings. Additionally, one dimensional numerical simulation methods were investigated for accurate modelling of pressure transient events in pipelines, such as water hammer phenomena. Pressure wave propagation, transmission and reflection characteristics were first studied. Finite volume methods were also studied for numerical simulation of one-dimensional pressure transient phenomena. Accuracy of pressure wave attenuation models was then analysed using a contradiction method, relying on analysis of numerical simulation tools for pressure transient events. <b>Impulse</b> <b>pumping</b> physical principles were next described using fundamentals of pressure wave propagation. A numerical simulation tool was then developed to reproduce <b>impulse</b> <b>pumping</b> physical principles, using a finite volume numerical scheme. <b>Impulse</b> <b>pumping</b> performances were modelled afterwards in terms of lifting heights, flow rates and efficiency, based on results from the developed numerical simulation tool. Potential applications of <b>impulse</b> <b>pumping</b> in petroleum engineering were then analysed using the performance model. <b>Impulse</b> <b>pumping</b> generates flow from bottomhole to wellhead using pressure waves generated at wellhead. Fluid can be transported from bottomhole to wellhead without theoretical lifting height limitations using <b>impulse</b> <b>pumping.</b> <b>Impulse</b> <b>pumping</b> performances were illustrated and a range of petroleum engineering applications was investigated. <b>Impulse</b> <b>pumping</b> greatest efficiency is obtained for artificial lift of water from shallow wells. <b>Impulse</b> <b>pumping</b> performances depend on pressure wave amplitude, wellhead pressure, lifting height, fluid compressibility and volume occupied in the production tubing.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to measure the effect of intermittent pneumatic compression of the plantar venous plexus on popliteal vein (PV) and common femoral vein (CFV) velocities measured by duplex ultrasound scanning. Methods: Thirty lower limbs in 15 healthy volunteers had venous duplex scanning measurement of PV and CFV velocities before and during foot pumping with an arteriovenous <b>impulse</b> foot <b>pump</b> system. Venous velocities were measured at two pump pressure settings (100 mm Hg, 200 mm Hg) and during two <b>pump</b> <b>impulse</b> durations (short = l second, normal = 3 seconds). All limbs were examined with the subjects in the supine position, and then measurements were repeated with subjects in the 15 -degree reverse Trendelenburg position. The mean maximum venous velocity (MVV) produced by foot pumping was compared with resting venous velocity at each anatomic location and for each technologic variable. Results: <b>Impulse</b> foot <b>pumping</b> produced a statistically significant increase in MVV in both the PV and the CFV compared with resting velocities. This significant increase was observed for both pressure settings and both impulse durations, and no differences produced by these two individual variables could be detected. The increase in MVV produced by foot pumping was similar for limbs in the supine position and those examined in the reverse Trendelenburg position. The percentage increase in MVV produced by foot pumping was significantly higher in the PV than in the CFV. Conclusions: Intermittent pneumatic compression of the plantar venous plexus produces measurable increases in venous outflow from the lower limbs of normal subjects. This study seems to justify further evaluation of the effectiveness of this technique for mechanical deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in selected high-risk patient groups.

To address this question, we studied 20 healthy volunteers with duplex ultrasound. The peak velocity in the popliteal vein was measured at rest with the legs flat, foot-up, and foot-down, then it was measured when the AV <b>Impulse</b> Foot <b>Pump</b> was activated.

40|$|Patients who undergo total knee {{replacement}} (TKR) are at {{high risk}} of venous thromboembolism. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) are the most suitable chemical prophylactic agents but there are some uncertainties about their safety and effectiveness. The foot pump offers an alternative. We randomised 229 patients undergoing primary, unilateral TKR to receive either the A-V <b>Impulse</b> foot <b>pump</b> or enoxaparin, a LMWH. Ascending venography was undertaken between the sixth and eighth postoperative day in 188 patients without knowledge of the randomisation category. The prevalence of venographic deep-vein thrombosis was 58 % (57 / 99) in the foot-pump group and 54 % (48 / 89) in the LMWH group which was not statistically significant. There were four cases of proximal thrombi and two of fatal pulmonary emboli in the foot-pump group and none in the LMWH group.

He found that continuous use of a pneumatic compression device (A-V <b>impulse</b> hand <b>pump)</b> for 48 h resulted in reduction in swelling of 78.6 %, and intermittent use a reduction of 69.4 %; they also found subjective reduction in pain perception and objective improvement in hand function. The reason for the improvement seen with the A-V impulse system could {{be an increase in}} the velocity of venous return as demonstrated by Duplex scanning of the medial cubital vein. In our pneumatic compression group we used the A-V impulse system four times per day for one hour, and this regime produced better results than cryotherapy. The reduction in swelling produces increased mobility of the MP and PIP joints, as we found in the EVAL assessment measurements. The increased range of motion of the uninvolved joints maintains mobility of joint capsule, ligaments and tendons, increases the circulation and assists in the reduction of oedema, as lack of mobility impairs outflow from the arm, causing increased oedema in the hand [2].|$|R

Exposure of the acetabulum by distraction of the femur with a hook was less likely to occlude flow than retraction with bone levers. Adequate exposure of the femoral shaft by adduction, flexion and either internal or external rotation caused cessation of flow in all cases.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a randomized clinical trial {{to compare the}} effectiveness of the A-V <b>Impulse</b> System foot <b>pump</b> for reducing the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients under edoxaban thromboprophylaxis. Patients undergoing primary TKA at our institution between September 2013 and March 2015 were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. The patients were randomized to use the foot pump (n = 58) and not to use the foot pump (n = 62). Both groups were given prophylactic edoxaban. Primary outcomes were any DVT as detected by bilateral ultrasonography up to postoperative day 10 (POD 10) and pulmonary embolism (PE) up to POD 28. The safety outcomes were bleeding and death of any cause up to POD 28. Plasma D-dimer levels were measured before TKA and on POD 10 after TKA. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) -class anti-PF 4 /heparin antibodies were measured using an IgG-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The incidences of any DVT up to POD 28 were 31. 0 % and 17. 7 % in patients with or without the foot pump, respectively. The incidences of major bleeding up to POD 28 were 5. 1 % and 4. 8 % in patients with or without the foot pump, respectively. Foot pump use did not significantly reduce the incidence of DVTs in patients undergoing TKA under edoxaban thromboprophylaxis. Although seroconversion of anti-PF 4 /heparin antibodies was confirmed in one-fourth of patients, the seroconversion rates did not differ between patients with (20. 7 %) or without (25. 8 %) foot pump use. This study shows that the A-V <b>Impulse</b> system foot <b>pump</b> did not affect the incidence of DVT under edoxaban thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing TKA. Seroconversion of anti-PF 4 /heparin antibodies was detected in a significant number of patients who underwent TKA under antithrombotic prophylaxis using edoxaban. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 986 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 9 月 20 日Author: Sakai, Tatsuya; Izumi, Masahiro; Kumagai, Kenji; Kidera, Kenichi; Yamaguchi, Takayuki; Asahara, Tomohiko; Kozuru, Hideko; Jiuchi, Yuka; Mawatari, Masaaki; Osaki, Makoto; Motokawa, Satoru; Migita, KiyoshiCitation: Medicine, 95 (1), e 2247; 201...|$|R
30|$|Data {{transmission}} under down-hole {{and data}} receiving {{on the ground}} are the key techniques in the wireless measure while drilling. At present the signal transmission manners used in MWD mainly include the electromagnetic wave and mud drilling fluid pressure wave[1]. The signal attenuation degree of the electromagnetic wave transmission signal becomes serious {{with the increase of}} the depth of the stratum, and the difference of the geological structure leads to different attenuation extent of signal amplitude, thus the signal transmission rate can only be send with a low frequency and also in a short transmission distance[2]. The transmission rate of mud drilling fluid pulse signal possesses the characteristics of higher reliability and further transmission distance compared with that of electromagnetic wave signal, so using mud drilling fluid pressure wave to communicate is currently a common method used in MWD[3, 4]. However, MWD signal transmission medium is susceptible to be affected by all kinds of the outside noise[5], it’s a problem needing to be solved as soon as possible to extract useful signal from signal flooded by all kinds of noise. Literature[5] makes analysis of the pump noise, well drilling noise, pulse noise and transmitting noise in mud pulse signal. Literature[6] processes the mud pulse signal with wavelet transform and compares the signal by choosing different parameters to decompose and reconstruct seven kinds of common wavelet basic functions with the original signal, and choose the best wavelet base function proper to process the signal and its parameters according to the size of correlated coefficient. Literature[7] adopts the method of reversing pulse signal by linear filter algorithm, and based on this, uses a nonlinear “flat-roofed elimination” method to process the mud pulse signal. Literature[8, 9] adopts related filtering wave processing method. The methods used in the above literature mainly focus on signal denoising, or rather mainly aim at processing signal of the PLM[10] (pulse location managerment). Although the scheme using Manchester encode values is not a new idea,our contributions mostly lie in giving detailed signal flow,applying FIR filtering and <b>pump</b> <b>impulse</b> noise elimination algorithm, introducing the pattern similarity recognition algorithm to the mud pulse signal recognition.|$|R
