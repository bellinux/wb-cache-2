50|$|The cuvette {{calibration}} has a {{great effect}} on the absorbance measurement. Many variables {{need to be considered}} to <b>ensure</b> <b>precision</b> and accuracy. The spectrophotometric measurement is sensitive to the change in volume. The calibration cuvette helps scientists to convert the volume data from relative value units to the true volume with the less uncertainty. The cuvette adjustment is important for laboratory technicians who acquiring a precise estimation of the volume of solution. In the laboratory facility, sometimes a round glass cuvette is frequently utilized. The adjusted cuvette that has been aligned and sold in the market is expensive in comparison with the cost of normal glass tubes. The glass cell costs approximately 30 times more than an ordinary glass tube. In turn, the cuvettes do the most appropriate sort of spectrophotometer, but in the some researches need the great number of cuvette and can be costly. A high quality glass tube as calibrated can give similar result as a cuvette. However, the manually calibrated cuvette has less consistency. The adjustment and position of the tube affect the reading value of the absorbance as the light goes through the sample controlled by the width of the cuvette. The distance traveled by light and the concentration of solution influence the estimation of absorbance. The appropriate wavelength and type of cuvette is the main component for measuring the correct absorbance with manually calibrating the cuvette.|$|E
