Some of these can include brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, and progressive neurological disorders. In rare cases, aphasia may also result from <b>herpesviral</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> The herpes simplex virus affects the frontal and temporal lobes, subcortical structures, and the hippocampal tissue, which can trigger aphasia.|$|E

50|$|On 27 March 1985, Wearing, then an {{acknowledged}} {{expert in}} early {{music at the}} height of his career with BBC Radio 3, contracted <b>herpesviral</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> a herpes simplex virus that attacked his central nervous system. Since this point, he has been unable to store new memories. He has also been unable to control emotions (unstable mood) and to associate memories effectively.|$|E

50|$|A {{neurotropic}} {{virus is}} said to be neuroinvasive if it is capable of accessing or entering the nervous system and neurovirulent if it is capable of causing disease within the nervous system. Both terms are often applied to central nervous system infections, although some neurotropic viruses are highly neuroinvasive for the peripheral nervous system (i.e. herpes simplex virus). Important neuroinvasive viruses include poliovirus, which is highly neurovirulent but weakly neuroinvasive, and rabies virus, which is highly neurovirulent but requires tissue trauma (often resulting from an animal bite) to become neuroinvasive. Using these definitions, herpes simplex virus is highly neuroinvasive for the peripheral nervous system and rarely neuroinvasive for the central nervous system, but in the latter case may cause <b>herpesviral</b> <b>encephalitis</b> and is therefore considered highly neurovirulent. Many arthropod-borne neurotropic viruses, like West Nile virus, spread to the brain primarily via the blood system by crossing the blood-brain barrier in what is called hematogenous dissemination.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Herpesviral</b> <b>Encephalitis</b> can {{be treated}} with {{high-dose}} intravenous acyclovir. Without treatment, HSE results in rapid death in approximately 70% of cases; survivors suffer severe neurological damage. [...] When treated, HSE is still fatal in one-third of cases, and causes serious long-term neurological damage in over half of survivors. Twenty percent of treated patients recover with minor damage. Only a small population of survivors (2.5%) regain completely normal brain function. Indeed, many amnesic cases in the scientific literature have etiologies involving HSE. Earlier treatment (within 48 hours of symptom onset) improves {{the chances of a}} good recovery. Rarely, treated individuals can have relapse of infection weeks to months later. There is evidence that aberrant inflammation triggered by herpes simplex can result in granulomatous inflammation in the brain, which responds to steroids. While the herpes virus can be spread, encephalitis itself is not infectious. Other viruses can cause similar symptoms of encephalitis, though usually milder (Herpesvirus 6, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, etc.).|$|E
