40|$|Refining 155, 000 {{barrels of}} crude oil daily, a Louisiana plant markets oil {{products}} to gas stations in at least 26 states, including Washington, D. C. The plant uses 8, 538 <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> with 1, 200 -, 600 -, 250 -, 75 -, 40 - and 15 -psi nominal pressures. Standardized with <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>steam</b> <b>traps,</b> the Louisiana refinery?s maintenance and energy coordinator was content with the results. The Spirax Sarco Inc (SSI) team demonstrated SSI?s Energy Service Group (ESG) capabilities and successes to the refinery manager, operations manager and production manager. From 2004 through 2006, the team presented a series of ESG seminars at the refinery site. The numerous models demonstrated quantitative savings with 3 - to 12 -mo paybacks. For a complete SSI turnkey program, for example, the SSI team presented an ROI with {{less than six months}} payback. The ESG survey found that only 3, 952 (46. 3 %) of the <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> were operating correctly. The remaining <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> experienced a variety of failures, including: 613 (7. 2 %) that failed open; 2, 763 (32. 4 %) were cold; 1, 012 (11. 9 %) that failed closed; 6 (0. 0 %) exhibited rapid cycling; and 192 (2. 2 %) were disconnected. The team also found performance and temperature issues with the HP sulfur reactors in the SRU units, largely due to the application of <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>steam</b> <b>traps.</b> Plus, as a result of excessive steam leaks, the sulfur reactors were creating a safety hazard. When these results were presented, management agreed that the sulfur reactors needed process improvement. The SSI team recommended replacing the <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> with 1 - 1 / 2 -in. strainers and 1 - 1 / 2 -in. flanged float & thermostatic <b>steam</b> <b>traps.</b> They also suggested that the existing trap discharge piping should be removed and re-piped with globe-style bypass valves and gate-style isolation valves to reduce flow velocity. Once the SSI team began negotiations, it only took one survey for the Louisiana refinery to realize all the energy savings opportunities. In fact, the ESG survey uncovered more than $ 1. 3 million in steam losses through failed <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> and another $ 1 million in steam leak opportunities and production, process, safety and environmental improvements. Impressed with the survey results, the refinery approved the estimated $ 110, 000 turnkey project, which offered a 5. 3 -month payback. Further negotiations netted the team annual <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> surveys for the next three years, as well as an approved 2008 energy budget of $ 600, 000. Additionally, the Louisiana refinery has indicated that upon successful completion of the ESG program, SSI?s annual energy budget will increase to $ 1, 000, 000. ...|$|R

This study shows that <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> traps have lower EUAC's under more conditions than other types of traps.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the energy loss through the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> in the <b>steam</b> system. In industry, <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> {{frequently}} fail {{but they are not}} noticed except when they are leaking. If <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> fail in failed open, live steam can escape to surrounding. High amount of energy will loss from the steam system. It takes weeks or months before it being repaired or replaced. The first objective {{of this study is to}} measure the heat loss for normal thermodynamic <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> in respond to operating pressure for different condensate load. The second objective is to measure the heat loss for failed open thermodynamic <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> in respond to operating pressure for different condensate load. The last objective is to compare energy loss between normal and failed open <b>steam</b> <b>trap.</b> From the last objective, the actual energy loss if failed <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> is not repaired is determined. Thermodynamic <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> has been tested in the experiment and the operating pressure is below 1 bar. Condensate that discharges from <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> is collected to record the reading of its temperature and weight. These data is used to determine the energy loss through the <b>steam</b> <b>trap.</b> For normal <b>steam</b> <b>trap,</b> energy loss for high condensate load is higher than low condensate load. For failed open <b>steam</b> <b>trap,</b> energy loss for high condensate load is lower than low condensate load.

40|$|In {{these days}} of high technology, the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> is often treated as a {{commodity}} item, forgotten by many and respected by a relative few. Yet, in many facilities, widespread undetected failure of <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> has wasted 5 - 15 % of a plant's total steam generation.

40|$|In oil {{refineries}} and petrochemical plants {{large number of}} <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> are used to discharge condensate from steam mains, tracers and process equipment. Early efforts on <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> focused almost exclusively on their selection and sizing, {{and it was not}} until the 1973 oil embargo that a need for regular maintenance became recognized. Although relatively small pieces of equipment, traps are responsible for large quantities of steam losses, decreased equipment efficiency and high maintenance costs; e. g., a <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> leaking 100 psig steam through a 1 / 8 inch orifice costs at least $ 2 k/yr if steam is valued at $ 5 /k lb. Typically, a <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> survey identifies 20 - 60 % of traps malfunctioning. Therefore, establishing an effective <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> selection/maintenance program is not simple but can be extremely profitable. This paper will show how a successful checking/maintenance program can result in high returns by using a case study at an Exxon plant.

40|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>trap</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} link in the condensate loop because it connects steam usage with condensate return. The function of <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> is to discharge condensate while not permitting the escape of live steam. For the efficient usage of steam inside the process equipment, the steam should be kept inside the device until the complete steam is transformed into condensate. For thi s to be happen the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> functioning will be in perfect condition. The main objective of the study is to analyse the operating characte ristics of the presently installed <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> and their effects on the efficiency of heat transfer in their respective process applications. From the study it may clear that trap failure may be of two-live steam to discharge and <b>steam</b> leak. <b>Trap</b> failure may also result in the water logging of heat exchangers of textile processing units. All these may results in excessive steam usage and it directly have an economy impact.

The power plant is a coal fired power plant with its normal operation temperature of 540 °C. This study consists of failure mode inventory collection of the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> bypass tube failure, collection of background information about the process, component function and operating conditions. Detailed investigation carried out by visual examination, nondestructive testing (NDT), metallurgical testing which consists of microstructure examination, chemical testing and mechanical testing.
