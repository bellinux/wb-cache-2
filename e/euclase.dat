50|$|<b>Euclase</b> is a {{beryllium}} {{aluminium hydroxide}} silicate mineral (BeAlSiO4(OH)). It crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system and is typically massive to fibrous {{as well as}} in slender prismatic crystals. It is related to beryl (Be3Al2Si6O18) and other beryllium minerals. It {{is a product of the}} decomposition of beryl in pegmatites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Euclase</b> {{crystals}} {{are noted}} for their blue color, ranging from very pale to dark blue. The mineral {{may also be}} colorless, white, or light green. Cleavage is perfect, parallel to the clinopinacoid, and this suggested to René Just Haüy the name <b>euclase,</b> from the Greek , easily, and , fracture. The ready cleavage renders the crystals fragile with a tendency to chip, and thus detracts from its use for personal ornament. When cut it resembles certain kinds of beryl and topaz, from which it may be distinguished by its specific gravity (3.1). Its hardness (7.5) is similar to beryl (7.5 - 8), and a bit {{less than that of}} topaz (8).It was first reported in 1792 from the Orenburg district in the southern Urals, Russia, where it is found with topaz and chrysoberyl in the gold-bearing gravels of the Sanarka (nowadays probably, Sakmara River, Mednogorsk district, Orenburgskaya Oblast'). Its type locality is Ouro Prêto, Minas Gerais, Southeast Region, Brazil, where it occurs with topaz. It is found rarely in the mica-schist of the Rauris in the Austrian Alps.|$|E
50|$|Nikolai Koksharov {{was born}} in Ust-Kamenogorsk (today's Kazakhstan). He was educated at the {{military}} school of mines in St.Petersburg. At the age of twenty-two he was selected to accompany Roderick Murchison and Edouard de Verneuil, and afterwards Dr. Keyserling, in their geological survey of the Russian Empire. Subsequently, he devoted his attention mainly {{to the study of}} mineralogy and mining, and was appointed director of the Institute of Mines. In 1865, he became director of the Imperial Mineralogical Society of St.Petersburg. He contributed numerous papers on <b>euclase,</b> zircon, epidote, orthite, monazite, and other mineralogical subjects to the St.Petersburg and Vienna academies of science, to Johann Christian Poggendorff's Annalen der Physik und Chemie, Leonhard and Browns Ja/irbuch, &c. He also issued as separate works Materialen zur Mineralogie Russlands and Vorlesungen uber Mineralogie.|$|E

40|$|Colombian <b>euclase</b> is {{rare and}} {{associated}} with emerald in medium-temperature hydrothermal veins hosted by Lower Cretaceous black shales (BS). The original sources of <b>euclase</b> production were the mining districts of Gachala and Chivor {{in the eastern}} emerald belt, but in 2016 euclases were also found at the La Marina mine in the western emerald belt. The present study is centered on a chemical and mineralogical examination of zoned Colombian <b>euclase</b> sold on the gem market as "trapiche'. Its texture is characterized by growth bands and sectors distinguished {{by the presence of}} numerous inclusions (mainly pyrite, carbonates, and organic matter) which represent around 0. 2 % of the total volume of the crystals. Xray computed tomography showed that the largest inclusions are randomly located, whereas the small inclusions are concentrated {{in the center of the}} crystals, along the crystallographic b axis, between neighboring growth sectors and between growth bands in each sector. The texture cannot be defined as "trapiche', like that of Colombian emeralds, because there is no matrix material from the surrounding BS trapped between the growth sectors and accumulated as dendrites. Three-phase fluid inclusions (FI) containing halite, liquid, and vapor phases are also observed in the <b>euclase,</b> and their volume is identical to that of the inclusions in emerald. Chromium and vanadium are the main chromophores, and the highest concentrations (1240 and 400 ppm, respectively) were found in deep blue-colored zones. Surprisingly, the <b>euclase</b> crystals have high Ge contents, between 230 and 530 ppm. The Rare Earth Element (REE) patterns of <b>euclase</b> are inherited from the enclosed BS or albitized and carbonatized BS. <b>Euclase</b> has the same REE pattern as emerald from the Gachala mines with an Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* similar to 0. 40) and a depletion in Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREE). The present study allows for the reconstruction of the formation conditions of "trapiche' <b>euclase</b> and discussion about its probable geographic origin, i. e., the eastern emerald belt...|$|E
40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} refl ectance spectroscopy measurements {{made possible the}} characterization of kaolinite, muscovite, lepidolite, Na_muscovites, cookeite and tourmaline. Mixtures and spatial distribution of these minerals, together with quartz, spodumene, tantalite, <b>euclase</b> and garnet, were used to defi ne internal zonation of the Alto do Giz pegmatite. The co-occurrence of Lithium-bearing minerals in the border zone of N 2 and N 3 quartz cores was key in defi ning the Zone III (inner zone). The inner zone had not been done previously in this pegmatite, due to the intense kaolinization overprinting the rock bulk mineralogy. It is demonstrated that refl ectance spectroscopy is {{a useful tool for}} mineralogical studies, even in earlier fi eld works, contributing to sample and map pegmatites of Borborema Pegmatitic Province...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Euclase is a live {{development}} environment focused on creating interactive web applications. It uses a programming model that combines constraints and finite state machines to specify interactive behaviors. <b>Euclase</b> is “live ” {{in the sense}} that while the user is developing code, their program is always executing. Changes made to the source of the program are reflected immediately in the running program. We identify some of the implementation and design challenges of making our {{development environment}} live, including performance issues, ensuring predictability, dealing with errors in the source, and handling edge cases such as the removal of code that is currently running. We also discuss how Euclase’s use of finite state machines and constraints can help alleviate these difficulties.

40|$|Criteria used to {{identify}} Fe^ 2 +-Fe^ 3 + and Fe^ 2 +-Ti^ 4 + intervalence charge transfer absorption bands in electronic spectra are reviewed and compared to the characteristics of unperturbed Fe^ 2 + crystal field bands {{and those that are}} intensified by interaction with Fe^ 3 +. Band energy is the least definitive diagnostic criterion. Changes in band intensity with temperature are also of limited value. Large widths are the most reliable characteristic of charge transfer bands. New optical absorption spectra are presented for <b>euclase,</b> as well as 80 K spectra of rockbridgeite, babingtonite and lazulite. Comparison of optical spectra to magnetic susceptibility measurements for rockbridgeite and babingtonite provides support for recent theories regarding the effect of magnetic coupling on the variation of charge transfer intensity with temperature...|$|E
40|$|The 1 -MHz {{dielectric}} constants {{and loss}} factors of the minerals diaspore, <b>euclase,</b> hamberyite, sinhalite, danburite, datolite, beryllonite, and montebrasite {{and of the}} synthetic oxides La_(2) Be_(2) O_ 5, AlP_(3) O_ 9, and NdP_(5) O_ 14, were determined. The dielectric polarizabilities of B_(2) O_ 3, and P_(2) O_ 5, derived from the dielectric constants of these compounds are 6. 15 and 12. 44 Å^ 3, respectively. The dielectric constants of the above minerals and oxides, along with the dielectric polarizabilities of Li_(2) O, Na_(2) O, BeO, MgO, CaO, Al_(2) O_ 3, Nd_(2 _O_ 3, La_(2) O_ 3, SiO_ 2, diaspore, and the derived values of the polarizabilities of B_(2) O_ 3, and P_(2) O_ 5, were used to calculate dielectric polarizabilities from the Clausius-Mosotti equation and to test the oxide additivity rule. The oxide additivity rule is valid to ± 0. 5 % for all except beryllonite. These compounds with deviations from additivity of 0. 5 - 1. 5 %, along with previously studied aluminate and gallate garnets, chrysoberyl, spinel, phenacite, zircon, and olivinetype silicates, form a class of well-behaved oxides {{that can be used}} as a basis for comparison of compounds that show larger deviations (> 5 %) caused by ionic or electronic conductivity, the presence of H_(2) O or CO_ 2, or structural peculiarities...|$|E
40|$|Minerals {{were seen}} merely {{as sources of}} chemicals: iron ore, copper ore, etc. However, {{minerals}} are not just chemicals associations, since they display crystal structures. These two features together provide properties that can be technologically useful. Even though a mineral occurs in very small amount, which does not allow its extraction, it {{can serve as a}} model for obtaining the synthetic analogue on an industrial scale. It is necessary that a new-mineral proposal be submitted for approval by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC) of the International Mineralogical Association (IMA) before publication. Only 65 valid mineral species were first described from Brazil, that is, the type minerals from Brazil. Nineteen of these were published between 1789 and 1959 (0. 11 per year). From 1959, when the CNMMN (today CNMNC) - IMA was established, to 2000, 18 approved Brazilian mineral species remain valid (0. 43 per year). However, the number of type minerals from Brazil approved in the last 15 years (2000 to 2014) was substantially increased: 28 (1. 87 per year). This number is very small considering the wide range of Brazilian geological environments. The two first type species from Brazil, discovered in the 18 th century, chrysoberyl and <b>euclase,</b> are important gemological minerals. Two other gem minerals, tourmaline-supergroup members, were published only in the 21 st century: uvite and fluor-elbaite. Some type minerals from Brazil are very important technologically speaking. Some examples are menezesite, coutinhoite, lindbergite, pauloabibite, and waimirite-(Y) ...|$|E
