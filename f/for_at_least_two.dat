40|$|OBJECTIVE: Investigating the {{relationship}} between birth weight and the metabolic syndrome and the modifying effects of lifestyle in adults (36. 5 years). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: 273 subjects completed a birth-weight questionnaire; waist circumference, HDL and triglyceride concentrations, blood pressure and HbA 1 c, physical activity and fitness, smoking status and dietary intake were measured. Risks for the metabolic syndrome and <b>for</b> having <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> {{of the components of}} the metabolic syndrome were calculated and the modifying effect of lifestyle factors was assessed by comparing four groups based on birth weight and a lifestyle factor. RESULTS: Birth weight was not associated with the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio OR = 0. 67, 95 % confidence interval CI = 0. 25 - 1. 79). Birth weight lower than the median increased the risk <b>for</b> having <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> components (OR = 2. 28, 95 % CI = 1. 15 - 4. 50). Subjects who smoked and had a birth weight lower than the median had a 6. 9 times increased risk. Modification by lifestyle measured at age 36 was not observed, although effect modification using lifestyle data from 32 years was found. CONCLUSIONS: Lower birth weight increased the risk <b>for</b> having <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> components of the metabolic syndrome.
