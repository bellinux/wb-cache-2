5|$|Municipalities in the {{watershed}} of Nanticoke Creek include Loomis Park, Lower Askam, Hanover, Espy Gap, Truesdale Terrace, Witinski Villa, and Warrior Gap. The city of Wilkes-Barre <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>far</b> from the creek. A reservoir {{known as the}} Hanover Reservoir {{is located in the}} southwestern part of {{the watershed}}. There are also a number of silt ponds {{in the vicinity of the}} creek. The creek's mouth is half a mile to the east of Nanticoke Falls.|$|E
5|$|After a curve to the northeast, CR149 passes {{under some}} power lines, {{intersecting}} with Cattall Road. There the highway {{turns to the}} north, and soon to the northeast, entering Livingston Manor. Immediately after entering the community, CR149 becomes more developed, with residential homes and commercial buildings now surrounding highway. After an intersection with Creamery Road, CR149 continues to the northeast through downtown Livingston Manor, ending at an intersection with CR178 (a former alignment of NY17). Interchange 98 on Route17 (the Quickway), <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>far</b> {{to the north and}} is accessible via CR178 and CR81.|$|E
5|$|NY83 {{begins a}} more erratic routing, passing between West Mud Lake and Black Pond as {{it enters the}} town of Arkwright. For a short {{distance}} it is concurrent with CR85, and takes on the name Black Corner Street, so named because it is located within the hamlet of Black Corners. Although this portion of NY83 is cosigned with CR85, it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. An intersection with CR79 <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>far</b> off, as it passes {{just north of the}} town of Arkwright. NY83 proceeds west-northwest until it reaches its ending terminus at NY60 in the community of Laona, located just west of the Arkwright town line in Pomfret.|$|E

5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an apparent magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting apparent magnitude <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>far</b> from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E

25|$|Huntington Beach sits above a large natural fault {{structure}} containing oil.

25|$|In places, {{stratified}} till and {{boulder clay}} {{give rise to}} features of glacial deposition such as eskers, and drumlins that are predominant {{over much of the}} area north and east of Larbert and provide natural transportation routes.
