5000|$|A {{protective}} <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> is {{a substance}} or chemical composition {{applied to the}} surface of an object that provides a barrier of protection from external elements. Polishes use a highly refined abrasive (generally finer than 4,000 grit) that is suspended in a liquid carrier. The polish wears away the surface to create a smooth surface. The smoother the surface the higher the resulting gloss or perceived [...] "shine". A protective <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> is applied after polishing to preserve the surface and help resist further oxidation or weathering. Effective finishing coatings penetrate the surface pores and use these pores to which the protective film anchors to.|$|E

50|$|Primer {{coatings}} {{form the}} essential {{link between the}} pretreatment and the <b>finish</b> <b>coating.</b> Essentially, a primer is required to provide inter-coat adhesion between the pretreatment and the <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> and is also required to promote corrosion resistance in the total system. The composition of the primer will {{vary depending on the}} type of <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> used. Primers require compatibility with various pretreatments and top coat paint systems; therefore, they usually comprise a mixture of resin systems to achieve this end.|$|R

5000|$|For {{the first}} coat {{a layer of}} well-haired coarse stuff, about 1 inch thick, is put on with the laying trowel. This is termed [...] "pricking up" [...] in London, and in America [...] "scratch coating". It should be laid on diagonally, each trowelful {{overlapping}} the previous one. When on laths the stuff should be plastic enough to be worked through the spaces between the laths to form a key, yet so firm as not to drop off. The surface while still soft is scratched with a lath to give a key for the next coat. In Scotland {{this part of the}} process is termed [...] "straightening" [...] and in America [...] "browning", and is performed when the first coat is dry, so as to form a straight surface to receive the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{daguerreotype}} {{image is}} formed on a highly polished silver surface. Usually the silver {{is a thin}} layer on a copper substrate, but other metals such as brass {{can be used for}} the substrate and daguerreotypes can also be made on solid silver sheets. A surface of very pure silver is preferable, but sterling (92.5% pure) or US coin (90% pure) or even lower grades of silver are functional. In 19th century practice, the usual stock material, Sheffield plate, was produced by a process sometimes called plating by fusion. A sheet of sterling silver was heat-fused onto the top of a thick copper ingot. When the ingot was repeatedly rolled under pressure to produce thin sheets, the relative thicknesses of the two layers of metal remained constant. The alternative was to electroplate a layer of pure silver onto a bare copper sheet. The two technologies were sometimes combined, the Sheffield plate being given a <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> of pure silver by electroplating.|$|E
5000|$|Often {{referred}} to as drywall taping mud, joint compound is the primary material used in the drywall industry by a tradesperson, or applicator, called a [...] "drywall mechanic," [...] "taper," [...] or [...] "drywall taper." [...] A similar compound is used in various ways as a sprayed-on textural finishing for gypsum panel walls and ceilings that have been pre-sealed and coated with joint compound. The flexibility and plastic qualities of joint compound make it a very versatile material both as sealer or <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> for wall surfaces, and also in decorative applications that range from machine sprayed texturing to hand-trowelled or even hand-crafted and sculptural finishes. In North America the application of joint mud and drywall tape sealer and trowelled joint compound on gypsum panels is a standard construction technique for painted wall and ceiling surfaces. Until more recently in North America, and through the world, several different plasters such as veneer plaster and [...] "plaster of Paris" [...] {{have been used in}} a similar ways to joint compounds as fillers or for decorative purposes since ancient times, and the actual make up and working properties of these compounds is much similar. Modern ready-mixes or powder and water mixes are available {{in a wide range of}} styles from slow-drying to quick-drying to suit specific demands for use by contractors or decorators.|$|E
40|$|Coatings {{are used}} to enhance {{appearance}} and assure functional requirements. High performance and cost reduction during vehicle manufacturing are the main requirements, leading to increased use of pre-primed automotive sheet in recent years. Costs may be significantly reduced if the conventional electrophoretic primer is eliminated or its usage reduced. Conductive primers also offer the advantage of welding facility. The behaviour of two conductive pre-primers applied on galvannealed steel was studied and {{compared with that of}} a conventional electrophoretic primer. Before pre-priming a nonchrome pre-treatment was applied. Pre-primer 1 is an organic zinc rich silicate with a low thickness and pre-primer 2 is a very thin water based primer filled with graphite. The behaviour of two <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> systems was also studied. These <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> were applied on not primed and pre-primed galvannealed steel sheets. Two activation treatments were used, a conventional zinc phosphate and an experimental one. <b>Finish</b> <b>coat</b> system 1 included a powder intercoat, a waterborne base coat and a clear <b>coat,</b> and <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> system 2 included the same powder intercoat, a solvent based base coat and a clear coat. Formability capabilities of pre-primers were evaluated through cupping and stone chipping tests. To evaluate corrosion protection, these samples were submitted to a cyclic corrosion test (CCT). Corrosion mechanisms were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with associated X-ray microanalysis by dispersive energy spectrometry (EDS) and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To evaluate the performance of <b>finish</b> <b>coats,</b> the samples were also submitted to the same cyclic corrosion test, and the paint coating adhesion was evaluated, before and after exposure, by cross-cut test method. Both pre-primers applied with a low thickness seem to be good alternatives to the conventional electrophoretic primers. In agreement with results previously obtained for preprimed electrogalvanized steel substrate, submitted to CCT, electrochemical studies showed that less protection was achieved by primer 2. Regarding <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> better adhesion was verified for the one with waterborne base coat, a more environmentally convenient system. Both <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> presented good anticorrosive behaviour, without significant defects on undamaged areas...|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{application of}} stucco and lath occurs in three coats — the scratch coat, the brown <b>coat</b> and the <b>finish</b> <b>coat.</b> The two base coats of plaster are either hand-applied or machine sprayed. The <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> can be troweled smooth, hand-textured, floated to a sand finish or sprayed. Originally the lath material was strips of wood installed horizontally on the wall, with spaces between, that {{would support the}} wet plaster until it cured. This lath and plaster technique became widely used.|$|R

Thermometers and strain gauges are placed into different wall layers to gather thermal and strain data and another instrument measures the crack dimensions after every 4 cycles. The results showed that the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> shrank at early stage (elastic deformation) and then the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> tends to expand and become damaged at later stage (plastic deformation). The deformation of insulation layer {{is similar to that of}} the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> but its variation amplitude is smaller. Deformation of substrate expanded with heat and contracted with cold due to the small temperature variation. The length and width of cracks on the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> grew as the experiment progressed but with a decreasing growth rate and the cracks stopped growing around 70 cycles...|$|E

40|$|Lately, {{there has}} been a lot of {{discussion}} about negative impacts on the environment that are caused by human actions. Climate change, ozone hole, global warming, air pollution are only some of the many negative impacts. In addition, non-renewable energy resources (such as oil, natural gas, coal) are being depleted, causing energy to increasingly become more and more valuable. One of the methods for detection of such negative environmental impacts is the socalled life cycle assessment method or LCA. First part of the master thesis presents the LCA method and with it connected standardization, its characteristics, process and its use in construction industry. It continues with the presentation of the ETICS and its components. The LCA calculation (“from cradle to gate”) using real data and the presentation of the results in form of the environmental product declaration EPD, is carried out for adhesive mortar, <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> and ETICS. Last part of this thesis presents the comparison of the environmental impacts on thermal insulation materials, finishing coats and ETICS. We compared the thermal insulation materials according to the LCA results that were calculated from the databases. For comparison of the finishing coats we used publicly available EPD and the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> we calculated ourselves. Lastly we combined different thermal insulation materials and finishing coats into ETICS, calculated LCA and compared the ETICS. We have found that the only right comparison including declared unit is the one that is based on the function of the material and not on the mass unit of the material. The results vary according to different environmental impact indicators, therefore it is necessary to compare different indicators among themselves. Using LCA we came to a conclusion that the thermal insulation material has the biggest impact on the ETICS in majority of the environmental impact indicators, while the choice of <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> does not play a key role for environmental impact indicators...|$|E

30|$|Medium density {{fiberboard}} (MDF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used wood-based panels in furniture industry. <b>Finishing</b> <b>coat</b> of MDF is mainly dependent upon the properties of the raw materials, such as wood species, fiber characteristics, and manufacturing parameters. For the direct painting or adhesive application, the surfaces of MDF have to be smooth, stable, and low absorbent. In the coating technology, only surface layer of the MDF is coated with the water- or solvent-based paints. Similarly, UV-cured powder coating technology is a rapidly growing segment of the coatings industry and MDF industry.|$|E

40|$|To analyse the {{influence}} of a <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> on the hygric buffering capacities of gypsum board, dynamic experiments are performed on uncoated and coated gypsum board samples. In these experiments a harmonically changing relative humidity is imposed, while the mass response of the sample is measured quasi-continuously. The measured response is compared with a numerically predicted response. To do so, gypsum board is implemented as a composite material in a FE-model with sorption isotherm and vapour permeability determined for each layer of the board separately. It is found that hysteresis on the sorption isotherm plays an important role on the dynamic response of coated gypsum board...|$|E

40|$|The External Thermal Insulation Composite Systems with {{rendering}} (ETICS) are {{a building}} envelope technology widely used both in new construction interventions and in energy refurbishments. Installed ETICS display multiple failure modes, {{which are often}} {{the result of the}} repeated action of multiple agents inducing cyclic stresses and strains, thus fatigue. In this study, to predict the performance decay over time and to assess the durability, we coupled two numerical models: a hygrothermal model, computing the Heat and Moisture Transport (HMT) in porous media, coupled to a Thermo-Mechanical Finite Element Method model (TM-FEM). The transient temperature profile computed with the HMT model was the input for the TM-FEM simulations, with which we assessed the thermal stress over time, and the frequency of the events exceeding the critical stress thresholds, beyond which the base coat is subject to fatigue. As variables, we considered the moisture response of the base coat, and the optical properties of the <b>finishing</b> <b>coat,</b> in a set of Southern European climates.

Bore steel specimens and specimens coated with two different cootings were examined in these solutions. The corrosivity was evaluated by carrying out corrosion potential, potentiodynamic polarization and mass loss measurements. The results indicate that Na 2 S 2 O 3. 5 H(2) O ond Na 2 S 2 O 5 have no {{significant effect on the}} corrosion rate of bore steel, but which increases fourfold when these sulphur compounds ore both present in the caustic solutions. H 2 O 2 is a corrosion activator only in solutions of sulphur salts or in solutions which contain chloride ions.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the {{experimental}} evaluation of the durability of ETICS cladding through accelerated laboratory ageing, which is now being developed by BEST – Polytechnic of Milan. The experimental programme as a whole includes accelerated laboratory ageing, long-term outdoor exposure, comparison and analysis of results. Four types of specimens have been built with masonry wall acting substrate EPS as insulation and polymeric additives incorporated in the base coat mortar. Of the additives included in the mortar, two were prepared with acrylic resin and two with vinyl resin. Additionally, {{for each type of}} specimen, one included a typical <b>finishing</b> <b>coat</b> and another one an acrylic painting. For each series of ETICS specimens, a one set will be aged and the other remains as the (cladding system reference set). There are also four pairs of sets of smaller scale samples on which disruptive tests are to be completed. The ageing cycle consists of 125 UV cycles, 125 summer thermal shock cycles and 50 winter thermal shock and freeze-thaw cycles. In order to assess performance decay on the reference specimen and on the aged specimens {{at the end of their}} service life, several disruptive tests will be carried out, including: water absorption, water vapour permeability, tensile bond strength of adhesive and of base coat to insulation, render strip tensile tests, and pull off tests. Non-disruptive tests (e. g. record of T [°C], RH [%] and heat flow) are being conducted throughout the ageing process and, at every end of test cycle, characterization tests are carried out to assess changes in thermal conductance, moisture transfer properties, dynamic effects and thermal inertia.
