5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until men who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the duel, Zaretsky gets {{several more}} chances to prevent the duel from happening. Because dueling was {{forbidden}} in the Russian Empire, duels were always held at dawn. Zaretsky urges Lensky to get ready shortly after 6o'clock in the morning (chapter 6, stanza XXIII), while the sun only rises at 20 past 8, because he expects Onegin to be on time. However, Onegin oversleeps (chapter 6, stanza XXIV), and arrives on the scene more than an hour late. According to the dueling codex, if a duelist arrives more than 15 minutes late, he automatically forfeits the duel. Lensky and Zaretsky <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> all that time (chapter 6, stanza XXVI), even though it was Zaretsky's duty to proclaim Lensky as winner and take him home.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{takes on}} the Fremen name Muad'Dib, and emerges as the leader for whom the Fremen <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting.</b> He teaches the Fremen to build and use Weirding Modules—sonic weapons {{developed}} by House Atreides—and begins to target spice mining production, which is back {{in control of the}} Harkonnen, overseen by Rabban. Over the next two years, spice production is effectively halted, a fact Rabban tries to keep hidden from the empire. The Spacing Guild returns to the Emperor to warn him of the deteriorating situation on Arrakis. They also fear that Paul will consume the Water of Life, a powerful poison used by the Bene Gesserit to help induce their abilities. The meeting is revealed to Paul in a prophetic dream, but then the dreams suddenly stop. Shaken by the absence of his visions, he goes out into the desert, drinks the Water of Life and enters into a trance. Upon awakening, he is transformed, obtaining powerful psychic abilities and the ability to control the sandworms. Paul has also regained his ability to see into space and the future, and learns the Emperor is amassing a huge invasion fleet above Arrakis to wipe out the Fremen and to regain absolute control of the planet.|$|E

A {{struggle}} occurs, and Chengcai bumps into several gangsters, while Tom's mobile phone falls {{out of his pocket}} as he is tackled by vicious vigilantes. The phone hits the ground, accidentally calling Mr. Yeo, who is doing a presentation about 3G phones for a contract worth $3 million. He rushes off to the scene and pleads the old lady to give Tom a second chance. When the police arrive, she tells them she made a prank call, which meant to give Tom another chance. Two days later, Mr. Yeo meets the conmen and gives them thousands of dollars of hell money; the conmen are then arrested by real police officers who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> in ambush close by, and then Mr.Yeo heard the news of the big succeed with his company, which Tom and Mr.Yeo remain overjoyed.|$|E
500|$|The action {{scenes were}} {{generally}} praised. RPGamer's Michael Beckett, while giving the film a 4 out of 5, lauded the film's fighting scenes, calling them [...] "mesmerizing" [...] {{and the primary}} focus of the movie. Anime News Network's Santos also heavily praised the action sequences, and Felperin of Variety felt they were the only point to the movie, which they felt focused entirely on the technical aspects of the action. The music received mixed reviews; Eriani of Mania Entertainment heavily praised it, as did Santos of Anime News Network, but 1UP.com's Mielke called it [...] "a bit sappy". Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk concluded that Advent Children [...] "is pretty much the film that fans all over the world <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for", RPGamer's Beckett said that [...] "the film feels very much like a love letter to the fans of Final Fantasy VII", and IGN's Carle summed up the film as [...] "glorious, beautiful, well-executed fan service." ...|$|E

David James Young, from Sputnikmusic, felt it was the best song on the album, [...] "the best thing about this song is how damn {{infectious}} it is, thus making it an excellent pop song with top harmonies and a synth hook". Andrew Tijs from CitySearch Brisbane stated that it [...] "has the kind of breathless, carnivorous sexuality that Madonna still keeps trying to convince us she has", but it wasn't [...] "the sexual awakening that most <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for [...] to have". For its lyrics, Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] "sacrifice lyrical clarity {{for the sake of a}} good hook".|$|E

[...] "Good Goodbye" [...] was co-written by DeGarmo and her real-life fiance Ace Young, who was also a competitor on American Idol, and details Angelina's [...] "emotional journey" [...] on the show. She was approached by the show's award-winning composer David Kurtz, and he asked her to make a song for Angelina. Rodney Ho of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said: [...] "It’s supposed to be a turning point to her character. Her character on the most part has been pushy and full of herself." [...] During an interview with TV Guide, DeGarmo said that the song will [...] "tug at your heartstrings" [...] and marks a big turning point for Angelina's storyline: [...] "where she's finally starting to grow up. She's coming to realize that she needs to get rid of her selfish ways. She doesn't know how to go about that like a normal person, so she does it through song." ...|$|E

He {{is one of a}} handful of [...] "sorely missed" [...] major {{characters}} that do not appear in 2005's A Feast for Crows, but on his website in 2006 Martin released a sample chapter featuring Tyrion from his next novel A Dance with Dragons. In advance of the publication of A Dance with Dragons in 2011, Martin confirmed Tyrion's presence in the novel and called him one of [...] "the characters people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for". Grossman concurred, writing of A Dance with Dragons, [...] "Now the camera has swung back to the main characters: Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister." [...] James Poniewozik of Time added that the return of these [...] "favorite characters" [...] gave A Dance with Dragons a [...] "narrative edge" [...] over A Feast for Crows. In April 2012, Martin read a Tyrion chapter from his forthcoming The Winds of Winter at Eastercon; a second Tyrion chapter was read at Worldcon in August 2013 and later released in the official A World of Ice and Fire iOS application on March 20, 2014.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, [...] "Anymore" [...] {{received}} a mixed to positive response from music critics. Several critics {{noted that the}} track serves as a strong opener for Silver Eye. David Chiu from Consequence of Sound described the song as an [...] "outstanding opening track" [...] for [...] "fans who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for Goldfrapp to somehow {{get back to their}} dance club roots". Agreeing, Daryl Easlea, writing for Record Collector, labelled it as the [...] "perfect opener". In the album review for Silver Eye, AllMusic's Heather Phares claimed that [...] "Anymore" [...] was a [...] "quintessential" [...] track and noted how the duo tends to open their albums in similar manners. A group of critics from PopMatters reviewed the recording in their [...] "Singles Going Steady" [...] column; Adriane Pontecorvo from the publication stated that although it [...] "isn't breaking any barrier", it [...] "makes no apologies" [...] and [...] "promises a good time". Chris Ingalls thought similarly and said, [...] "'Anymore' won't change your life, but it'll get stuck in your head {{for the better part of}} the morning". And finally, Andrew Paschal was more mixed to the track, awarding it five out of ten stars, and claiming that the track is [...] "fun" [...] but overall found it to be too predictable.|$|E

Pompeo says she is unaware if her {{character}} knows how to have fun, adding: [...] "All of my scenes with [...] are the same—we're either breaking up or having sex." [...] Her personality has evolved over the past few seasons from depressed, to happy and [...] "fixed". Pompeo said to Good Morning America, [...] "I am so incredibly lucky to have Patrick , to have the chemistry that we do, we have an amazing relationship, and it's like any other relationship, you have your ups and downs. But we work it out, and we've found a way to do this for this long and still get along, and make it work and believe in what we're doing." [...] Pompeo told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "It's awkward with Patrick [...] because he's like my brother. As soon as the camera is off, I'm like, 'Is your hand on my butt?' But there are millions of girls who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for this, so I feel an obligation to the fans."

500|$|Halo Wars {{garnered}} generally positive reviews. The {{game has}} {{an average of}} 82/100 on aggregate web site Metacritic. Critics were split on whether Halo Wars was a successful console translation of the RTS genre. GameSpy's Allen Rausch argued that, as [...] showed that first-person shooters could work on consoles, Halo Wars [...] "is an RTS ... on a console ... and it works". Tom Price of TeamXbox said that gamers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> {{a long time for}} a console RTS [...] "to get it right", and Halo Wars did so; reviewers for Official Xbox Magazine credited Ensemble with creating a strategy game that felt [...] "absolutely at home on the console", rather than a [...] "poorly shoehorned ... port" [...] of a PC game with clumsy controls. 1UP's Thierry Nguyen was neutral about whether it was a good RTS game or Halo title, but called it a [...] "solid beginning towards what could be a really good console RTS". Digital Trends' Scott Steinberg said that, while not perfect, Halo Wars made a strong case for the viability of RTS on consoles; [...] "There's certainly the potential to have PC holdouts seriously reconsidering hoisting the controller." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle offered a dismissive summation of the game as [...] "a remedial game—real-time strategy for dummies", and stated that the game offered relatively little innovation when compared to other Halo titles.|$|E

500|$|Amy Sciarretto for Popcrush was {{complimentary}} of Lewis's vocals, {{writing that}} she sounds [...] "appealing and captivating," [...] {{and continued to}} say that it is what her fans <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for. Sciarretto gave [...] "Collide" [...] a rating of three out of a possible five stars. Lewis Corner for Digital Spy praised the song, writing that Lewis combined her ability to deliver power ballad lyrics into a dance orientated song. Corner compared the song to Katy Perry's [...] "Firework", also produced by Sandy Vee; however, Corner noted that Lewis performs [...] "Collide" [...] in a way which distances the comparison. Katherine St. Asaph for Popdust was critical of the song. Whilst she noted that Lewis was venturing into dance music, where artists such as David Guetta and Kylie Minogue have experienced great success, and that Lewis has an iconic voice compared to both, she felt that the delivery still lacked. St. Asaph wrote [...] "The lethargic, two-note verses make her voice sound less husky than bored, an emotion that a comeback single should never evoke." [...] Michael Cragg for The Guardian felt that the song seemed to build and drop at the wrong times, and that its structure was not cohesive. Cragg continued to say that Lewis does a [...] "passable job as a dance diva," [...] and noted the resemblances between [...] "Collide" [...] and [...] "Penguin".|$|E
500|$|Plutarch {{says that}} upon {{hearing that the}} Persian forces were {{gathering}} at Aspendos, Cimon sailed from Cnidus (in Caria) with 200 triremes. It is highly likely that Cimon had assembled this force because the Athenians had had some warning of a forthcoming Persian campaign to re-subjugate the Asiatic Greeks. Certainly, no other league business would have required such a great force. Cimon may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> in Caria because he expected the Persians to march straight into Ionia, along the Royal road from Sardis. According to Plutarch, Cimon sailed with these 200 triremes to the Greek city of Phaselis (in Lycia) but was refused admittance. He therefore began ravaging the lands of Phaselis, but with the mediation of the Chian contingent of his fleet, the people of Phaselis agreed to join the league. They were to contribute troops to the expedition, and to pay the Athenians ten talents. The fact that Cimon pre-emptively sailed to and captured Phaselis suggests that he anticipated a Persian campaign to capture the coastal cities (as outlined [...] above). The presence of both army and navy at Aspendos may have persuaded him that {{there was to be}} no immediate assault on Ionia. By capturing Phaselis, the furthest east Greek city in Asia Minor (and just {{to the west of the}} Eurymedon), he effectively blocked the Persian campaign before it had begun, denying them the first naval base they needed to control. Taking further initiative, Cimon then moved to directly attack the Persian fleet at Aspendos.|$|E
