50|$|Appliqué is {{a sewing}} {{technique}} where an upper layer of fabric is sewn onto a ground fabric. The upper, applied fabric shape {{can be of}} any shape or contour. There are several different appliqué techniques and styles. In needle-turn appliqué, the raw edges of the appliquéd fabric are tucked beneath the design to minimize raveling or damage, and small hand stitches are made to secure down the design. The stitches are made with a <b>hem</b> <b>stitch,</b> so that the thread securing the fabric is minimally visible {{from the front of}} the work. There are other methods to secure the raw edge of the appliquéd fabric, and some people use basting stitches, fabric-safe glue, freezer paper, paper forms, or starching techniques to prepare the fabric that will be applied, prior to sewing it on. Supporting paper or other materials are typically removed after the sewing is complete. The ground fabric is often cut away from behind, after the sewing is complete, in order to minimize the bulk of the fabric in that region. A special form of appliqué is Broderie perse, which involves the appliqué of specific motifs that have been selected from a printed fabric. For example, a series of flower designs might be cut out of one fabric with a vine design, rearranged, and sewn down on a new fabric to create the image of a rose bush.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to clarify the relation between the grades of hand-sewing skills of university students and their experiences of clothing construction in previous schools. This study was composed of a questionnaire on the experiences of clothing construction, the scores of a practical examination on hand-sewing skills, and the scores of sewing skills learned under technical guidance. Research was conducted on 72 students, 33 men and 39 women, who were studying to obtain an elementary school teacherʼs license. The survey was conducted in October and November 2009. The following results were obtained : 1) Although most of the students had had experience of learning clothing construction in elementary school and junior high school, many of them had little experience of this at high school. Those who had sewing experience at home tended to be women rather than men. There {{was no significant difference in}} the contents of clothing construction between elementary school, junior high school, and high school. Therefore, pouches and aprons had been made regardless of the grade of school. 2) Comparing women and men on hand-sewing skills, women had significantly higher scores for the plain stitch, the half-back <b>stitch,</b> and the <b>hem</b> <b>stitch,</b> and no significant difference was found for the back stitch. 3) Furthermore, when hand-sewing skills were analyzed, it turned out that these were correlated to skill in the plain stitch and half-back stitch...|$|R

Dosada skupljena građa (pisana i predmetna) daje dovoljno podataka za opće spoznaje, ali i obavezuje na podrobniju analizu svakog od spomenutih segmenata vještina tekstilnog rukotvorstva na ovim prostorima. This article {{contains}} some general conclusions about textile folk handicrafts as remained in autarkic {{economy of the}} villages of Baranja till {{the middle of our}} century. Briefly, these are: making of linen and woolen weave from the home-made raw materials (flax, hemp, wool); known weave techniques are plain weave, picking out and kelim; known embroidery techniques are plane embroidery, hollie <b>stitch,</b> woven <b>hem</b> <b>stitch</b> and overcast filling -Russian; often used ornaments are horizontal variegated woven stripes and lines of vertically embroidered vegetative and zoomorphic figures. Variety and numerousness of subordinate species of particular parts of garb or soft furnishings are achieved by interacting combinations of the elements mentioned above. Along with the rich variety of material things, the lexical riches is preserved as well. There are numerous localisms used for things, techniques of making textile and decorative ornaments. The material which has been analysed by now gives us enough facts for the general ideas, but it also ties us to do a detailed analysis of each segment of the textile folk handicrafts...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to clarify the level of university students' hand sewing skills and knowledge, and to examine the retention of the learning up to the high school. Moreover, teaching contents necessary for elementary school students to acquire hand sewing skills are also considered. This research was composed of a questionnaire on hand sewing knowledge, a questionnaire on the memory of courses and confidence in skills, a practical examination to evaluate hand sewing skills and a survey of the actual state of basic skills such as how to handle a needle and cloth. The research was conducted on 417 university students. 209 men and 208 women, the survey being conducted in June and December 2015. and in June and November 2016. The following results were obtained: 1) There were many items regarding which the students only half understood regarding hand sewing knowledge. The problem in the questionnaires was a low response rate and a low percentage of correct answers. 2) The evaluations for hand sewing skills were significantly higher for women than for men with ball knots, ball beads, plain stitch, half backstitch, and back stitches. Around 10 percent of all students could not sew a half backstitch, a backstitch or a <b>hem</b> <b>stitch.</b> 3) About half the students could not sew a straight stitch. Moreover, about half the students could not hold cloth suitably to perform a plain stitch. It was found that students who could hold cloth correctly were able to perform a straight stitch. 4) Furthermore, basic skills such as how to handle a needle and cloth were found {{to be related to the}} skill evaluations...|$|R

50|$|In {{the state}} of Johor, both the design and the wearing of Baju Melayu is {{somewhat}} {{different from that of}} other areas. Here, the kain samping or kain sarung is worn below the baju rather than above it. The baju itself does not have the cekak musang collar or any placket. Instead, the opening is <b>hemmed</b> with stiff <b>stitching</b> called tulang belut (literally eel's spine) and ends with a small loop at the top of one side to fit a singular kancing (similar to the collars of Baju Kurung worn by women). This style is known as the Teluk Belanga style and was believed to be designed by Sultan Abu Bakar's aides to commemorate the move of Johor's administrative capital from Teluk Belanga in Singapore to Tanjung Puteri in 1866 (known as Johor Bahru from 1866).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my piece is to {{illuminate}} the wonders and beauties of each individual woman. It’s telling {{a story about a}} woman’s journey into finding herself between a young woman and a sophisticated adult. This relates to me immensely because I am also taking this journey where I am finding myself in this world. The woman to wear this garment is fearless and confident but has grace and elegance. She never lets anything get her down and is always looking at the positive aspects of life. Process: During the design development of this project, photos of Paris were reviewed and the common theme of elegance from the images was used as a major source of visual inspiration. It gave a sense of independence and beauty that so many women strive for. I then looked and researched more photos and I fell in love with photos that are classy and elegant {{from the front of the}} garment but when the wearer turns around the back is subtlety sexy. This inspired me to my dress with an open back and elegant front. Techniques: This dress was created through the draping technique. From the draping a pattern was made and a sample from the pattern was fitted on my model. Adjustments were made to the pattern and the final product was constructed. The garment is fully lined and features an invisible zipper and a hand <b>stitched</b> <b>hem.</b> Materials: 100 -percent black polyester exterior fabric, black polyester lining, invisible zipper and thread...|$|R
