The Kauravas wished to reveal Pandavas' real identities {{so that they would}} repeat another exile of 13 years in a cyclic fashion. The issues faced by the Pandavas and their wife Draupadi at Matsya due to various factors, notably Virata's brother-in-law Kichaka form the rest of the story.|$|E
5|$|Early in Ahmedabad's history, under Ahmed Shah, {{builders}} fused Hindu craftsmanship with Persian architecture, {{giving rise}} to the Indo-Saracenic style.

It is entirely arched and has ten stone latticework windows or jali {{on the side and}} rear arches. Private mansions or haveli from this era have carvings.

5|$|Linnaeus {{entered the}} Växjö Katedralskola in 1724, {{where he studied}} mainly Greek, Hebrew, {{theology}} and mathematics, a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> at the gymnasium, Linnaeus' father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live {{with his family in}} Växjö and to teach him physiology and botany. Nils accepted this offer.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his life}} in {{politics}} and his long military career he characterised the arrogant and extravagant aristocrat of the period.

5|$|From the {{unexpected}} realism {{of his first}} major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company {{with a variety of}} high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by Class of '44, a slice-of-life film made up of vignettes about Herman Raucher and Oscar Seltzer's experiences in college. Class of '44 involves the boys facing army service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of World War II. The only crew member from Summer of '42 {{to return to the}} project was Raucher himself, who wrote the script; a new director and composer were brought in to replace Mulligan and Legrand. Of the principal four cast members of Summer of '42, only Jerry Houser and Gary Grimes returned for prominent roles, with Oliver Conant making two brief appearances totaling less than two minutes of screen time. Jennifer O'Neill did not appear in the film at all, nor was the character of Dorothy mentioned.|$|E

That year, the new mayor opened an investigation against eleven former city officials alleged to be involved in the financial case. On November 8, 2016, one of the city's former financial heads, Juan Fernando Miranda Macías, was arrested for illegally using city resources. He was released from prison in two days after a judge concluded that the accusations against him were inconclusive.|$|E

I {{can only hope that}} they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

5|$|Instrumental {{in facilitating}} the trade to Florida was Bertuzzi's {{positive}} relationship with Panthers general manager Mike Keenan, {{who was his}} first coach in Vancouver. Debuting with the Panthers on October 6, 2006, Bertuzzi scored a goal and three assists in an 8–3 win against the Boston Bruins. He appeared in six more games for Florida, notching seven points total, before being sidelined with back spasms. After being diagnosed with a herniated disc in early-November, Bertuzzi opted for surgery, which {{kept him out of}} the lineup for five months. While recovering, the Panthers dealt him to the Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline in exchange for forward prospect Shawn Matthias and conditional draft picks. Bertuzzi was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of his contract with no guarantee he would re-sign with Florida in the off-season.|$|E
5|$|O'Rourke {{left for}} a second time in May 1930, after he {{resigned}} because he was not allowed to sign a player he wanted. City spent eight seasons back in Division Two but the nearest they came to stepping up to the top flight was in 1933–34 when at one point they topped the division. Their sixth-place finish was the highest position since the club had been in Division One and would not be bettered until the 1980s. Relegation back to Division Three (North) came in 1936–37. City were runners-up in the Division Three North Challenge Cup a year later before they won the same competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> before league football was again suspended because of war.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis {{seized from}} the French {{thousands}} of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles {{of weapons and}} raw materials such as copper, tin, oil and nickel. Financial demands were levied on {{the governments of the}} occupied countries as well and payments for occupation costs were received from France, Belgium and Norway. Barriers to trade led to hoarding, black markets and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most areas of Europe, {{but not as much as}} during World War I.
