5|$|Chrétien's {{position}} {{was far more}} <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> Johnson's: Part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had been moving the country away from large scale constitutional debates. Provincial governments were also far more hostile to the constitutional process {{than they had been}} in the decade prior, with even the federal government's typical ally, Ontario, being firmly against any pursuit of constitutional accommodation.|$|E

She considered {{the writing of}} songs for Ketika Cinta Bertasbih to be more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> her previous work in teen romances, {{as it was a}} religious film. As such, she felt that she had to be extra careful.|$|E

5|$|In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") {{theory was}} the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> general relativity, with the {{equations}} of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the songs}} on Demolition J-7 were written while Scott Kannberg and Jason Fawkes were in their {{short-lived}} band, Pa. After Stephen Malkmus heard demos recorded by Pa, the songs turned into a Pavement project. The recording session for Demolition J-7 was more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> for Slay Tracks due to tension between producer Gary Young and Fawkes. The EP received favorable reception from critics and fans, and solidified the band's cult fanbase.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked about}} the {{possibility}} of a European release, Nintendo representatives said there were no plans for one, and remarked that preparing an RPG for release in Europe is far more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> other regions due to the need to optimize the game for PAL TV systems and translate it into multiple languages.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{new road}} proved far more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> first imagined. Workers {{followed}} an old Native American trail, wholly consumed by nature, between Delhi and Port Talbot. To get across the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a corduroy road, much {{to the chagrin of}} settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering that the road remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular and winding route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the corduroy logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.|$|E
5|$|Digging {{the tunnel}} {{turned out to}} be more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> expected. The soil was rocky, which forced the men to dig deeper than planned. There, they {{discovered}} a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified to discover that the entrance was blocked by a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.|$|E
5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population is more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> {{it is in}} the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E

5|$|Echo & the Bunnymen is {{the fifth}} studio album by the English post-punk band Echo & the Bunnymen, their last with drummer Pete de Freitas, who died in 1989 in a {{motorcycle}} accident, aged 27. The album was produced by Laurie Latham who recorded the album in Germany, Belgium, London and Liverpool; this followed an aborted attempt at recording the album without de Freitas and with producer Gil Norton. With Latham being an exacting producer, and singer Ian McCulloch receiving star treatment and drinking heavily, the recording of the album was more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> the band had initially hoped. The album made more use of keyboards than their previous albums, which had been string-heavy.|$|E
5|$|Expected to {{last only}} two days, the {{evacuation}} of remaining evacuees proved more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure {{and a growing number}} of evacuees. By the morning of September 1, Governor Blanco reported that the number of evacuees in the Superdome was down to 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town.|$|E
5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark {{recesses}} of the globe, including the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, and everywhere in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands untouched by modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South Pole, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E
50|$|Though {{cognitive}} interviews {{have been}} shown to yield many positive results, this technique is not without its limitations. The most commonly cited problem regarding cognitive interviews is that they are more <b>difficult</b> to perform <b>than</b> standard police interviews.

5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Fuller and Form {{said the}} casting process for Friday the 13th was more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> that for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because {{thirteen}} young actors {{were involved in}} Friday the 13th, as opposed to five in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The pair continually recast roles to find which actors worked best together. This recasting process lasted until the start of filming. s Richard Burgi, who was cast as Sheriff Bracke, did not sign his contract until twelve hours before he was due to start filming his scenes.|$|E
5|$|In the third-season premiere, Shelly accepts J.T.'s {{marriage}} proposal. Donovan gets a work visa {{after finding}} a job selling makeup products for a British company. Shelly and J.T. break up again, resolving to remain just friends. J.T. pursues a career in medicine and enrolls in the Miami State Medical School. He finds out that college is more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> he first thought, and struggles with his classes and finances. During the spring, Rita reignites her relationship with Donovan and buys her own apartment. In the series' finale, Beverly finally admits to Yusef, Shelly's father, that she is carrying his child; Shelly questions his ability {{to be a father}} again. The series ends in a cliffhanger, with Janie, Rita, and Nick arrested for illegally selling BOTOX at DivaStyle.|$|E

5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide it simply have to select an intercept point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the intercept point is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful radar systems, and faster computers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, {{there were still}} huge numbers of Roman Catholics. Some conformed, bending with the times, hoping {{that there would be}} a fresh reverse. Vestments were still hidden, golden candlesticks bequeathed, chalices kept. The Mass was still celebrated in some places {{alongside}} the new Communion service but was more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> before. Both Roman Catholic priests and laity lived a double life, apparently conforming, but avoiding taking the oath of conformity. Only as time passed did recusancy—refusal to attend Protestant services—became more common. Jesuits and seminary priests, trained in Douai and Rome to make good the losses of English priests, encouraged this.|$|E
5|$|Pundits {{and fans}} who opposed Kansas' {{selection}} {{pointed to the}} Jayhawks' strength of schedule, which {{at one point during}} the season was as low as 109th out of 119Division I teams. By the time of the BCS selection, however, Kansas's strength of schedule had climbed by a small amount, reaching 88th in the Sagarin rankings and 74th in the CBS rankings. The final rankings rated Kansas' schedule as more <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> Hawaii, which was also selected to play in the BCS. Aggravating the situation was the fact that Kansas and Missouri had one of the most intense rivalries in college football. Known as the Border War, the roots of the rivalry dated to the years before the American Civil War.|$|E
