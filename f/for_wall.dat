5|$|Casting metalware in Chamba is {{an ancient}} tradition, {{dating back to the}} Bronze Age period, with items {{typically}} made out of copper or brass, and also iron, especially in the traditional making of implements and weapons by blacksmiths. Of particular note in this trade are the large plaques with reliefs, commonly used <b>for</b> <b>wall</b> decoration. The temple cupolas in Chamba district are often furnished with copper and brass items made in Chamba and often the golden kalasha or vessel crowning them is produced here.|$|E

Stanley Weiser had worked on a treatment for a sequel set in the present with Gekko being released from jail; the second part would be set in China. The studio felt that the material was dated, and put the project in turnaround. Stone had a falling out with Pressman, the producer, and began work on W. with Weiser. Weiser's treatment <b>for</b> <b>Wall</b> Street Two was discarded and the film began taking shape from an original script by Stephen Schiff. It was reported that Aaron Sorkin had turned down {{the opportunity to work}} on the film's script.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other great}} {{scholars}} {{of the age}} he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over one thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from his vast correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator's early maps were in large formats suitable <b>for</b> <b>wall</b> mounting but {{in the second half}} of his life he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his Atlas of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word Atlas in a geographical context but Mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise (Cosmologia) on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose the word as a commemoration of a King Atlas of Mauretania whom he considered to be the first great geographer. This King Atlas was a son of the Titan Atlas but the two myths very quickly coalesced.|$|E

The house, believed to have been occupied by French Canadians, was a long narrow building consisting of a parlor flanked by two bedrooms with a fenced garden or animal pen at one end.

25|$|As {{is often}} the case in archaeology, it is {{everyday}} records that give the best picture of a civilization. Cuneiform tablets were constantly moving around the ancient Near East, offering alliances (sometimes including daughters for marriage), threatening war, acting as shipping documents for mundane supplies or settling accounts receivable. Most were tossed away after use the way that we would discard unwanted receipts.

25|$|Mosaic was {{a common}} form of {{decoration}} throughout the Roman Empire and because of its durability was usually applied to floors, where it was at first executed in pebbles or small marble tiles. During the Early Christian period glass tiles were used extensively <b>for</b> <b>wall</b> and vault decorations, the vault of the Mausoleum of Santa Costanza in Rome being {{a fine example of}} decorative, non-narrative Christian mosaic. A perhaps unique example of Late Roman pictorial mosaic is the magnificent apsidal mosaic of the Church of Santa Pudenziana. The nearby church, dedicated to her sister Santa Prassede, has mosaics which are Byzantine in style.|$|E
25|$|The {{demolition}} of buildings containing {{large amounts of}} asbestos based materials pose particular problems for builders and property developers – such buildings often have to be deconstructed piece by piece, or the asbestos has to be painstakingly removed before the structure can be razed by mechanical or explosive means. One such example is the Red Road Flats in Glasgow, Scotland which used huge amounts of asbestos cement board <b>for</b> <b>wall</b> panelling – here British health and safety regulations stipulate that asbestos material has to be removed to a landfill site via an approved route at certain {{times of the day}} in specially adapted vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Coulomb (1776) first {{studied the}} problem of lateral earth {{pressures}} on retaining structures. He used limit equilibrium theory, which considers the failing soil block as a free body {{in order to determine}} the limiting horizontal earth pressure. The limiting horizontal pressures at failure in extension or compression are used to determine the Ka and Kp respectively. Since the problem is indeterminate, a number of potential failure surfaces must be analysed to identify the critical failure surface (i.e. the surface that produces the maximum or minimum thrust on the wall). Mayniel (1908) later extended Coulomb's equations to account <b>for</b> <b>wall</b> friction, symbolized by δ. Müller-Breslau (1906) further generalized Mayniel's equations for a non-horizontal backfill and a non-vertical soil-wall interface (represented by angle θ from the vertical).|$|E

She's {{a young woman in}} difficult circumstances, frightened, trying to understand her abilities and burdened by expectation and convention. It's easy to sympathise with her and marvel at her ability when she builds her spectacular palace in the mountains.

[...] Stuff.co.nz's James Croot compared her [...] "humiliation and exile" [...] to that of Simba in The Lion King.

500|$|By {{the end of}} [...] August 2001, his company's stock value still falling, Lay named Greg Whalley, {{president}} and COO of Enron Wholesale Services and Mark Frevert, to positions in the chairman's office. Some observers suggested that Enron's investors were in significant need of reassurance, {{not only because the}} company's business was difficult to understand (even [...] "indecipherable") but also because it was difficult to properly describe the company in financial statements. One analyst stated [...] "it's really hard for analysts to determine where [...] are making money in a given quarter and where they are losing money." [...] Lay accepted that Enron's business was very complex, but asserted that analysts would [...] "never get all the information they want" [...] to satisfy their curiosity. He also explained that the complexity of the business was due largely to tax strategies and position-hedging. Lay's efforts seemed to meet with limited success; by September 9, one prominent hedge fund manager noted that [...] " [...] stock is trading under a cloud." [...] The sudden departure of Skilling combined with the opacity of Enron's accounting books made proper assessment difficult <b>for</b> <b>Wall</b> Street. In addition, the company admitted to repeatedly using [...] "related-party transactions," [...] which some feared could be too-easily used to transfer losses that might otherwise appear on Enron's own balance sheet.
