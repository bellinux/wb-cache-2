5|$|Despite the show's success, Chapman {{was still}} unsure about abandoning his medical career. In {{between the two}} series of At Last the 1948 Show he {{completed}} his studies at St Bartholomew's, and became professionally registered as a doctor. Chapman and Cleese also wrote for the long-running television comedy series Doctor in the House, and both appeared on a one-off television special, How to Irritate People alongside Brooke-Taylor and Michael Palin. One of Cleese and Chapman's sketches, featuring a used car salesman refusing to believe a customer's model had broken down, became {{the inspiration for the}} Dead Parrot sketch.

5|$|Dunning {{remained}} in charge at Columbia until 1 May 1943, when the Manhattan District {{took over the}} contract. By this time Slack's group had nearly 50 members. His was the largest group, and it {{was working on the}} most challenging problem: the design of a suitable barrier through which the gas could diffuse. Another 30 scientists and technicians were working in the other five groups. Henry A. Boorse was responsible for the pumps; Booth for the cascade test units. Libby handled chemistry, Nier analytical work and Hugh C. Paxton, engineering support. The Army reorganized the research effort at Columbia, which became the Special Alloyed Materials (SAM) Laboratories. Urey was put <b>in</b> <b>charge,</b> <b>with</b> Dunning becoming head of one of its divisions.

Allardyce's first game in charge was a 3–0 victory over Stoke City at Ewood Park three days later. This was {{the first game of}} a nine-game unbeaten run. He strengthened the team by spending £2million on Sunderland winger El Hadji Diouf and brought in defender Gaël Givet on loan from Marseille.

He was tasked with keeping the club steady whilst it struggled with financial problems. He decided {{to cut back}} on the club's youth coaching spending, and as a result Wrexham's youth structure was downgraded from an Academy to a Centre of Excellence. He signed goalkeeper Marius Røvde, midfielder Jim Whitley, and gave striker Hector Sam his debut, but failed to keep Wrexham away from the relegation zone. With relegation confirmed, new signing Lee Jones scored all five goals in a 5–0 win over Cambridge United, leaving cause for optimism at the Racecourse Ground.|$|E

As the Programs Evaluation Office was already in place in the U.S. Embassy, it was tasked with furnishing the needed equipment from Department of Defense stores. Trainers came from Lair's PARU cadre.

25|$|British {{authorities}} quickly realised {{that these}} men could not just be dumped into any old armaments factory because of two problems – the obvious one of language (most Belgian soldiers spoke little or no English) and totally different working practices.

After all, it was the British government who was paying for everything, even if the Belgian government was finding the workers. Birtley was chosen as one of these sites.|$|E

The following season, Ajax again lost out on the Eredivisie title to PSV, but won the European Cup Winners' Cup, its first continental trophy in 14 years. After this, Cruyff left the club to become manager of Barcelona and Rijkaard and Van Basten were sold to Sporting CP and Milan respectively. Despite these losses, Ajax reached a second consecutive Cup Winners' Cup final in 1988, where they lost to Belgian club KV Mechelen.|$|E

Westley, Salt River's mechanical engineer in charge, who had it plinthed just inside the entrance to the works.
