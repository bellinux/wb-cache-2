5|$|Because of {{its high}} salt concentration, the lake water <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> dense, and most people can float more easily than in other bodies of water, {{particularly}} in Gunnison Bay, the saltier north arm of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Coverage {{in rural}} areas <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> low, given the level of {{economic}} development and sector development. Using a broad definition of access, based on the WHO definition of an improved water source, access {{in rural areas}} in Colombia was 71%, while it was 81% in Honduras - a considerably poorer country - and 89% in Ecuador, also a poorer country than Colombia.|$|E

5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> highly inclined to {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Some notable {{feats of}} {{problem-solving}} {{provide evidence that}} the common raven <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> intelligent. Over the centuries, {{it has been the}} subject of mythology, folklore, art, and literature. In many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and Siberia and northeast Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or god.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the piece <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> symmetric. It opens and closes with a duet including a chorale text. Harmonically, the piece begins and ends in C major, and the central movement is in D minor. The second movement modulates from A minor to F major, while the fourth movement mirrors this motion.|$|E

5|$|From Thunderball {{through to}} Die Another Day, the gun barrel {{sequence}} segues into the pre-title sequence {{by having the}} opening shot be sighted through the barrel. Beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me, the teasers emphasised not only action sequences but stunts, a practice that prevailed until Casino Royale. The sequence for The World Is Not Enough <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> long: at over fourteen minutes it is {{two to three times}} the length of most others.|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a stable}} G-type star, meaning it shines with white light {{that can be}} seen in the Sun. In terms of mass, the star {{exhibits}} almost identical properties. HD 2039 exhibits a radius approximately 40 percent larger than the Sun's. The star is slightly hotter than the Sun; while HD 2039 has a temperature of 5935 K, the Sun's surface temperature lies nearly 200 kelvins lower at 5778 K. HD 2039 <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> metal-rich, which has attracted the attention of astrophysicists.|$|E
5|$|Haumea's moons are {{unusual in}} a number of ways. They are thought to be part of its {{extended}} collisional family, which formed billions of years ago from icy debris after a large impact disrupted Haumea's ice mantle. Hiʻiaka, the larger, outermost moon, has large amounts of pure water ice on its surface, which is rare among Kuiper belt objects. Namaka, about one tenth the mass, has an orbit with surprising dynamics: it <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> eccentric and appears to be greatly influenced by the larger satellite.|$|E
6000|$|This gentleman’s white head <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> large, and his {{shock of}} white hair <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> thick and ample. ‘I suppose, waiter,’ he said, shaking his shock of hair, as a Newfoundland dog might shake his before sitting down to dinner, ‘that a fair lodging for a single buffer might be found in these parts, eh?’ ...|$|R

5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Scotland <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> varied for {{a country}} of its size, {{with a large number}} of differing {{geological}} features. There are three main geographical sub-divisions: the Highlands and Islands is a diverse area which lies to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault; the Central Lowlands is a rift valley mainly comprising Paleozoic formations; and the Southern Uplands, which lie south of the Southern Uplands Fault, are largely composed of Silurian deposits.|$|E
5|$|The long tail of Kentrosaurus {{results in}} a {{position}} of the center of mass that <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> far back for a quadrupedal animal. It rests {{just in front of the}} hip, a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs. However, the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, did not support the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E

5|$|At night, a carnivorous, shape-shifting alien named Kator {{lands in}} the woods of rural England. The vanguard of an {{invasion}} force, his mission is to evaluate the suitability of humans {{as a source of}} food for his species. Stumbling across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their parked car, he kills both and assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. The women are vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist's attacking batting {{has been}} {{a key part of}} Australia's one-day success, as he usually opened the batting. He {{was a part of the}} {{successful}} 1999, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns. Gilchrist's Test batting average in the upper 40s <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> high for a wicket-keeper. He is currently 45th on the all–time list of highest batting averages. He maintains a Test strike-rate of 82 runs per hundred balls, the highest since balls were recorded in full. His combination of attack and consistency create one of the most dynamic world cricketers ever, playing shots to all areas of the field with uncommon timing. He is second on the all-time list of most sixes in Tests at 100 with only Brendon McCullum ahead of him with 107. Gilchrist's skills as a wicket-keeper are sometimes questioned; some people claim that he is the best keeper in Australia whilst others claim that Victorian wicket-keeper Darren Berry is the best Australian wicket-keeper of the 1990s and early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|In 1636 {{the space}} beneath the south west tower became a bishop's consistory court. It was {{furnished}} as such at that time, {{and is now}} a unique survival in England, hearing its last case, that of an attempted suicide of a priest, in the 1930s. Until 1881, the south transept, which <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> large, also took on a separate function as an independent ecclesiastical entity: the parish church of St Oswald. Although the 17thcentury saw additions to the furnishings and fittings, there was no further building work for several centuries. By the 19thcentury, the building was badly in need of restoration. The present homogeneous appearance that the cathedral presents from many exterior angles is largely the work of Victorian restorers, particularly George Gilbert Scott.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{cynical and}} despairing over his recent break-up with ex-girlfriend Felicia, the normally-grumpy Bolander (Ned Beatty) <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> cheerful {{as a result}} of his budding romantic relationship with Linda (Julianna Margulies), a much younger (26-year-old) waitress. Nervous about his first real date with her, Bolander asks Howard (Melissa Leo) to go on a double-date with him, along with Howard's boyfriend, prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek). The double date goes well until a lonely Munch crashes, joins the table and ruins the mood of the evening complaining about his romantic woes. Bolander, Munch and Linda leave together and walk to Fort McHenry, where Linda offers Munch words of encouragement. Impressed with her, Munch leaves Linda and Bolander alone, where they happily watch a fireworks show.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Raleigh, North Carolina, a {{young couple}} are kidnapped by a man dressed as a police officer. Several days later, Scully and her partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) discuss the case in Mulder's office at FBI headquarters. Mulder relates that the case {{seems to be the}} work of a repeat offender, and {{there is reason to believe}} the couple will be killed in a matter of days. He also tells Scully that Luther Lee Boggs (Brad Dourif), a serial killer he had helped to {{apprehend}} years before, has claimed to have had psychic revelations about the kidnapping and has offered to help police in exchange for his death sentence being commuted. Mulder <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> skeptical about Boggs' claims.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the nine}} figures depicted, five are looking {{directly}} {{out at the}} royal couple or the viewer. Their glances, along with the king and queen's reflection, affirm the royal couple's presence outside the painted space. Alternatively, art historians H. W. Janson and Joel Snyder suggest {{that the image of}} the king and queen is a reflection from Velázquez's canvas, the front of which is obscured from the viewer. Other writers say the canvas Velázquez is painting <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> large for a portrait by Velázquez, and is about the same size as Las Meninas. Las Meninas contains the only known double portrait of the royal couple painted by Velázquez.|$|E
