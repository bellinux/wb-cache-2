Tumor recurrence is common with no available cure. The current standard-of-care can cause significant morbidities including a sharply elevated risk for secondary malignancies, ototoxicity and neurophysiological sequelae.

This is predicated on our ability to <b>deliver</b> <b>ex</b> vivo expanded and activated clinical grade NK cells to the tumor microenvironment through an ommaya reservoir. In pre-clinical studies we observed that many MBs and ATRT were susceptible to NK cells in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveMore than 50 % of aortocoronary {{saphenous vein}} grafts are {{occluded}} 10 years after surgery. Intimal hyperplasia is an initial, critical {{step in the}} progression toward occlusion. To date, no clinically relevant large animal models of aortocoronary saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia have been fully characterized. Gene therapy holds promise as a novel treatment for aortocoronary saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia. The 2 objectives {{of this study are}} to characterize a canine model of aortocoronary saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia and to demonstrate that ex vivo gene delivery is possible in these grafts using adenoviral vectors. MethodsTen dogs underwent aortocoronary bypass grafting using saphenous veins. Six dogs underwent serial arteriograms to monitor graft patency. On postoperative day 90, the dogs were killed and their grafted and nongrafted saphenous veins were studied histologically. Four dogs underwent the same procedure, but their saphenous veins were treated with 1 × 1012 total viral particles of a replication-deficient, recombinant adenovirus containing β-galactosidase (n = 2) or the β-adrenergic receptor kinase carboxyl terminus (n = 2). These animals were killed on postoperative day 7 for determination of transgene expression. ResultsAll grafts were demonstrated patent by arteriogram before the animals were killed. The mean intimal area of the saphenous vein grafts was increased when compared with that of the nongrafted saphenous veins (2. 83 mm 2 vs 0. 09 mm 2, P <. 0008). Adenoviral-treated saphenous vein grafts demonstrated positive transgene expression either by X-gal staining (β-galactosidase) or Northern analysis (β-adrenergic receptor kinase carboxyl terminus). ConclusionThis study characterizes a clinically relevant canine model of aortocoronary saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia. In addition, it demonstrates that adenoviral vectors can be <b>delivered</b> <b>ex</b> vivo to the saphenous vein graft vessel wall at subphysiologic distension pressures. This model may be used in future studies to manipulate molecular targets critical in aortocoronary saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates empirically the {{performance}} of six structural credit risk models by comparing the probabilities of default (PDs) they <b>deliver</b> to <b>ex</b> post default rates. In contrast to previous studies pursuing similar objectives, the paper employs firm-level data and finds that theory-based PDs tend to match closely the actual level of credit risk and to account for its time path. At the same time, nonmodelled macro variables from the financial and real sides of the economy help to substantially improve the forecasts of default rates. The finding suggests that theory-based PDs fail to fully reflect the dependence of credit risk on the business and credit cycles. Most of the upbeat conclusions regarding {{the performance}} of the PDs are due to models with endogenous default. For their part, frameworks that assume exogenous default tend to underpredict credit risk. Three borrower characteristics influence materially the predictions of the models: the leverage ratio; the default recovery rate; and the risk-free rate of return.

40|$|Lentiviral vectors (LVs) {{have emerged}} as potent and {{versatile}} vectors for ex vivo or in vivo gene transfer into dividing and nondividing cells. Robust phenotypic correction of diseases in mouse models has been achieved paving the way toward the first clinical trials. LVs can <b>deliver</b> genes <b>ex</b> vivo into bona fide stem cells, particularly hematopoietic stem cells, allowing for stable transgene expression upon hematopoietic reconstitution. They are also useful to generate induced pluripotent stem cells. LVs can be pseudotyped with distinct viral envelopes that influence vector tropism and transduction efficiency. Targetable LVs can be generated by incorporating specific ligands or antibodies into the vector envelope. Immune responses toward the transgene products and transduced cells can be repressed using microRNA-regulated vectors. Though there are safety concerns regarding insertional mutagenesis, their integration profile seems more favorable than that of γ-retroviral vectors (γ-RVs). Moreover, {{it is possible to}} minimize this risk by modifying the vector design or by employing integration-deficient LVs.

Here we have demonstrated that two marker genes (lacZ and neo) and cDNA coding for a potentially therapeutic protein (human interleukin 1 -receptor-antagonist protein; IRAP or IL- 1 ra) can be <b>delivered,</b> by <b>ex</b> vivo techniques, to the synovial lining of joints; intraarticular expression of IRAP inhibited intraarticular responses to interleukin 1. To achieve this, lapine synoviocytes were first transduced in culture by retroviral infection. The genetically modified synovial cells were then transplanted by intraarticular injection into the knee joints of rabbits, where they efficiently colonized the synovium. Assay of joint lavages confirmed the in vivo expression of biologically active human IRAP. With allografted cells, IRAP expression was lost by 12 days after transfer. In contrast, autografted synoviocytes continued to express IRAP for approximately 5 weeks. Knee joints expressing human IRAP were protected from the leukocytosis that otherwise follows the intraarticular injection of recombinant human interleukin 1 beta. Thus, we report the intraarticular expression and activity of a potentially therapeutic protein by gene-transfer technology; these experiments demonstrate the feasibility of treating arthritis and other joint disorders with gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} {{the boundaries of}} the set of transfers implementing a given allocation rule without imposing any assumptions on the agent's type space or utility function besides quasi-linearity. In particular, we {{characterize the}} pointwise largest and the pointwise smallest transfer that implement a given allocation rule and are equal to zero at some prespecied type (extremal transfers). Exploiting the concept of extremal transfers allows us to obtain an exact characterization of the set of all implementable allocation rules (the set of transfers is non-empty) and the set of allocation rules satisfying Revenue Equivalence (the extremal transfers coincide). Furthermore, we show how the extremal transfers can be put to use in mechanism design problems where Revenue Equivalence does not hold. To this end we rst explore the role of extremal transfers when the agents with type dependent outside options are free to participate in the mechanism. Finally, we consider the question of budget balanced implementation.
