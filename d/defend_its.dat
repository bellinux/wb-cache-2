5|$|Although {{generally}} a peaceful bird, which lives quite happily alongside humans, the willie wagtail will <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> nest aggressively. Willie wagtails {{are known to}} swoop at passers by, much like the Australian magpie. While attacks from willie wagtails are not as common or as formidable as the magpie, they do come as a great shock to recipients.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} is {{socially}} monogamous. Conspecific or intraspecific brood parasitism, where the female lays {{eggs in the}} nest of others of their own species is common with nearly 40% of nests being parasitized on average. In terms of territory, this grebe will only <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> nest site.|$|E
5|$|Despite the British training, the SLA was {{not large}} enough or {{strong enough to}} enter into combat with the RUF while also holding the ground it had recaptured, so the British persuaded UNAMSIL to move forward behind the {{advancing}} SLA to <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> recaptured ground. Additional British liaison officers were attached to UNAMSIL, and the British facilitated a daily coordination meeting for SLA and UNAMSIL commanders, while also assisting the UN forces in drawing up a campaign plan.|$|E

He recorded one assist in six games, though Canada was unable to <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> 2002 gold medal, failing to medal entirely. Regehr participated in team Canada's orientation camp for the 2010 Games in the hopes of earning a second opportunity to win an Olympic medal.|$|E
5|$|Individual feeding territories vary in {{size from}} , with the general {{concentration}} of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance, adequate denning sites, and competition with conspecifics and other predators. The coyote generally does not <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> territory outside of the denning season, and is much less aggressive towards intruders than the wolf is, typically chasing and sparring with them, but rarely killing them. Conflicts between coyotes can arise during times of food shortage.|$|E
5|$|While the ACLU {{rushed to}} <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> image against {{allegations}} {{of being a}} communist front, it also worked to protect witnesses who were being harassed by the HUAC. The ACLU {{was one of the}} few organizations to protest (unsuccessfully) against passage of the Smith Act in 1940, which would later be used to imprison many persons who supported Communism. The ACLU defended many persons who were prosecuted under the Smith Act, including labor leader Harry Bridges.|$|E

5|$|Commandant Chaltin {{recovered}} three cannons, {{over seven}} hundred rifles, and a considerable supply of provisions from the Mahdist post at Rejaf. Three thousand Congolese regulars were garrisoned at the town, and a gunboat {{was brought up}} the Nile to <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> ports. After securing Rejaf, Chaltin and his column marched to the northernmost point of the Lado Enclave {{in order to establish}} a Belgian presence in the area and prevent Mahdist reentry. A serious assault on the post at Rejaf occurred in June 1898, when Mahdists forced their way through Free State defenses before being finally defeated near the town.|$|E
5|$|From the 1890s onwards, Muller had {{published}} with great regularity {{about the importance}} of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in international affairs. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and the necessity for the Dutch government to <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon had {{calculated}} that Kutuzov, expecting reinforcements from Russia to <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> political allies, would withdraw toward Vienna; he envisioned that his and Kutuzov's armies would {{engage in a}} great battle at Vienna, and that this battle would decide the war. Consequently, Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the Grande Armée {{to create a new}} VIII Corps. This corps was to secure the north shore of the Danube, block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and, more importantly, prevent Kutuzov from crossing the river and escaping to Russia.|$|E

Team North America clinched the cup in the second round of skins play after holding back a late Team World comeback, giving Team North America a 5–4 edge in the overall cup record.

5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy (Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine, {{shortened}} to k.u.k. Kriegsmarine) built {{a series}} of battleships between the early 1900s and 1917. To <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> Adriatic coast in wartime, Austria-Hungary had previously built {{a series of}} smaller ironclad warships, including coastal defense ships, and armored cruisers. The appointment of Admiral Hermann von Spaun to the post of State Secretary of the Navy in 1897 accelerated naval construction and {{under the command of}} Franz Joseph I of Austria, the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine began a program of naval expansion {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. The navy immediately pushed for the construction of the three s, after which soon followed three of the , all of which were pre-dreadnoughts.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} Alboin's reign as king in Pannonia {{following}} the death of his father, Audoin, was one of confrontation and conflict between the Lombards and their main neighbors, the Gepids. The Gepids initially gained the upper hand, but in 567, thanks to his alliance with the Avars, Alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies, whose lands the Avars subsequently occupied. The increasing power of his new neighbours caused Alboin some unease however, and he therefore decided to leave Pannonia for Italy, hoping {{to take advantage of the}} Byzantine Empire's reduced ability to <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> territory in the wake of the Gothic War.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the European or American robins but {{appear to be an}} early offshoot of the Passerida group of songbirds. The flame robin is predominantly insectivorous, pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A territorial bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> territory. Classified by BirdLife International as Near Threatened, the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.|$|E
5|$|Tsar Nicholas II had desired a warm-water port on the Pacific {{since his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} in 1894. He achieved this ambition in March 1898 when Russia signed a 25-year lease for Port Arthur and the Liaotung Peninsula with China. Japan had previously forced China to sign over the port and its surrounding territory {{as part of the}} treaty that concluded the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, but the Triple Intervention of France, Russia, and Germany forced them to return the port in exchange for a sizeable increase in the indemnity paid by the Chinese. Japan invested much of the indemnity money in expanding its fleet, while Russia began a major building programme ("For the Needs of the Far East") to <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> newly acquired port.|$|E
5|$|With {{the decline}} of the Caliphate and its obvious {{inability}} to <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> border provinces, a new local dynasty, the Hamdanids, emerged as the principal antagonists of Byzantium in northern Mesopotamia and Syria. They were led by al-Hasan, called Nasir al-Dawla ("Defender of the State"), and by his younger brother Ali, best known by his epithet, Sayf al-Dawla ("Sword of the State"). In ca. 935, the Arab tribe of Banu Habib, defeated by the rising Hamdanids, defected in its entirety to the Byzantines, converted to Christianity, and placed its 12,000horsemen at the disposal of the Empire. They were settled along the western bank of the Euphrates and assigned to guard five new themes created there: Melitene, Charpezikion, Asmosaton (Arsamosata), Derzene, and Chozanon.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Frederick, the Kingdom was ruled by HenryVII of Germany and ConradIV of Germany. The next {{legitimate}} heir was ConradII, who was too young at the period to rule. Manfred of Sicily, the illegitimate son of Frederick, took the power and ruled the kingdom for fifteen years while other Hohenstaufen heirs were ruling various areas in Germany. After long wars against the Papal States, the Kingdom managed to <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> possessions, but the Papacy declared the Kingdom escheated because of disloyalty of the Hohenstaufen. Under this pretext he came to an agreement with LouisIX, King of France. Louis's brother, Charles of Anjou, would become king of Sicily. In exchange, Charles recognized the overlordship of the Pope in the Kingdom, paid {{a portion of the}} papal debt, and agreed to pay annual tribute to the Papal States. The Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily ended after the 1266 Angevin invasion and {{the death of}} Conradin, the last male heir of Hohenstaufen, in 1268.|$|E
5|$|Although the ZNDH was {{now able}} to mount a {{credible}} threat against the insurgents, by then a new menace was arriving {{from the other side}} of the Adriatic. On 30 June 1943, the first Allied reconnaissance flights were reported, followed by the first USAAF bombers, when 61 B-24 Liberators of IX Bomber Command overflew the NDH on a deep penetration raid on the Austrian city of Wiener Neustadt on 13 August. The ZNDH's 3rd Flak Group, defending Brod na Savi (Slavonski Brod), managed to shoot down a single bomber en route to its target. The best aircraft that the ZNDH could put up to <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> homeland at the end of 1943 were 20 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, 10 Fiat G.50s, six Fiat CR.42s, five Avia BH-33s and two Ikarus IK-2 fighters – aircraft that had been obsolete in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941, Japan launched, {{in quick}} succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong. Churchill's {{reaction}} to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory {{and the future of}} the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the Fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not <b>defend</b> <b>its</b> entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States. This resulted in the 1951 ANZUS Pact between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America.|$|E
