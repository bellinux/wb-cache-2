25|$|This {{background}} prepared Bell {{for work}} with spoken sound waves and electricity. He began his experiments in 1873-1874 with a harmonic telegraph, following {{the examples of}} Bourseul, Reis, and Gray. Bell's designs employed various on-off-on-off make-break current-interrupters driven by vibrating steel reeds which sent interrupted current to a distant receiver <b>electro-magnet</b> that caused a second steel reed or tuning fork to vibrate.|$|E
25|$|In 1840, Wheatstone {{introduced}} his chronoscope, for measuring minute intervals of time, {{which was used}} in determining {{the speed of a}} bullet or the passage of a star. In this apparatus an electric current actuated an <b>electro-magnet,</b> which noted the instant of an occurrence by means of a pencil on a moving paper. It {{is said to have been}} capable of distinguishing 1/7300 part of a second (137 microsecond), and the time a body took to fall from a height of one inch (25mm).|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} use {{was made of}} {{searchlight}} signals; these have a single lamp in front of which is placed either a red, yellow or green filter to show the respective aspect. The filter assembly is moved by an <b>electro-magnet.</b> For a double-yellow aspect a second lamp is fitted, illuminated only when required. A few traditional searchlight signals (i.e. with moving glasses inside) remain in use in the Clacton area, but the concept had a renaissance in the 2000’s {{with the advent of}} LEDs which can show three different colours.|$|E

5000|$|... (4) Where an {{external}} electric supply is provided, this is typically with overhead conductors or above-ground rails or (rarely) sub-surface <b>electro-magnets.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{conductor}} cable was laid {{in a trench}} between the rails. At [...] intervals a box was fitted between the rails that contained a stud (which protruded about [...] above the road) and a bell crank. A magnet on a passing tram attracted this crank which then moved to make contact between the {{conductor cable}} and stud; once the tram moved away the crank dropped away and the stud was no longer connected to the cable. A long skate was suspended beneath each tramcar which was magnetised by <b>electro-magnets</b> and so both operated the cranks and collected the current that both moved the tram car and powered the <b>electro-magnets.</b> A small battery was carried to charge the <b>electro-magnets</b> should the power be interrupted. The negative return current passed through the rails.|$|R
2500|$|Bell {{exhibited}} a working telephone at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in June 1876, where it {{attracted the attention}} of Brazilian emperor Pedro II plus the physicist and engineer Sir William Thomson (who would later be ennobled as the 1st Baron Kelvin). In August 1876 {{at a meeting of the}} British Association for the Advancement of Science, Thomson revealed the telephone to the European public. In describing his visit to the Philadelphia Exhibition, Thomson said, [...] "I heard [...] passages taken at random from the New York newspapers: 'S.S. Cox Has Arrived' (I failed to make out the S.S. Cox); 'The City of New York', 'Senator Morton', 'The Senate Has Resolved To Print A Thousand Extra Copies', 'The Americans In London Have Resolved To Celebrate The Coming Fourth Of July!' All this my own ears heard spoken to me with unmistakable distinctness by the then circular disc armature of just such another little <b>electro-magnet</b> as this I hold in my hand." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{production}} of the shock from the current in the cross wire, whether D was a long extended wire, or a helix, or an <b>electro-magnet,</b> has been already described (1060. 1061. 1064.).|$|E

50|$|For the Dolter {{system a}} {{conductor}} cable was laid {{in a trench}} between the rails. At 9 ft intervals a box was fitted between the rails that contained a stud (which protruded about 1 in above the road) and a bell crank.

6000|$|... 54. A similar spiral had {{the current}} of eighty pairs of 4-inch plates sent through it {{so as to}} form an <b>electro-magnet,</b> {{and then the other}} spiral {{connected}} with the galvanometer (58.) approximated to it; the needle vibrated, indicating a current in the galvanometer spiral the reverse of that in the battery spiral (18. 26.). On withdrawing the latter spiral, the needle passed in the opposite direction.|$|E
6000|$|... 1105. Using the helix only, I {{could not}} obtain {{distinct}} deflections at x, {{due to the}} extra effect on making contact, for the reasons already mentioned (1088.). By using a very fine platina wire there (1083.), I did succeed in obtaining the igniting effect for making contact in the same manner, though by no means to the same degree, as with the <b>electro-magnet</b> (1104).|$|E
6000|$|... 1063. On {{putting a}} bar of soft iron into the helix, it became an <b>electro-magnet</b> (1057.), and its power was {{instantly}} and greatly raised. On putting {{a bar of}} copper into the helix, no change was produced, the action being that of the helix alone. The two helices i and ii, made into one helix of twofold length of wire, produced a greater effect than either i or ii alone.|$|E
50|$|Where signals {{applying}} to opposing directions of travel {{on the same}} line are suitably positioned relative to each other, a common magnet may be used, comprising an unsuppressed permanent magnet associated with both signals' <b>electro-magnets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It is {{recorded}} that in 1855 a Frenchman [...] adapted the Jacquard mechanism {{to a system}} by which it could be worked by <b>electro-magnets.</b> There was significant interest, however trials were not successful, and the development was soon lost in history.|$|R
40|$|Linac 4 is {{the first}} element of the LHC Injectors Upgrade Project and will replace the {{existing}} Linac 2 as linear injector of protons for the CERN accelerators. A new transfer line will link Linac 4 to the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). Approximately hundred normal-conducting <b>electro-magnets</b> are required for beam steering and focusing along the linac and the transfer line. This text concentrates {{on the design of}} the Linac 4 quadrupole magnets. The design and the first magnetic measurements of the inter-tank quadrupole <b>electro-magnets</b> are discussed. In addition, the design and optimization of the transfer line quadrupole magnets are highlighted. The compatibility of the magnetic requirements and the power converter constraints for the latter magnet type is assessed...|$|R
6000|$|... 1081. On {{introducing}} a fine platina wire at x, and employing the <b>electro-magnet</b> at D, no visible effects occurred {{as long as}} contact was continued; but on breaking contact at G or E, the fine wire was instantly ignited and fused. A longer or thicker wire could be so adjusted at x as to show ignition, without fusion, every time the contact was broken at G or E.|$|E
6000|$|... 53. A spiral {{containing}} fourteen feet {{of copper}} wire, being {{connected with the}} galvanometer, and approximated directly towards the marked pole {{in the line of}} its axis, affected the instrument strongly; the current induced in it was in the reverse direction to the current theoretically considered by M. Ampère as existing in the magnet (38.), or as the current in an <b>electro-magnet</b> of similar polarity. As the spiral was withdrawn, the induced current was reversed.|$|E
6000|$|... 1095. If an <b>electro-magnet</b> be employed, {{the effect}} will be still more highly exalted; because the iron, {{magnetized}} {{by the power}} of the continuing current, will lose its magnetism at the moment the current ceases to pass, and in so doing will tend to produce an electric current in the wire around it (37. 38.), in conformity with that which the cessation of current in the helix itself also tends to produce.|$|E
40|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} external-ly powered upper-limb prostheses {{seems to be}} in connection with ex-periments that took place in Ger-many about 1918 in which <b>electro-magnets</b> were used to close the fin-gers of an artificial hand (16). The next reported effort apparently is the research and development pro-gram proposed and carried out by Alderson (1) on electrically powered arm systems during 1946 - 195...|$|R
6000|$|... 58. The {{similarity}} of action, almost amounting to identity, between common magnets and either <b>electro-magnets</b> or volta-electric currents, is strikingly {{in accordance with}} and confirmatory of M. Ampère's theory, and furnishes powerful reasons for believing that the action is the same in both cases; but, as a distinction in language is still necessary, I propose to call the agency thus exerted by ordinary magnets, magneto-electric or magnelectric induction (26).|$|R
40|$|A {{magnetic}} micro robot is {{a microscopic}} magnet that {{is controlled by}} a system of electromagnetic coils that generate a magnetic field to manipulate the magnetic robot. A major chal-lenge for manipulating multiple magnets at microscale is that the applied field affects the entire workspace, {{making it difficult to}} address individual magnets. In this paper, we propose a sys-tem where electromagnetic coils are close to the magnets being manipulated to exploit spatial non-uniformities in the magnetic field. Our model considers the magnetic field generated by the electromagnetic coils and the magnetic fields present from neigh-boring magnetic robots to generate the desired force on each magnet. This approach is demonstrated on a macroscopic, one-dimensional system with two magnets controlled by two <b>electro-magnets</b> using visual feedback control. Additionally, simulation results for a linear system with three magnets and three <b>electro-magnets</b> are shown. While demonstrated at the macroscale, our results suggest that our methods can be extended for microscale manipulation, where it is advantageous to control multiple iden-tical magnets with global fields...|$|R
6000|$|... 1116. Before concluding, I may briefly remark, that {{on using}} a voltaic battery of fifty pairs of plates {{instead of a}} single pair (1052.), the effects were exactly of the same kind. The spark on making contact, for the reasons before given, was very small (1101. 1107.); that on {{breaking}} contact, very excellent and brilliant. The continuous discharge did not seem altered in character, whether a short wire or the powerful <b>electro-magnet</b> were used as a connecting discharger.|$|E
6000|$|... 1059. The {{effects to}} be {{considered}} depend on the conductor employed to complete the communication between the zinc and copper plates of the electromotor; and I shall have to consider this conductor under four different forms: as the helix of an <b>electro-magnet</b> (1056); as an ordinary helix (1053, &c.); as a long extended wire, having its course such that the parts can exert little or no mutual influence; and as a short wire. In all cases the conductor was of copper.|$|E
6000|$|... 1076. When {{the end of}} a short clean copper wire, {{attached}} to one plate of an electromotor, is brought down carefully upon a surface of mercury connected with the other plate, a spark, almost continuous, can be obtained. This I refer to a succession of effects of the following nature: first, contact,--then ignition of the touching points,--recession of the mercury from the mechanical results of the heat produced at the place of contact, and the electro-magnetic condition of the parts at the moment[A], --breaking of the contact and the production of the peculiar intense effect dependent thereon,--renewal of the contact by the returning surface of the undulating mercury,--and then a repetition of the same series of effects, and that with such rapidity as to present the appearance of a continued discharge. If a long wire or an <b>electro-magnet</b> be used as the connecting conductor instead of a short wire, a similar appearance may be produced by tapping the vessel containing the mercury and making it vibrate; but the sparks do not usually follow each other so rapidly as to produce an apparently continuous spark, because of the time required, when the long wire or <b>electro-magnet</b> is used, both for the full development of the current (1101. 1106.) and for its complete cessation.|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} {{which is}} required to allow the principles of magnetic suspension and balance systems (MSBS) {{to be applied to}} the high Reynolds number transonic testing of aircraft models is examined. A test facility is presented as comprising a pressurized transonic cryogenic wind tunnel, with the MSBS providing full six degree of freedom control. The <b>electro-magnets</b> which are superconducting and fed from quiet, bipolar power supplies are examined. A model control system having some self adaptive characteristics is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{powerful}} permanent magnet in the world—for its size—has {{been developed in}} the research laboratories of the General Electric Company in New York. Only {{half the size of}} the eraser on a lead pencil, it will lift a flat-iron weighing 5 lb. Its magnetic attraction is several times as strong as that of any previous magnet. The strongly magnetic alloy forming the magnet can be used, too, in electrical equipment to replace <b>electro-magnets</b> that require current.|$|R
50|$|The herein-described {{method of}} {{compiling}} statistics, which consists in recording separate statistical items {{pertaining to the}} individual by holes or combinations of holes punched in sheets of electrically non-conducting material, and bearing a specific relation {{to each other and}} to a standard, and then counting or tallying such statistical items separately or in combination by means of mechanical counters operated by <b>electro-magnets</b> the circuits through which are controlled by the perforated sheets, substantially as and for the purpose set forth.|$|R
6000|$|... 1049. The inquiry arose {{out of a}} fact {{communicated to}} me by Mr. Jenkin, which is as follows. If an {{ordinary}} wire of short length {{be used as the}} medium of communication between the two plates of an electromotor consisting of a single pair of metals, no management will enable the experimenter to obtain an electric shock from this wire; but if the wire which surrounds an <b>electro-magnet</b> be used, a shock is felt each time the contact with the electromotor is broken, provided the ends of the wire be grasped one in each hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 1060. The {{peculiar}} {{effects are}} best {{shown by the}} <b>electro-magnet</b> (1056.). When {{it was used to}} complete the communication at the electromotor, there was no sensible spark on making contact, but on breaking contact there was a very large and bright spark, with considerable combustion of the mercury. Then, again, with respect to the shock: if the hands were moistened in salt and water, and good contact between them and the wires retained, no shock could be felt upon making contact at the electromotor, but a powerful one on breaking contact.|$|E
6000|$|... 1056. The {{principal}} <b>electro-magnet</b> employed {{consisted of}} a cylindrical bar of soft iron twenty-five inches long, and one inch and three quarters in diameter, bent into a ring, so that the ends nearly touched, and surrounded by three coils of thick copper wire, the similar ends of which were fastened together; each of these terminations was soldered to a copper rod, serving as a conducting continuation of the wire. Hence any electric current sent through the rods was divided in the helices surrounding the ring, into three parts, all of which, however, moved in the same direction. The three wires may therefore be considered as representing one wire, of thrice {{the thickness of the}} wire really used.|$|E
6000|$|... 1052. The {{electromotor}} used {{consisted of}} a cylinder of zinc introduced between the two parts of a double cylinder of copper, and preserved from metallic contact in the usual way by corks. The zinc cylinder was eight inches high and four inches in diameter. Both it and the copper cylinder were supplied with stiff wires, surmounted by cups containing mercury; {{and it was at}} these cups that the contacts of wires, helices, or <b>electro-magnets,</b> used to complete the circuit, were made or broken. These cups I will call G and E throughout the rest of this paper (1079.).|$|R
6000|$|... 2. Certain {{effects of}} the {{induction}} of electrical currents have already been recognised and described: as those of magnetization; Ampère's experiments of bringing a copper disc near to a flat spiral; his repetition with <b>electro-magnets</b> of Arago's extraordinary experiments, and perhaps a few others. Still it appeared unlikely that these could be all the effects which induction by currents could produce; especially as, upon dispensing with iron, almost the whole of them disappear, whilst yet an infinity of bodies, exhibiting definite phenomena of induction with electricity of tension, still remain to be acted upon by the induction of electricity in motion.|$|R
6000|$|... 129. The {{effect of}} {{rotation}} or deflection of the needle, which M. Arago obtained by ordinary magnets, M. Ampère succeeded in procuring by <b>electro-magnets.</b> This is perfectly {{in harmony with}} the results relative to volta-electric and magneto-electric induction described in this paper. And by using flat spirals of copper wire, through which electric currents were sent, in place of ordinary magnetic poles (Ill.), sometimes applying a single one {{to one side of the}} rotating plate, and sometimes two to opposite sides, I obtained the induced currents of electricity from the plate itself, and could lead them away to, and ascertain their existence by, the galvanometer.|$|R
