40|$|The main {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to analyze {{benefits}} of {{the establishment of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Rating</b> Agency. The partial aim is to determine the influence of the credit ratings on economics situation in selected European countries and to analyze problems of current credit rating industry. A slight impact of the credit ratings on the observed countries has been found by way of the analysis of evolution of the yields of ten-year government bonds and the prices of CDS contracts on these bonds. Non-perfect competition, weak transparency of the rating process and conflict of interest are considered as the most important problems of the credit rating agencies. By way of the analysis of the ability of the <b>European</b> <b>Rating</b> Agency to remove or at least to partially eliminate discussed problems has been found that the <b>European</b> <b>Rating</b> Agency {{would not be able to}} remove all problems of the credit rating industry. The uncertainty about the independence of the <b>European</b> <b>Rating</b> Agency is the biggest weakness of this agency. For this reason, we can't expect that the <b>European</b> <b>Rating</b> Agency would be able to make the credit rating process more efficient and improve the situation in the credit rating industry...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that indigenous populations have suffered disproportionately from past infl uenza pandemics. To examine any such patterns for Māori in New Zealand, we {{searched the literature}} and performed new analyses by using additional datasets. The Māori death rate in the 1918 pandemic (4, 230 / 100, 000 population) was 7. 3 × the <b>European</b> <b>rate.</b> In the 1957 pandemic, the Māori death rate (40 / 100, 000) was 6. 2 × the <b>European</b> <b>rate.</b> In the 2009 pandemic, the Māori rate was higher than the <b>European</b> <b>rate</b> (rate ratio 2. 6, 95 % confi dence interval 1. 3 – 5. 3). These fi ndings suggest some decline in pandemic-related ethnic inequalities in death rates over the past century. Nevertheless, the persistent excess in adverse outcomes for Māori, and for Pacifi c persons residing in New Zealand, highlights the need for improved public health responses. Evidence {{suggests that}} indigenous populations have been disproportionately affected more by influenza pandemics than other population groups.

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} {{behavior}} of world interest rates, focusing on the ramifications of European Monetary Union. Our analysis indicates that nominal US interest rates tend to drive <b>European</b> <b>rates</b> at both the short and long horizons. There {{is some evidence that}} US rates are becoming increasingly influenced by <b>European</b> <b>rates,</b> but the relationship is still far from symmetric, despite EMU. We also investigate the empirical determinants of real interest rates over the past decade and a half. Real US interest rates also have an influence upon <b>European</b> <b>rates,</b> although German rates do not appear to have a similar effect upon US rates. Conditioning on foreign interest rates, we find that real interest rates on government debt depend significantly upon current and expected levels of debt, in Europe as in the US. It follows that if US and European budget deficits continue to grow more rapidly than official forecasts, interest rates will rise. What had previously been a strong effect on US interest rates has been diluted by the addition of 2003 to the sample, perhaps reflecting the effect of massive purchases of US securities by foreign central banks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature by presenting a detailed summary of existing problems with credit rating agencies and proposing a model of a European Rating Agency that acts as a competitor and benchmark to the established credit <b>rating</b> agencies. <b>European</b> <b>Rating</b> Agency (ERA) as a new entrant will make a difference by increasing rating transparency and reputation cost for rating agencies at the same time. A vital point when developing the idea of an independent rating agency was the minimization of regulation changes. This will help shareholder to better orientate and understand the functionalities of the <b>European</b> <b>Rating</b> Agency which will make its establishment process easier. Reputation cost (capital) are assumed to be the building blocks that support the unique position of current rating agencies. ERA is modelled specifically to target this information and use the fragile concept of trust and reputation to the benefit of all stakeholder...|$|R

30|$|Second, {{in terms}} of credit <b>rating</b> <b>platform,</b> (1) Advantages: The {{fundamental}} reason of financing difficult problem for high-tech enterprises is information asymmetry. For the banks, lending to high-tech companies, accessing their information, post-loan supervision costs and bearing market risks are higher than loan to large enterprises. In this case, {{if there is no}} effective mechanism to help banks to measure credit risk of high-tech firms and reduce the cost of access to enterprise information, even if the bank with sufficient funds is not willing to take risks in loans. So it is an effective mechanism to establish a credit <b>rating</b> <b>platform</b> of high-tech firms. It is conducive to investors to reduce or avoid investment risks due to the information asymmetry through the use of credit scoring to evaluate high-tech business loan applications. And the credit scoring is in favor of financial institutions to make credit decisions for high-tech enterprises, and take appropriate risk prevention measures and help the construction of technology and financial services platform. (2) Disadvantage: If the credit rating agencies could not provide a fair, transparent and correct credit rating, it would be exacerbated information asymmetry. There will affect the borrowers and the lenders’ willingness to investment and financing, then a complete and sustainable technology and financial services platform would not be constructed.|$|R
