Watts and Black interview the woman, Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), at her home. Butler is adamant {{she has not}} seen or heard from Fabricant since his escape. However, Black finds information on Butler's computer which he believes is linked to his own home address; and photographs of a judge who he recognizes as having been murdered.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was a very}} tempting {{target for}} the Italians, who {{saw it as a}} refuge for British {{warships}} and allied merchant shipping. The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa (Villa Carmela) located two miles (3km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino. Their base was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Olterra, interned in Algeciras.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{succession}} to the estates {{did not go}} undisputed, however. A protracted {{battle over}} parts of the inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, who <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> daughter from Richard Beauchamp's first marriage. The dispute centred on land, not on the Warwick title, as Henry's half-sisters {{were excluded from the}} succession.|$|E

5|$|Romualdo Braschi-Onesti, cardinal-nephew of Pius VI (1775–1799), was the {{penultimate}} cardinal-nephew. Despite Pius VI's lineage to a noble Cesena family, {{his only}} sister <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> {{man from the}} poor Onesti family. Therefore, he commissioned a genealogist to discover (and inflate) some trace of nobility in the Onesti lineage, an endeavor which yielded only a circuitous connection to Saint Romualdo.|$|E

5|$|The Nazi regime {{began to}} persecute Jews {{soon after the}} seizure of power. Hess's office was partly {{responsible}} for drafting Hitler's Nuremberg Laws of 1935, laws that had far-reaching implications for the Jews of Germany, banning marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and depriving non-Aryans of their German citizenship. Hess's friend Karl Haushofer {{and his family were}} subject to these laws, as Haushofer <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> half-Jewish woman, so Hess issued documents exempting them from this legislation.|$|E

5|$|After the New York City draft {{riots in}} 1863, Smith {{and his family}} were among {{prominent}} blacks who left New York and moved to Brooklyn, then still a separate city. He no longer felt safe in his old neighborhood. In the 1870 census, Malvina and her four children were living in Ward 15, Brooklyn. All were listed as white. James W. Smith, who <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at home were Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. Five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 on.|$|E
5|$|Augustine was {{the prior}} of a monastery in Rome when Pope Gregory the Great chose him in 595 {{to lead a}} mission, usually known as the Gregorian mission, to Britain to Christianize King Æthelberht and his Kingdom of Kent from Anglo-Saxon paganism. Kent was {{probably}} chosen because Æthelberht <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> Christian princess, Bertha, daughter of Charibert I the King of Paris, who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Before reaching Kent, the missionaries had considered turning back, but Gregory urged them on, and in 597, Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet and proceeded to Æthelberht's main town of Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|By 1928, Tschaikovsky's claim had {{received}} interest and {{attention in the}} United States, where Gleb Botkin had published articles in support of her cause. Botkin's publicity {{caught the attention of}} a distant cousin of Anastasia's, Xenia Leeds, a former Russian princess who <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> wealthy American industrialist. Botkin and Leeds arranged for Tschaikovsky to travel to the United States on board the liner Berengaria at Leeds's expense. On the journey from Seeon to the States, Tschaikovsky stopped at Paris, where she met Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia, the Tsar's cousin, who believed her to be Anastasia. For six months Tschaikovsky lived at the estate of the Leeds family in Oyster Bay, New York.|$|E
5|$|Domhnall was, reputedly, {{the son of}} Raghnall (fl. 1192) son of Somhairle (died 1164). The 17th-century History of the Macdonalds by Hugh MacDonald of Sleat {{claimed that}} Domhnall's father Raghnall <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> {{daughter}} or sister of the early 14th-century hero Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray. Sellar suggested that this tradition may have derived from a garbled version of reality. Perhaps, Sellar argued, {{his mother was a}} daughter of William fitz Duncan. The latter was another famous Earl of Moray, but one who lived in the 12th- rather than the 14th-century.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Suharto's birth, his mother {{suffered}} {{a nervous breakdown}} and he {{was placed in the}} care of his paternal great-aunt, Kromodirjo. Kertosudiro and Sukirah divorced early in Suharto's life and both later remarried. At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies. In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yielding farming area near Wonogiri. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father.|$|E

Shakespeare signed his last will and {{testament}} on 25 March 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Fatima Jinnah {{joined her}} brother in England. From then on, Muhammad Jinnah would receive {{personal}} care {{and support from}} her as he aged and began to suffer from the lung ailments which would kill him. She lived and travelled with him, and became a close advisor. Muhammad Jinnah's daughter, Dina, was educated in England and India. Jinnah later became estranged from Dina after she decided to marry a Christian, Neville Wadia from a prominent Parsi business family. When Jinnah urged Dina to marry a Muslim, she reminded him that he <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> woman not raised in his faith. Jinnah continued to correspond cordially with his daughter, but their personal relationship was strained, {{and she did not}} come to Pakistan in his lifetime, but only for his funeral.|$|E
5|$|In June 1866 the Claimant {{moved to}} Sydney, {{where he was}} able to raise money from banks {{on the basis of a}} {{statutory}} declaration that he was Roger Tichborne. The statement was later found to contain many errors, although the birthdate and parentage details were given correctly. It included a brief account of how he had arrived in Australia: he and others from the sinking Bella, he said, had been picked up by the Osprey, bound for Melbourne. On arrival he had taken the name Thomas Castro from an acquaintance from Melipilla and had wandered for some years before settling in Wagga Wagga. He <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> pregnant housemaid, Mary Ann Bryant, and taken her child, a daughter, as his own; a further daughter had been born in March 1866.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leonardo's early life. He spent his first {{five years in the}} hamlet of Anchiano in the home of his mother, and from 1457 lived in the {{household}} of his father, grandparents and uncle {{in the small town of}} Vinci. His father <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera Amadori, who loved Leonardo but died young in 1465 without children. When Leonardo was sixteen (1468), his father married again to twenty-year-old Francesca Lanfredini, who also died without children. Piero's legitimate heirs were born from his third wife Margherita di Guglielmo (who gave birth to six children: Antonio, Giulian, Maddalena, Lorenzo, Violante and Domenico) and his fourth and final wife, Lucrezia Cortigiani (who bore him another six children: Margherita, Benedetto, Pandolfo, Guglielmo, Bartolomeo and Giovanni).|$|E
5|$|Outside Europe, {{women were}} able to dress as men and go undetected. Deborah Sampson fought in the American Revolution as a man named Robert Shurtlieff, and pursued {{relationships}} with women. Edward De Lacy Evans was born female in Ireland, but took a male name during the voyage to Australia and lived as a man for 23 years in Victoria, marrying three times. Percy Redwood created a scandal in New Zealand in 1909 when he {{was found to be}} Amy Bock, who <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> woman from Port Molyneaux; newspapers argued whether it was a sign of insanity or an inherent character flaw.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands {{provided}} William Bruce {{with many}} of his influences.

Alexander Bruce <b>had</b> <b>married</b> <b>a</b> Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.|$|E
