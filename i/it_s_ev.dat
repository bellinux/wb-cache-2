EV 71 is known to be a causa-tive agent of HFMD, herpangina, aseptic meningitis, par-alysis, and meningoencephalitis [1]. HFMD usually presents with symptoms including fever and a character-istic rash associated with the limbs, mouth and skin. In severe disease such as caused by EV 71, however, the aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, brainstem encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and poliomyelitis-like syndrome as well as neurogenic pulmonary edema and myocarditis, resulting in high morbidity and mortality [2]. EV 71 was first isolated in the United States (California) in 1969 and by the mid- 1970 <b>s,</b> <b>EV</b> 71 outbreaks, character-ized by central nervous system complications occurred in succession in Bulgaria and Hungary [3].

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is an {{important}} pathogenic bacterium that causes various infectious diseases. Extracellular vesicles (<b>EVs)</b> released from <b>S.</b> aureus contain bacterial proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. These EVs can induce immune responses leading to similar symp-toms as during staphylococcal infection condition and have the potential as vaccination agent. Here, we show that active immunization (vaccination) with <b>S.</b> aureus-derived <b>EVs</b> induce adaptive immunity of antibody and T cell responses. In addition, these EVs have the vaccine adjuvant ability to induce protective immunity such as the up-regulation of co-stimu-latory molecules and the expression of T cell polarizing cytokines in antigen-presenting cells. Moreover, vaccination with <b>S.</b> aureus <b>EVs</b> conferred protection against lethality induced by airway challenge with lethal dose of S. aureus and also pneumonia induced by the administration of sub-lethal dose of S. aureus. These protective effects were also found in mice that were adoptively transferred with splenic T cells isolated from S. aureus EV-immunized mice, but not in serum transferred mice.

Ions are extracted from a quasi-dc plasma using a pulsed bias on the substrate. The {{shape of the}} resulting ion energy and angular distribution (IEAD) is particularly important with respect to obtaining desired junction characteristics. Images are presented of the time evolution of the IEAD in a plasma doping system. Index Terms—Ion implantation, modeling, plasma, pulsed. ULTRA-SHALLOW junctions (USJ) are required forfabrication of sub- 0. 1 m transistors in semiconductor integrated circuits. The most straight forward fabrication method is to extend the beam-line ion implantation technology to ultra-low energies (100 <b>s</b> <b>eV</b> to a few kiloelectronvolts).

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of the use of {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) energy consumption in general and petroleum consumption in particular. The analysis is conducted for sub-compact cars, small vans, and large vans for the years 1995 and 2010. We compare per-mile primary energy consumption of EVs and gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), for each of four primary energy sources: petroleum, coal, natural gas, and biomass. When petroleum, natural gas, or biomass is the primary energy source, EVs with current technology will consume more energy per mile than ICEVs, but EVs with advanced technology will consume less. If coal is the primary energy source, both current- and advanced-technology EVs will consume less energy per mile than ICEVs. We find that the magnitude of petroleum displacement by EVs depends mainly on the amount of petroleum used for electricity generation. In many areas of the U. <b>S.,</b> <b>EVs</b> will reduce per-mile petroleum use by over 90 %, because the vast majority of electricity is generated from non-petroleum fuels.
