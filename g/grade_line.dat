40|$|Many factors {{influence}} {{the incidence of}} mechanical damage in fruit handled on a <b>grading</b> <b>line.</b> This {{makes it difficult to}} address damage estimation from an analytical point of view. During fruit transfer from one element of a <b>grading</b> <b>line</b> to another, damage occurs as a combined effect of machinery roughness and the intrinsic susceptibility of fruit. This paper describes a method to estimate bruise probability by means of logistic regression, using data yielded by specific laboratory tests. Model accuracy was measured via the statistical significance of its parameters and its classification ability. The prediction model was then linked to a simulation model through which impacts and load levels, similar to those of real <b>grading</b> <b>lines,</b> could be generated. The simulation output sample size was determined to yield reliable estimations. The process makes it possible to derive a suitable line design and the type of fruit that should be handled to maintain bruise levels within European Union (EU) Standards. A real example with peaches was carried out with the aid of the software implementation SIMLIN®, developed by the authors and registered by Madrid Technical University. This kind of tool has been demanded by inter-professional associations and <b>grading</b> <b>lines</b> designers in recent year...|$|R

At the same time, Faroudja started manufacturing products {{based on the same}} technologies, including adaptive comb filters and video quality improvement products for use with Sony’s U-Matic video recorders.

The railroad, after consultation, careful study and negotiations between the engineers of the railroad and the city, established a <b>grade</b> <b>line</b> for the railroad that significantly reduced the old gradient and so made it possible to achieve a higher rate of speed.

50|$|The {{original}} {{line from}} Bolton through Daubhill to Kenyon Junction included two rope-hailed inclines, one at Chequerbent {{and the other}} at Daubhill. Although improvements in locomotive design meant these became redundant by the 1850s, the line was also largely single track. The LNWR decided to improve the line by addressing both issues: it doubled the route throughout and built new, less steeply <b>graded</b> <b>lines</b> bypassing the Chequerbent and Daubhill banks.|$|R
50|$|Flow {{through the}} main is by gravity under the driving head of the service {{reservoirs}} at the source WTWs. By virtue of its depth, the pipeline is under some pressure; however, the hydraulic <b>grade</b> <b>line</b> rarely exceeds ground level, and, to enter, supply water must be pumped up into the distribution zones at the pump-out shafts. In some respects, therefore, the main {{can be considered as}} a minor reservoir, from which supply is drawn as required. An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the Battersea and Park Lane pump-out shafts. The loop is closed to provide the redundancy that allows any segment on the ring to be isolated and drained for maintenance without interrupting the supply to any shaft, not for hydraulic reasons.|$|E

In 1994, the Mk.

With the 1:144th-scale HGUC lineup, launched in 2000, the Mk. II has seen very heavy coverage. The Mk. II was released as a stand-alone model in May 2002 (in AEUG and Titans colors), with the G-Defenser in [...] "Super Gundam" [...] configuration in November 2002, a limited production (now discontinued) collector's [...] "extra finish" [...] version in May 2005, with the Flying Armor re-entry vehicle later that month, and as part of the [...] "Gryphios War" [...] 3-pack with the Zeta Gundam and MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki in March 2006. The Mk. II joined the 1/100th-scale Master Grade lineup in August 1998, in both AEUG and Titans colors. A Master Grade [...] "Super Gundam" [...] kit with the G-Defenser was issued in January 1999, Totally re-designed versions of the Master Grade Mk.

50|$|The ditch has a {{grade of}} 4.2 {{feet to the}} mile and was built 11 feet wide on the bottom. The <b>grade</b> <b>line</b> was located 1 foot {{below the surface of}} the ground on the lower side and a 4-foot lower bank was provided. The removal of 1 or 2 feet of the upper moss and soil put the bottom of the ditch into a mixture of ground ice and muck, much of which was almost clear ice. This {{material}} thawed when the water was turned in, and as a result a large part of the bottom of the ditch has settled at least 2 feet and the ditch has widened in many places to 15 or 20 feet or more. As the upper bank thawed, material was thrown against the lower bank to protect it and to keep the water from getting under it. Practically all the upper ditch and at least three-fourths of the lower ditch is built in frozen ground of this character. These sections have been difficult and expensive to maintain and caused considerable interruption in the delivery of water during 1909 and 1910. Where the lower ditch is built around the steep gulches that carry the eastern tributaries of the Pinnell the northerly slopes of the gulches are covered with muck, but the southerly slopes are made up of a more solid clay and of decomposed mica schist. Along the upper ditch lava bowlders are present in the muck from the surface to bedrock, and at a few places the material encountered was composed of angular fragments of lava with only a little soil between them. Above and below Snow Gulch, the lowest tributary of Pinnell River which the ditch crosses, are short pieces of rockwork. The rock is much shattered and could have been loosened with picks if it had not been frozen. Much difficulty was experienced in making the rockwork water tight on account of the lack of good sod, as the surface covering is commonly decayed moss or peat containing much fibrous matter and little earthly material, and will float even though saturated with water, so that it is necessary to weight it down with rocks when it is used on the bottom of the ditch.|$|E
