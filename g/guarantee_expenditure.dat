40|$|The {{administration}} of the relevant part of EAGGF <b>Guarantee</b> <b>expenditure,</b> which {{accounts for more than}} 50 % of the budget of the European Communities follows shared management arrangements. Shared management means that member states pay and control the expenditure for agricultural and rural development subsidies and the Commission is responsible for the {{administration of}} payments and for auditing the control system of member states. The communication on the expenditure effected by accredited paying agencies takes place via a comprehensive financial reporting system and monthly EAGGF Committee meetings. These meetings provide scope for the reconciliation of any disagreement concerning the monthly advances reimbursed by the Commission to member states and also give an overview on actual budget implementation. The new member states which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 have started to apply the comprehensive financial reporting system following an intensive cooperation period in the form of training seminars provided to them by the Commission for setting up the reporting systems of paying agencies. The first expenditure from the EAGGF Guarantee Section was executed in July 2004 and reported to the Commission during the following month. The pioneer new member states were the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, followed by Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia a month later. Until the end of August approximately 6 million Euros have been withdrawn from the Fund, used in a fifty-fifty percent split for export restitutions for milk and milk products, beef and veal, live animals and eggs to countries outside the European Union and for other market intervention measures, such as supply of food from intervention stocks for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community, production refunds on sugar used in the chemical industry, aid for skimmed milk processed into casein and school milk. By the end of the 2004 financial year (15 October 2004) some other new member states, Lithuania, Latvia and Cyprus also intend to start paying agricultural subsidies to their beneficiaries. The total estimated value of expenditure to be withdrawn from EAGGF Guarantee by the new member states in the 2004 financial year and charged therefore to the 2004 budget is circa an additional 14 million Euros. Therefore, the aggregated amount of the subsidy withdrawn by the EU- 10 countries charged to the 2004 budget will be ca. 20 million Euros, which is a minor amount compared to the budget appropriations included in the 2004 budget for EAGGF Guarantee as a whole. A speeding up of subsidy withdrawals is necessary for new member states to make the best use of benefit from CAP. It is possible to achieve this goal by the withdrawal of subsidies for direct aids. Direct aids can be paid to farmers in the framework of the Single Area Payment Scheme from {{the first day of the}} 2005 financial year (16 October 2004) in case of new member states (except Malta and Slovenia). The advances to member states will be reimbursed in January 2005 and charged therefore to the 2005 budget. As it was the case for earlier enlargements of the European Union, the first months of subsidy withdrawals are being used mainly to get acquainted with the administration and to test the operation of the paying agency systems. However, this period should be considered strictly as an interim phase and significant effort should be made by the national agricultural administrations to widen the â€œpenetrabilityâ€ of the subsidy handling, that is to increase the amount of subsidy withdrawn from the EU by the paying agency systems already operating in the new member states to benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. withdrawn from the EU Funds, target branches, paying agency systems, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E

40|$|Arizona Free Enterprise v. Bennett, 131 S. Ct. 2806 (2011), invalidates the {{matching}} funds provision of Arizona’s clean elections law, {{one of the}} most effective forms of public financing for political campaigns. Bennett has tremendous implications for democracy and the increasing role of money in politics. This essay shows how the majority opinion employs economic theory as judicial reasoning, construing the First Amendment as a <b>guarantee</b> that political <b>expenditures</b> and contributions shall have their optimal, market-determined effect. Earlier cases had struck down certain limitations on political spending on the theory that money was speech and Congress could not “abridge the freedom of speech. ” Although many disagree with the notion that private political spending is speech in the meaning of the First Amendment, it was at least clear that the laws at issue in earlier cases restricted that spending. The Roberts Court has now redefined the First Amendment. Even if the government does not restrict private political spending, Bennett prohibits it from providing electoral subsidies that might diminish the effectiveness of that private spending. Public financing systems such as the one contained in the Arizona law have thus become unconstitutional government interventions into the market for political power. Bennett goes beyond Buckley v. Valeo’s dictate the money is speech and democracy is a market; it even goes beyond Citizen United’s holding that corporations have a First Amendment right to political expenditures. Bennett establishes a far broader proposition: the First Amendment protects consumer sovereignty, not popular sovereignty...|$|R

5000|$|The German army, {{mindful of}} the {{steadily}} increasing proportion of spending going to the navy, demanded an increase of 136,000 men to bring its size closer to that of France. In February 1912 the British war minister, Viscount Haldane, came to Berlin to discuss possible limits to naval expansion. Meanwhile, in Britain, the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill made a speech describing the German navy as a 'luxury', which was considered an insult when reported in Germany. The talks came to nothing, ending in recriminations over who had offered what. Bethmann-Hollweg argued for a <b>guaranteed</b> proportion of <b>expenditure</b> for the army, but failed when army officers refused to support him publicly. Tirpitz argued for six new capital ships, and got three, together with 15,000 additional sailors in a new combined military budget passed in April 1912. The new ships, together with the existing reserve flagship and four reserve battleships were to become one new squadron for the High Seas Fleet. In all the fleet would have five squadrons of eight battleships, twelve large cruisers and thirty small, plus additional cruisers for overseas duties. Tirpitz intended that with the rolling program of replacements, the existing coastal defence squadron of old ships would become a sixth fleet squadron, while the eight existing battle-cruisers would be joined by eight more as replacements for the large cruisers presently in the overseas squadrons. The plan envisaged a main fleet of 100,000 men, 49 battleships and 28 battlecruisers by 1920. The Kaiser commented of the British, [...] "... we have them up against the wall." ...|$|R

The aim {{of the study is}} to demonstrate the concepts, aims, areas, indicators and challenges of sustainable development. The study also aims to demonstrate the importance of human development and its influence to achieve sustainable development in Oman. Furthermore, the study aimed: 1 - to demonstrate the government expenditure to develop health and education sectors, 2 - to demonstrate the per capita income and the effect of human development to achieve the sustainable development in the Omani society. The study has been carried out by two main approaches/methods. The first approach was a rigorous review to the literature (previous studies). The second approach was a “case study” by which an experimental investigation took place. The experimental part is divided into two phases: 1 - creating and developing a model showing and illustrating government expenditure first on the education and health sectors and second illustrating per capita income, according to the annual criteria of the United Nation, in developing human development in Oman, 2 - a questionnaire has been used in the study to demonstrate the effect of human development to achieve sustainable development in Oman. The second phase of the case study included 356 participants belonging and working to the Supreme Council for Planning, the State Councils, the Main Municipality, Omani Company for Trade and Industry, Omani Women’s Association and another sample from health and education sectors. The study has proved the first hypothesis to be true, while the second and third hypotheses are proved true. This is due to the negative results that the study has demonstrated. The main hypothesis, however, has been proved true, shown a difference in the findings and perspectives of different researchers. According to the findings, the study recommends that government expenditure should be guided, well-supervised and reconsidered to effectively support education and health sectors.
