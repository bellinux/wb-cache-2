5|$|Over {{the next}} three games, Kansas outscored its opponents 162–16. As Kansas's Big 12 {{schedule}} began, the Jayhawks' winning ways continued, as they proved themselves against legitimate competition. On October 6, Kansas traveled to Manhattan, Kansas, home of then-ranked No.24 Kansas State University for the opening game of its Big12 schedule. In front of 50,924hostile fans, Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing struggled {{for the first time}} in the season.

5|$|Passport to Pimlico is set {{during a}} {{heatwave}} {{that occurred in}} Britain in 1947, but, despite this, filming took place during 1948's abnormally wet summer. The poor weather caused delays in production, {{which led to the}} film being over-time and over-budget. Shooting started early each day, in an attempt to get the first successful shot completed before 9:00 am. An average of ten takes a day were taken, in an attempt to get two and a <b>half</b> <b>minutes</b> of usable film per day. There were arguments between Cornelius and Balcon throughout the production, because Balcon was unhappy with what he saw as poor direction. Cornelius left Ealing Studios after working on Passport to Pimlico and did not work for the studio again.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas Jayhawks {{began the}} regular season with twelve {{consecutive}} victories before losing to Iowa State by two points after losing {{the lead in the}} closing seconds of the game.

The Jayhawks won their next four games before losing to Oklahoma State in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Due to the lack of a shot-clock in 1957, the Cowboys held the ball for the final three and a <b>half</b> <b>minutes</b> in order to win the game 5654.
