25|$|These {{first three}} (and {{subsequently}} more) Russian language imprints were published and circulated in the Russian Empire during the 1903–6 period {{as a tool}} for scapegoating Jews, blamed by the monarchists for the defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and the Revolution of 1905. Common to all three texts is the idea that Jews aim for world domination. Since The Protocols are presented as merely a document, the <b>front</b> <b>matter</b> and back matter are needed to explain its alleged origin. The diverse imprints, however, are mutually inconsistent. The general claim is that the document was stolen from a secret Jewish organization. Since the alleged original stolen manuscript does not exist, one is forced to restore a purported original edition. This has been done by the Italian scholar, Cesare G. De Michelis in 1998, in a work which was translated into English and published in 2004, where he treats his subject as Apocrypha.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of its {{publication}} in July 1791, the book had been printed in four variants, differing only in <b>front</b> <b>matter.</b> In the first two variants, 1790 is given as the year of publication, and in the other two variants it is 1791. The 1790 variants have two title pages, one in Slavonic-Serbian (folio 1 verso), and the other in German (folio 2 recto). The earlier of these variants contains a dedication to Metropolitan Mojsije Putnik composed by Kurzbeck, while the other variant has no dedication. The 1791 variants have one title page (folio 2 recto) with both the Slavonic-Serbian and the German version of the title. The preceding page (folio 1 verso) contains a copperplate engraving depicting Count Francis Balassa, and these two variants differ only in some details of the engraving. After the title page comes a dedication to Balassa, composed by Kurzbeck in the tone of humble devotion. All variants have the same foreword written by Kurzbeck, while none of them mentions Jacob Rodde as the source or Teodor Avramović as the editor of the dictionary. Only Kurzbeck is mentioned as its publisher. Its source and editor have been identified respectively by Samuel Linde {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century and Pavel Jozef Šafárik in 1865, since when the book has been referred to as the Avramović Dictionary.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{engages with}} {{the works of}} Autonomist Marxists, such as Hardt, Negri and Arvidsson, who {{have argued that the}} {{so-called}} ‘new economy’, which is characterized by a new importance of immaterial labour, knowledge and processes of consumption, gives rise to a new law of value and changed labour relations in what they call the ‘social factory’. While {{we see a lot of}} value in this emerging body of literature – particularly in terms of its potential for critiquing relatively narrow debates in critical organization and management studies – this paper critiques the highly optimistic analyses put forward by Hardt, Negri and Arvidsson, especially with regard to their claims for a new autonomy and freedom of labour emerging out of the ‘new economy’. We counter these claims by showing how in contemporary capitalism, despite the discourses of autonomy and freedom, labour is continuously subjected to control, measurement and governance.

2500|$|Herbert Giles {{created the}} first Chinese-English encyclopedic {{dictionary}} in two ways, with comprehensive explanations under head entries and with informative tables. His example was followed by many later Chinese-English dictionaries {{up to the present}} time (Yong and Peng 2008: 387). First, some dictionary entries include in-depth information. Take pǔlu 氆氇 [...] "a woolen fabric made in Tibet" [...] as an example. Giles gives P'u3 氆3 (9514) [...] "An open-woven, thick woolen cloth, either plain or flowered, with a nap on one side, known as 氆氇. It comes from Tibet, and is used for making the winter caps of Lamas. Known to the Mongols as cheng-mé and chalma." [...] Second, Giles's dictionary has six tables, in addition to the requisite table of the 214 Kangxi Radicals (essential for using a radical-and-stroke index) included by Morrison, Medhurst, and Williams. The tables are for Insignia of Official Rank, The Family Names, The Chinese Dynasties, Topographical, The Calendar, and Miscellaneous (Chinese numerals). Another table is found in the dictionary <b>front</b> <b>matter,</b> called the Table of Sounds (1892) or Table of Sounds for Dialects (1912).|$|E
2500|$|An {{article by}} Ed Lynskey, , which {{appeared}} in the August 2003 issue of Allan Guthrie's Noir Originals webzine, claims that Hill Girl [...] "sold an astonishing 2.5 million copies." [...] This unsourced claim is almost certainly an overstatement, even if it includes foreign sales, which is not hinted at. The cover of the book's eighth Gold Medal printing, dated August 1957, states, [...] "Now in its second million," [...] meaning before the given printing—likely 100,000 or 200,000 copies—Hill Girl had probably sold a total of 900,000 or 1 million copies. According to the edition's <b>front</b> <b>matter,</b> the first six printings all occurred between December 1950 (though the novel is copyrighted 1951) and November 1951. The seventh took place in November 1954. That three-year gap and the one of nearly three years that preceded the eighth printing indicate a substantial slowdown in what, by any standard, are still very impressive sales. Given this publishing record, {{it is hard to imagine}} Hill Girl wound up selling even as many as 1.5 million copies through Gold Medal. There is no evidence of it ever having been put out by another American publisher. In his essay [...] "What Is Noir?" [...] (see above), George Tuttle, though he does not indicate the source of his figures, claims Gold Medal sales of 1,226,890 copies for Hill Girl, which is entirely plausible.|$|E

5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (<b>front)</b> grey <b>matter</b> section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|R
40|$|River plumes, also {{regions of}} {{freshwater}} influence, are important features to understand {{because of their}} impact on the current structure, stratification and the transport of fine sediments, nutrients and contaminants. One important river plume is the Rhine ROFI. Prior studies have sought to understand far-field dynamics where cross-shore straining is dominant (Simpson & Souza, 1995; Souza & Simpson, 1995; De Boer et al., 2008). However, less is known about the mid-field region of this river plume, where <b>fronts</b> <b>matter</b> as well. Here we use field observations from a 6 week measurement campaign in fall 2014 to investigate the dynamics of the mid-field region of het Rhine ROFI. We will focus on the interaction between far-field processes, such as tidal straining, and near field processes, such as fronts. The Rhine ROFI is of interest because the Dutch coast has been modified by extending the Port of Rotterdam and the construction of the Sand Engine that extends into the southern North Sea. These perturbations might impact the currents, the ROFI and the distribution of fine sediment, nutrients and contaminants. Therefore, the understanding of this is of importance. During September and October 2014, a large field observational campaign was conducted off the Dutch coast close to the sand Engine, 10 km north of the river outflow. Measurements were made at two locations, 2 and 5. 5 km offshore (see Figure 1). Moorings, with Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) and Optical Backscatter (OBS) instruments at different depths, were deployed to obtain vertical profiles of salinity and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC). In addition, at each location a bottom-mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measured vertical velocity profiles. Radar images of the area were used to gain surface information, specifically about frontal propagation {{in the vicinity of the}} measurement locations. The weather conditions were highly variable during the six week period. There were very calm periods, but also storms, which completely destroyed stratification. The wind direction changed during the campaign as well. In addition to the data, numerical modelling with a 3 D hydrostatic model will be used to gain information of the entire mid-field plume.
