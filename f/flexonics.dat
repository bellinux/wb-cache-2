40|$|In this paper, a new {{approach}} using mobile sensor networks is proposed for structural health monitoring. Compared with static sensors, mobile sensor networks offer flexible system architectures with adaptive spatial resolutions. The paper describes the design concept of a flexure-based mechatronic (<b>flexonic)</b> mobile sensing node and its application in structural health monitoring. The <b>flexonic</b> mobile sensing node is capable of maneuvering on structures built with ferromagnetic materials, as well as attaching/detaching an accelerometer onto/from a steel structural surface. The performance of the prototype mobile sensor network has been validated through laboratory experiments, where two <b>flexonic</b> mobile sensing nodes are adopted for maneuvering on a steel portal frame. Transmissibility function analysis is then conducted to identify structural damage using data collected by the mobile sensing nodes. This preliminary work is expected to spawn transformative changes of using mobile sensors for future structural health monitoring...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new magnetic car as a mobile sensor node for health monitoring and dynamic testing of large civil (ferromagnetic) structures. Unlike traditional car design where {{the distance between}} the front and rear wheel pairs is fixed, the electromagnetically driven compliant beam (connecting the front and rear axles) not only offers an effective means to negotiate corners and cross ridges of small dimensions when maneuvering on ferromagnetic surfaces, but also serves as a sensor attachment device. Specifically, this paper presents the design concept of a novel <b>flexonic</b> magnetic car incorporating compliant beams and permanent magnets, and a three-dimensional model for simulating the deformed shape of the compliant beam. The compliant beam that enables direct contact of the accelerometer with the measuring surface eliminating the dynamic effect of the sensor carriers has been validated with the experimental modal analysis for a frame structure.

It describes our preliminary explorations of materials and processes. And it describes a kinematic approach to joint design that has so far led to one promising new design. Finally, we give a brief prospectus of future applications of <b>flexonics.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new magnetic wall-climbing car as a mobile sensor node (MSN) for health monitoring and dynamic testing of large civil (ferromagnetic) structures. Unlike traditional design where {{the distance between}} the front and rear wheel pairs is fixed, the electromagnetically driven compliant beam connecting the axles not only offers an effective means to negotiate corners when maneuvering on ferromagnetic surfaces, but also serves as a sensor attachment device. Specifically, this paper presents the design concept of a novel magnetic <b>flexonic</b> mobile node (FMN) incorporating a compliant beam and permanent magnets, and a two-dimensional model for simulating the deformed shape of the compliant beam. Simulation results show that there exist consistent relations between input/output displacements and rotation angle for control implementation in sensor attachment and corner negotiation regardless of gravity direction or the critical force for buckling. Experiment results are also provided to validate the theoretical model and compare with the analysis for sensor attachment and corner negotiation.

40|$|Motivated by the {{interests}} to understand bio-structure deformation and exploit their advantages to create bio-inspired systems for engineering applications, a curvature-based model for analyzing compliant mechanisms capable of large deformation in a three dimensional space has been developed. Unlike methods (such as finite element) that formulate problems based on displacements and/or rotational angles, superposition holds for curvatures {{in the case}} of finite rotation but not for rotational angles; thus the curvature-based formulation presents an advantage in presenting nonlinear geometries. Along with a generalized constraint that relaxes traditional boundary constraints (such as fixed, pinned or sliding constraint) on compliant mechanisms, the method of deriving the compliant members in the same global referenced frame is presented. The attractive features of the method, which greatly simplifies the models and improves the computation efficiency of multi-body system deformation where compliant beams play an important role, have been experimentally validated. To demonstrate the applicability of this proposed method to a broad spectrum of applications, three practical examples are given; the first example verifies the generalized constraint by analyzing the multi-axis rotation motion within a natural human knee joint and investigates the human-exoskeleton interactions through dynamic analysis. The second example studies a deformable bio-structure by incorporating the generalized joint constraint into the curvature-based model for automated poultry meat processing. The last example designs a bio-inspired robot with a compliant mechanism to serve as a <b>flexonic</b> mobile node for ferromagnetic structure health monitoring. The analytical models have been employed (with experimental validation) to investigate the effects of different joint constraints on the mechanism deformations. It is expected that the proposed method will find a broad range of applications involving compliant mechanisms. PhDCommittee Chair: Kok-Meng Lee; Committee Member: Jun Ueda; Committee Member: Lena H.
