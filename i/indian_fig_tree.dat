50|$|Ficus racemosa (syn. Ficus glomerata Roxb.) is {{a species}} of plant in the family Moraceae. Popularly known as the cluster fig tree, <b>Indian</b> <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> or goolar (gular) fig, this is native to Australia, Malaysia, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is unusual in that its figs grow on or close to the tree trunk, termed cauliflory. In India, the tree and its fruit are called gular {{in the north and}} atti in the south. The fruits are a {{favourite}} staple of the common Indian macaque. It serves as a food plant for the caterpillars of the two-brand crow butterfly (Euploea sylvester) of northern Australia.|$|E
5000|$|Like other megabats, {{commonly}} known as fruit bats, the Aldabra flying fox is herbivorous. It has been observed eating fruit from the evergreens Calophyllum inophyllum and Mystroxylon aethiopicum, the [...] <b>Indian</b> almond, and <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> such as the giant-leaved fig, Ficus rubra, and Ficus reflexa. The bat also eats flowers from the coconut tree and sisal plant and {{the leaves of the}} grey mangrove tree. It has been observed licking honeydew produced by scale insects infesting fig trees; rats exhibit the same behavior.|$|R
40|$|In {{the coffee}} based {{land use system}} of Nduuri in Embu District, Kenya, farmers have devised several methods of {{replenishing}} soil fertility namely use of sweet potatoes in rotation, use of farm yard manure (FYM), use of crop residues and planting <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> (Ficus sycomorus) in coffee farms. Farmers claim the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> modifies the microclimate and improves soil fertility. Six farmers recorded the weights of coffee berries harvested from coffee <b>trees</b> under the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> and outside the <b>fig</b> <b>tree.</b> 100 -berry weight {{as well as the}} weight of a used cooking oil tin full of berries was also recorded. Soil samples were taken from under the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> and outside the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> canopy for analysis. Results indicated no significant difference (P= 0. 05) in yield or soil quality under the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> or outside. However because of apparent numerical difference and given the many other uses of the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> farmers could be advised to plant/retain the <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in the coffee farms. In the process farmers will also be contributing to the conservation of biodiversity...|$|R

5000|$|In Allahabad {{there is}} a pillar with {{inscriptions}} from Ashoka and later inscriptions attributed to Samudragupta and Jehangir. It {{is clear from the}} inscription that the pillar was first erected at Kaushambi, an ancient town some 30 kilometres west of Allahabad that was the capital of the Koshala kingdom, and moved to Allahabad, presumably under Muslim rule. [...] The pillar is now located inside the Allahabad Fort, also the royal palace, built during the 16th century by Akbar at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers. As the fort is occupied by the Indian Army it is essentially closed to the public and special permission is required to see the pillar. The Ashokan inscription is in Brahmi and is dated around 232 BC. A later inscription attributed to the second king of the Gupta empire, Samudragupta, is in the more refined Gupta script, a later version of Brahmi, and is dated to around 375 AD. This inscription lists the extent of the empire that Samudragupta built during his long reign. He had already been king for forty years at that time and would rule for another five. A still later inscription in Persian is from the Mughal emperor Jahangir. The Akbar Fort also houses the Akshay Vat, an <b>Indian</b> <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> of great antiquity. The Ramayana refers to this tree under which Lord Rama is supposed to have prayed while on exile.|$|E
40|$|Graphene {{quantum dots}} (GQDs) have gained {{enormous}} attention {{due to their}} unique optical properties and emerging employment in biology. Herein, we report the synthesis of highly crystalline GQDs having superior physicochemical and near infrared (NIR) -responsive properties using simple waste, withered leaves of Ficus racemosa, an <b>Indian</b> <b>fig</b> <b>tree,</b> as a carbon source. A considerably large production yield was obtained (ca. 18 %) with a competitive quantum yield of 14. 16 %. The GQDs exhibited excellent dispersibility in both organic as well as aqueous solvents and were highly photostable. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of ultra-small honeycombed as well as self-assembled GQDs. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry and biocompatibility studies showed that the GQDs were cytocompatible and were used as in situ labeling probes for normal as well as cancer cells. Furthermore, upon irradiation with an 808 nm laser (0. 5 W cm(- 2)), a concentration-dependent photothermal response and production of reactive oxygen species were observed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that GQDs did not lose their fluorescence despite continuous laser irradiation (30 min) on MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells. Thus, cell death could be traced using GQD-labeled MDA-MB- 231 cells post-therapy using the photostability of GQDs, unlike photo-bleachable organic dyes. Thus, a low-cost, scalable, greensynthesis of GQDs with highly efficient optical properties will {{pave the way for}} new therapeutics and imaging in biomedical cancer research...|$|E

40|$|While sacred groves (forest {{fragments}} protected {{for religious}} reasons) are widely acknowledged {{to have a}} beneficial effect on biodiversity conservation, the ecological benefits of individual sacred <b>trees</b> remain unknown. <b>Fig</b> <b>trees</b> are present as sacred trees in humandominated landscapes across South Asia and are considered keystone species for wildlife in tropical forests. If frugivores continue to visit <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in disturbed landscapes, they may deposit seeds of other <b>tree</b> species beneath <b>fig</b> canopies, ultimately facilitating forest regeneration. We studied whether sacred <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in Tamil Nadu, India can facilitate seed dispersal in human-dominated landscapes. We quantified abundance of sacred <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> at the study site, assessed whether seed-dispersing frugivore visitation to <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> is affected by human disturbance, and compared tree seedling density beneath <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> and open areas. We found that some species of frugivorous birds and bats will visit large <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in conditions of high human disturbance and that tree seedling density is significantly higher under sacred trees compared to open areas. By promoting frugivore activity, sacred <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> may have a beneficial effect on biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes...|$|R

40|$|Pest attack, {{disease and}} soil fatigue {{have always been}} a great problem in fig (Ficus carica L.) nursery tree production, {{especially}} when traditional methods that use soil culture are applied. Therefore, as an alternative method, substrate culture could be a sustainable and favorable propagation method for growing healthy nursery <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> of high quality. No information is available on substrate use and its effect on nursery <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> production.
