Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E

Sean Butler upholding that Yogacara is a form of idealism, albeit its own unique type, notes the similarity of Kant's categories and Yogacara's Vāsanās, both of which are simply phenomenal tools with which the mind interprets the noumenal realm. Unlike Kant however who <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> the noumenon or thing-in-itself is unknowable to us, Vasubandhu <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> ultimate reality is knowable, but only through non-conceptual yogic perception of a highly trained meditative mind.|$|R
