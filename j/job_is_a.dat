500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 16, 1910. It states: [...] "May Sanders {{is the daughter of}} a farmer, Deacon Sanders, who is nearly as poor as he is religious. May goes to the city to seek employment, and her father warns her to shun theatres and bad company. Her first <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> maid in the home of Mrs. Carr, wife of a theatrical manager. Mrs. Carr discovers that May can sing and dance exceptionally well, and her husband places May on the stage. She makes a hit right from the start. Also she annexes the affections of John DeLacy, a wealthy young man. But she does not dare tell her parents about her new vocation. Matters drag along until the Deacon unexpectedly arrives in town. May has still pretended to be the maid of Mrs. Carr, and the father finds her in the house when she calls. He tells her that her mother is ill, and she is needed at home. She goes and is promptly put to work on the farm. John follows his sweetheart to the country, and to be near her, pretends to be poor and secures a job on the farm. The newspaper gives the Deacon a clue to the mystery, and he prepares to disown his daughter. But when she sings and dances, his anger melts, he forgives May and John, who later marry with a paternal blessing." ...|$|E
500|$|Louise O'Malley {{arrives at}} the hospital, and asks Torres to decide if O'Malley's organs will be donated. The victim of a {{speedboat}} accident, Clara Ferguson (Zoe Boyle), {{arrives at the}} hospital in an ambulance, with both of her arms {{and one of her}} legs amputated. She is attended to by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who informs her that her cut-off arms can be reattached. The hospital's president, Larry Jennings (Mitch Pileggi), explains to neurosuregon Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) that Webber has not been substantially completing his role as chief of surgery, and offers Shepherd the job. Karev reveals O'Malley's death to Stevens, and Torres seeks her help in deciding whether or not to donate O'Malley's organs. Stevens opinionates that O'Malley would give all his organs, and the two come to a mutual conclusion that donation is the correct option. Prior to the harvesting of his organs, O'Malley's former mentor Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) is uneasy about donating his organs, but soon comes to terms with the situation. Several days later, at O'Malley's funeral, the woman O'Malley saved, Amanda (Shannon Lucio) is shown hysterically crying while Karev, Stevens, Meredith, and Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) are laughing—unable to deal with their true emotions. After the funeral, O'Malley's former best friend Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is designated the job of emptying out his locker, but breaks down. Bailey subsequently discharges Stevens, and Robbins' body pain patient returns, with chronic pain, though Robbins is unable to diagnose him. Torres approaches Webber, seeking information {{as to whether or not}} her application to become an attending surgeon has been accepted. Webber explains that the job is no longer available, as the surgeon who was going to retire, ultimately did not. Torres becomes enraged, saying that the current surgeon who has the <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dinosaur, and storms out while yelling: [...] "I'm a superstar". The episode closes with Lexie consoling the speedboat victim, Ferguson.|$|E
