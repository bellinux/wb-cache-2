5|$|Vanilla is <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> small {{patches of}} land {{both as a}} single crop {{as well as an}} inter crop. As it needs lot of water for growth, it is largely <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> the rainier {{windward}} side of the island. Initially, vanilla is planted next to small trees until its vines grow to some height, at which point it is cut down closer to the soil so that it spreads across the ground. It starts to flower when about three years old; the flowering period is from July to August.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide food, feed and fuel. With grain sorghum currently <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.|$|E
5|$|Cotton is {{integral}} to Pakistan's economy. According to an analysis in the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015, it is grown as an industrial crop in 15% of the nation's land. It is grown during the monsoon months of May to August, known as the kharif period. It is also <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> a smaller scale between February and April.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grown</b> <b>on</b> agar plates, the mycelia of A.serialiformis and A.serialis have {{identical}} chemical reactivity, and {{are rather}} similar in appearance, although the authors {{note that the}} former's was more cottony than the latter's. The authors mated several combinations of North American collections using vegetative compatibility tests, and confirmed the presence of different mating alleles—indicating {{that all of the}} North American collections represented a single species. Similar pairings performed between North American and European collections showed the species to be incompatible, and therefore distinct.|$|E

40|$|Bakers' yeast cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, if <b>grown</b> aerobically <b>on</b> ethanol or if <b>grown</b> aerobically <b>on</b> glucose {{and allowed}} to pass into {{stationary}} phase, with utilization of accumulated ethanol, maintain a normal value (0. 8 to 0. 9) of the adenylate energy charge during prolonged starvation.

These results suggest that functional mitochondria or enzymes of balance of adenine nucleotides during starvation. Yeast cells remain viable at energy charge values below 0. 1, in marked contrast to results previously obtained with Escherichia coli. In other respects, the engery charge responses of yeast to starvation and refeeding are generally similar to those previously reported for E. coli...|$|R

5|$|Historically, California Zinfandel vines {{were planted}} {{as a field}} blend {{interspersed}} with Durif (Petite Sirah), Carignan, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Mission and Muscat. While most vineyards are now fully segregated, California winemakers continue to use other grapes (particularly Petite Sirah) in their Zinfandel wines. Zinfandel is <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> approximately 11% of California's vineyard land area. Around 400,000 short tons (350,000 tonnes) are crushed each year, depending on the harvest, placing Zinfandel third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot.|$|E
5|$|However, Wason had {{expected}} the Methven Branch railway {{to be built}} near Barrhill, {{but when it was}} built on a more southerly route along Thompsons Track and what was later to become known as Lauriston, the village began to decline. Dwindling population forced the closure of the school in 1938, although the Church of St John the Evangelist is still in use. Most of the buildings were constructed from pine wood <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> the estate, but the three original concrete buildings remain: church, school and schoolhouse.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, three {{cuttings}} of Carménère were {{imported from}} Chile by renowned viticultural expert Dr Richard Smart {{in the late}} 1990s. After two years in quarantine, only one cutting survived the heat treatment to eliminate viruses and was micro-propagated (segments of individual buds <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> nutrient gel) and field grown by Narromine Vine Nursery. The first vines from the nursery were planted in 2002 by Amietta Vineyard and Winery in the Moorabool Valley (Geelong, Victoria) who use Carménère in their Angels' Share blend.|$|E

The fruit is handpicked, mostly {{during the rainy season}} between March and May, and brought to a washing station in Maraba, where the coffee beans are extracted and dried. At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount and quality of the beans they provide.|$|E
5|$|Most cowpeas are <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> the African continent, {{particularly}} in Nigeria and Niger {{which account for}} 66% of world production. A 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on , have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes and are consumed by 200 million people on a daily basis. Insect infestation is a major constraint {{to the production of}} cowpea, sometimes causing losses of over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer Maruca vitrata is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea and the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus the main post-harvest pest.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the island}} {{is typical of the}} Outer Hebrides with heather, {{sphagnum}} moss, sedges, grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single tree– a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the deserted Village.|$|E

The conidia produced are thin and curved with a whip-like shape. They have 13–20 septa, measure 65–135 by 2–3.5μm, and usually have a single branch (typically about 45μm long) that appears before cells are released.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend towards}} more {{intensive}} farming {{began to be}} partially reversed {{by the end of}} the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred elsewhere) and grew less grain (some barley is still <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> the farm). Instead, some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{asserts that}} all wild trees grow from seed or from roots. He {{mentions}} that the philosophers spoke of spontaneous generation, as when Anaxagoras claims the air contains {{the seeds of}} every plant, whereas Diogenes believed plants arose when water mixed with earth. In places like Crete, Theophrastus writes that native plants spring up if the ground is simply disturbed, and that wild trees are generally more vigorous than cultivated ones, give fruit later, and like cold and hilly terrain. He asserts that trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> the plain.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their infectivity, their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> a large scale for vaccine production.|$|E

Dye crops of indigo and chay root were produced for the weaving industry. A mineral rich region, Machilipatnam was the gateway for high quality {{iron and steel}} exports. Diamond mining {{was active in the}} Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain calico and muslin (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to Java and the Far East. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed. The main imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and luxury goods.|$|E

Mycelia <b>grown</b> <b>on</b> solid agar media in laboratory petri dishes are usually referred to as colonies.
