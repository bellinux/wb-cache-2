5|$|The {{ground of}} fettering {{discretion}} {{on this basis}} is distinct from {{the right to a}} fair hearing. The latter relates to a separate <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review,</b> namely, procedural impropriety, and particularly the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative law does not recognize proportionality as a distinct <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b>|$|E
25|$|The UK case of R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, {{ex parte}} Coughlan (1999) {{established}} that legitimate expectations {{may have a}} substantive element as well. This involves a consideration of whether a change in policy was justified even after the individuals who {{would be affected by}} the change had already been consulted by the decision-making authority. In other words, a finding of substantive legitimate expectation may prevent a decision-maker from going back on a lawful representation that an individual will receive or continue to receive a substantive benefit of some kind. Substantive legitimate expectation was found to be a <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> in Singapore in Chiu Teng. The Court of Appeal has yet to rule definitively on whether substantive legitimate expectation should be recognized in Singapore as a <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> In any case, it is arguably a form of illegality rather than procedural impropriety.|$|E

25|$|The {{failure of}} a public {{authority}} {{to take into account}} relevant considerations and the taking of irrelevant ones into account are <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> in Singapore administrative law. They are regarded as forms of illegality.|$|R
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation was first developed in English {{law as a}} <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> in administrative law to protect a procedural or substantive interest when a public authority rescinds from a representation made to a person. It {{is based on the}} principles of natural justice and fairness, and seeks to prevent authorities from abusing power.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, {{common law}} grounds of {{judicial}} review were codified in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Findings of fact may be reviewed under sections 5(1)(f) and 6(1)(f) of the Act, provided the error is material to the decision. Hence, error of material fact is statutorily recognized in Australia as a <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review,</b> and is classified as an error of law.|$|E
25|$|Courts {{in several}} jurisdictions {{including}} Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK {{have followed the}} Tameside decision and conclusively recognized error of material fact as a distinct <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> These jurisdictions have categorized an error of material fact as an error of law, while specifying that the error must have been material to {{the outcome of a}} particular case before the court can quash the decision made.|$|E
25|$|Bias is one <b>of</b> the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> in Singapore {{administrative}} law {{which a person}} can rely upon to challenge the judgment of a court or tribunal, or a public authority's action or decision. There are three forms of bias, namely, actual, imputed and apparent bias.|$|R
25|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> {{failing to}} take into account {{relevant}} considerations and taking into account irrelevant ones may overlap with other <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> such as deciding for an improper purpose and irrationality. For example, in Lines International, the High Court considered the <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> relevant and irrelevant considerations together with Wednesbury unreasonableness.|$|R
25|$|The <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> {{that may}} be {{regarded}} as forms of illegality {{can be divided into}} two categories: those that, if proved, mean that the public authority was not empowered to take action or make the decision it did; and those that relate to whether the authority exercised its discretion properly.|$|R
25|$|The case {{appears to}} have {{introduced}} error of material fact into Singapore case law as a <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> While the term error of material fact was not explicitly stated in the case, the Court applied the legal rule laid down in the UK case Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council (1976) that a court may interfere with a government decision which {{has been based on}} a misunderstanding or ignorance of an established and relevant fact, and/or an incorrect basis of fact.|$|E
25|$|Courts {{in several}} jurisdictions {{including}} Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK {{have followed the}} Tameside decision and recognized error of material fact as a distinct <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> In the case E v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2004), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales set out four essential requirements that must be met {{in order for the}} ground of review to be successful. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the Singapore courts will adopt this refinement of the Tameside test.|$|E
25|$|As a result, the court's role {{should not}} be limited to {{reviewing}} such cases on the classic Wednesbury ground of review because to limit the review to the rationality of the decision would make the public authority the judge of its own decision. Ordinarily, a justification for acting against a legitimate expectation would often be sufficient and rational from the position of the authority regardless of objective judgment. In Ex parte Coughlan, the Court of Appeal also held that the Wednesbury <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> is not compromised by the doctrine of legitimate expectation. Rather, the latter complements the classic doctrine by providing a further benchmark where public authorities are held accountable to good standards of public administration.|$|E

The author suggests that the traditional <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> administrative action represent the courts 2 ̆ 7 accommodation of individual rights and the collective interest, and thus cover much the same ground as the Charter.

50|$|The {{first two}} grounds {{are known as}} {{substantive}} <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> because {{they relate to the}} substance of the disputed decision.

25|$|Justice Chan {{relied on}} a United Kingdom case, Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council (1976), to {{ascertain}} the law with regard to this <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> In this case, the House of Lords held that statutory provisions which are framed to include the word satisfaction may exclude judicial review on matters of pure judgment by the decision-maker, but judicial review will not be excluded in all cases. Lord Wilberforce held that when the judgment {{is dependent on the}} existence of relevant facts, the court has to ascertain if the facts truly exist and if they have been properly taken into account, although the evaluation of the facts is for the decision-maker alone. If these requirements are not met, an aggrieved person is entitled to challenge the decision, and the court can intervene {{on the grounds that the}} decision-maker acted outside its powers, outside the purpose of the legislation empowering it, unfairly, or upon an incorrect basis of fact. Lord Diplock mentioned it was also necessary to consider if the decision-maker had taken into consideration only matters which he ought to have considered.|$|E
500|$|Citing Chng Suan Tze v.

500|$|A {{decision-maker}} {{is said to}} {{be acting}} ultra vires (beyond its powers) when it does not have the power it purported to have, and therefore there is no basis in law for the impugned action or decision.

500|$|In UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp.

500|$|The High Court will enquire {{whether all}} {{considerations}} relevant to an act or decision {{have been taken}} into account by the decision-maker, and irrelevant ones ignored.

At that time, the Government of South Africa practised apartheid, and the Council had a policy not to support this. However, the club members who travelled to South Africa, while not agreeing with apartheid, believed that the social barriers created by apartheid could be broken down by maintaining sporting links with the country. The club members had not acted unlawfully by choosing to participate in the tournament, and neither had the club by permitting them to do so. Lord Templeman said that: ...|$|E

Prior to the year 1996, the Malaysian courts referred to the rigid and technical common law rules governing <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> administrative actions. In 1996, with the trail blazing judgment of the Court of Appeal in tan Tek Seng v Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan & Anor, I the judicial trend shifted from referring to common Jaw principles concerning the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> to the Federal Constitution.
