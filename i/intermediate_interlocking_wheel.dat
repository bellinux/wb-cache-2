On all schedules, each subject developed a stable performance that was generally break-and-run. Analysis of the cumulative records, post-SR breaks, and running rates showed a continuum of performance related to the schedule continuum...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{self-assembly}} kinetics for a norovirus {{capsid protein}} were probed by time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering and then analyzed by singular value decomposition and global fitting. Only three species {{contribute to the}} total scattering intensities: dimers, intermediates comprising some 11 dimers, and icosahedral T = 3 capsids made up of 90 dimers. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the intermediate robustly show a stave-like shape consistent with an arrangement of two pentameric units connected by an interstitial dimer. Upon triggering of self-assembly, the biphasic kinetics consist of a fast step in which dimers are assembled into intermediates, followed by a slow step in which <b>intermediates</b> <b>interlock</b> into capsids. This simple kinetic model reproduces experimental data with an excellent agreement over 6 decades in time and with nanometer resolution. The extracted form factors are robust against changes in experimental conditions. These findings challenge and complement currently accepted models for the assembly of norovirus capsids...|$|R
50|$|Race Report: Esteban Guerrieri {{took his}} second {{victory of the}} season, after leading every lap of the race to move closer to his team-mate and {{championship}} leader Josef Newgarden. Newgarden had started the race from pole position, but a move by Guerrieri at Turn 5 allowed {{him to take the}} lead just before the opening caution of the race, caused by series rookie Tyler Dueck running into the back of David Ostella, and the field concertinaed, with Daniel Morad, Daniel Herrington and Stefan Wilson also involved, with Dueck, Ostella and Morad all out on the spot. Third place went to another series rookie, with Oliver Webb finishing ahead of Wilson with Bruno Andrade just ahead of Gustavo Yacamán to complete the top five placing. The race's only other retirees came {{as a result of an}} incident between Victor Carbone and Peter Dempsey. Dempsey tried to take Carbone into Turn 1 on lap 28, with the two drivers <b>interlocking</b> <b>wheels</b> on the corner exit, sending both drivers into the wall. Carbone's car launched Dempsey's car upside-down, but Dempsey emerged without injury. Newgarden comfortably won race two after slight contact with Guerrieri, which left Guerrieri down the order. Wilson and Dempsey completed the podium.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{view of the}} {{problems}} existing in the present transportation ways of coal mine, a kind of new auxiliary haulage system has been designed, which can achieve the going there and back transportation only by using one winch in the multi-slope and undulating roadway. And {{according to the requirements}} of safety production of coal mine, the non-wheeled supply mine car without anti-car device and the safety <b>interlock</b> system of <b>wheeled</b> supply mine car have been designed. Meanwhile, finite element analysis software is adopted to check and analyze the locking pawl strength of the safety <b>interlock</b> system with <b>wheeled</b> supply mine car. The analyzing result shows that the locking pawl can completely stand the impact loading when the mine car sliding down. The haulage costs and the occurrence of security incidents have been reduced when the designed system is applied to coal mine. Engineering practice shows that the good results have been achieved...|$|R

50|$|The 1969 models {{received}} {{only a minor}} facelift such as a new split grille and vertical taillights with the same model and engine offerings. A new three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 {{was added to the}} option list to replace the two-speed Jetaway automatic. Headrests were made standard equipment due to federal safety mandate and the ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, which also was designed to lock the steering wheel. This ignition/steering <b>wheel</b> <b>interlock,</b> found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, debuted one year before the federal government mandated it on all 1970 models.|$|R
500|$|Villeneuve {{was joined}} by Jody Scheckter in 1979 after Carlos Reutemann moved to Lotus. Villeneuve won three races during the year and even briefly led the {{championship}} after winning back to back races in USA and South Africa. However, the season is mostly remembered for Villeneuve's wheel-banging duel with René Arnoux in the last laps of the 1979 French Grand Prix. Arnoux passed Villeneuve for second place with three laps to go, but Villeneuve re-passed him on the next lap. On the final lap Arnoux attempted to pass Villeneuve again, and the pair ran side-by-side through the first few corners of the lap, making contact several times. Arnoux took the position but Villeneuve attempted an outside pass one corner later. The cars bumped hard, Villeneuve slid wide but then passed Arnoux on the inside at a hairpin turn and held him off for {{the last half of}} the lap to secure second place. Villeneuve commented afterwards, [...] "I tell you, that was really fun! I thought for sure we were going to get on our heads, you know, because when you start <b>interlocking</b> <b>wheels</b> it's very easy for one car to climb over another." [...] At the Dutch Grand Prix a slow puncture collapsed Villeneuve's left rear tyre and put him off the track. He returned to the circuit and limped back to the pits on three wheels, losing the damaged wheel on the way. On his return to the pits Villeneuve insisted that the team replace the missing wheel, and had to be persuaded that the car was beyond repair. Villeneuve might have won the World Championship by ignoring team orders to beat Scheckter at the Italian Grand Prix, but chose to finish behind him, ending his own championship challenge. The pair finished first and second in the championship, with Scheckter beating Villeneuve by just four points. During the extremely wet Friday practice session for the season-ending United States Grand Prix, Villeneuve set a time variously reported to be either 9 or 11 seconds faster than any other driver. His teammate Jody Scheckter, who was second fastest, recalled that [...] "I scared myself rigid that day. I thought I had to be quickest. Then I saw Gilles's time and — I still don't really understand how it was possible. Eleven seconds!" ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{provides}} a scientific substantiation of loading of metal-bond diamond grinding wheels and describes {{the mechanism of}} contact interaction (<b>interlocking)</b> of <b>wheels</b> with tool steel {{as well as its}} general properties having an influence on combined electric diamond grinding efficiency. The study concluded that a loaded layer can be formed in a few stages different by nature. It is known, that one of the causes of grinding degradation is a continuous loading of active grits (abrasive grinding tool) by workpiece chips. It all affects the diamond grinding wheels efficiency and grinding ability with a result in increase of tool pressure, contact temperature and wheels specific removal rate. Science has partially identified some various methods to minimize grinding wheel loading, however, as to loading of metal-bond diamond grinding wheels the search is still in progress. Therefore, research people have to state, that {{in spite of the fact}} that the wheels made of cubic boron nitride are of little use as applied to ceramic, ultrahard, hard-alloyed hard-to-machine and nano-materials of the time, but manufactures have to apply cubic boron nitride wheels wherein diamond ones preferable...|$|R
60|$|It {{was close}} upon nine o'clock {{when we were}} ready to start for the Downs, and by that time my uncle's curricle was almost the only vehicle left in the village street. The night before they had lain with their <b>wheels</b> <b>interlocking</b> and their shafts under each other's bodies, as thick as they could fit, from the old church to the Crawley Elm, {{spanning}} the road five-deep for a good half-mile in length. Now the grey village street lay before us almost deserted save by a few women and children. Men, horses, carriages--all were gone. My uncle drew on his driving-gloves and arranged his costume with punctilious neatness; but I observed that he glanced up and down the road with a haggard and yet expectant eye before he took his seat. I sat behind with Belcher, while the Hon. Berkeley Craven took the place beside him.|$|R
2500|$|The race {{began at}} 14:00 Central Time Zone (...) [...] Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the race were dry and sunny with an air temperature of [...] and a track temperature between [...] 107,778 people attended the race. Every driver, except for Vettel, Kvyat and Hülkenberg, started on soft compound tyres. A strong cross wind cutting through the third and fifth turns caused cars to oversteer. When the race started, Rosberg made a fast getaway to maintain the lead heading into the first corner. Hamilton. who put his car at an angle towards Rosberg on the starting position, maintained second position. Bottas had wheelspin off the line, enabling teammate Massa to get ahead of him. Alonso attempted to overtake Bottas for fourth heading into the second turn but reduced his speed in his attempt. Ricciardo also had wheelspin off his starting position, and fell behind both Ferrari and McLaren cars. He remained on the outside line and overtook Button and Räikkönen and attacked Magnussen, passing him driving into turn 12. Pérez glimpsed space around the inside of Sutil but the additional speed required to drive alongside the Sauber meant he slid into the rear-end of Räikkönen's car. Räikkonen was able to continue but Pérez ploughed into Sutil. As the Sauber spun, it hit Pérez for a second time; both their front <b>wheels</b> <b>interlocked</b> and their suspensions were damaged.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rhythms of}} Coleman's {{music of the}} 1990s were {{described}} in the literature as [...] "circular and highly complex polymetric patterns which preserve their danceable character of popular funk rhythms despite their internal complexity and asymmetries. … On the scale of things, {{this is a very}} intelligent … music, a music which is hipper than any other music has been in a long time, a music which processes manifold stylistically experiences without abandoning its African American identity." [...] These rhythms are generated by overlapping rhythmic(-tonal) cycles of various, often [...] "odd" [...] (5, 7, 9 ...beats) lengths <b>interlocking</b> like gear <b>wheels</b> in a very complex way. The cycles are so long and their interaction is so complex that they appear unpredictable nevertheless well organized and grooving to the listener. In order to communicate freely and expressively within these textures, the musicians must be able to hear these contrasting rhythms simultaneously and that is challenging. But the multilayered rhythmic-tonal textures heighten the possibilities for improvised interactivity and their [...] "odd" [...] character is effective {{in the sense of the}} following statement of drummer Elvin Jones: [...] "Some parts of Latin music are very rigid, as are some aspects of African rhythms. The flexibility comes from the number of people that are playing the rhythm. It is not always synchronized, so that gives it a certain movement that makes it more fluid. When I applied it, I opted for the fluidity rather than the static portion of the rhythms." [...] Steve Coleman's overlapping cycles of various, often [...] "odd" [...] lengths provide a very fluid (multilayered) basis for improvisation.|$|R
