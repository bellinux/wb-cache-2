5|$|Carroll {{looks at}} how a fruit fly's <b>embryonic</b> {{development}} is controlled, and describes his own discoveries (back in 1994).|$|E
5|$|Gastrotrichs {{demonstrate}} eutely, {{each species}} having an invariant genetically fixed {{number of cells}} as adults. Cell division ceases {{at the end of}} <b>embryonic</b> development and further growth is solely due to cell enlargement.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v. Wade. Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on <b>embryonic</b> stem cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto). He also amended his position on <b>embryonic</b> stem cell research itself.|$|E
5|$|Many Gobioolithus minor {{specimens}} contain <b>embryonic</b> {{remains of}} the enantiornithine genus Gobipipus. The embryos have well-ossified skeletons, implying that they were at a late stage in development when they died. Their wings and shoulders are especially well-developed. Only the modern megapodes and the little tern exhibit a comparable degree of <b>embryonic</b> ossification in the arm and shoulder bones. It is likely that Gobipipus hatchlings, like megapodes and little terns, {{would be able to}} fly very soon after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{tests on}} {{reproductive}} function, <b>embryonic</b> toxicity, or carcinogenic potential {{can all be}} required by law, depending on the result of other studies {{and the type of}} drug being tested.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve {{is derived from}} the basal plate of the <b>embryonic</b> spinal segments C1–C6.|$|E
5|$|The <b>embryonic</b> heart begins beating {{at around}} 22 days after {{conception}} (5 {{weeks after the}} last normal menstrual period, LMP). It starts to beat at a rate near to the mother's which is about 75–80 beats per minute (bpm). The <b>embryonic</b> heart rate then accelerates and reaches a peak rate of 165–185 bpm early in the early 7th week (early 9th week after the LMP). After 9 weeks (start of the fetal stage) it starts to decelerate, slowing to around 145 (±25) bpm at birth. There is no difference in female and male heart rates before birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart is}} the first {{functional}} organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at about three weeks into embryogenesis. This early start is crucial for subsequent <b>embryonic</b> and prenatal development.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nucleus {{is derived}} from the basal plate of the <b>embryonic</b> medulla oblongata.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid ima artery is an <b>embryonic</b> artery and {{it occurs}} {{because of the}} failure of the vessel to close, {{remaining}} patent (open).|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of <b>embryonic</b> development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as <b>embryonic</b> bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
5|$|Developing neurons travel {{toward the}} {{olfactory}} bulb along the RMS via glial tubes, which mark {{the division between}} the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with <b>embryonic</b> characteristics. Uniquely, the cells travel tangential to the brain surface, parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons. Neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe {{this is not the}} case. Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes. They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology. Furthermore, these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression, a protein commonly found in <b>embryonic</b> or immature glial cells. The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the cell surface molecule, a polysialylated (PSA) <b>embryonic</b> form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) called PSA-NCAM, as well as β-tubulin, a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts, proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb. With the removal of NCAM, the neuroblasts scatter, proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation. The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes.|$|E
5|$|G. minor {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is found with <b>embryonic</b> skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest {{they would be}} able to fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{exposure}} to ambient Mn air concentrations {{in excess of}} 5 μg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms. Increased ferroportin protein expression in human <b>embryonic</b> kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity, characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase leakage.|$|E
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the <b>embryonic</b> development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the <b>embryonic</b> splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Microfossils {{dating from}} – just 3million {{years after the}} end of the Cryogenian glaciations– may {{represent}} <b>embryonic</b> 'resting stages' in the life cycle of the earliest known animals. An alternative proposal is that these structures represent adult stages of the multicellular organisms of this period.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos {{have become}} a {{standard}} knockdown tool in animal <b>embryonic</b> systems, which have {{a broader range of}} gene expression than adult cells and can be strongly affected by an off-target interaction. Following initial injections into frog or fish embryos at the single-cell or few-cell stages, Morpholino effects can be measured up to five days later, after most of the processes of organogenesis and differentiation are past, with observed phenotypes consistent with target-gene knockdown. Control oligos with irrelevant sequences usually produce no change in <b>embryonic</b> phenotype, evidence of the Morpholino oligo's sequence-specificity and lack of non-antisense effects. The dose required for a knockdown can be reduced by coinjection of several Morpholino oligos targeting the same mRNA, which is an effective strategy for reducing or eliminating dose-dependent off-target RNA interactions.|$|E
5|$|Pollock {{was born}} on 11 May 1977 in Liverpool, England with spina bifida, a {{developmental}} congenital disorder caused by the incomplete closing of the <b>embryonic</b> neural tube. He currently lives in Wigan, Greater Manchester in north west England.|$|E
5|$|The <b>embryonic</b> body {{segments}} (somites) {{of different}} arthropods taxa have diverged {{from a simple}} body plan with many similar appendages which are serially homologous, {{into a variety of}} body plans with fewer segments equipped with specialised appendages. The homologies between these have been discovered by comparing genes in evolutionary developmental biology.|$|E
5|$|Troponin I, slow {{skeletal}} muscle is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI1 gene. An isoform switch from ssTnI to cTnI occurs during perinatal heart development. ssTnI is not {{expressed in the}} <b>embryonic</b> hearts of Xenopus and zebrafish, while it is expressed in the somites and {{skeletal muscle}}s.|$|E
5|$|Using human {{manufacturing}} processes, wheeled {{systems of}} varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, {{and issues of}} power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of <b>embryonic</b> development are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.|$|E
25|$|After {{joining the}} Senate in 2002, Talent {{supported}} federal {{legislation that would}} ban <b>embryonic</b> stem cell research or federal funding for <b>embryonic</b> stem cell research. This included cosponsoring a bill (S.658) sponsored by Senator Sam Brownback, which would ban all forms of human cloning including <b>embryonic</b> therapeutic cloning techniques that are seen as crucial to stem cell research. This law was unnecessary because President Bill Clinton outlawed human cloning in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Harkin {{has come}} {{out in favor of}} <b>embryonic</b> stem cell research. In July 2006, Harkin made a speech from the Senate floor in {{response}} to George W. Bush's veto of the <b>embryonic</b> stem cell research federal funding bill.|$|E
25|$|Sheep: Marked {{the first}} mammal being cloned (1984) from early <b>embryonic</b> cells by Steen Willadsen. Megan and Morag cloned from {{differentiated}} <b>embryonic</b> cells in June 1995 and Dolly the sheep from a somatic cell in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The omphalomesenteric duct (omphaloenteric duct, vitelline duct or yolk stalk) {{normally}} {{connects the}} <b>embryonic</b> midgut to the yolk sac ventrally, providing nutrients to the midgut during <b>embryonic</b> development. The vitelline duct narrows progressively and disappears between the 5th and 8th weeks gestation.|$|E
25|$|LIN28: LIN28 is an mRNA binding protein {{expressed}} in <b>embryonic</b> stem cells and <b>embryonic</b> carcinoma cells associated with differentiation and proliferation. Thomson et al. demonstrated that LIN28 {{is a factor}} in iPSC generation in combination with OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG.|$|E
25|$|STS-126 also {{flew the}} first bovine embryos {{as well as}} porcine <b>embryonic</b> stem cells on an American {{spacecraft}} for an experiment to evaluate effects of the environment of space on <b>embryonic</b> development. The project was a joint project of ZeroGravity Inc., University of Florida and USDA ARS.|$|E
25|$|The Varicella zoster {{vaccine is}} made from the Oka/Merck strain of live {{attenuated}} varicella virus. The virus was initially obtained from a child with natural varicella, introduced into human <b>embryonic</b> lung cell cultures, adapted to and propagated in <b>embryonic</b> guinea pig cell cultures, and finally propagated in human diploid cell cultures.|$|E
25|$|The {{ectodermal}} dysplasia associated with EEC syndrome arises from abnormalities in the <b>embryonic</b> ectoderm, as described above. Very early in <b>embryonic</b> development, the <b>embryonic</b> stem cells differentiate into {{three types of}} cells: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. It is from these three types of cells that all body organs originate. In general terms, ectodermal cells generate the skin, spinal cord, and teeth (as well as the numerous derivatives mentioned above). Mesodermal cells generate blood vessels, muscle and bone, and endodermal cells generate the lungs, the digestive system and the urinary system.|$|E

25|$|The human {{inner ear}} {{develops}} during week 4 of <b>embryonic</b> development from the auditory placode, a thickening of the ectoderm which {{gives rise to}} the bipolar neurons of the cochlear and vestibular ganglions. As the auditory placode invaginates towards the <b>embryonic</b> mesoderm, it forms the auditory vesicle or otocyst.|$|E
