Hartsfield's <b>knives</b> were hard ground from differentially heat-treated A2 tool steel and {{are known for their}} distinctive chisel-ground blades. More accurately, they are zero ground; that is, the edge has no secondary bevel, minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes. Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding <b>knives,</b> which Hartsfield granted. When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife, he informed them that he did not make folding <b>knives</b> and referred them to Emerson.|$|E

5|$|This {{surge in}} {{interest}} for Emerson's <b>knives</b> soon became overwhelming. Although {{he had been}} making <b>knives</b> full-time since 1994, Emerson was still manufacturing these <b>knives</b> in his home garage workshop three years later. As Emerson watched his customers' wait time expand from two years to seven, {{he realized that the}} demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his ability to produce them. The first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations with established cutlery companies.|$|E

5|$|These early <b>knives</b> {{sold for}} between $800 and $2,000 each; that, {{combined}} with his appearances at knife shows and write-ups in knife magazines, helped Emerson gain status and {{credibility as a}} custom knifemaker. Once established as a serious and reputable maker, Emerson was soon able to concentrate on making the <b>knives</b> he wanted to make—knives designed for use as opposed to show, specifically folding-knives designed for combat.|$|E
5000|$|... 9. The {{instrument}} {{must have}} been a strong <b>knife</b> at least six inches long, very sharp, pointed at the top and about an inch in width. It may have been a clasp <b>knife,</b> a butcher's <b>knife</b> or a surgeon's <b>knife.</b> I think it was no doubt a straight <b>knife.</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the <b>knives</b> he made were built as fighting <b>knives</b> first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his <b>knives.</b> The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E
5|$|Bo Randall {{first became}} {{interested}} in making <b>knives</b> after he purchased a Bill Scagel knife that was being used to scrape paint off of a boat without showing any signs of wear or damage. He made his first knife in his garage at Lake Ivanhoe, Florida using an auto spring.|$|E

5|$|In 1994 the {{president}} of Benchmade <b>Knives,</b> Les DeAsis, approached Emerson to manufacture the CQC-6 {{on a larger scale}} as a factory production model. Preferring to keep the CQC-6 as a custom-only knife, Emerson instead licensed a similar design of his, the CQC-7.|$|E
50|$|Schrade Cutlery Company had {{its roots}} in the New York Press Button <b>Knife</b> Company, formed in 1892 by George Schrade, an {{inventor}} from Sheffield, England. Unable to raise sufficient capital to begin <b>knife</b> production, Schrade sold a partial interest in the company to the Walden <b>Knife</b> Company. The company's unusual name arose from its first <b>knife</b> design, a switchblade or automatic-opening pocket <b>knife</b> with an operating button mounted in the <b>knife</b> bolster. First patented by Schrade in 1892, the <b>knife</b> was eventually produced with a unique style of clip point blade. In 1903, Schrade sold all of his interest in the New York Press Button <b>Knife</b> Co. to Walden <b>Knife</b> Company. The following year, Schrade formed the Schrade Cutlery Company in Walden.|$|R

5|$|The CQC-6 (Close Quarters Combat— Six) or Viper Six is a {{handmade}} tactical {{folding knife}} with a tantō blade manufactured by knifemaker Ernest Emerson. Although initially reported as the sixth design in an evolution of fighting <b>knives</b> {{and the first}} model in the lineup of Emerson's Specwar Custom <b>Knives,</b> Emerson later revealed that the knife was named for SEAL Team Six. It has a chisel-ground blade of ATS-34 or 154CM stainless steel and a handle made of titanium and linen micarta. The CQC-6 is credited as the knife that popularized {{the concept of the}} tactical folding knife.|$|E

50|$|A pantographic <b>knife</b> or paratrooper <b>knife</b> is {{a folding}} <b>knife</b> whose blade is opened by a unique {{scissors}} method. The blade {{has a slightly}} longer tang than a folding <b>knife</b> heel. The handle is symmetrically segmented and articulated to fold away on both sides to grip the longer tang. The manner {{is similar to a}} balisong <b>knife</b> (also called a butterfly <b>knife</b> in western countries)—with which it is often confused. Unlike the balisong <b>knife</b> handles that swing freely and independently, the pantographic <b>knife</b> uses a pantograph linkage to keep the handles aligned during opening and closing. The pantographic <b>knife</b> is very strong when compared to most other folding <b>knife</b> designs, being joined at several points and along several planes—this increases the force required to break the blade away from the handle. By enclosing the blade on both sides, double edged blades can be used.|$|R
50|$|The Little <b>Knife</b> River (West) is a 7.4 mi {{river in}} St. Louis County, Minnesota, United States. It is a {{tributary}} of the <b>Knife</b> River. A second Little <b>Knife</b> River flows into the <b>Knife</b> River from the east, in Lake County.|$|R

They also found credit cards belonging to Sheila Damude and Gerard Lowe. In addition, police found Simon Davis' birth certificate, and items that Martin had used to immobilise and kill: a hammer weighing 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb), a battery-operated Z-Force III electroshock weapon, a can of mace, two pairs of handcuffs, a pair of thumbcuffs, two Police brand foldable <b>knives,</b> an oilstone and two Swiss army <b>knives.</b> Importation of some of these into Singapore is illegal.|$|E
5|$|When {{traditional}} cutters are involved, non-sterile {{devices are}} likely to be used, including <b>knives,</b> razors, scissors, glass, sharpened rocks and fingernails.

5000|$|The facón {{is both a}} {{fighting}} <b>knife</b> and a utility <b>knife,</b> and is widely used in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. [...] The <b>knife</b> is typically worn at the back and tucked into the gaucho's belt {{to allow it to}} be quickly drawn with the right hand. As {{a fighting}} <b>knife,</b> the facón is the main article of combat in an indigenous style of <b>knife</b> fighting known as escrima criolla ("Creole fencing") [...] When used in this context, one hand holds the <b>knife,</b> and a poncho or coat is wrapped about the opposite arm to absorb cuts and stabs in a manner reminiscent of traditional Andalusian <b>knife</b> fighting styles using the long-bladed Spanish clasp <b>knife</b> or navaja sevillana.|$|R
50|$|For {{short-range}} weapons, {{the combat}} <b>knife</b> was tested against the cane <b>knife</b> in eliminating two targets.

The edge {{was given to the}} combat <b>knife</b> for its flexibility and portability.|$|R
