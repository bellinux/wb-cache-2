25|$|Open circuit scuba has no {{provision}} for using the breathing gas more than once for respiration. The gas inhaled from the scuba equipment is exhaled to the environment, or occasionally into another <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> for a special purpose, usually to increase buoyancy of a lifting device such as a buoyancy compensator, inflatable surface marker buoy or small lifting bag. The breathing gas is generally provided from a high-pressure diving cylinder through a scuba regulator. By always providing the appropriate breathing gas at ambient pressure, demand valve regulators ensure the diver can inhale and exhale naturally and without excessive effort, regardless of depth, as and when needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> for a cavalryman was {{the horse}} {{and one of the}} reasons both North and South initially hesitated in forming mounted units was because of financial considerations; each cavalry regiment cost $300,000 for initial organization with annual upkeep expenses tallying over $100,000. Both cavalries originally required recruits or local communities to provide horses, a policy that lasted briefly in the North, while the South maintained it throughout the war even though Richmond leaders recognized its serious drawbacks. While Confederate troopers bore the monetary cost of keeping themselves mounted, Union cavalrymen rode quartermaster issued animals obtained though public contracts (although officers had to reimburse the cost of their mounts to the government). While open to fraud early in the war, once tightened regulations and stringent inspections were enforced, the contract system yielded an estimated 650,000 horses for Union armies during the war exclusive of an additional 75,000 confiscated in Confederate territory. Union army guidelines for cavalry horse selection mandated animals be at least 15 hands high, weighing minimally 950 pounds and aged between 4 and 10 years old, and be well-broken to bridle and saddle. Animals were to be dark colors and free from defects such as shallow breathing, deformed hooves, spavin or ringbone. Geldings were preferred for cavalry horses with the purchase of mares strictly prohibited outside absolute military emergency and stallions' volatility and aggressiveness made them generally unsuitable for service. In the Confederacy, limited horse numbers did not permit such selectivity in trying to keep their armies horsed. Cavalry horse prices varied throughout the war; in 1861 the maximum government price for cavalry horses was $119. However, relentless military demand caused prices to continually increase and by 1865 prices hovered near $190 per head. In the Confederacy horse prices rapidly spiraled upward due to animal scarcity and inflation costing over $3,000 by war's end. The daily feed ration for Union cavalry horses was ten pounds of hay and fourteen pounds of grain which were ample and fulfilled the animals' nutritional needs if of good quality, however, the vagaries of the army supply system did not always insure prescribed forage amounts were delivered where most needed. On both sides volunteer officers often proved notably lax in promoting strict animal welfare, a shortcoming exacerbated by the absence of a trained and organized veterinary corps which allowed serious maladies like strangles, grease heel, farcy, and glanders to spread among army stock. The U.S. Congress finally created the rank of veterinary sergeant in March 1863, but the meager pay and rank held no inducement for qualified candidates to join the army. Repeated calls to establish a professional military veterinary service failed, and widespread waste, suffering, and destruction among army horses resulted; not until 1916 was an official U.S. army veterinary corps founded.|$|E

2500|$|The {{break of}} railway gauge at Albury {{was a major}} {{impediment}} to Australia's war effort and infrastructure during both World Wars, as every soldier, every <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> and all supplies had to be off-loaded from the broad gauge and reloaded onto a standard gauge railway wagon {{on the opposite side}} of the platform. In his book Tramps Abroad, writer Mark Twain spoke of the break of gauge at Albury and changing trains: [...] "Now comes a singular thing, the oddest thing, the strangest thing, the unaccountable marvel that Australia can show, namely the break of gauge at Albury. Think of the paralysis of intellect that gave that idea birth".|$|E
2500|$|A {{condenser}} is {{an apparatus}} or <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> used to condense (change the physical state of a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state). In the laboratory, condensers are generally used in procedures involving organic liquids {{brought into the}} gaseous state through heating, with or without lowering the pressure (applying vacuum)—though applications in inorganic and other chemistry areas exist. While condensers can be applied at various scales, in the research, training, or discovery laboratory, one most often uses glassware designed to pass a vapor flow over an adjacent cooled chamber. In simplest form, such a condenser consists of a single glass tube with outside air providing cooling. A further simple form, the Liebig-type of condenser, involves concentric glass tubes, an inner one through which the hot gases pass, and an outer, [...] "ported" [...] chamber through which a cooling fluid passes, to reduce the gas temperature in the inner, to afford the condensation.|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{profession}} and the tasks it entails, soldiers {{are exposed to}} high levels of physical activity and strain. This can result in overexertion and pain in the locomotor system, partly caused by carrying <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study was to analyse the extent of muscle activity in the lower extremities caused by carrying specific <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> For this purpose, the activity of selected groups of muscles caused by different <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> (helmet, carrying strap, backpack, and rifle) in the upper and lower leg was measured by recording dynamic surface electromyograms. Electrogoniometers were also used to measure the angle of the knee over the entire gait cycle. In addition to measuring muscle activity, the study also aimed to determine out what influence increasing weight load has on the range of motion (ROM) of the knee joint during walking. The activity of recorded muscles of the lower extremity, that is, the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius lateralis, gastrocnemius medialis, rectus femoris, and biceps femoris, was found to depend on the weight <b>of</b> the <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> There was no evidence, however, that <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> weighing a maximum of 34 % of their carrier’s body weight had an effect on the ROM of the knee joint...|$|R

50|$|Firstly, let’s {{follow the}} current path. There is a generic source of current. This source {{can be either}} large or small, as only a small voltage is {{required}} to drive the low current for micro-shock. Such sources might be, a wall socket, a faulty <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> an inappropriate <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> a poorly designed <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> or an <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> designed to deliver current into the body. Our patient has unfortunately contacted one such source and current is dispersing through their right arm and upper torso, to eventually converge on a catheter (as labelled - {{but it could be}} a lead or wire) that is placed into their heart. This concentration of current flow at the heart muscle is the danger from micro-shock. If the catheter is conductive and insulated, the current may follow the catheter, emerging through the skin into some other <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> For the circuit as shown to be complete, the conductive part of the catheter needs to also be connected to ground within this equipment. Finally, the hazardous circuit is complete - current can flow and if it continues the patient is in mortal danger. Again, while this is theoretically possible this has never been proven to have actually happened.|$|E
