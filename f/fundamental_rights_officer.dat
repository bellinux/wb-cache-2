The debated issues follow the criminal and criminal procedure law reform in Romania, during 2013 - 2016, reform {{which resulted in a}} legislative void and a non-unitary and uncorrelated interpretation of the old legislation. The academic and practical significance of this endeavor consists in analyzing a transitional situation due to the failure of the legislator that remained unregulated and is likely to lead to a non-unitary interpretation and consequently to the flagrant damaging of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> of police <b>officers.</b> Without wishing to be an exhaustive initiative, the present paper represents a review that highlights the doctrinal and jurisprudential implications of a conviction with conditional suspension of the custodial sentence, upon labor relations of the police officers...|$|R

40|$|As the EU's <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> regime reaches maturity, {{this book}} offers the first {{full-length}} {{overview of the}} historical development and current role of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the law and policy of the European Union. It analyses both the institutional aspects (the place of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the EU legal order and their role in decision-making procedures) and substantive dimensions (the range and scope of rights recognized as part of EU law). Part I traces the emergence of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> as {{a feature of the}} EU legal order, from the initial silence of the original Treaties to the development of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> as general principles of law safeguarded by the European Court of Justice, and the adoption of a number of legislative instruments linking the protection of certain <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> to the establishment of the internal market. Part II moves on to examine <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the current landscape of EU law and policy. It analyses the constitutionalization of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> through Treaty amendments and the development of an area of freedom, security and justice among the Member States. It examines the role of the EU Charter of <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> and of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> Agency; and the relationship between the EU and the Council of Europe in the protection of human rights on the European continent. Finally, Part III offers a critical analysis of the role of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the external relations of the EU.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the ‘horizontal effect’ of European <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the {{jurisprudence}} of the CJEU. It explores how the Court appies these rights in adjudicating litigations between private parties. It addresses three questions: (1) how the horizontal effect of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> operates, (2) which policy goals it serves, and (3) whether this use of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> is legitimate and desirable. The first section of this paper explains how the terms ‘European fundamental rights’ and ‘private law’ are used throughout the text, and outlines the difference between vertical and horizontal effect. The second section outlines the difference between direct and indirect horizontal effect of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> In its third section, this paper takes position in favour of a normative individualistic understanding of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> The fourth section makes some examples of direct horizontal application and the fifth section some examples of indirect horizontal application of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the CJEU jurisprudence. The sixth section analyses the horizontal effect of the Charter. Here, this paper proposes a new doctrine: the ‘double indirect horizontal effect’ of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> This doctrine helps explain the impact of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> on private relationships in the European multi-level system of court adjudication. It also encourages the Court of Justice to develop its jurisprudence towards a better consideration of the non-economic human interests protected by European <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> The subsequent sections identify the policies related to the horizontal effect of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> at the EU level (seventh section). The eighth section addresses the question whether the pursuit of these policies through court adjudication constitutes a legitimate use or an illegitimate instrumentalization of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> It assesses {{the extent to which}} both the above-mentioned national and European patterns of horizontal effect correspond to the normative individualistic perspective outlined in the fourth section.

It focuses on three general ex ante conditionalities {{in the area of}} antidiscrimination, gender equality and disability. Conditionality in <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> is a long-standing EU policy tool, used mainly to enforce compliance with <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> values on third countries. The 2013 Cohesion policy reform marks a strong transition of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> conditionality to internal policy. The development stirred a great interest as the tool addresses directly the EU Member States. It conditions the access to funding on a prior fulfilment of specifically prescribed <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> criteria. In this context, the thesis inquires what is the nature and reach of the novel <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> conditionalities. To facilitate a robust understanding of the newly introduced tool, the thesis firstly undertakes a conceptual analysis of conditionality. It further takes an evolutivecomparative approach, locating the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> conditionalities in the broader context of EU conditionality policy {{as well as in the}} context of European Structural and Investment Funds framework.

This thesis {{places the}} debate on the {{relationship}} between <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> and the internal market outside the field of negative integration (where it is usually takes place) into the field of positive integration. It examines the extent to which there is an internal market competence to deal with <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> and analyses new mechanisms for <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> protection outside the Courts. Against this backdrop, this thesis analyses the existing harmonisation practice in the EU through the lens of four fundamental rights: (i) data protection, (ii) freedom of expression, (iii) <b>fundamental</b> labour <b>rights</b> [the right to collective bargaining and the right to fair and just working conditions] and (iv) the right to health. The research reveals that there is a considerable amount of internal market legislation dealing with <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> (even pre-existing the EU Charter of <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights)</b> but that most of it is not couched in <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> terms. This thesis identifies the determinants, which account for the current prevalent conceptualisation and assesses the consequences of such approaches both for the substantive content of legislation and for its judicial review. The thesis provides a much more differentiated account of the EU's <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> policy in and through the internal market than perhaps initially expected.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> within the EU legal order {{has come to}} a climax through the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in December 2009. Article 6 of the EU Treaty now recognizes the binding force of the EU Charter of <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights,</b> embraces the intention to accede to the European Convention on the Protection of Human <b>Rights</b> and <b>Fundamental</b> Freedoms and codifies the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) case law that <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> shall constitute general principles of Union law.

40|$|Examining Board: Professor Loïc Azoulai, European University Institute (EUI Supervisor) Professor Bruno de Witte, European University Institute Professor Giorgio Gaja, University of Florence Professor Steve Peers, University of Essex. Defence date: 21 October 2013 The {{recognition}} of the legally binding value of the EU Charter of <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> has profoundly transformed the Union system of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> protection. The novelties not only concern the sources of this protection, but also the conditions for the application and interpretation of EU <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> In particular, before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty the Court of Justice was the exclusive architect of its approach to <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> whereas {{in the era of}} the legally binding Charter is confronted with written rules on the subject. Moreover, if {{there is no doubt that}} the Lisbon Treaty has put an unprecedented emphasis on the protection and promotion of EU <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> the Member States have contextually expressed, and with equal emphasis, concerns towards an ever-increasing expansion of the scope of EU <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> at the expense of domestic standards and material competences. Against this background, the aim of this thesis is to reconstruct the scope of the protection offered (better, that should be offered) by the EU Charter. The analysis covers problems relating both to the scope of application of the Charter and to its effects. Some of the questions addressed are new, as they stem from novelties introduced by the Charter others are veritable topoi of the EU discourse on <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> which nevertheless need to be revisited in light of the new scenario just described. The leading idea is that, in order to overcome the ambiguity of the Charter on many crucial issues concerning its scope of application and effects, reliance must be made on the role assigned to EU <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> by the revised Treaties. These, and the progressive evolution of the EU system of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> protection, suggest that <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> are constitutive values of the EU legal order...|$|R
40|$|The use of self-regulatory or privatized {{enforcement}} {{measures in the}} online environment can give rise to various legal issues that affect the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> of internet users. First, privatized enforcement by internet services, without state involvement, can interfere with the effective exercise of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> by internet users. Such interference may, on occasion, be disproportionate, but there are legal complexities involved in determining the precise circumstances in which this is the case. This is because, for instance, the private entities can themselves claim protection under the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> framework (e. g. the protection of property {{and the freedom to}} conduct business). Second, the role of public authorities in the development of self-regulation in view of certain public policy objectives can become problematic, but has to be carefully assessed. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> framework puts limitations on government regulation that interferes with <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> Essentially, such limitations involve the (negative) obligation for States not to interfere with <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> Interferences have to be prescribed by law, pursue a legitimate aim and be necessary in a democratic society. At the same time, however, States are also under the (positive) obligation to take active measures in order to ensure the effective exercise of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> In other words, States must do more than simply refrain from interference. These positive obligations are of specific interest in the context of private ordering impact on <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> but tend to be abstract and hard to operationalize in specific legal constellations. This study’s central research question is: What legal limitations follow from the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> framework for self-regulation and privatized enforcement online? It examines the circumstances in which State responsibility can be engaged as a result of selfregulation or privatized enforcement online.

40|$|This article assesses {{whether the}} EU Treaty freedoms - the free {{movement}} of goods, persons, services and capital - {{should be considered as}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> which are hierarchically equal to other <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> It uses the political philosophy of John Rawls to assess why we should attach priority to certain rights and which rights should therefore be considered <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> On this basis it is argued that we should recognise two main types of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> namely basic rights and liberties associated with Rawls' first principle of justice and the rights associated with the principle of fair equality of opportunity. This is followed by an analysis of the interpretation that the European Court of Justice (CJEU) gives to the Treaty freedoms. On the basis of the normative framework, it is argued that the Treaty freedoms can be seen as <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> insofar as they embody the value of equality of opportunity. Nonetheless, the CJEU increasingly seems to rely on a broader market access approach rather than an equal treatment approach in interpreting the Treaty freedoms. It is argued that where equal treatment is not at stake, the Treaty freedoms should not be seen as <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> Therefore, in cases where there is a conflict between a <b>fundamental</b> <b>right</b> and a Treaty freedom the CJEU should carefully distinguish between these two different interpretations of the Treaty freedoms. In cases where it is merely market access that is at stake, the CJEU should regard the protection of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> as more important, and be very careful in allowing a restriction of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> {{in order to protect the}} exercise of the Treaty freedom. On the other hand, in cases where the Treaty freedoms can be seen as protecting equality of opportunity and where they conflict with other <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> the Court is justified in construing the conflict as a right-right conflict in which a fair balance has to be sought...|$|R

In traditional doctrine, the reason usually given to confer horizontal effect to <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> is a deferral to the constitution: The constitutional text decides whether and how <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> apply to private legal relationships. This answer implies that <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> are either logically or normatively alien to private law, that they are located in a logical or normative room beyond the logical room of private law. In contrast to this prevailing opinion, the paper argues that, first, private law is logically prior to <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> and that, second, <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> are part of private law 2 ̆ 7 s intrinsic normative logic. This is developed for the class of democratic rights that includes all rights besides anti-discrimination rights and classical civil rights. If the argument is cogent, then it can also explain why <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> also apply, including horizontal effect, in the sphere of transnational legal regimes, subject to the transnationalj urisdictiono f state courts and internationalt ribunals.
