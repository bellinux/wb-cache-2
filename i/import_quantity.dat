Later Jeep Australia began full assembly of the SUV and J20 trucks from knock-down kits. Problems with spare parts, quality control, the limited capacity of the assembly plant (maximum of 60 Cherokee/J20 vehicles per month), and lack of dealer support (many were multi-franchise stores so Jeeps were not their focus) were disadvantages to maintaining market share. Australian tariff regulations defined [...] "real" [...] 4x4 vehicles as having a separate frame and chassis construction and had a 25% duty and no quota restrictions, while vehicles with an integral chassis were classified as [...] "cars" [...] and subject to both an <b>import</b> <b>quantity</b> restriction and a 57.5% tax. This meant the continuing assembly of the SJ models even after the compact XJ model was introduced by AMC. All Cherokee assembly was discontinued in Australia by 1985, three years after the SJ had been replaced in the U.S. by the XJ.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze economic factors affecting the demand for imported corn to Saudi Arabia. The analysis aimed also at observing the impact of alternative livestock support policy on the demand for corn. 	Import demand model for corn is specified and statistically estimated using time series data for the period 1976 - 1990. Some literature for related studies in the U. S., Egypt, and Saudi Arabia is reviewed in this research. 	Results showed that about 94 % of the variation in <b>imported</b> <b>quantities</b> of corn is due to the variations in real import price of corn, real per capita GDP, real price of local chicken meat, and the per animal unit government support to the livestock sector. 	The estimated demand model was tested for its projection ability using the (U-theil). <b>Imported</b> <b>quantity</b> demanded of corn is then forecasted up to the year 2000 with a 95 % confidence interval. The paper also analyzed the impact of a 10 % increase or decrease in the per animal unit government support on the <b>imported</b> <b>quantity</b> of corn to Saudi Arabia. 	It is expected that <b>imported</b> <b>quantities</b> of corn will be around 504 thousand tons by the year 2000, a 10 % increase (decrease) in the per animal unit government support will result in an increase (decrease) of the forecasted <b>imported</b> <b>quantities</b> of corn by 9 %, and 33 %, respectively...|$|R

An artificial neural network- (ANN-) based simulation model has been developed to forecast the long-term power demand considering different A/C-system quantity import scenarios. Beside the A/C factor, four socio-economic factors are utilized as inputs for the simulation model, including gross national product, population, number of buildings, and historic peak power demand. The baseline scenario shows that the peak power demand will reach 27 440 MW by the year 2025, with an average annual power growth rate of 5. 9 per cent. The A/C <b>import</b> <b>quantity</b> scenario shows that an average A/C <b>import</b> <b>quantity</b> change of 1 per cent is proportionate to an 1. 1 per cent change in power demand...|$|E

Four variables, namely real exchange rate, national income (GOP), lagged <b>import</b> <b>quantity</b> of meat and the dummy variable to take into account the currency pegging policy that has been practiced by Malaysia for the year 1997 to 2005 are identified and tested to determine each variable relationship with Malaysia import demand for meat. Import demand function that has been used by Aysen-Tanyeri-Abur and Parr Rosssonin (1997) paper titled Forecasting Mexican Import Demand for Diary Products has been adapted. In estimating the demand of import for meat in Malaysia, A double-log-linear functional form (Leamer et ai, 1970) is used as a functional for for the study.

40|$|Soybean is a {{strategic}} commodity {{which is used}} as a raw material for food processing and consumed by most of Indonesian people. National demand cannot be covered by local production, due to imported one. This research indicated that soybean harvested area was influenced by local soybean real price, maize real price and last year harvested area. Soybean productivity was influenced by rainfall, maize real price and last year productivity. Local soybean price was influenced by soybean real price at producer level, imported soybean real price, quantity of imported soybean, productivity and last year soybean real price. Soybean real price at producer level was influenced by soybean production, imported soybean quantity, soybean consumption, BULOG monopoly and last year real price at producer level. Soybean <b>import</b> <b>quantity</b> was influenced by production and consumption. Imported soybean price was influenced by international price, exchange rates, import tariff, and last year import price. Combination policy of increase the soybean price and import tariff 20 % would stimulate the producer to increase harvested area and production. Strategy to increase competitiveness and national soybean production are through productivity improvement and extended planting area programs. The priority to increase the production is to improve productivity and apply suitable technology. Extension of planting area to better region is conducted to increase cropping index. To anticipate trading liberalization negative effect to farmers’ welfare, protection policy by the government is still needed to control international price fluctuation and to strengthen local soybean competitiveness.

40|$|Policy Summary: The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain the natural gas demand {{dynamics}} of Germany and to determine the factors affecting the import of natural gas from Russia. In the existing literature, there are several studies which investigate the demand structure of single sectors (like industry or households), but there is a lack of analysis that tries to explain <b>import</b> <b>quantities</b> as a whole. On the basis of a theoretical discussion, the components of natural gas <b>import</b> <b>quantities</b> have been tested through different time series analysis. We found that the European natural gas and oil prices are co integrated with a time lag of 7 months. We interpret this result as revealing that natural gas is a viable substitute for oil. The time series estimation results support our hypothesis and demonstrate a positive relationship between oil price and natural gas demand. Furthermore, we found that the German industry production level is also an important determinant for natural gas import. In the next step, we used a technologica...|$|R
