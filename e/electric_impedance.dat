To investigate {{the effect of}} the crack on the <b>electric</b> <b>impedance</b> in a convenient fashion, an analytical expression is derived that is correlated to the physical parameters of the crack and the host beam. The beam segment covered with piezoelectric patches and the cracked region are regarded as a bimorph segment and an equivalent spring, respectively, and the entire beam system is then represented by three elastic beam segments and a bimorph segment together with the spring. <b>Electric</b> <b>impedance</b> experiments are also conducted for uncracked beams and for cracked beams with single-edge or double-edge cracks. The experimental results agree with those generated by the analytical expression. The crack depth has little effect on the corresponding mode frequency for cracks located at the mode node of a beam.

Moreover, the closer the crack to the anti-node of the mode, the greater the decrease in the corresponding mode frequency. The mechanism of these changes is discussed.

Methods: During creation of 21 trajectories for stereotactic implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes in the globus pallidus internus or subthalamus (zona incerta or subthalamic nucleus), impedance at 512 kHz and reflected light intensity at 780 nm were measured continuously and simultaneously with a radio frequency electrode containing optical fibres. The signals were compared with anatomy determined from pre- and postoperative MRI and CT. The measurements were performed within minutes and signal analysis was done post-operatively. Results: Reflected light intensity was low from cortex, lateral ventricle, caudate nucleus and putamen. It was intermediate from globus pallidus and thalamus while it was high from subcortical white matter, internal capsule and the subthalamus. The <b>electric</b> <b>impedance</b> was less consistent but generally low in the cortex, intermediate in subcortical white matter, the putamen, the globus pallidus and the thalamus and high in the internal capsule and the subthalamus.
