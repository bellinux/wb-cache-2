40|$|The {{microbial}} {{content of}} dust collected from intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> in six Norwegian nurseries was determined using 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing and plate count analyses. The concentration of endotoxins was also estimated. About 96 % of the sequences {{were classified as}} Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria. At the genus level, about 30 % of sequences from the exhaust filter were classified as bacteria of probable human origin, such as Streptococcus and Corynebacterium species. These were close to absent in intake dust samples (< 1 %). This suggests that occupancy shapes the indoor microbiota, creating an environment relatively rich in genera of potential health significance. There were significantly greater counts of culturable bacteria and fungi in exhaust samples, indicating that passage of air through the nursery causes deterioration in the general air quality. Although there was more endotoxin in exhaust dust, the endotoxin levels per colony forming unit were similar in both samples. This study explores, for the first time, the bacterial composition of ventilation filter dust in Norwegian nurseries, and is important as it reveals what types of microorganisms nursery users are exposed to. In addition to possible direct health issues, {{the nature of our}} early exposure to microbes may be significant in the development of immunological conditions...|$|R

Hiermee kunnen in de toekomst de effecten van het reconstructie beleid in Landbouw Ontwikkelingsgebieden worden gevolgd. Het onderzoek is gericht op het effect van beleidsmaatregelen in het kader van de reconstructie van de veeteeltsector waarbij verdichting van veeteeltbedrijven en toepassing van technische installaties zullen leiden tot veranderingen van de emissies. Metingen in de directe omgeving van het Landbouw Ontwikkelingsgebied De Rips, waar vooral varkenshouderijen zijn gevestigd, toonden een duidelijke bijdrage van stalemissies aan ammoniak. De bijdrage van fijn stof is geringer maar wel waarneembaar. Met dit resultaat wordt de beslissing voor voortzetting van het project onderbouwd en de uitbreiding naar het Landbouw Ontwikkelingsgebied in de Gelderse Vallei (vooral pluimveebedrijven) gerechtvaardigd. Particulate {{matter is}} an {{important}} environmental problem for which abatement measures are being developed to reduce the emissions {{for a number of}} sources categories, including animal farming. A part of this policy the government supports reduction measures for the intensive animal farms, among others <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>filters.</b> In the framework of the reconstruction policy LOGs (Agricultural Development Regions) are selected in which the concentration of farms and the implementation of <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> are combined. To monitor the effect of the measures the Ministry of VROM and the provinces of Noord-Brabant en Gelderland have initiated research to follow the developments in the LOG by measuring concentrations. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has set up a limited monitoring network for ammonia (NH 3) and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2, 5) in the LOG De Rips in Noord-Brabant consisting of three monitorsites. The first evaluation focuses on the applicability of the developed research setup. The impact of NH 3 -emissions in the LOG is clearly discernible in the concentrations measured on the down-wind site (average approximately 60 % of the up-wind concentration) applying a wind directional analysis. A simple wind rose also indicates clearly observable contributions of the emissions in the LOG. For PM 10 and PM 2, 5 the wind directional analysis approach is necessary, in the wind rose the contribution from the LOG is obscured by a contribution from the southeast (probably large scale) and other sources of PM. The results support the expectation that the developments in the LOG can be monitored and carry the decision to continue the project and setup the monitoring network in the LOG in the Gelderse Vallei in Gelderland, using an identical setup. To allow the interpretation of the observed concentrations the activities in the LOG need to be registered. A protocol is currently being developed in collaboration with the provinces and the involved authorities (municipalities, local trade organizations and individual businesses. ...|$|R

50|$|It {{is nearly}} {{impossible}} for a practical <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> to completely remove all ultrafine particles from a dirt-laden airstream. An ultra-efficient <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> will immediately clog up and become ineffective during everyday use, and practical filters are a compromise between filtering effectiveness and restriction of airflow. One way to sidestep this problem is to <b>exhaust</b> partially <b>filtered</b> <b>air</b> to the outdoors, which is a design feature of some central vacuum systems. Specially engineered portable vacuums may also utilize this design, but are more awkward {{to set up and}} use, requiring temporary installation of a separate exhaust hose to an exterior window.|$|R
40|$|Biofilters are an {{effective}} and economically feasible technique for mitigating odor and other gaseous emissions from livestock production systems. They consist of a media containing a biofilm, where microorganisms break down compounds in livestock building <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> into energy and nutrients for growth and reproduction. In addition to capital costs, continuous <b>filtering</b> of <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> from mechanically ventilated buildings can be expensive and not always required, if odor is considered nuisance; thus, an automated control system was designed to <b>filter</b> odorous <b>air</b> when surrounding neighbors {{are most likely to}} be impacted and bypass the biofilter when odor impact potential is low. This ON/OFF control strategy can reduce energy usage by operating exhaust fans more efficiently at lower static pressures, when no filtering is required. The Impact Based Odor Control System (IBOCS) monitors wind speed and direction, dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, and insolation to assess atmospheric stability and utilizes the location of neighbors relative to a facility to determine if <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> requires <b>filtering.</b> An Arduino stored in a weatherproof housing served as the main control by recording sensor measurements, neighbor locations, storing data on a flash card, and activating louvers to bypass or <b>filter</b> the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air.</b> The user interface consisted of an eight-direction toggle switch indicator (relative neighbor location), on/off switch, automatic/manual switch to override IBOCS, and open/close buttons for use in manual operation. IBOCS was field tested for two years at a commercial swine finishing facility in central Iowa with encouraging results for reducing biofilter operational time. The overall goal of IBOCS is to reduce odor impact to nearby receptors via removing odor from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> and concurrently decrease operational expenses of the mitigation technology...|$|R

40|$|A {{multifunction}} lid {{has been}} developed for a commercially available transparent animal cage which permits feeding, watering, viewing, long-term holding, and local transport of laboratory rodents on experiment while isolating the surrounding environment. The cage is airtight except for its inlet and <b>exhaust</b> high-efficiency particulate <b>air</b> <b>filters,</b> and it is completely steam-sterilizable. Opening of the cage's feed and water ports causes an inrush of high velocity air which prevents back-migration of aerosols and permits feeding and watering while eliminating need for chemical vapor decontamination. Ventilation system design permits the holding in adjacent cages of animals infected with different organisms without danger of cross-contamination; leaves the animal room odor-free; reduces required bedding changes to twice a month or less, and provides investigators with capability to control precisely individual cage ventilation rates. Forty-eight cages can be conveniently placed on a standard NIH “shoebox” cage rack (60 inches wide × 28 inches deep × 74 inches high) fitted with a simple manifold exhaust system.

40|$|If a {{building}} is heated by a heat pump, {{it is of}} high importance that the heat pump has a high coefficient of performance. An <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> heat pump extracts heat from the building’s <b>exhaust</b> <b>air.</b> The air has a relatively high and constant temperature all year around, leading to a high seasonal coefficient of performance.
