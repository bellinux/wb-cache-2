A cover-letter from CRS's Chief of Party, Jared M. Hoffman claims that [...] "The comprehensive and accurate information on prevention contained in this material is consistent with CRS policy, and {{we are confident that}} the <b>flipchart</b> will be useful in all settings, requiring only minor adaptations to ensure cultural competence.” However, even though Hoffman claims that the <b>flipchart</b> is consistent with CRS policy, he also notes that [...] "“CRS has chosen not to include the CRS or AIDSRelief logo on the <b>flipchart,</b> due to the potential sensitivity of the information contained in these materials among Church partners.” Not only does the <b>flipchart</b> promote condom use as a means of preventing the transmission of HIV (in contradiction with Catholic moral teaching), but it also promotes artificial birth control, also in conflict with Catholic moral teaching. The <b>flipchart</b> says on page 132, [...] "If the client and partner do not want to have a baby, explain that you can give them information about family planning choices." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} known patent of a <b>flipchart</b> is from May 8, 1913. Flip charts have {{being in}} use from the 1900s, the earliest recorded {{use of a}} flip chart is a photo from 1912 of John Henry Patterson (1844-1922), NCR’s CEO while addressing the 100 Point Club {{standing next to a}} pair of flip charts on casters. The <b>flipchart</b> we know (on a small whiteboard) was invented by Peter Kent in the 1970s. Peter Kent was the founder and CEO of the visual communications group Nobo plc, and it is believed that they were the first company to put the large pieces of paper over whiteboards, rather than over other materials.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} prototype, simultaneous, multi-input {{whiteboard}} techniques {{were developed in}} June 2006. These ideas were first exhibited at the NECC, Atlanta, in July 2007 and many were included under the product name 'Activarena' within Activstudio and Activprimary versions 3.5 (released Sept 2007). New features included shared concept mapping and dual <b>flipcharting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Activprimary {{provides}} {{a suite of}} ‘interactive whiteboard centric’ tools.

50|$|The use of {{the term}} 'flipchart' in {{describing}} these electronic documents derives from the similarity in the way a physical <b>flipchart</b> is commonly used, effectively starting with a set of 'blank canvas' pages upon which to present. The very early versions of Activstudio had a much reduced functionality set, comprising simple pens, highlighters and page turning and hence the analogy with 'flipcharts' was born and has remained.|$|E
40|$|Technology {{has changed}} the way that {{educators}} are able to present curriculum to students across grade levels and throughout the educational landscape. Advancements in technology have given special education teachers new ways to present material that meets kinesthetic, visual, and auditory learners specific needs at the same time. This project looked at how Promethean technology {{can be used in}} order to support students with moderate/severe needs. Specific interactive Promethean <b>flipcharts</b> were designed that correlate to four students IEP goals. In addition, an instructional manual was developed by the researcher in order to assist and encourage other special education teachers to begin developing Promethean <b>flipcharts</b> for their specific students. When utilized correctly Promethean technology gives educators the ability to develop and individualize digital curriculum and present it to students on a large interactive whiteboard (ActivBoard).

Collaboration tools can be either of non-technological nature such as paper, <b>flipchart,</b> post-it notes or whiteboard, purely based on computer systems such as Memex or, which is more common these days, enabled through complex and often web-based collaborative software like Wiki or SharePoint that perfectly integrate in an agile work environment and make us more efficient.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{restaurants}} {{use only}} text in their menus. In other cases, restaurants include illustrations and photos, {{either of the}} dishes or of {{an element of the}} culture which is associated with the restaurant. An example of the latter is in cases where a Lebanese kebab restaurant decorates its menu with photos of Lebanese mountains and beaches. Particularly with the ancillary menu types, the menu may be provided in alternative formats, because these menus (other than wine lists) tend to be much shorter than food menus. For example, an appetizer menu or a dessert menu may be displayed on a folded paper table tent, a hard plastic table stand, a <b>flipchart</b> style wooden [...] "table stand," [...] or even, {{in the case of a}} pizza restaurant with a limited wine selection, a wine list glued to an empty bottle.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, Promethean {{released}} ActivInspire {{which can}} be used for free. [...] This software package now uses the new 'flipchart' file format ending in the file extension '.flipchart'. ActivInspire can open the older '.flp' format but it can only save in the new '.flipchart' format. This results in ActivInspire's files from no longer being backwards compatible. [...] In other words, Activstudio (and Activprimary) cannot open the <b>flipcharts</b> created by ActivInspire.|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{evaluating}} {{the effects of}} using a <b>flipchart</b> as an educational intervention in improving maternal self-efficacy in breastfeeding. Methods: a quasi-experimental study with 41 postpartum women: Intervention Group (n = 20) and Control Group (n = 21) of a public hospital. The intervention consisted of implementing the <b>flipchart</b> “I can breastfeed my baby” in the immediate postpartum and were contacted by telephone after 15 days. For both groups, Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form was applied at baseline and after 30 days. Results: before the intervention, the intervention group was 75 % with high self-efficacy and 71 % of the mothers {{in the control group}} of had high self-efficacy. It was found that after educational intervention, all the mothers in the intervention group showed high self-efficacy, while the percentage remained similar to before in the control group (76 %). Conclusion: the <b>flipchart</b> had a positive effect on the elevation of self-efficacy in nursing mothers...|$|E

It can take {{a very long time}} to build a good reputation within a FOSS project and to gain enough trust to be allowed to change work processes. We already had a basic trusting relationship with project members hence the bonding period could be minimized and allowed us to conduct the AR within a reasonable time frame. If one has direct access to people and artefacts, e.g., whiteboards and <b>flipcharts,</b> discussions can be done in a shorter time as well and it is easier to acquire all material used in the discussion for later analysis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In practice, most {{creativity}} {{techniques are}} still performed with traditional tools, such as pen and paper, whiteboards, and <b>flipcharts.</b> When transforming these techniques into a digital environment, {{the reduction of}} organizational overhead is the main goal to foster accessibility. Still, {{we do not know}} if overhead reduction fosters creativity or if it eliminates {{an important part of the}} creative process. To get a deeper understanding of these effects, we compare the performance of the creativity technique SIS (Systematic Integration of Solution Elements) in a traditional setting with a setup based on multiple interactive surfaces. By using a mix of diverse evaluation methods, we show how the use of a digital interactive creativity room can really foster creativity and produce better results...|$|R
