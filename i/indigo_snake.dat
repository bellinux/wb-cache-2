5|$|Sea turtles nest {{on island}} beaches in the park. Park staff {{actively}} assist turtle nesting by removing debris from beaches that might pose {{an obstacle to}} adults and hatchlings. Loggerhead turtles {{are the most common}} sea turtle species and account for nearly all of the turtle nests in the park. Nest sites are identified by daily morning beach patrols and are protected with mesh screen against the predation by abundant raccoon population. Nest protection efforts have reduced predation from 100% of nests disturbed per year to no disturbed nests in 2007, with a more usual average of more than 50% nest disturbance in most years. In 2012 one undisturbed nest was found and protected, five partially disturbed nests were protected, and one nest was destroyed by predators. The threatened eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snake</b> is also present on the island.|$|E
25|$|Reptiles: eastern diamondback and pygmy rattlesnakes, gopher tortoise, {{green and}} {{leatherback}} sea turtles, and eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snake.</b> In 2012, {{there were about}} one million American alligators and 1,500 crocodiles.|$|E
500|$|Coastal lowlands, or wet prairies, are {{salt water}} marshes that absorb marine water {{when it gets}} high or fresh water when rains are heavy. Floods occur during {{hurricane}} and tropical storm surges when ocean water can rise several feet over the land. Heavy wet seasons also cause floods when rain from the north flows into the Everglades. Few trees can survive in the conditions of this region, but plants—succulents like saltwort and glasswort—tolerate salt, brackish water, and desert conditions. [...] Animal life in this zone is dependent upon {{the amount of water}} present, but commonly found animals include Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), Everglades snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), [...] wood stork (Mycteria americana), eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snake</b> (Drymarchon couperi), and small mammals such as rats, mice, and rabbits.|$|E
50|$|Eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> {{frequent}} flatwoods, hammocks, dry glades, stream bottoms, cane fields, riparian thickets, {{and high}} ground with well-drained, sandy soils. In Georgia, eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> prefer excessively drained, deep sandy soils along major streams, {{as well as}} xeric sandridge habitats. Xeric slash pine plantations seem to be preferred over undisturbed longleaf pine habitats. Habitat selection varies seasonally. From December to April, eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> prefer sandhill habitats; from May to July the snakes shift from winter dens to summer territories; from August through November they are located more frequently in shady creek bottoms than during other seasons.|$|R
