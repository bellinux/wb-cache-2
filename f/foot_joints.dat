2500|$|The {{husbandry}} system of water buffalo {{depends on the}} purpose {{for which they are}} bred and maintained. Most of them are kept by people who work on small farms in family units. Their buffalo live in very close association with them, and are often their greatest capital asset. The women and girls in India generally look after the milking buffalo while the men and boys are concerned with the working animals. Throughout Asia, they are commonly tended by children who are often seen leading or riding their charges to wallowing places. Water buffalo are the ideal animals for work in the deep mud of paddy fields because of their large hooves and flexible <b>foot</b> <b>joints.</b> They are often referred to as [...] "the living tractor of the East". It probably is possible to plough deeper with buffalo than with either oxen or horses. They are the most efficient and economical means of cultivation of small fields. In most rice-producing countries, they are used for threshing and for transporting the sheaves during the rice harvest. They provide power for oilseed mills, sugarcane presses, and devices for raising water. They are widely used as pack animals, and in India and Pakistan also for heavy haulage. In their invasions of Europe, the Turks used buffalo for hauling heavy battering rams. Their dung is used as a fertilizer, and as a fuel when dried.|$|E

50|$|The design {{principles}} of foot orthoses are founded on {{knowledge of the}} functional anatomy of the foot. Pronation of the foot is triplanar. The axis of rotation in the <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> is not perpendicular {{to any of the}} cardinal planes (sagittal, horizontal, frontal) of the human body. The triplanar motion of the foot postulates that blocking of any one component of triplanar motion in a single cardinal plane prevents movement in the other two planes as well. This all-or-nothing rule is the premise for orthotic posting or wedging.|$|E
5000|$|Foot orthoses {{comprise}} a custom made insert or footbed fitted into a shoe. Commonly {{referred to as}} [...] "orthotics" [...] these orthoses provide support for the foot by redistributing ground reaction forces as well as realigning <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> while standing, walking or running. A great body of information exists within the orthotic literature describing the sciences that {{might be used to}} aid people with foot problems as well as the impact [...] "orthotics" [...] can have on foot, knee, hip, and spine deformities. They are used by everyone from athletes to the elderly to accommodate biomechanical deformities and a variety of soft tissue inflammatory conditions such as plantar fasciitis. They may also be used in conjunction with properly fitted orthopaedic footwear in the prevention of foot ulcers in the at-risk diabetic foot.|$|E
50|$|Rocker soles may replace regular soles on any {{style of}} footwear. Some rocker bottom shoes are purpose built {{to reduce the}} {{function}} or replace the lost function of a joint. For example, {{a person with a}} hallux rigidus (stiff big toe) may use a rocker bottom shoe to replace the flexion lost at the metatarsal joint. Rocker bottom shoes are also used to compensate for the lost range of motion, however caused, at the tibiotalar joint (ankle joint). In such cases, the wearer maintains solid and stable footing while standing, but the rock of the heel assists with the propulsive phase of gait, making walking more natural and less painful to the affected joints. Beneficiaries of this type of sole modification include people suffering from arthritis or any other disorder or injury causing pain and/or loss of motion in <b>foot</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Pastoral pipes {{gradually}} {{evolved into}} the Union pipes as Baroque musical tastes favoured a more expressive type of instrument. [...] The foot joint may have fallen out of use {{as early as the}} 1746-1770's [...] as oboists of the period, who usually played Pastoral pipes, would frequently removed or invert the foot joint in order to remove the low C# foot joint to play the chanter upon the knee,.

5000|$|Moses Kellow, who {{was born}} in on 5 June 1862 at Delabole, Cornwall, close to one of the largest slate {{quarries}} in Britain. His parents moved to Caernarfon some three years later, and besides his school education, his father trained him in engineering and geology. By the age of 20, around 1882, he was managing Parc Quarry. Slate in the Blaenau Ffestiniog region is generally found in veins which slope downwards at an acute angle from the horizontal, resulting in the quarries being underground once the initial surface rock has been removed. The veins are separated by layers of harder rock, often granite or chert, which are called [...] "hards". The slate vein worked at Parc Quarry was about 121 ft thick, and sloped downwards at about 42 degrees. Unusually, the pillaring line, one of the planes in which rock can be split, was almost horizontal rather than vertical, and the <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> did not run in a suitable direction to detach slate blocks from the floor of a chamber. Additionally, the rock above the vein was not hard enough to support the roof of large chambers. Because of this, Kellow's father, William, decided in 1880 to work the quarry from the bottom upwards, rather than adopting the more normal practice of working from the top downwards.|$|E

Quantifying this error is needed to evaluate the accuracy of this model. This study validated the MSFM against bi-planar radiostereometric analysis (RSA) fluoroscopy. Heel-strike, mid-stance, and toe-off events during the stance phase were compared between motion capture and fluoroscopy. Rise/drop of the medial longitudinal arch showed a significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) during toe-off, but no significant difference during heel-strike or mid-stance. Hindfoot supination/pronation and internal/external rotation, and forefoot supination/pronation motions showed {{no significant difference between the}} two techniques. The lack of significant difference will allow the MSFM to be used as a sufficiently accurate technique for measuring <b>foot</b> <b>joint</b> motions...|$|R

Foot kinematic data calculated from the approximated equations, which were represented by the correlation between moment and angular displacement, and the data from motion analysis were very similar. We found that the movements of <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> were mainly decided by the passive characteristics of the joints when ground reaction force acts.

40|$|Abstract Background In 3 D gait analysis, {{kinematics}} of the <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> {{are usually}} reported via isolated time histories of joint rotations and no information is provided {{on the relationship}} between rotations at different joints. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify movement coordination patterns in the foot during walking by expanding an existing vector coding technique according to an established multi-segment foot and ankle model. A graphical representation is also described to summarise the coordination patterns of joint rotations across multiple patients. Methods Three-dimensional multi-segment foot kinematics were recorded in 13 adults during walking. A modified vector coding technique was used to identify coordination patterns between <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> involving calcaneus, midfoot, metatarsus and hallux segments. According to the type and direction of joints rotations, these were classified as in-phase (same direction), anti-phase (opposite directions), proximal or distal joint dominant. Results In early stance, 51 to 75 % of walking trials showed proximal-phase coordination between <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> comprising the calcaneus, midfoot and metatarsus. In-phase coordination was more prominent in late stance, reflecting synergy in the simultaneous inversion occurring at multiple <b>foot</b> <b>joints.</b> Conversely, a distal-phase coordination pattern was identified for sagittal plane motion of the ankle relative to the midtarsal joint, highlighting the critical role of arch shortening to locomotor function in push-off. Conclusions This study has identified coordination patterns between movement of the calcaneus, midfoot, metatarsus and hallux by expanding an existing vector cording technique for assessing and classifying coordination patterns of <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> rotations during walking. This approach provides a different perspective in the analysis of multi-segment foot kinematics, and may be used for the objective quantification of the alterations in foot joint coordination patterns due to lower limb pathologies or following injuries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A computer-graphics based biomechanical {{model was}} {{constructed}} {{to investigate the}} kinematics of <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> during the stance-phase of walking. In the model, all joints were assumed to act as monocentric, single degree of freedom hinge joints. To obtain the inputs to the model, the motion of foot segments was captured during the gait by a four-camera video system. The model fitted in an individual subject was simulated with these motion data. The ranges of motion of the first tarsometatarsal joint and the first metatarsophanlangeal joint were 8 ∼ 13 and- 13 ∼ 48 respectively. The kinematic data of joints {{were similar to those}} of the previous studies. Our method based on the graphical computer model is considered useful for kinematic analysis of small joints including <b>foot</b> <b>joints.</b> Also, the results of this study will provide important information to the biomechanical studies which deal with human gait...|$|E

30|$|More {{and more}} {{research}} interests have {{been devoted to}} the study of column in heritage buildings in recent years. Friction-sliding seismic isolation model has been proposed and the slippage criterion of a column foot is given [12]. It is assumed that the moment carried by the column foot is the same as that at the column head, and restoring moment at the column foot is determined according to the analytical moment at the top of column [13]. Lee et al. [14] proposes a technique for obtaining the skeleton curve of moment–rotation relation at the stone base of traditional timber buildings from local compression tests of wooden components. Those studies mainly focused on the friction-sliding characteristics, restoring moment of column head and stiffness characteristics of column. However, study on the whole process of column rocking under external loads is rare, and the rotational behaviors of column <b>foot</b> <b>joint</b> during rocking have not been studied. Furthermore, a recent trend in analyzing timber structures involves considering the timber connections as semi-rigid joints. But, few researches have focused on the semi-rigidity of column <b>foot</b> <b>joint</b> in traditional timer structure, and many studies take column foot as rigid or hinge joint during structural analysis. In fact, the rotation behavior of column foot needs to be better known to properly analyze the whole structure, and there is an urgent to study the mechanical behavior and propose a theoretical model for predicting the restoring moment and the rotational performance of column <b>foot</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} inflammatory abnormalities of the hand, wrist and <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> in SLE patients by US and to correlate them with clinical, laboratory and disease activity score parameters. Methods. Sixty-two consecutive SLE patients {{were enrolled in the}} present study and underwent clinical evaluation, laboratory tests and bilateral high-resolution US of the hand, wrist and <b>foot</b> <b>joints.</b> Joint effusion (JE), synovial hypertrophy (SH) and local pathological vascularization [power Doppler (PD) ] were evaluated according to both a dichotomous score and a semi-quantitative (0 - 3) grading system. In addition, a global US score was calculated by summing the values given to each elementary lesion for every single joint and every joint group. US findings were correlated with physical examination, serological parameters (CRP, ANA, anti-dsDNA, ENA, aPL, C 3 and C 4 serum levels) and disease activity indexes (SLEDAI- 2 K, ECLAM). Results. US detected inflammatory joint abnormalities in 54 / 62 patients (87. 1 %); 72. 6 % presented involvement of the MTP joints, 46. 7 % the MCP joints, 19. 3 % the PIP joints and 53 % the wrists. A total of 1984 joints were examined highlighting JE in 19. 1 % of cases, SH in 6. 9 % and positive PD in 1. 1 %. The global US inflammatory score had a mean value of 10. 9 (S. D. 15. 2). No correlations were found between US findings and SLE disease activity parameters. Conclusion. US demonstrated a high prevalence of inflammatory joint abnormalities in SLE that were also present in asymptomatic patients. Interestingly, the <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> were the most frequently involved. US is a valuable tool for detecting subclinical synovitis in SLE. © The Author 2013.

40|$|Background Foot pain in {{patients}} diagnosed with early rheumatoid arthritis is common. Objectives To investigate effects of off-the-shelf foot orthoses on outcomes of swollen and tender joints, and pain, {{in patients}} with early rheumatoid arthritis. Methods Thirty-five patients with painful and swollen <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> were recruited. None had previously used foot orthoses or had contraindications to their use. Any patients with concomitant musculoskeletal disease, endocrine disorders, and neurological disease, were excluded. At baseline, participants were prescribed a customised off-the-shelf foot orthosis with chair-side modifications. Data was collected at baseline, three and six months. Foot pain (using Visual Analogue Scale) {{and the number of}} tender and swollen <b>foot</b> <b>joints</b> was measured. Results There was a trend towards a {{reduction in the number of}} swollen and tender joints by 3 months with a further improvement by 6 months. Statistically (p< 0. 05) and clinically significant reductions in pain levels was also noted. Conclusion Patients diagnosed with early RA may benefit from using off-the-shelf foot orthoses with the majority of their pain reduction occurring within the first 3 months of use, but with some small further symptomatic improvement up to 6 months. Their was a tendency to a reduction in swollen and tender joints although more studies are required to substantiate these findings...|$|E
