The proposed techniques {{are based on the}} system identification theory which consists on heuristically determining an analytical model using physical insights and measurements. More precisely, this paper validates models as a tool for the identification of the system's temperature. This is done through the understanding of the physical insights of this type of structures and based on numerical simulations and laboratory representative tests...|$|E
40|$|Smoked {{vacuum-packed}} trout fillets {{have won}} {{importance in the}} market {{over the last few}} years, especially because of the increasing production in aqua cultures. According to the fish regulations (Fischhygiene-Verordnung 1994) fish processing facturies have to establish the principles of the HACCP-system for this potentially hazardous product. Similar control-plans were laid down also for the food trade in the ordinance about food hygiene (Lebensmittelhygiene-Verordnung 1997). Here, the most important control point is the maintenance of the cold chain according to the <b>declared</b> <b>temperature</b> in order to control the multiplying of spoiling bacteria and pathogenous microorganisms. The aim of the thesis was to estimate the hazard of insufficient cold storage. First, this study determines the hygienic state of smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets that were taken from fish processing plants, wholesale trade and retail markets. Then, the storage temperatures in chilled cabinets of food handling establishments were controlled by long-term measurements. Afterwards, challenge tests were carried out in order to assess the influence of different temperature conditions on the product quality and shelf life. The hazard caused by growth of L. monocytogenes and toxin production of Cl. botlinum was discussed. The results are summarized as follows: 1.) The median for the total aerobic bacterial count of 28 samples taken in fish processing plants was log 3, 10 cfu/g. The market anlysis of 44 samples bought in wholesale trade and 76 samples bought in retail shops showed a median of log 6, 38 cfu/g (wholesale) and log 6, 80 cfu/g (retail) for the total count. The predominant spoilage bacteria belonged to the group of lactic acid bacteria and Pseudomonas spp., followed by coliform bacteria and yeasts. 2.) L. monocytogenes was isolated in 43 (31 %) smoked trouts from wholesale trade and retail markets. 42 % of the L. monocytogenes-positive samples showed levels between log 2 and log 4 L. monocytogenes/g, in 12 % of the samples levels of more than log 4 L. monocytogenes/g were detected. 3.) The long-term measurements of the storage temperature proved insufficient cooling in 9 of 12 chilled cabinets. On the one hand the storage temperature remained constant over the whole period of time but exceeded the <b>declared</b> <b>temperature</b> partly extreme. In other hand the smoked trout fillets were stored at extremely varying temperatures. The labeled storage temperature was mainly exceeded during the defrosting period. Furthermore, the long-term determination showed that neither spot checks of the storage temperature by single measurement nor integrated displays provide meaningful results, because the defrosting can not be recorded. 4.) A high total bacterial load (> log 6 cfu/g) was reached at 3, 5 °C after 3 weeks storing of commercially produced smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets. A comparable result was attained within 8 days when the samples were stored at 11 °C. In samples stored at 6 °C, interrupted by one-hour storage at 11 °C, the limit of log 5 cfu/g was exceeded between the fifth and eighth day of storage. The minimum shelf life at a constant temperature of 4 °C should be fixed upon 14 days. 5.) Within the usual labeled shelf life of more than 3 weeks L. monocytogenes and Cl. botulinum will grow to high levels or produce toxin in smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets, if temperature abuse occurs (f. e., storage temperature of 10 °C). Therefore, for this potentially hazardous product a maximum storage temperature of 4 °C has to be settled. This indicates also a contribution to consumer protection. Furthermore, it is concluded from {{the results of this study}} that the trade has to be more responsible for the control point "storage temperature". <br...|$|E
40|$|At the 2015 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) {{meeting in}} Paris, {{participants}} in a new international climate agreement will volunteer Nationally Determined Contributions to emissions reductions. To put the planet on a path to <b>declared</b> <b>temperature</b> goals, the growth of global greenhouse gas emissions must cease, and begin to decline, by 2035 to 2040; however, the expected contributions do not yield results consistent with this timeline. Three achievements in Paris and follow-on activities are then crucial components of the new climate regime: a robust system of review with widely accepted measures of national effort; an established, durable plan of future pledge cycles; and increased financial support for the mitigation efforts of less developed countries. The MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model is applied to assess emissions outcomes of expected pledges and national performances in meeting them, and to elaborate the components of a successful launch.

30|$|Flexible {{electronic}} devices have recently attracted tremendous attention {{due to their}} facile interaction long-term monitoring capabilities [1 – 5]. They {{become one of the}} most prospective electrical sensors due to the advantages such as light weight, portable, excellent electrical properties, and high integration [6 – 11]. Indubitably, nanomaterials play irreplaceable role in flexible sensors due to their outstanding properties, for instance small sizes, surface effect, and quantum tunneling effect [12 – 14]. Based on resonant tunneling effect of nanomaterials, many researches focus on piezoresistive strain sensors whose resistances change with deformation [15 – 17]. One of the key applications of the soft strain sensors is flexible electronic skin, so multi-fictionalizations are the development trend of the sensors.

The span between purchase and "best before" date of pre-packs was investigated sensorically {{in order to get}} a not yet representative insight into the quality level, during their remaining life, of a number of new foods brought from the trade and found increasingly on the market. Nutritive value, enjoyment value and usefulness determine their properties. The enjoyment value, i. e. shape, colour, smell, taste and consistency, is of particular interest to the customer. Even with a relatively low designated traffic limit, which allows noticeable impairments of the sensory properties and slight faults, only a few of the product batches investigated reached the "best before" (minimum durability) date without clear losses of their enjoyment value. The majority of the foods investigated had an overstreched "best before" dating.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The maximum {{temperature}} experienced by biomass during combustion {{has a strong}} effect on chemical properties of the resulting charcoal, such as sorption capacity (water and nonpolar materials) and microbial degradability. However, information about the formation temperature of natural charcoal {{can be difficult to}} obtain in ecosystems that are not instrumented prior to fires. Benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) are molecular markers specific for pyrogenic carbon (PyC) which can provide information on the degree of aromatic condensation in charcoals. Here we apply the BPCA molecular marker method to a set of 10 charcoals produced during an experimental fire in a Pitch pine−scrub oak forest from litter and bark of pitch pine and inkberry plants in the Pinelands National Reserve in New Jersey, USA. We deployed temperature-sensitive crayons throughout the burn site, which recorded the maximum air temperature and made comparisons to the degree of thermal alteration recorded by BPCA molecular markers. Our results show an increase of the degree of aromatic condensation with monitored temperatures for bark biomass, while for needles no clear trend could be observed. For leaf-derived charcoals at increasing monitored fire temperatures, decreasing degree of aromatic condensation was obtained. This suggests that molecular markers can be used to roughly estimate the maximum fire temperatures experienced by bark and wood materials, but not based on leaf- and needle-derived materials. Possible applications include verifying <b>declared</b> pyrolysis <b>temperatures</b> of biochars and evaluating ecosystem fire temperature postburn. 1...|$|R
40|$|In nano-medicine, {{attempts}} {{of using the}} carbon-nanotubes (CNTs) as drug-carriers are undertaken especially {{in the treatment of}} cancer. These (CNTs) are first injected into the blood which then reach the tumor cite under the actions of the waves propagated by the walls of the arteries with an external force such as a magnetic field or laser beams. The flow near the boundary of the artery may be treated as a boundary layer flow only for simplification as we consider here. In applied science, the flow and heat transfer of CNTs are usually described by systems of nonlinear differential equations. Due to nonlinearities, the exact solutions of such systems cannot be obtained in most cases. In this paper, an effective analytical procedure is proposed to deduce the exact solution of a system of nonlinear differential equations describing the effect of a convective heat condition on the flow and the heat transfer of carbon-nanotube suspended nanofluids with suction/injection {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. The heat transfer equation is solved via applying Laplace transform and the solution is expressed in terms of the generalized incomplete gamma function. Also, it is proved that the present exact solutions for the flow and the heat transfer reduce to those in literature in the absence of the suction/injection and the convective parameters. The results <b>declare</b> that the <b>temperature</b> profiles are very sensitive regarding the value assigned to the convective parameter. Moreover, the effects of other physical parameters on the studied phenomena are displayed through graphs. Besides, possible applications of the current results have been also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The current index, IPS, {{developed}} for benthic diatoms {{and used for}} assigning the ecological status of streams in Sweden reflects on levels of nutrients and organic pollution. Metals are not considered in the index, {{which leads to the}} risk that metal contaminated streams can be assigned a high ecological status based on this index. Thus, an index that take into consideration the impact of metals in streams should be developed. In order to develop such an index, knowledge about if factors such as temperature and phosphorus affects metal toxicity to benthic diatoms could be useful. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if temperature and phosphorus affects the toxicity of Zn to benthic diatoms. Several laboratory experiments were performed with diatoms isolated from Swedish streams. The hypothesis was that temperatures above 20 °C would elevate toxic effects caused by Zn, which was partly confirmed. High temperatures (30 - 32 °C) caused a decrease in number of cells and in the maximum efficiency of the photosystem II in the highest concentration of Zn tested. The values of the approximate EC 50 for each temperature and the amount of fluorescence per cells did however not show that temperature impact the toxicity of Zn. Thus, conclusively not all parameters investigated <b>declared</b> that <b>temperature</b> impacts the toxicity of Zn, but since some of them did, it cannot be said that temperature does not impact the toxicity of Zn. The hypothesis for the impact of phosphorus on Zn toxicity was that a higher concentration of phosphorus would increase tolerance to Zn and consequently lower concentrations of phosphorus was thought to increase the toxicity of Zn. The phosphorus effects were partly in-line with the hypothesis. The highest concentration of phosphorus tested caused a decrease in toxicity, detected as a higher median value of EC 50 and as a higher amount of fluorescence in the highest concentration of Zn for most strains in one experiment. However, the lower amount of phosphorus only increased the toxicity, detected as a lower amount of fluorescence, in the highest concentration of Zn tested in two of the strains in one experiment. The results regarding the impact of phosphorus on Zn toxicity was not consistent in the experiments performed. However this study indicated that phosphorus and temperature could impact the toxicity of Zn. Therefore, in order to develop an index that reflect on the levels of metals more studies should be done to establish if temperature and phosphorus in fact impact the toxicity of Zn...|$|R
40|$|Estimating {{thermal effect}} of so called double-skin façades on energy {{performance}} of buildings with two envelopes, a proprietary mathematical model of heat trans-fer through double-skin façades has been developed. A very specific {{approach of the}} mathematical model presented here is based on prediction of the double-skin façades interspace temperature and assumption that façade could {{be treated as a}} single one <b>declaring</b> the interspace <b>temperature</b> and reduced intensity of solar radiation as the “outdoor ” conditions. In this paper results of the heating and cooling loads as well as the interspace temperature prediction compared for three months (January, April, and July) and for the west oriented façade with ordinary and absorption glass are presented. Façade is placed under climatic conditions of Belgrade (45 ° north latitude). Also, results for weather conditions of sunny and cloudy day are shown. Results includes influence of air velocity in interspace of façades for April and July. Following a type of the double-skin façade construction assumption it was implied that the space between the two envelopes is closed during the winter mode for air circulation, in order to have temperature higher inside than outside and opposite in the summer mode, air inlet and outlet are opened in order to prevent much higher temperatures than the outside ones, and higher cooling load of an air-conditioned building, as a consequence. Taking only thermal effects into account, presented prediction has proven that double-skin façades decrease both building heat losses and heat gains throughout the year, and give significant contribution to the building energy consumption savings.
