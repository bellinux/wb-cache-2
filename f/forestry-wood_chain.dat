One way to do this is through scanning technique and computerized process control systems, and one emerging scanning technique for the wood industry is X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning.|$|E
40|$|Timber and {{furniture}} {{industry is a}} very important economic sector in Italy, it imports a large amount of timber despite the country is covered by extensive forests. Further, the alpine region presents an increase of the forests in lands once used by agricultural activities. Consequently the improved availability of hardwood from spontaneous regenerating process could provide industrial roundwood. An interdisciplinary project was undertaken to study the potential of these forests with regard to the sustainability of the short <b>forestry-wood</b> <b>chain</b> for the furnishing production together local designers and industries. Furnishing requirements of ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) wood were evaluated, focusing to physical and aesthetical behaviour after ageing. Technological tests like bonding, were performed. In order to evaluate the sustainability of the whole supply chain, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of pieces of furniture (school desk and chair) made with certified wood was performed. The aim was to quantify the benefits coming from eco-design solutions and short supply chain provision of the wood and to identify further improvement possibilities. The short supply chain ensures a more sustainable use of hardwood compared to long distance imports or other uses of local wood (e. g. burning). Moreover, the eco-design of furniture for schools can {{be a good way to}} find a market for the wood products through Green Public Procurement (GPP). The good technological characteristics and the environmental profile of the furniture supply chain indicate that these hardwoods can be improved by a short <b>forestry-wood</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>forestry-wood</b> <b>chain</b> today {{involves}} many actors, and {{the decisions}} taken {{in the process of}} making trees into finished products are so many that the effect of each individual decision is difficult to assess, especially if the natural variation of the input material is considered. This means that a simulation approach to the <b>forestry-wood</b> <b>chain</b> is suitable, since it makes it possible to evaluate the effects of decisions in a short timeframe, while the input material can be kept constant for different production setups. The long term aim is to connect tree and log properties to the quality of a final product through simulation, depending on the various operations involved in making the product. A part of this is realized through this thesis. It is shown that a simulation model of a cross-cutting and finger-jointing process is representative of a real process. The model is used to evaluate an adaptive strategy for setting the safety zone size between finger-joints and sound knots, a strategy which improves recovery in a finger-jointing operation by 3 %. Another issue addressed in this thesis is that of simulation input data. The sawing simulation tool used to a large extent in research today, Saw 2003, usesthe Swedish Pine Stem Bank as input data. This is a very well-documented datasource, and computed tomography (CT) scanning of the stem bank logs allows wood features such as knots to be represented in a realistic way in Saw 2003. There are limitations to the stem bank, however, mostly {{due to the fact that}} CT scanning is a time consuming process, which means that the amount of scanned logs is relatively small. In this thesis, it is shown that it is possible to use a small amount of log features for determining the knot structure in a log, which opens up possibilities for using industrial data from two-directional X-ray scanners. This would increase the amount of logs to be used as simulation input data. A second set of data used for simulation was also collected in a study of a production process, where the wood raw material was followed from the logyard through all production operations of making finger-jointed furniture components. Each individual piece of wood was traced through the operations, thus ensuring a link between the properties of logs and those of the finished product. This second data set was collected by grey-scale camera scanning of boards prior to cross-cutting and finger-jointing, and was used in the development of cross-cutting and finger-jointing simulation. It contains information on non-clearwood features of the board surfaces such as knots, cracks, and pitch pockets. It can be concluded from this thesis that it is possible to increase bothfunctionality and the amount of input data in the simulation of the <b>forestry-wood</b> <b>chain,</b> and by doing so production strategies and decisions can be evaluated. Wood quality discussions may be simplified by being able to assess the effects on the production process of decisions being made. Future work involves adding more functionality to the simulation environment as well as evaluating the methods proposed in this thesis industrially. The long term vision is to be able to integrate the <b>forestry-wood</b> <b>chain</b> from log to finished product in one simulation model.

40|$|A {{customer-oriented}} production philosophy, {{an integrated}} <b>forestry-wood</b> <b>chain</b> {{and the global}} vision of Precision Forestry are concepts that researchers and {{people involved in the}} forest and wood industry have to deal with in the beginning of this new millennium. Fulfilling the specific requirements for dimension, length, biological features and proof-of-origin that customers demand for the wood products entails the existence of advanced methods and tools for understanding and thus controlling the production process along the forestry-wood value chain. The two overall objectives of this thesis were a) to study the prerequisites of using the simulation technique together with advanced simulation tools in understanding the role of the measurement accuracy at different locations within the forestry-wood production chain and b) to study the prerequisites of developing a marking/reading free traceability system for sawlogs based on log measurement data as generated today at the sawmill site.

40|$|As {{innovations}} are {{the basic}} premise of commercial success in the market the main objective {{of this paper is}} to determine the main course of innovations in wood-processing industry within the <b>forestry-wood</b> <b>chain</b> in Slovakia from the viewpoint of representatives of wood processing companies. Using a Q-methodology approach the emphasis is also put on identification of differences between the opinions of small individual entrepreneurs and representatives of capital companies. Based on the results of structured interview with representatives of 33 wood processing companies the main findings suggest that future innovation activities in the sector will be related to the technology innovations mainly in processing of coniferous timber. However, the extent of such innovations is perceived differently depending on the company size and ownership category. While small individual entrepreneurs expect only slight innovation changes in the industry aimed at the meeting of required standards, managers of capital companies tend to foresee the future vision in restructuralisation of wood-processing industry...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} value {{recovery}} and production {{control in the}} <b>forestry–wood</b> <b>chain</b> for improved competitiveness of sawmills through higher profit and better adaptation to product requirements of the customers. The subject was approached using simulation technique with a database of virtual logs and a sawing simulator capable of processing the logs in the database. CT images of young Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) sawlogs were processed with artificial neural networks (ANN) for identifying knots in sapwood where the contrast in the images is low. ANN classifications were deemed a feasible method where traditional image analysis methods failed. Further processing of the classified image allowed for parametric descriptions of the logs in a format compatible with the previously established Swedish Pine Stem Bank (SPSB). Static models of stem shape and interior knot structure were used to create stems that were also compatible with the SPSB. Processing the stems with the sawing simulator demonstrated the possibility of predicting timber grade recovery and volume yield from stands based on site, stand and tree characteristics. It was also shown that timber values in logs can be predicted using variables derived from 3 -dimensional (3 D) scanning of stems’ external geometry {{as well as from}} 3 D scanning in combination with X- ray log scanning. The improvement achieved with the combined scanning was rather low compared to using 3 D scanning alone. Results of a study of bucking methods, log sorting methods and production control showed that the more detailed information the bucking and log sorting decisions are based on, the higher the value recovery. Furthermore, the more processing stations involved in production control, the better are the demand targets met. In a study aiming at increased share of target board lengths, different bucking alternatives were evaluated. It was concluded that optimizing forest operations, value recovery and production as separate entities will not produce optimal results. A case study of a sawmill where the length of the timber was of high interest showed that increasing the share of target lengths of small dimensions can only be done at a relatively high cost in terms of volume yield loss. It was also shown that log classes should be defined with varying diameter limits for different log lengths at the conventional diameter-based log sorting. In order to meet the desired length distribution of the timber, it is necessary to alter the log length distribution, and this can be done with adaptive control heuristics that dynamically updates control log prices during bucking. It is concluded that there is an unexploited value potential in the <b>forestry–wood</b> <b>chain</b> which can be reached using modern measurement techniques and that a better characterization of the wood raw material will facilitate an improved customer-order orientation.

40|$|Projet européen EFORWOODThis presentation, {{takes place}} {{in the context of the}} EFORWOOD project. The aim of this project is to provide methodologies and tools that will, for the first time, {{integrate}} Sustainability Impact Assessment of the whole European <b>Forestry-Wood</b> <b>Chain</b> (FWC), by quantifying performance of FWC, using indicators for all three pillars of sustainability; environmental, economic and societal. The project will provide methods to assess the sustainability impacts of modifications of Forestry-Wood Chains as influenced by policy changes, market drivers, or technological innovations. This presentation is a contribution to to the work package 2. 3 on Social and cultural values. This WP focuses on recreational uses of forests defined as follows: Recreational uses include all direct uses of forests and woodlands for non-work purposes, regardless of frequency and duration of visits and the wide range of activities of forest visitors (walking, picnicking, sport, hunting, harvesting of non timber forest products [...] .). The main task of this WP is the collection of aggregate data on levels of recreational uses for Eforwood:i. To express the baseline situation regarding recreational use and to show differences in this baseline between regions - forest types and social groups across Europe. ii. To express predicted impact on recreational uses due to future scenarios such as change in forest management. Thus, the propoer aim of this presentation is: i To fill gaps in knowledge on recreational use of forests in French reference regions: Aquitaine and Lorraine (cf. EFORWOOD PD 2. 3. 2); ii To give an overview of forest recreation in Aquitaine and Lorraine; iii To underline specificities and common figures between the two regions; iv To put in perspective with national figure...|$|E
