5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{a series of}} letters between Eldon {{businessmen}} and Carl E. Smith, the newly-inherited owner of the house, revealed differing opinions on continued use of the house: Smith wanted to renovate the house and protect it from vandalism only; the Eldon leaders were more in favor of making the house a historic site. The house was abandoned {{for much of the}} 1970s—a bullet was fired in an upstairs bedroom; weather and vandalism took their toll as well. Only in the late 1980s did the owner of the property consider turning the house over to the state. Indeed, many southern Iowans were conflicted on the issue—the owner wanted to keep the house only because he believed the current renters would have nowhere else to <b>go</b> <b>if</b> they were forced to leave.|$|E
5|$|The CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now {{executive}} director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest condenser, code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the CIA is willing to let Jodie <b>go</b> <b>if</b> she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy a facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them go is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her too dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him {{into the heart of the}} Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.|$|E
25|$|West Allis's {{ordinance}} {{focused on}} curbing drug paraphernalia sales to minors. Not only were such sales forbidden, all paraphernalia sales within {{a thousand feet}} (305 m) of a school. It also required that paraphernalia be displayed only in portions of stores not visible to minors and where they could only <b>go</b> <b>if</b> accompanied by a parent or guardian. Unlike Hoffman Estates, West Allis provided for criminal penalties, with fines and jail time.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, {{a county}} civic group {{advocated}} {{for the election}} of a county executive. The group's report said that the new position would give citizens another place to <b>go</b> <b>if</b> their concerns were refused by the Montgomery County Council. The group said that the fact that the county had four appointed county managers in thirteen years demonstrates that establishing the position in 1948 had not been a stunning success. The group also advocated for nonpartisan elections for council members. Among the reasons for the suggested changes in governance {{is the fact that the}} county's population had more than doubled since the governmental system had been established in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Fabrice {{has been}} {{captured}} and imprisoned in the Farnese Tower in Parma, where the commander is the Général Conti. But Fabrice sees Clélia again, feeding her {{birds in the}} prison courtyard – and although she has agreed with her father to marry the Marquis Crescenzi, love is rekindled and he would rather stay in prison near her than escape. Clélia decides to save Fabrice who {{is in danger of}} poisoning because of his Bonapartist views. Gina plans to free Fabrice, but he only agrees to <b>go</b> <b>if</b> Clélia meets him. In the final tableau of the act they meet and Clélia swears to help him, but after that will never see him again. The two women give Conti sleeping draft and Fabrice flees with Gina.|$|E
25|$|Cinderella {{is living}} a dissatisfying life, having lost both parents {{at a young}} age, and being forced {{to work as a}} scullery maid for her cruel stepmother, Lady Tremaine, jealous of Cinderella's beauty, and stepsisters Drizella and Anastasia, in the {{dilapidated}} château they live in. Despite this, Cinderella is a kind and gentle young woman, and is friends with mice and birds that live in and around the château. Meanwhile, at the royal palace, the King is frustrated that his son, the Prince, is still unmarried. He and the Grand Duke organize a ball in an effort to find a suitable wife for the Prince, requesting every eligible maiden attend. Upon receiving notice of the ball, Tremaine agrees to let Cinderella <b>go</b> <b>if</b> she finishes her chores and can find a suitable dress to wear.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand {{decided to}} help fight for the Empire and sent 6,500 mounted troops to assist the British efforts, making the war New Zealand's first {{overseas}} military campaign. Virtually every man in New Zealand was desperately keen to get to war, so the first soldiers to go were {{selected on the basis}} of who could afford to <b>go.</b> <b>If</b> a man could provide his own horse, rifle and equipment, costing about £25 in total, he could go to war. The first two of the 10 contingents paid their own way. The proposal to send the first contingent – 200 mounted riflemen – was approved by Parliament prior to the outbreak of war on 28 September 1899. Prime Minister Richard Seddon's proposition to do so was overwhelmingly supported, meeting opposition from only five members of parliament.|$|E
25|$|A week later, Jake {{leaves to}} go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that {{it looks as if}} a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy's room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since {{returning}} from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, Doctor Jesus"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares ("Vendors' Trio"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to <b>go</b> <b>if</b> she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her, and he promises that she will never have to be afraid again ("I Loves You, Porgy").|$|E
500|$|At 17:20 McCay signalled Bridges {{that large}} numbers of {{unwounded}} men were leaving the battlefield and heading for the beaches. This was followed by Maclagan asking for urgent artillery fire support, onto Gun Ridge, as his left was under a heavy attack and at 18:16 Owen reported the left flank was [...] "rapidly" [...] being forced to retire. At dusk Maclagan made his way to Bridges headquarters and when asked for his opinion replied [...] "It's touch and <b>go.</b> <b>If</b> the Turks come on in mass formation... I don't think anything can stop them." [...] As it got dark the Turkish artillery ceased firing, and although small arms fire continued on both sides, the effects were limited when firing blind. Darkness also provided the opportunity to start digging more substantial trenches and to resupply the troops with water and ammunition.|$|E

500|$|The song {{opens with}} a single crash cymbal {{followed}} by two bars of 4/4 drumming, then a plaintive three-note guitar line rings through a strummy rhythm, and Martin's vocals. Its instrumentation is varied {{with the sound of}} thumping drums, chiming guitars, a singalong chorus, and a string arrangement. The song also features a guitar lick swirl. The three lines of the third verse allude to a man's love of a woman, who does not reciprocate his love. He is saying he will always wait for her, but he does not think that she should stay where she is any longer. The lyrics emphasize: [...] "But I wait for you/if you <b>go,</b> <b>if</b> you go/leave me down here on my own/then I'll wait for you." [...] The song's lyrics also include references to a desire for weary optimism.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{a breakup}} lament {{dealing with the}} theme of commitment. Its title refers to the turning point of a {{relationship}}. The lyrics address a relationship {{in a state of}} tension and uncertainty: [...] "We've reached the climax / We're together / Now we're undone / Won't commit so we choose to run away / Do we separate?" [...] Usher sings in a pleading falsetto and a plaintive tone on the song, alternating restrained vocals and anguished howls. In an interview for V-103, Usher stressed that [...] "Climax" [...] focuses more on the complication of relationships rather than sex, saying that [...] "it's really about the ultimate experience or lack thereof. Or the finale of an experience of love and life. When you're in a relationship and it has kinda reached the climax of where it can go, you gotta let it <b>go</b> <b>if</b> {{you are not going to}} commit." [...] He viewed that his falsetto vocals and the song's tone give the song a sexual feel with music that works as a [...] "double entendre".|$|E

Setchfield was positive towards the [...] "terrific" [...] comedy with Strax, Coleman and the [...] "surprisingly underused" [...] Grant, as well as the new title sequence and TARDIS. While he wrote that the subtle callback of the Great Intelligence was [...] "a tad more interesting than the usual 'So, we meet again!' schtick", he ultimately felt their threat [...] "never quite comes into sharp relief". Neela Debnath of The Independent wrote that [...] "The Snowmen" [...] was stronger than the previous year's [...] "The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe" [...] as it was connected to the overall story of the series, but [...] "still has a way to <b>go</b> <b>if</b> it is to live up to 'A Christmas Carol'". Despite feeling that it was [...] "enjoyable", she noted that [...] "the story feels truncated and rushed" ...|$|E

500|$|Seizing an axe, Batman hacks {{down the}} front door of the asylum, proclaiming that the inmates are now free. The Joker offers to put him out of his misery. Batman {{retrieves}} Two-Face's coin from Adams and returns it to him, stating that it should be up to Two-Face to decide Batman's fate. Two-Face declares that they will kill Batman if the coin lands scratched side up, but let him <b>go</b> <b>if</b> the unscarred side appears. Two-Face flips the coin and declares Batman free. The Joker bids Batman good-bye, taunting him by saying that should life ever become too much for him in [...] "the asylum" [...] (the outside world) then he always has a place in Arkham. As Batman disappears into the night, Two-Face stands looking at the coin and it is revealed that it actually landed scratched side up; Two-Face chose to free Batman with his own will. He then turns to the stack of tarot cards and recites a passage from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: [...] "Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2015, Chiwetel Ejiofor entered {{preliminary}} {{talks with}} Marvel {{for a role}} in the film, later revealed to be Baron Mordo. Ejiofor's role was confirmed during the 2015 D23 Expo. In April, Derrickson and members of the production team visited New York City to scout potential filming locations, while Feige revealed that filming would begin that November. A month later, Tilda Swinton was in talks to play the Ancient One. In June 2015, Derrickson announced {{that he was going to}} London to begin work on the film, and Feige confirmed that Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum would appear, located on Bleecker Street in New York City's Greenwich Village, as in the comics. Swinton confirmed her role in the film in July, when Rachel McAdams was being considered for the female lead. McAdams cautioned that [...] "it's still super-early, and I don't know where that's gonna <b>go,</b> <b>if</b> it's gonna go anywhere at all", but she ultimately confirmed her role during the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. Mads Mikkelsen entered into early negotiations to play a villain in August, [...] "one of a number of actors being considered for the unspecified villianous role." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{production}} designer was Scott Chambliss, {{a longtime}} collaborator with Abrams. Chambliss {{worked with a}} large group of concept illustrators, including James Clyne, Ryan Church, creature designer Neville Page, and Star Trek veteran John Eaves. Abrams stated the difficulty of depicting the future was that much of modern technology was inspired by the original show, and made it seem outdated. Thus the production design had to be consistent with the television series but also feel more advanced than the real world technology developed after it. [...] "We all have the iPhone that does more than the communicator," [...] said Abrams. [...] "I feel like there's a certain thing that you can't really hold onto, which is kind of the kitschy quality. That must <b>go</b> <b>if</b> it's going to be something that you believe is real." [...] Prop master Russell Bobbitt collaborated with Nokia on recreating the original communicator, creating a $50,000 prototype. Another prop recreated for the film was the tricorder. Bobbitt brought the original prop to the set, but the actors found it too large to carry when filming action scenes, so technical advisor Doug Brody redesigned it to be smaller. The phaser props were designed as spring-triggered barrels that revolve and glow as the setting switches from [...] "stun" [...] to [...] "kill". An Aptera Typ-1 prototype car was used on location.|$|E

500|$|... "Borderland" [...] first premiered on UPN in the United States on October 29, 2004. The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Robert Bianco highlighted the episode as one {{to watch in}} his preview column for USA Today. Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune praised the return of Brent Spiner to Star Trek, saying [...] "Surprise, fear, elation, self-control; they're all given masterful life by Spiner {{in the space of}} a few seconds." [...] The reviewer at IGN thought that the episode was a return to the quality of [...] "", and praised the abilities of Spiner. The teaser trailer was compared to that of a Quentin Tarantino film, and a score of 3/5 was given saying [...] "Executive Producer Manny Coto has a long way to <b>go</b> <b>if</b> he has any hope of making up for Enterprise's transgressions the past three years but if this three episode story arc lives up to the promise shown in Borderland, he might just pull it off." [...] Stephanie Vander Weide of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] grade rating. She said that she liked the premise of the episode, but felt that the execution was sub-par, describing the augments as [...] "Khannabees" [...] and expressing her disappointment in the actions of Captain Archer. The mini-arc featuring the episodes [...] "Borderland", [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] and [...] "The Augments" [...] were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt.|$|E
