40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 1997. This study {{focuses on}} the {{preparation}} and characterization of palladium-silver-nickel composite membranes. Electroless plating was used to deposit thin metal films on aluminazirconia membrane supports. Palladium conversion, in the <b>electroless</b> <b>palladium</b> <b>plating</b> process, was optimized {{with the aim of}} minimizing expensive palladium losses. The effect of deposition order on alloy composition and heat treatment on structural characteristics of the composite membrane was investigated. The inorganic support membranes were thoroughly cleaned and pretreated prior to plating to catalyze the surface. Factorial designs were used to obtain the maximum palladium conversion. Tetra amine palladium nitrate gave better solution stability and resulted in higher conversions than tetra amine palladium chloride. Buffer pH values of 9 to 11 caused little variation in palladium conversion. Moving outside this range resulted in a sharp decline in palladium conversion. At a pH of 9 to 11 the stabilizer is in the correct ionic form (EDTA 3 and EDTA 4,) to best stabilize the palladium ions, and hydrazine acts as a proper reducing agent. Significant interactions existed between the EDTA concentration (stabilizer) and hydrazine concentration (reducing agent) and between EDTA and temperature. The EDTA concentration was the most sensitive variable. A 27. 5 g 10 % tetra amine palladium nitrate <b>solution</b> per liter <b>plating</b> <b>solution</b> was used. Conversions exceeding 80 % were obtained after three hours plating with 20 ml <b>plating</b> <b>solution</b> at the following conditions: temperatures from 71 to 77 DC, 40 - 60 % molar excess hydrazine, EDTA:Pd-salt molar ratios between 30 : 1 and 40 : 1 and buffer pH = 11. Silver plating rates for two hours plating of up to 2 mg/cm 2 were obtained using a dilute silver nitrate solution with hydrazine as reducing agent. Electroless nickel plating was performed in a low temperature bath (40 DC) with nickel sulphate as source of metal ions and sodium hypophosphite as reducing agent. Metal films were fully characterized before and after heat treatment for 5 hours in a hydrogen atmosphere at 650 dc. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the surface structure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken to examine alloying and detect changes in the crystal structure. after heating. Energy dispersive X-ray maps (EDS) were used to visualize the diffusion process and particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) was used to construct concentration profiles across the thickness of the metal films. Palladium deposits were dense, but columnlike, with a purity of 99. 75 %. Silver deposits were non-homogeneous, in other words it did not cover the entire substrate. The purity of the silver films was 99. 5 %. The nickel films were about 97 % pure, very dense and defect free. When silver was deposited on palladium, the alloy penetrated more than 3 microns into the support and the palladium and silver concentrations varied across the thickness of the film after heating. By depositing palladium on silver, there was very little penetration into the support membrane pores (about 1 micron) and the palladium to silver ratio remained constant across the thickness of the film after heating. Silver-palladium-nickel alloy films call be prepared by first depositing silver, then palladium and finally nickel. During heat treatment, a counter diffusion process took place and the smaller nickel atoms penetrated into pores and defects that might be present in the palladium-silver solid solution. By adding more than 3 % nickel, dense defect free films can be prepared, which is much thinner than conventional palladium-silver films. This method makes it possible to reduce the film thickness of dense, non-porous films to less than 5 microns, reducing fabrication cost and increasing the hydrogen flux through the film. Dense, non-porous palladium-silver films are usually in the range of 10 - 15 microns...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} pore {{structure}} of the support on the plating morphology, thickness, and composition were investigated in an electroless plating procedure. Some of the plating {{studies were carried out}} directly on commercially available porous glass supports, while others were performed on modified supports. Two modification steps with alumina were applied on tubular supports. Formation of a 60 -μm-thick layer on the modified support was detected by SEM analysis after the first 2 plating steps, while layer formation was not observed on the non-modified support. It was shown that the formation of a new layer started on the modified support, and a firm structure was obtained on the non-modified support after the fourth plating step. Pd film thickness was 100 μm for plating on the modified support. From EDS analysis, the plating composition on the modified support was 0. 52 % Al, 1. 56 % Si, and 97. 92 % Pd, and it was 2. 52 % Al, 3. 28 % Si, and 94. 20 % Pd on the non-modified support after the fourth plating step. The highest differential gain value was 10. 33 mg/cm 2 for the first plating on the modified support. The number of pores corresponding to the mesoporous region increased after the second plating and it decreased with subsequent plating steps for both supports. Pores with an average diameter of about 5500 nm were found in the structure following the fourth plating on the non-modified support, and pores with an average diameter of 800 nm were found basically in the structure after the fourth plating on the modified support.

The use of electroless plating has a number of advantages over electroplating including the ability to deposit coatings onto complex-shaped objects which can be metallic or non-metallic, such as plastics. The most widely used electroless coating is electroless nickel prepared using sodium hypophosphite as reductant. This results in coatings which contain phosphorus.

The <b>plating</b> <b>solution</b> operates at room temperature within narrow limits of composition and concentration: small deviations in composition from the optimum results in solution decomposition. Characterisation of electroless palladium-boron coatings indicates that the inclusion of boron decreases the corrosion resistance of the coating.

The <b>plating</b> <b>solution</b> developed uses hydrazine hydrate as the reducing agent with methylamine as stabiliser.
