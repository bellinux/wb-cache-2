5|$|Four years later, with <b>Drumlin</b> {{seeking to}} close SETI, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a {{sequence}} of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system Vega some 26 light-years away. This announcement causes <b>Drumlin</b> and the National Security Council led by Michael Kitz to attempt {{to take control of}} the facility. Arroway's team then discover a video buried in the signal: Adolf Hitler's opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth's atmosphere, taking 26 years to reach Vega and then being transmitted back from there.|$|E
5|$|The {{nations of}} the world fund the {{construction}} of the machine at Cape Canaveral. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her hopes are scuppered by Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico. When he brings attention to her atheism, the panel selects <b>Drumlin</b> instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing <b>Drumlin</b> and many others.|$|E

5|$|The Holderness {{landscape}} {{is dominated by}} deposits of till, boulder clays and glacial lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form {{a more or less}} continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial landscape features such as <b>drumlin</b> mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area. The well drained glacial deposits provide fertile soils that can support intensive arable cultivation. Fields are generally large and bounded by drainage ditches. There is very little woodland in the area and this leads to a landscape that is essentially rural but very flat and exposed.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the process}} that forms <b>drumlins</b> is not fully understood, their shape implies that they are {{products}} of the plastic deformation zone of ancient glaciers. It is believed that many <b>drumlins</b> were formed when glaciers advanced over and altered the deposits of earlier glaciers.|$|R

25|$|Mt. Albion was {{established}} 12 years after Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts popularized the rural cemetery, where graves {{were located in}} a park-like setting outside an urban area. Arad Thomas and Lorenzo Burrows were tasked with revising the village charter so that land outside of the village limits could be purchased for use a municipal cemetery. Instead of adding amendments to the charter, the committee redrafted the entire document, which {{was passed by the}} New York State Legislature on April 1, 1842. Soon after, the citizens of Albion selected Lorenzo Burrows and Alexis Ward to locate a parcel of land on which a new municipal cemetery could be established. A suitable location sitting on 25 acres of forested hills and rolling meadows atop a sandy <b>drumlin</b> were selected and purchased for $40 per acre from Jacob Annis and Lyman O. Patterson.|$|E

25|$|The segment between Peterborough and Perth {{was built}} in the 1930s during the Great Depression, as a public works {{employment}} project. It was constructed parallel to a CP Rail corridor (now abandoned east of Peterborough) that {{was built in}} the 1880s, and used hand-power to dig and build the road whenever possible. From Peterborough to Norwood, the route travels in a straight line through the Peterborough <b>Drumlin</b> Field, connecting to the southern terminus of Highway28 and crossing the Indian River while otherwise passing through farmland. At Norwood the route suddenly begins to meander as it approaches the undulated Canadian Shield. The section east of Havelock to Perth, unlike the rest of the highway, travels through a relatively isolated area, with few services or residences along the route outside of the several towns that it connects. In contrast to the surroundings west of there, this section is located in dense forest with numerous lakes and muskeg dotting the landscape. It services the villages of Marmora, where it connects with the northern terminus of former Highway14, Madoc, where it intersect Highway62, Actinolite, where it meets the northern terminus of Highway37, and Kaladar, where it intersects Highway41.|$|E
500|$|Highway28 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Highway7 approximately [...] east of Peterborough. The road that carries Highway28 continues south as Peterborough County Road34 (Heritage Line). Proceeding north, Highway28 crosses the Peterborough <b>Drumlin</b> Field, an area dominated by undulating terrain oriented in a southwest–northeast direction. Despite this, the highway progresses due north {{without regard for}} the terrain; numerous cuts and fills have since flattened the route for easier travel. Passing east of Lakefield, the straight path of the route is interrupted by the Otonabee River; it curves northeast and intersects Peterborough County Road29 (Queen Street) and Road6 while travelling south of the river. At Young's Point, {{the southern tip of}} Stony Lake, the highway crosses the river and serves cottages along the western shore of the lake. Approximately [...] south of Burleigh Falls, the route descends a hill and enters the Canadian Shield; south of this point, the terrain is underlain by limestone and covered by deciduous forests, whereas north of it the terrain is dominated by exposed granite bedrock and coniferous forests.|$|E
