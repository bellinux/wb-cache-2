40|$|The {{interaction}} of small molecules with larger noncovalent assemblies is important {{across a wide}} range of disciplines. Here, we apply two complementary NMR spectroscopic methods to investigate the {{interaction of}} various <b>fluorophenol</b> isomers with sunset yellow. This latter molecule is known to form noncovalent aggregates in isotropic solution, and form liquid crystals at high concentrations. We utilize the unique fluorine- 19 nucleus of the <b>fluorophenol</b> as a reporter of the interactions via changes in both the observed chemical shift and diffusion coefficients. The data are interpreted in terms of the indefinite self-association model and simple modifications for the incorporation of a second species into an assembly. A change in association mode is tentatively assigned whereby the <b>fluorophenol</b> binds end-on with the sunset yellow aggregates at low concentration and inserts into the stacks at higher concentrations...|$|E

Crystal structure prediction methods {{have been used to}} generate an ensemble of putative structures of o- and m-fluorophenol, whose previously unknown clathrate structures have been studied by 129 Xe NMR spectroscopy. The high sensitivity of the 129 Xe chemical shift tensor to the chemical environment and shape of the crystalline cavity makes it ideal as a probe for porous materials. The experimental powder NMR spectra can be used to directly confirm or reject hypothetical crystal structures generated by computational prediction, whose chemical shift tensors have been simulated using density functional theory. For each <b>fluorophenol</b> isomer we find one predicted crystal structure whose measured and computed chemical shift tensors agree within experimental and computational error margins and these are thus proposed as the true <b>fluorophenol</b> xenon clathrate structures...|$|E

In contrast to the components, the complexes were observed to exhibit nematic and smectic A phases by polarised optical microscopy, and nematic tendency was found to decrease with increasing alkoxy chain length. A correlation between mesophase stability and the fluorine substitution positions for a given number of fluorine substituents in the phenol was also observed. The mesomorphism of the <b>fluorophenol</b> complexes prepared are compared with similar complexes formed between stilbazoles and 2 -, 3 - and 4 -cyanophenol, {{as well as between}} stilbazoles and 3 - and 4 -nitrophenol. Nine X-ray crystallographic structures of the 4 -octyoxy- 4 ’-stilbazole complexed with fluorophenols were also obtained. Eight of the complexes crystallised in the space group, with a back-to-back dimer motif, while the complex of 4 -fluorophenol crystallised in the Pbca space group and formed head-to-tail, zig-zagged chains. A linear relationship between the N•••H separation and the pKa value of the corresponding <b>fluorophenol</b> was discovered. Comparisons are made with the analogous halogen-bonded 4 -(N,N-dimethylamino) pyridine and iodofluorobenzene complexes, in addition to with the crystal packing of the pure fluorophenols. ...|$|E

Here {{we report on the}} enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of fluorobenzaldehydes as catalyzed by the flavoprotein 4 -hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase (HAPMO). HAPMO was most active with 4 -amino- and 4 -hydroxybenzaldehydes. With these compounds significant substrate inhibition occurred. Monofluoro- and difluorobenzaldehydes were readily oxidized by HAPMO without substrate inhibition. 19 F NMR analysis revealed that 4 -fluoro-, 2, 6 -difluoro-, 3, 4 -difluoro-, 2 -fluoro- 4 -hydroxy- and 3 -fluoro- 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde were quantitatively converted by HAPMO to the corresponding fluorophenyl formates. These products spontaneously hydrolyzed to <b>fluorophenols.</b> The HAPMO-mediated conversion of 2 -fluoro-, 3 -fluoro-, 2, 3 -difluoro- and 2, 4 -difluorobenzaldehyde yielded, besides <b>fluorophenols,</b> also minor amounts of fluorobenzoic acids. The high preference of HAPMO for the production of <b>fluorophenols</b> is in disagreement with the rule derived from chemical studies that electron-poor benzaldehydes form mainly benzoic acids.

The results show that a calix[4]pyrrole membrane is able to recognize chloro and fluoro derivatives of phenols, and discriminate between ortho-, meta-, and para-isomers of chlorophenol. The mechanism of molecular recognition relies on the formation of a supramolecular complex between a phenolic guest and the calix[4]pyrrole host occurring at the organic/aqueous interface, which leads to a change of charge separation. The sensitivity and selectivity of the sensor studied depend on the acidity and lipophilicity of the phenolic analytes.

When grown aerobically on 2 -FP, growth kinetics of strain FP 1 followed the Luong model. An inhibitory effect of increasing 2 -FP concentrations was observed with no growth occurring at 2 - FP levels higher than ca. 4 mM. Rhodococcus strain FP 1 was able to degrade a range of other organofluorine compounds, including 2 -fluorobenzoate, 3 -fluorobenzoate, 4 -fluorobenzoate, 3 -fluorophenol, 4 -fluorophenol, 3 -fluorocatechol, and 4 -fluorocatechol, as well as chlorinated compounds such as 2 -chlorophenol and 4 -chlorophenol.

40|$|Of all NMR-observable {{isotopes}} 19 F is the {{one most}} convenient for studies on the biodegradation of environmental pollutants and especially for fast initial metabolic screening of newly isolated organisms.

Together the presented data illustrate {{the potential of the}} 19 F NMR technique for (1) fast initial screening of biodegradative pathways, i. e. for studies on metabolomics in newly isolated microorganisms, and (2) identification of relatively unstable pathway intermediates like fluoromuconolactones and fluoromaleylacetates...|$|R
40|$|Of all NMR {{observable}} isotopes 19 F {{is the one}} {{perhaps most}} convenient for studies on biodegradation of environmental pollutants. The reasons underlying this potential of 19 F NMR are discussed and illustrated {{on the basis of}} a study on the biodegradation of <b>fluorophenols</b> by four Rhodococcus strains. The results indicate marked differences between the biodegradation pathways of <b>fluorophenols</b> among the various Rhodococcus species. This holds not only for the level and nature of the fluorinated biodegradation pathway intermediates that accumulate, but also for the regioselectivity of the initial hydroxylation step. Several of the Rhodococcus species contain a phenol hydroxylase that catalyses the oxidative defluorination of ortho-fluorinated di- and trifluorophenols. Furthermore, it is illustrated how the 19 F NMR technique can be used as a tool in the process of identification of an accumulated unknown metabolite, in this case most likely 5 -fluoromaleylacetate. Altogether, the 19 F NMR technique proved valid to obtain detailed information on the microbial biodegradation pathways of fluorinated organics, but also to provide information on the specificity of enzymes generally considered unstable and, for this reason, not much studied so far...|$|R

Their grafting onto the lignin-exposed jute was demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflection spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). The coupling of <b>fluorophenol</b> and fluoramine onto a complex lignin model compound (2 -methoxy- 4 -propylphenol) (MP) was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR). Laccase-catalyzed grafting of both fluorinated monomers led to 41. 94 % and 46. 35 % increase in contact angle for TFMPP and PFNL, respectively. An oil static contact angle of 117. 16 [degree] and oil wetting time values higher than 30 min obtained for PFNL-grafted jute also demonstrated the oleophobic behavior of jute samples after laccase-mediated oxidation.

Emerging biological approaches, namely the use of bioreactors, for cleaning processes have been introduced. The use of bioreactors requires the development of efficient monitoring tools, preferably with realtime measurements. In this work, a couple of flow injection systems were developed and optimized for the potentiometric determination of fluoride to monitor a rotating biological contactor (RBC) bioreactor and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with offline and online sampling. Both the RBC and the SBR bioreactors were set up for the biodegradation of the halogenated organic compound 2 <b>fluorophenol</b> and, as fluoride was a degradation byproduct, the process was monitored by following up its concentration. The described flow injection potentiometric methods enabled the fluoride determination within the required quantification range 0. 10 – 100 mM. The possible interferences from the growth medium were minimized inline. The determination rate was 78 h− 1 for the offline monitoring of RBC and 50 − 1 h for the online monitoring of the SBR, with a sample consumption of 0. 500 mL and 0. 133 mL per determination, respectively.

Numerous interrelated processes contribute to pollutant removal in wetlands; of these processes, interactions between organic pollutants and aquatic plants may be least understood. Research focused on (1) understanding parameters that affected uptake of fluorinated organic pollutants by Lemnaceae, (2) identifying plant processes involved in removal of wastewater-associated organic pollutants by Lemnaceae, and (3) assessing use of Lemnaceae callus cultures in understanding toxicity and metabolism of fluorinated organic pollutants by Lemnaceae. Through active plant uptake, Lemna minor rapidly removed 13 fluorinated phenols, with pseudo-first order rate constants of 0. 20 ± 0. 04 d- 1 to 0. 84 ± 0. 07 d- 1. Uptake rates depended on substituent type (i. e., trifluoromethyl- vs. fluoro-) and position, with slowest removal rates for di-ortho-substituted <b>fluorophenols.</b> Uptake rates decreased with increasing concentrations of fluorinated phenols; assessments of inhibition of plant oxygen production in conjugation with concentration studies indicated that concentration affected uptake rates even when Lemnaceae was not inhibited. Additionally, temperature dependencies of fluorinated phenol uptake by Lemnaceae were well represented by Arrhenius relationships; however, effects of temperature on plant activity were also observed in trends of uptake rates with temperature. Increasing uptake with decreasing concentration and increasing temperature, in addition to effects of plant inhibition, plant activity, and sorption on uptake, strongly {{emphasized the importance of}} plant metabolism in uptake of fluorinated phenols by Lemnaceae. Active plant uptake of wastewater-associated organic pollutants affected fate of fluoxetine, triclosan, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, while passive plant removal processes contributed to fate of four of six wastewater derived organic pollutants. Consequently, plant-associated processes were important components of fate for over 50 % of experimental wastewater-associated organic pollutants. Furthermore, assessments with Lemnaceae callus cultures indicated that callus cultures were generally more susceptible to inhibitory responses to fluorinated phenols than were Lemnaceae plants; however, metabolism of 3 -trifluormethylphenol in Lemnaceae callus cultures and plants was similar, indicating that callus cultures may be valuable in plant metabolism studies. Research advances understanding of fate of organic pollutants in wetland systems, and thus has important implications for water quality, ecosystem health, and human health. Ph. D.

The {{results of our}} recent studies strongly suggest that the excess electron attachment to the complex of a nucleic acid base with an amino acid can induce a barrier-free proton transfer (BFPT) from the amino acid to the O 8 of uracil. The driving force for the proton transfer is to stabilize the excess electron localized on a π* orbital. Our further studies also demonstrated that BFPT occurs in anionic complexes of uracil with alanine, formic acid, as well as H 2 Se and H 2 S. We briefly determined factors governing the occurrence of proton transfer in complexes between anionic nucleic acid bases (NABs) and proton donors. We found that the occurrence of BFPT in the uracil complexes is an outcome of the interplay between the deprotonation energy of a proton donor and the protonation energy of the anion of uracil. The density functional theory (DFT) was applied as our research method. The B 3 LYP and MPW 1 K exchange-correlation functionals with 6 - 31 ++G** (5 d) basis set were used. The substitution of five hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms in phenol molecule decreases the energy of deprotonation from 15. 3 eV to 14. 4 eV.
