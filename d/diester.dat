5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Alexander Todd’s group pioneered H-phosphonate and {{phosphate}} triester methods of oligonucleotide synthesis. The reaction of compounds 1 and 2 to form H-phosphonate <b>diester</b> 3 is an H-phosphonate coupling in solution while that of compounds 4 and 5 to give 6 is a phosphotriester coupling (see phosphotriester synthesis below).|$|E
5|$|The {{newly formed}} tricoordinated {{phosphite}} triester linkage is not natural and is of limited stability under {{the conditions of}} oligonucleotide synthesis. The treatment of the support-bound material with iodine and water {{in the presence of}} a weak base (pyridine, lutidine, or collidine) oxidizes the phosphite triester into a tetracoordinated phosphate triester, a protected precursor of the naturally occurring phosphate <b>diester</b> internucleosidic linkage. Oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions using tert-Butyl hydroperoxide or, more efficiently, (1S)-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)-oxaziridine (CSO). The step of oxidation is substituted with a sulfurization step to obtain oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (see Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and their synthesis below). In the latter case, the sulfurization step is best carried out prior to capping.|$|E

40|$|The ugp-encoded {{transport}} system of Escherichia coli accumulates sn-glycerol- 3 -phosphate with high affinity; it is binding protein mediated {{and part of}} the pho regulon. Here, we report that glycerophosphoryl <b>diesters</b> (deacylated phospholipids) are also high-affinity substrates for the ugp-encoded system.

25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{plants were}} opened in many European countries, {{including}} the Czech Republic, Germany and Sweden.

500|$|Thirty years later, {{this work}} inspired, independently, two {{research}} groups {{to adopt the}} H-phosphonate chemistry to the solid-phase synthesis using nucleoside H-phosphonate monoesters 7 as building blocks and pivaloyl chloride, 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (TPS-Cl), and other compounds as activators.

Oxidation of internucleosidic H-phosphonate <b>diester</b> linkages in 8 to phosphodiester linkages in 9 with a solution of iodine in aqueous pyridine is carried {{out at the end of}} the chain assembly rather than as a step in the synthetic cycle. If desired, the oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions. Alternatively, 8 can be converted to phosphorothioate 10 or phosphoroselenoate 11 (X = Se), or oxidized by CCl4 in the presence of primary or secondary amines to phosphoramidate analogs 12. The method is very convenient in that various types of phosphate modifications (phosphate/phosphorothioate/phosphoramidate) may be introduced to the same oligonucleotide for modulation of its properties.|$|E

The CGTase catalyzed reactions between the glucose and maltose esters and α-cyclodextrin were carried out in water.
