[...] The resulting products are easily identifiable and differ greatly from process manufacturing where the products are undifferentiated, for example oil, natural gas and salt.Discrete manufacturing is often characterized by individual or separate unit production. Units can be produced in low volume with very high complexity or high volumes of low complexity.

The goal is to allow an operator to specify the product routes through the system, {{for each type of}} product, irrespective of any other type of product that may be simultaneously present within the production system. Control laws guaranteeing production according to those product specifications can then be synthesized, given the model of the system.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} and validates {{the framework}} of a specialized maintenance decision support system for a <b>discrete</b> part <b>manufacturing</b> facility. Its construction utilizes a modular approach based on the fundamental philosophy of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). The proposed architecture uniquely integrates System Decomposition, System Evaluation, Failure Analysis, Logic Tree Analysis, and Maintenance Planning modules. It presents an ideal solution to the unique maintenance inadequacies of modern <b>discrete</b> part <b>manufacturing</b> systems. Well established techniques are incorporated as building blocks of the system 2 ̆ 7 s modules. These include Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), Logic Tree Analysis (LTA), Theory of Constraints (TOC), and an Expert System (ES). A Maintenance Information System (MIS) performs the system 2 ̆ 7 s support functions. Validation was performed by field testing of the system at a Miami based manufacturing facility. Such a maintenance support system potentially reduces downtime losses and contributes to higher product quality output. Ultimately improved profitability is the final outcome. ...|$|R
