40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the frequency domain based solution {{for a certain}} class of wave equations such as: a second order partial differential equation in one variable with constant and varying coefficients (Cantilever beam) and a coupled second order partial differential equation in two variables with constant and varying coefficients (Timoshenko beam). The exact solution of the Cantilever beam with uniform and varying cross-section and the Timoshenko beam with uniform cross-section is available. However, the exact solution for Timoshenko beam with varying cross-section is not available. Laplace spectral methods are used to solve these problems exactly in frequency domain. The numerical solution in frequency domain is done by discretisation in space by approximating the unknown function using spectral functions like Chebyshev polynomials, Legendre polynomials and also Normal polynomials. Different numerical methods such as Galerkin Method, Petrov- Galerkin method, Method of moments and Collocation method or the Pseudo-spectral method in frequency domain are studied and compared with the available exact solution. An approximate solution is also obtained for the Timoshenko beam with varying cross-section using Laplace Spectral Element Method (LSEM). The <b>group</b> <b>speeds</b> are computed exactly for the Cantilever beam and Timoshenko beam with uniform cross-section and is compared with the <b>group</b> <b>speeds</b> obtained numerically. The shear mode and the bending modes of the Timoshenko beam with uniform cross-section are separated numerically by applying a modulated pulse as the shear force and the corresponding <b>group</b> <b>speeds</b> for varying taper parameter in are obtained numerically by varying {{the frequency of the}} input pulse. An approximate expression for calculating <b>group</b> <b>speeds</b> corresponding to the shear mode and the bending mode, and also the cut-off frequency is obtained.

40|$|Effect of grid {{orthogonality}} on {{the solution}} of two-dimensional depth averaged shallow water equations is studied by comparing model predictions using different grid configurations with analytical solutions, for the cases of tidal forcing in a rectangular channel and seiche oscillation in a closed rectangular basin. The grid angle and grid resolution were found to affect accuracy of the model predicted velocities. Fourier analysis of the discretized equations also confirmed that grid angle and the grid resolution affects {{the accuracy of the}} solution and that the numerical dispersion increases with a decrease in grid angle or decrease in grid resolution. ^ The first manuscript investigates the effect of grid non-orthogonality on {{the solution of}} shallow water equations, using an existing two-dimensional boundary-fitted model (Muin and Spaulding, 1996). The linearized two-dimensional shallow water equations are expressed in terms of the grid angle and the grid aspect ratio. ^ In the second manuscript, expressions for phase and <b>group</b> <b>speeds</b> for both continuous and discretized, linearized two dimensional shallow water equations, in Cartesian coordinates are developed using Fourier analysis. The phase and <b>group</b> <b>speeds</b> of the equations, discretized using a three-point scheme of second-order, a five-point scheme of fourth order and a three-point compact scheme of fourth-order in an Arakawa C grid are calculated and compared with the corresponding values obtained for the continuous system. ^ In the third manuscript, a Fourier analysis is used to study the dispersion and group velocity relations of linearized, two-dimensional shallow water equations, in a non-orthogonal boundary fitted coordinate system. The phase and <b>group</b> <b>speeds</b> for the spatially discretized equations, using the second order scheme in an Arakawa C grid, are calculated for grids with varying degrees of non-orthogonality and compared with those obtained from the continuous case.

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{research}} described in this paper {{was to develop a}} means of identifying the wave-types propagating between two points in a finite length beam. It is known that different structural wave-types possess different dispersion relations: i. e., that their <b>group</b> <b>speeds</b> and the frequency dependence of their <b>group</b> <b>speeds</b> differ. As a result of those distinct dispersion relationships, different wave-types may be associated with characteristic features when structural responses are examined in the time frequency domain. Previously, the time-frequency character of analytically generated structural responses of both single element and multi-element structures were examined by using the Wigner Distribution (WD) along with filtering techniques that were designed to detect the wave-types present in the responses. In the work to be described here, the measure time-frequency response of finite length beam is examined using the WD and filtering procedures. This paper is organized as follows. First the concept of time-frequency analysis of structural responses is explained. The WD is then introduced along with a description of the implementation of a discrete version. The time-frequency filtering techniques are then presented and explained. The results of applying the WD and the filtering techniques to the analysis of a transient response is then presented...|$|R
