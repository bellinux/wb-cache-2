5|$|Large {{jumps in}} the {{successive}} molar <b>ionization</b> energies occur when removing an electron from a noble gas (complete electron shell) configuration. For magnesium again, {{the first two}} molar <b>ionization</b> energies of magnesium given above correspond to removing the two 3s electrons, and the third <b>ionization</b> energy is a much larger 7730kJ/mol, {{for the removal of}} a 2p electron from the very stable neon-like configuration of Mg2+. Similar jumps occur in the <b>ionization</b> energies of other third-row atoms.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>ionization</b> {{energy is}} the energy {{it takes to}} remove one {{electron}} from an atom, the second <b>ionization</b> energy is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive <b>ionization</b> energies increase with the degree of <b>ionization.</b> For magnesium as an example, the first <b>ionization</b> energy is 738kJ/mol {{and the second is}} 1450kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. <b>Ionization</b> energy becomes greater up and {{to the right of the}} periodic table.|$|E
5|$|A lead atom has 82 electrons, {{arranged}} in an electron configuration of 4f145d106s26p2. The combined {{first and second}} <b>ionization</b> energies—the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons—is close to that of tin, lead's upper neighbor in the carbon group. This is unusual; <b>ionization</b> energies generally fall going down a group, as an element's outer electrons become more distant from the nucleus, and more shielded by smaller orbitals. The similarity of <b>ionization</b> energies {{is caused by the}} lanthanide contraction—the decrease in element radii from lanthanum (atomic number 57) to lutetium (71), and the relatively small radii of the elements after hafnium (72). This is due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the lanthanide 4f electrons. The combined first four <b>ionization</b> energies of lead exceed those of tin, contrary to what periodic trends would predict. Relativistic effects, which become significant in heavier atoms, contribute to this behavior. One such effect is the inert pair effect: the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding, making the distance between nearest atoms in crystalline lead unusually long.|$|E

For several limiting cases rigorous bounds for the asymmetry parameter are established. The energy dependence of photoelectron angular distributions {{is discussed in}} terms of relative channel cross sections, transition moment phases, and Coulomb phase shifts. Rapid energy-dependent variations of the asymmetry parameter can be rationalized in this manner, e. g. for low-energy Π <b>ionizations</b> and for σ-type resonances in Σ <b>ionizations.</b> The proposed scheme is also used to identify the origin of errors in approximate calculations...|$|R

5|$|In pharmacology, <b>ionization</b> of a {{compound}} alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and lipophilicity, logp). For example, <b>ionization</b> of any compound {{will increase the}} solubility in water, but decrease the lipophilicity. This is exploited in drug development to increase the concentration of {{a compound}} in the blood by adjusting the pKa of an ionizable group.|$|E
5|$|Plasma {{temperature}} is commonly measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is, informally, {{a measure of}} the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain <b>ionization,</b> which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma <b>ionization</b> is determined by the electron temperature relative to the <b>ionization</b> energy (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the Saha equation. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states—atoms—and the plasma will eventually become a gas.|$|E
40|$|Gas-phase {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy {{was utilized}} {{to study a}} series of metal-metal bonded complexes. Molecular mechanics, Fenske-Hall and ab-initio theoretical calculations were performed {{on many of the}} systems. The central focus of all the studies was to identify metal-metal <b>ionizations,</b> and observe how ligands effects influence metal-metal interactions. This information was then used to describe various physical and chemical properties of the species. The first group of compounds studied were molybdenum and tungsten D₃(h) triply-bonded hexa-alkoxides of the form M₂(OC(CH₃) n(CF₃) ₃₋n) ₆ (where M=Mo, W and n = 1, 2, 3). The metal-metal π and σ <b>ionizations</b> were identified. It is observed that sequential fluorination of the ligands shifts all the valence <b>ionizations.</b> Because the shifts are found to be dominated by charge effects, the virtual levels are assumed to be equally shifted. This information was used to describe the similarity of the UV absorption spectra of the compounds. The next group studied are electron-rich single-bonded Rh(II) -Rh(II) complexes. The previously assigned PES data for Mo₂(O₂CCF₃) ₄ was used as a reference point when interpreting the data for Rh₂(O₂CCF₃) ₄. The electron configuration orbital ordering for the Rh-Rh bond in Rh₂(O₂CCF₃) ₄ is determined to be σ²π⁴δ²δ*²π*⁴, with the δ* and π* being nearly degenerate. It is observed that if the acetates are replaced with more electron-donating ligands, as with Rh₂(O₂CCF₃) ₂(form) ₂, Rh₂(form) ₄ (form = N-N’-p-tolylformamidine, C₁₅H₁₅N₂) and Rh₂(dpf) ₄ (dpf = diphenylformamidine, C₁₃H₁₁N₂), the δ* <b>ionizations</b> are destabilized relative to the other Rh-Rh <b>ionizations.</b> In addition, ligand-based <b>ionizations</b> overlap into metal-metal <b>ionizations</b> making it more difficult to interpret data. This information is then used to understand the data and electron structures of Rh₂(pfb) ₄ (pfb = perfluorobutyrate, CF₃(CF₂) ₂CO₂⁻), Rh₂(capy) ₄ (capy = caprolactamate, ⁻OC(CH₂) ₅N), Rh₂(OCCH₃NC₆H₅) ₄ and Rh₂(OCCH₃NC₆F₅) ₄. Rh₂(OCCH₃NC₆H₅) ₄ and Rh₂(OCCH₃NC₆F₅) ₄ provide examples where charge and overlap effects can be utilized to assign Rh-Rh <b>ionizations.</b> Rh₂(pfb) ₄ and Rh₂(capy) ₄ exhibit very high and different product selectivities when employed as catalysts in reactions involving carbenes derived from diazo-carbonyl complexes. A mechanism for this catalysis is derived which correlates with the observed selectivities...|$|R

5|$|The {{noble gas}} atoms, like atoms in most groups, {{increase}} steadily in atomic radius from one period {{to the next}} due to {{the increasing number of}} electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the <b>ionization</b> potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom. Noble gases have the largest <b>ionization</b> potential among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity. Some of the heavier noble gases, however, have <b>ionization</b> potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules. It was the insight that xenon has an <b>ionization</b> potential {{similar to that of the}} oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride, an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions; that is, they have a negative electron affinity.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electron, ununennium's first <b>ionization</b> energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 4.53eV, {{higher than those}} of the known alkali metals from potassium onward. This effect is so large that unbiunium (element 121) is predicted to have a lower <b>ionization</b> energy of 4.45eV, so that the alkali metal in period 8 would not have the lowest <b>ionization</b> energy in the period, as is true for all previous periods. Ununennium's electron affinity is expected to be far greater than that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarizability of ununennium, to 169.7a.u. Indeed, the static dipole polarisability (αD) of ununennium, a quantity for which the impacts of relativity are proportional to the square of the element's atomic number, has been calculated to be small and similar to that of sodium.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, <b>ionization</b> energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower <b>ionization</b> energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E

40|$|When x-rays from a {{synchrotron}} source are {{absorbed in}} a liquid, the x-ray energy (E{sub x}) is converted by the photoelectric effect into the kinetic {{energy of the}} electrons released. For hydrocarbons, absorption by the K-electrons of carbon dominates. Thus {{the energy of the}} photoelectron (E{sub pe}) is E{sub x}-E{sub b}, where E{sub b} is the K-shell binding energy of carbon. Additional electrons with energy equal to E{sub b} is released in the Auger process that fills the hole in the K-shell. These energetic electrons will produce many <b>ionizations,</b> excitations and products. The consequences of the high density of <b>ionizations</b> and excitations along the track of the photoelectron and special effects near the K-edge are examined here...|$|R
50|$|Because the {{electrons}} produced from X-rays have high energy and low LET, when {{they interact with}} a cell typically only a few <b>ionizations</b> will occur. It is likely then that the low LET radiation will cause only single strand breaks of the DNA helix. Single strand breaks of DNA molecules can be readily repaired, and so {{the effect on the}} target cell is not necessarily lethal. By contrast, the high LET charged particles produced from neutron irradiation cause many <b>ionizations</b> as they traverse a cell, and so double-strand breaks of the DNA molecule are possible. DNA repair of double-strand breaks are much more difficult for a cell to repair, and more likely to lead to cell death.|$|R
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, <b>ionization</b> energy, {{electron}} affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the <b>ionization</b> energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as <b>ionization</b> energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E

Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the <b>ionization</b> energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal <b>ionization.</b> This important property of phosphorus in diamond favors electronic applications, such as UV light emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235nm).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the two-compartment theory, {{which is based}} on the premise that energy deposition in nanometer sites can be broadly divided into two categories: a lowenergy deposition compartment comprising events with a total number of 2 - 5 <b>ionizations,</b> and a high-energy deposition compartment comprising events containing 6 - 10 <b>ionizations.</b> Under standard biochemical conditions, these events will lead to different biological consequences. The fate of DNA lesions produced by low-energy deposition events will mostly depend on the repair capacity of the irradiated cells, whereas events produced by high-energy deposition events will be irreparable.

5|$|Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, {{one more}} than the {{extremely}} stable configuration of the noble gas neon. Because of this and its low first <b>ionization</b> energy of 495.8 kJ/mol, the sodium atom {{is much more likely}} to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge. This process requires so little energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second <b>ionization</b> energy is very high (4562 kJ/mol), because the 10th electron is closer to the nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the Na+ cation.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new smoke detector is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an <b>ionization</b> chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the <b>ionization</b> and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the <b>ionization</b> smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E

5|$|The {{structural}} {{chemistry of}} boron {{is dominated by}} its small atomic size, and relatively high <b>ionization</b> energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low <b>ionization</b> energies. Instead, because of its small size and high <b>ionization</b> energies, the basic structural unit of boron (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E

When the temperature drops below the <b>ionization</b> potential, atoms become statistically favorable.

While it is known that a magnetic field, applied during irradiation, can improve the macroscopic absorbed dose distribution of electrons in the tumor region, effects on the microscopic distribution of energy depositions and <b>ionizations</b> have not yet been investigated. An effect on the number of <b>ionizations</b> in a DNA segment, which is related to initial DNA damage in form of complex strand breaks, could be beneficial in radiation therapy.

In the case that no magnetic field is applied, nanodosimetric results obtained with Geant 4 -DNA were compared with those from the PTB track structure code. The obtained results suggest that any potential enhancement of complexity of DNA strand breaks induced by irradiation in a magnetic field is not related to modifications of the low-energy secondary electrons track structure...|$|R
