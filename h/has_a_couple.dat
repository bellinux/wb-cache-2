5|$|There {{is a form}} sold as a Banksia (spinulosa) cunninghamii variant, {{propagated}} by Bournda Plants of Tura Beach on the NSW south coast. The plants reach 70cm {{after four}} years and have black-styled gold inflorescences. The form came from David Shiels of Wakiti Nursery in Victoria, who got it from Alf Salkin.

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Peggy's {{day and a}} heated {{argument}} with her boyfriend Abe, over her preoccupation with work and the effect this has on their sex life. The argument ends with Abe's leaving in a huff. After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu trip to a Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept. Frustrated, she leaves work, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of drinks, and goes to see the film Born Free (1966). She sees a young man smoking marijuana behind her, partakes herself, and eventually gives him a hand job. She returns to her office to see Ginsberg arguing with his father. After being told off by Ginsberg for eavesdropping, she falls asleep in Don's office. She awakens to a call from Don, who seems alarmed for incomprehensible reasons. Don hangs up on her, and Peggy returns to her office. When Peggy asks about Ginsberg's life, Ginsberg initially {{claims to be a}} Martian, stating that Morris Ginsberg is not his father. Michael was born in a Nazi concentration camp and, after its liberation, Morris claimed him from a Swedish orphanage when Michael was 5 years old. Peggy returns home, affected by this story, and calls Abe. She tells him about Ginsberg and asks him to come over to be with her.|$|E

25|$|In fact, {{each city}} <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of {{distinct}} advantages {{that the other}} city lacks—Sudbury is at the centre of a larger economic sphere due to the city's, and Northeastern Ontario's, larger population, but Thunder Bay is advantaged by air, rail and shipping traffic due to its prime location along major continental transportation routes. The Thunder Bay International Airport is the third busiest airport in Ontario after Toronto Pearson International Airport and Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, carrying some 600,000 passengers in 2004 with over 100 flights and four international flights daily. Sudbury's economy, in which the largest sectors of employment are government-related fields such as education and health care, is somewhat more diversified than Thunder Bay's, which is still based primarily on natural resources and manufacturing. Yet {{in the era of}} government cutbacks, Thunder Bay's economy has been less prone to recession and unemployment.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{reason for}} varying {{notation}} {{is due to}} the theory of point processes, which <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of mathematical interpretations. For example, a simple Poisson point process may be considered as a random set, which suggests the notation , implying that [...] is a random point belonging to or being an element of the Poisson point process [...] Another, more general, interpretation is to consider a Poisson or any other point process as a random counting measure, [...] so one can write the number of points of a Poisson point process [...] being found or located in some (Borel measurable) region [...] as , which is a random variable. These different interpretations results in notation being used from mathematical fields such as measure theory and set theory.|$|E
