Many early Claude cycle designs used a surface condenser since their performance was well understood. However, direct contact condensers offer significant disadvantages. As cold water rises in the intake pipe, the pressure decreases to the point where gas begins to evolve.

Experiments simulating conditions in the warm water intake pipe indicated about 30% of the dissolved gas evolves in the top [...] of the tube.
