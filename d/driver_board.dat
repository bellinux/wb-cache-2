5000|$|Golly! Ghost! (Gorī! Gōsuto!) is an electro-mechanical/video game hybrid {{released}} by Namco in 1990; it runs upon Namco System 2 hardware, and employs a diorama which {{is controlled by}} the game's <b>driver</b> <b>board</b> to open and close mechanical doors which are connected to solenoids, much like the moveable items on a pinball table. The diorama has five 24-volt globe lights that come on only during gameplay to light up the rooms - and they are all on when the game is being played during the shooting scenes, and off for the cutscenes, title screen, and high scores. The globes are not individually controlled, and are either all on or off; the <b>driver</b> <b>board</b> powers the diorama unit's solenoids and lights via several connectors on the <b>driver</b> <b>board</b> and the guns also plug into the <b>driver</b> <b>board</b> via another small connector (it was the first Namco game to use them). It was also the fourth game from Namco to allow scores not ending in [...] "0" [...] (after Hopping Mappy, 1986, Bakutotsu Kijūtei, 1988 and Metal Hawk, also 1988). In 2011, the game was adapted into a webcomic for Namco Bandai's ShiftyLook webcomic service.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a control hardware and software for a nano-fiber electro-spinning system. The hardware consists of motor <b>driver</b> <b>boards,</b> a high DC voltage board, and a main control board. The user interface software on PC is developed using Visual Studio C # 2010 express edition. The motor <b>driver</b> <b>boards</b> are controlled by an ATmega 8 microcontroller IC, while the main board is controlled by an ATmega 128 microcontroller IC. Communication between the main board and the motor <b>driver</b> <b>boards</b> uses the inter integrated circuit (I 2 C), while communication between PC and the main board uses a serial communication at a baud rate of 9, 600 bps. The high DC voltage generator is designed to have an output of 0 - 25 kV. High DC voltage output is configurable by giving a combination of low logic and high impedance into a six bit input. The result show that maximum output of high DC voltage is 25. 025 kV with formula of curve is y = 1 x – 0. 0244 with R 2 = 0. 9998 and PC software interface can work very well. Polymer flow rate can be configured from PC interface software via I 2 C connected to the main board. The flow rate y follows the RPM setting x, according to the formula y = 0. 954 x – 0. 0099 with R 2 = 1. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) for morphology analysis of PVDF copolymer composite nano-fiber shows that the average diameter of the resulted fiber is 136. 43 nm, when output high DC voltage is set to 15 kV and speed of syringe pump is set to 5 RPM.    </div...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a range of techniques useful for constructing analog and digital circuits for operation in a liquid Helium environment (4. 2 K), using commercially available low power components. The challenges encountered in designing cryogenic electronics include finding components that can function usefully {{in the cold and}} possess low enough power dissipation so as not to heat the systems they are designed to measure. From design, test, and integration perspectives it is useful for components to operate similarly at room and cryogenic temperatures; however this is not a necessity. Some of the circuits presented here have been used successfully in the MUSTANG and in the GISMO camera to build a complete digital to analog multiplexer (which will be referred to as the Cryogenic Address <b>Driver</b> <b>board).</b> Many of the circuit elements described are of a more general nature rather than specific to the Cryogenic Address <b>Driver</b> <b>board,</b> and were studied {{as a part of a}} more comprehensive approach to addressing a larger set of cryogenic electronic needs...|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{have been}} working in the field of virtual reality (VR) for many decades. It allows users to immerse {{themselves}} in the realistic-looking world. However, no matter how excellent and brilliant this synthetic world is, it cannot replace the real world. Instead of creating an artificial world for users, we can augment our real world. This is the goal of Augmented Reality (AR). AR refers to computer displays that integrate 3 -D virtual objects into 3 -D real environment in real time. Thus, AR is to supplement reality, but not replace it completely. An AR system was designed to provide an enhanced view of the real world through a video see-through head-mounted display. A hardware <b>driver</b> <b>board</b> was built as a bridge between the input sources and the liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS) micro-display.

Later, it will move into the topic of the design of the hardware <b>driver</b> <b>board</b> for video-front AR system. Furthermore, a video-back AR system and the specifications will be discussed.
