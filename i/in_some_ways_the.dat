5|$|<b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> {{run-up to}} Plataea resembled {{that at the}} Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo's {{offensive}} {{performance was}} <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> opposite of Connecticut's: while UConn dominated {{on the ground}} and barely passed the ball, Buffalo struggled with the run but had a good day passing. The Bulls ran for a total of 24yards on the game; James Starks accounted for 25yards on thirteencarries and scored a touchdown, while RB Brandon Termilus ran threetimes for fiveyards. Their total was partially offset by Drew Willy, who lost sixyards on three rushing attempts. Willy had a much more successful day passing, completing 29 out of 43passes for 213yards and oneinterception. Namaan Roosevelt led the Buffalo receivers with 90yards on eightcatches; of the five other Bulls who received passes, WR Brett Hamlin caught fourpasses for 54yards, TE Jesse Rack caught three for 22yards, RB Starks caught 11 for 21yards, WR Ernest Jackson caught two for 17yards, and WR Gary Rice caught one for 9yards.|$|E
5|$|The deaths {{caused by}} World War I were {{difficult}} for post-war societies to cope with: their unprecedented scale challenged existing methods of grieving. Furthermore, an expectation had arisen {{during the war}} that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, {{even if they were}} low ranking members of the military. One method used to address this was the inclusion of lists of names. In part, this was a response to the practical problem of commemorating such large numbers of dead, but it carried additional symbolic importance; <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>the</b> physical presence of a name acted to compensate for an absent body. The lists could vary in size from the 21 names listed in a small English village like East Ilsley, to the 54,896 names inscribed on the Menin Gate and the 73,357 on the Thiepval Memorial.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy is <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> same {{and in some ways}} different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, {{it does not mean that}} God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{possibly}} {{influenced by the}} minimalism of the International Style, a second renovation of the Sanctuary took place. The mid-20th-century renovation largely ignored the architectural history of the church. Louis Comfort Tiffany's paint and stenciling was obscured by a coat of light gray paint, and the purple Tiffany glass installed over the stained glass was removed. The oculus of the cupola was closed up. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> removal of decoration recalled the congregation's Puritan roots.|$|E
25|$|Burgundy is <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> most terroir-oriented {{region in}} France; immense {{attention}} is paid to the area of origin, and in which of the region's 400 types of soil a wine's grapes are grown. As opposed to Bordeaux, where classifications are producer-driven and awarded to individual chateaux, Burgundy classifications are geographically-focused. A specific vineyard or region will bear a given classification, regardless of the wine's producer. This focus is reflected on the wine's labels, where appellations are most prominent and producers' names often appear at the bottom in much smaller text.|$|E
25|$|Cyberpunk {{themes are}} widely visible in anime and manga. In Japan, where cosplay is popular {{and not only}} {{teenagers}} display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson's Neuromancer, whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in Chiba, one of Japan's largest industrial areas, although {{at the time of}} writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways.</b> <b>The</b> exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the mid 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.|$|E

25|$|During these centuries, many Venetians {{moved to}} the island. Because of its {{association}} with the ruling elite, {{by the end of}} the 15th century, the influence of the Italian language and culture (including <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> Roman Catholic church) assumed a predominant role in the island. Until the second half of the 20th century the Veneto da mar was spoken in Corfu, and the local Greek language assimilated a large number of Italian and Venetian words, many of which are still common today. Indeed, even before the fall of the Byzantine Empire much of the population in Corfu spoke the Veneto da mar or the Mediterranean Lingua Franca Sabir as a second, or first, language.|$|E
25|$|Deuterium is <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite}} of helium-4, in that while helium-4 is very stable {{and difficult to}} destroy, deuterium is only marginally stable and easy to destroy. The temperatures, time, and densities were sufficient to combine a substantial fraction of the deuterium nuclei to form helium-4 but insufficient to carry the process further using helium-4 in the next fusion step. BBN did not convert all of the deuterium in the universe to helium-4 due to the expansion that cooled the universe and reduced the density, and so cut that conversion short before it could proceed any further. One consequence of this is that, unlike helium-4, the amount of deuterium is very sensitive to initial conditions. The denser the initial universe was, the more deuterium would be converted to helium-4 before time ran out, and the less deuterium would remain.|$|E
25|$|As {{the show}} progressed into the 1990s, EastEnders still {{featured}} hard-hitting {{issues such as}} Mark Fowler discovering he was HIV positive in 1991, {{the death of his}} wife Gill from an AIDS-related illness in 1992, murder, adoption, abortion, Peggy Mitchell's battle with breast cancer, and Phil Mitchell's alcoholism and violence towards wife Kathy. Mental health issues were confronted in 1996 when 16-year-old Joe Wicks developed schizophrenia following the off-screen death of his sister in a car crash. The long-running storyline of Mark Fowler's HIV was so successful in raising awareness that in 1999, a survey by the National Aids Trust found teenagers got most of their information about HIV from the soap, though one campaigner noted that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> storyline was not reflective of what was happening at the time as the condition was more common among the gay community. Still, heterosexual Mark struggled with various issues connected to his HIV status, including public fears of contamination, a marriage breakdown connected to his inability to have children and the side effects of combination therapies.|$|E
