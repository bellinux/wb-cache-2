40|$|Using the FiNLIE {{solution}} of the AdS/CFT Y-system, we compute the anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator in planar N= 4 SYM up to eight loops, i. e. up to the leading <b>double</b> <b>wrapping</b> order. At this order a non reducible Euler-Zagier sum, zeta(1, 2, 8), appears for the first time. We find that at all orders in perturbation, every spectral-dependent quantity of the Y-system is expressed through multiple Hurwitz zeta functions, hence we provide a Mathematica package to manipulate these functions, including the particular case of Euler-Zagier sums. Furthermore, we conjecture that only Euler-Zagier sums can appear in the answer for the anomalous dimension at any order in perturbation theory. We also resum the leading transcendentality terms of the anomalous dimension at all orders, obtaining a simple result in terms of Bessel functions. Finally, we demonstrate that exact Bethe equations should be related to an absence of poles condition that becomes especially nontrivial at <b>double</b> <b>wrapping.</b> Comment: 49 pages.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{behaviour}} of basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) composites retrofitted RCC piles subjected to axial compression loads. Currently the awareness of using FRP increases rapidly in engineering fields and also among public. Retrofitting becomes vital for aged and damaged concrete structures, piles, and so forth, to improve its load carrying capacity and to extend the service life. The load carrying capacity of piles retrofitted with basalt unidirectional fabric was studied experimentally. 15 nos. of RCC end bearing pile elements were cast with same reinforcement for axial compression experiment. Three piles were used as conventional elements, another 3 piles were used as <b>double</b> BFRP <b>wrapped</b> pile elements, and remaining 9 piles were used as retrofitted piles with BFRP <b>double</b> <b>wrapping</b> after preloaded to 30 %, 60 %, and 90 % of ultimate load of conventional element. The effects of retrofitting of RCC pile elements were observed and a mathematical prediction was developed for calculation of retrofitting strength. The stress vs. strain relationship curve, load vs. deformation curve, preloaded elements strength losses are tabulated and plotted. Besides, crack patterns of conventional elements and tearing BFRP wrapped elements were also observed. The BFRP wrapped elements and retrofitted elements withstand more axial compressive load than the conventional elements...|$|R

30|$|A {{reversible}} CBD ligation {{model was}} used in the HGF B, EGF B, IGF B, TGF B, and Control B groups. The CBD was dissected gently from the surrounding tissues and a 1 – 2  cm segment was released and prepared for ligation. A silicone tube clung around the prepared segment and a silicone band was <b>double</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the tube. The silicone band was tightened enough to stop the flow of bile right into the duodenum and a metal mini clip was placed below the silicone band. The goal of the procedure was to perform a procedure that would reliably and simply reverse jaundice without wounding the CBD and duodenum while releasing the ligation. On the 7 th day of the operation, the CBD dissected, the adhesions divided into and the clip {{at the root of the}} band was gently removed. The silicone band was also taken out (Kirkland et al. 2010). All treatment groups in the reversible jaundice groups (HGF B, EGF B, IGF B, and TGF B) underwent growth factor treatments with the same dose as the irreversible groups for 5  days.

40|$|Abstract: Recticel Bedding Hulshout is a {{mattress}} manufacturer. The company intends {{to build a}} new packing line as a final step in their production lay-out redesign project. The objective of this study consists in answering the question whether, given the production volumes, the mix of mattresses (without packing, once <b>wrapped</b> or <b>double</b> <b>wrapped)</b> is operationally feasible within different scenarios. The new lay-out of the packing line can be modelled as a typical multi product job shop with general arrivals and general processing. The products (units of different modes of mattresses, a mode being a typical packing form of {{a mattress}}) enter the system individually and are processed as such at all manipulation steps. The mode depends on the upstream production line and is characterised by a deterministic routing. A general open queueing network and a parallel simulation model have been developed. We are able to show that the new lay-out is feasible, taking into account the different scenarios. Methodologically, we reveal that both an approximated queueing network and simulation are suitable approaches to give an answer to the managerial questions. However, the queueing model has the advantage of being a much more flexible, in terms of conducting what-if scenarios and computational efficient approach...|$|R

40|$|Adapting {{a method}} {{recently}} proposed by C. Marboe and D. Volin for N= 4 super-Yang-Mills, we develop an algorithm for a systematic weak coupling {{expansion of the}} spectrum of anomalous dimensions in the sl(2) -like sector of planar N= 6 super-Chern-Simons. The method relies on the Quantum Spectral Curve formulation {{of the problem and}} the expansion is written in terms of the interpolating function h(λ), with coefficients expressible as combinations of Euler-Zagier sums with alternating signs. We present explicit results up to 12 loops (six nontrivial orders) for various twist L= 1 and L= 2 operators, corresponding to triple and <b>double</b> <b>wrapping</b> terms, respectively, which are {{beyond the reach of the}} Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz as well as Lüscher's corrections. The algorithm works for generic values of L and S and in principle can be used to compute arbitrary orders of the weak coupling expansion.

50|$|When {{starting}} out in Drive range, low gear was automatically selected {{and the low}} band applied under pressure modulated by a vacuum modulator which sensed engine output and adjusted clutch and band apply pressures to provide smooth engagement without slip. As the vehicle accelerated, rear pump output would increase and initiate a shift to direct. The rear pump pressures were modified by a throttle valve, and governor, both of which could delay the upshift, or even trigger a forced downshift at driver command. Full throttle downshifts were achieved by the throttle valve which permitted the transmission to stay in low range or be forced into downshifting to speeds between 45 - 50 mph. At speeds under 35 mph, heavy throttle would delay upshifts, or initiate a forced 'detent touch' kickdown for better performance. When Low Range or Reverse are selected, the apply pressures are not modulated and the full line pressure of the transmission is applied to ensure positive engagement. The multiple plate reverse clutch and <b>double</b> <b>wrap</b> low band design offered a slight buffer to engagement to prevent harshness even under high apply pressures. A quite sophisticated valve body timed shifts and apply pressures carefully in Drive range to ensure smoothness and prevent 'hunting' between gears, which is a common complaint of small cars with automatic transmission. Corvair Powerglides had a good reputation for reliability and were ordered on {{a large majority of}} Corvair passenger cars.|$|R
50|$|Histone {{methylation}} is {{a process}} by which methyl groups are transferred to amino acids of histone proteins that make up nucleosomes, which the DNA <b>double</b> helix <b>wraps</b> around to form chromosomes. Methylation of histones can either increase or decrease transcription of genes, depending on which amino acids in the histones are methylated, and how many methyl groups are attached. Methylation events that weaken chemical attractions between histone tails and DNA increase transcription, because they enable the DNA to uncoil from nucleosomes so that transcription factor proteins and RNA polymerase can access the DNA. This process is critical for the regulation of gene expression that allows different cells to express different genes.|$|R

40|$|Storing {{foods in}} the freezer {{is a great way}} to {{maintain}} their quality, freshness, and nutritional value. The recommended freezer temperature (0 degrees Fahrenheit) will keep food safe to eat indefinitely. Depending on the food, the color, flavor, and texture will eventually deteriorate. Be careful. Harmful bacteria are not killed by freezing temperatures and could begin to grow once the food is thawed. The Colder, the Better Freezers should be kept at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. There are a few extra things you can do in addition to turning down the dial to ensure a cold freezer. Keeping cool is all about air flow, so reduce the number of items {{in the freezer}} and add shelf space. This will allow the air to circulate in the freezer more efficiently for a more thorough freeze. Keep foods away from the back vent. Blocking this vent means blocking the air circulation and a warmer freezer. Packaging Remember these three rules when wrapping for freezer storage: wrap tightly, wrap again, and wrap individual portions separately. <b>Wrapping</b> tightly and <b>double</b> <b>wrapping</b> help to maintain quality and prevent freezer burn. Wrapping individual portions separately lets you remove some of the food to prepare without thawing food that is not needed for your meal. Use only moisture- and vapor-proof materials for storing solid foods. Good choices are polyethylene bags, freezer film wraps, and aluminum foil over a layer of plastic film next to the food. Acid foods may react to the aluminum if in direct contact. For liqui...|$|R
