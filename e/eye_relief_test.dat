50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> — <b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> is the {{distance}} from the rear eyepiece lens to the exit pupil or eye point. It is {{the distance}} the observer must position his or her eye behind the eyepiece in order to see an unvignetted image. The longer the focal length of the eyepiece, the greater the <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> Typical telescopic sights may have <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> ranging from 25 mm to over 100 mm, but telescopic sights intended for scout rifles or handguns need much longer <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> to present an unvignetted image. Telescopic sights with relatively long <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> are favourable to avoid recoil induced facial and eye injuries and use in instances where it is difficult to hold the eyepiece steady. <b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> can be particularly important for eyeglass wearers. The eye of an eyeglass wearer is typically further from the eye piece which necessitates a longer <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> in order to still see the entire field of view.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> is a {{particularly}} important (but often overlooked) parameter for spectacle wearers if the full field of view is to be visible. Although magnification, objective lens diameter and field of view (either in degrees or m @1000m) are often shown {{on the body of}} the monocular, <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> virtually never is (except perhaps to say [...] "long eye relief" [...] or [...] "LER"). Early optics tended to have short <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> (sub 10mm) but more contemporary designs are now much better. At least 15mm is desirable - ideally nearer 20mm - for spectacle wearers. (See table of <b>eye</b> <b>reliefs</b> below, noting the best in class, Opticron 5x30 at 25mm and Opticron 8x42 DBA at 21mm). <b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> can seriously compromise the field of view if too short, so even if an optic has a good field of view specification, without an accompanying long <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> the benefit of the wide view will not be obtained (again, only applying to spectacle wearers). Good <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> can greatly be facilitated by the eye lens diameter. The photograph below shows a comparison between two 8x monoculars, {{the one on the left}} typical of a 1980s design and with a relatively small eyepiece lens diameter (11mm) and sub 10mm <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> The one on the right is more contemporary - from 2016 - and with a relatively large eyepiece diameter (24mm) and approx. 15mm <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> This large eyepiece lens not only helps <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> but also helps to create a wider field of view.|$|R
50|$|The optimum <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> {{distance}} also {{varies with}} application. For example, a rifle scope needs {{a very long}} <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> to prevent recoil from causing it to strike the observer.|$|R
5000|$|The Weaver rail {{above the}} action and barrel allow either for {{conventional}} positioning of a scope with normal 1.5 in - 3.5 <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> or for the forward placement of a [...] "scout scope" [...] with intermediate or long <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> The latter is more faithful to Cooper's Scout concept, and the Steyr-Mannlicher rifle can be ordered from the factory with a low-magnification Leupold scope with long <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> {{typically}} {{ranges from}} about 2 mm to 20 mm, {{depending on the}} construction of the eyepiece. Long focal-length eyepieces usually have ample <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> but short focal-length eyepieces are more problematic. Until recently, and still quite commonly, eyepieces of a short-focal length have had a short <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> Good design guidelines suggest a minimum of 5-6 mm to accommodate the eyelashes of the observer to avoid discomfort. Modern designs with many lens elements, however, can correct for this, and viewing at high power becomes more comfortable. This is especially the case for spectacle wearers, who may need up to 20 mm of <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> to accommodate their glasses.|$|R
50|$|The <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> of {{an optical}} {{instrument}} (such as a telescope, a microscope, or binoculars) is {{the distance from}} the last surface of an eyepiece within which the user's eye can obtain the full viewing angle. If a viewer's eye is outside this distance, a reduced field of view will be obtained. The calculation of <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is complex, though generally, the higher the magnification and the larger the intended field-of-view, the shorter the <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|R
50|$|The eye {{needs to}} be held at a certain {{distance}} behind the eye lens of an eyepiece to see images properly through it. This distance is called the <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> A larger <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> means that the optimum position is farther from the eyepiece, making it easier to view an image. However, if the <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is too large it can be uncomfortable to hold the eye in the correct position {{for an extended period of}} time, for which reason some eyepieces with long <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> have cups behind the eye lens to aid the observer in maintaining the correct observing position. The eye pupil should coincide with the exit pupil, the image of the entrance pupil, which in the case of an astronomical telescope corresponds to the object glass.|$|R
50|$|The <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> {{given in}} product {{specifications}} {{does not always}} give a realistic view of what a user can expect. Although eye-cups can usually be folded down to allow the spectacle wearer {{to get closer to}} binocular eyepieces, there are sometimes lens mountings that do not allow the theoretical <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> to be obtained. A better measure for those with strict needs would be one that takes account of this available <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> the theoretical value less any thickness of the lens' rims. This point can account for confusion in performance and is rarely expressed clearly.|$|R
50|$|An early {{practical}} refractor telescope based {{telescopic sight}} {{was built in}} 1880 by August Fiedler (Stronsdorf, Austria), forestry commissioner of Prince Reuss.Later telescopic sights with extra long <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> became available for handgun and scout rifle use. A historic example of a telescopic sight with a long <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is the German ZF41 which was used during World War II on Karabiner 98k rifles.|$|R
50|$|Because {{there is}} no magnification, the shooter need not worry about {{parallax}} or <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> The long <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> makes red dot sights appropriate for firearms with heavy recoil that might drive a conventional short <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> telescopic sight into the shooter's eye. Since dot sights can be mounted at any distance from the shooter's eye with no issues of focus, military rifle mounts usually place the sight in any mechanically-convenient mounting position, such as the carrying handle of the M16 rifle, or on a rail system (typically a Picatinny rail) {{on top of the}} rifle. This leaves plenty of room for night vision equipment to be used with the red dot sight.|$|R

50|$|The Plössl is an {{eyepiece}} usually {{consisting of}} two sets of doublets, designed by Georg Simon Plössl in 1860. Since the two doublets can be identical this design is sometimes called a symmetrical eyepiece. The compound Plössl lens provides a large 50° or more apparent field of view, along with relatively large FOV. This makes this eyepiece ideal {{for a variety of}} observational purposes including deep-sky and planetary viewing. The chief disadvantage of the Plössl optical design is short <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> compared to an orthoscopic since the Plössl <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is restricted to about 70-80% of focal length. The short <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is more critical in short focal lengths below about 10 mm, when viewing can become uncomfortable especially for people wearing glasses.|$|R
5000|$|For a shooter, <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> is also {{a safety}} consideration. If the <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> of a {{telescopic}} sight is too short, leaving the eye close to the sight, the firearms recoil can force the optic to strike the skin around the shooters eye, leaving a cut. This is frequently called the [...] "idiot cut" [...] due to the obvious and long-lasting nature of such a mistake. Typical <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> distances for telescopic sights are often between one and four inches (25 to 100 mm), {{as opposed to the}} much shorter 15 to 17 mm for typical binoculars. The exit pupil widths in rifle sights are designed to be larger than the eyes pupil, to allow for a range of motion without vignetting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>relief</b> {{distance}} can {{be particularly}} important for eyeglass wearers and shooters. The eye of an eyeglass wearer is typically further from the eyepiece so needs a longer <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> in order to still see the entire field of view. A simple practical test {{as to whether or}} not spectacles limit the field of view can be conducted by viewing first without spectacles and then again with them. Ideally there should be no difference in the field.|$|R
50|$|MK2 {{versions}} are recognised by a scope rail, which was milled {{into the top}} of the cylinder allowing the user to add a special telescopic sight with a longer <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|R
5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed <b>eye</b> <b>relief),</b> and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|R
50|$|The <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> {{property}} {{should not}} be confused with the exit pupil width of an instrument: that is best described as the width of the cone of light that is available to the viewer at the exact <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> distance. An exit pupil larger than the observers pupil wastes some light, but allows for some fumbling in side-to-side movement without vignetting or clipping. Conversely, an exit pupil smaller than the eyes pupil will have all of its available light used, but since it cannot tolerate much side-to-side error in eye alignment, will often result in a vignetted or clipped image.|$|R
50|$|The König {{eyepiece}} has a concave-convex positive doublet and a plano-convex singlet. The strongly convex {{surfaces of}} the doublet and singlet face and (nearly) touch each other. The doublet has its concave surface facing the light source and the singlet has its almost flat (slightly convex) surface facing the eye. It was designed in 1915 by German optician Albert König (1871−1946) as a simplified Abbe. The design allows for high magnification with remarkably high <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> — the highest <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> proportional to focal length of any design before the Nagler, in 1979. The field of view of about 55° makes its performance similar to the Plössl, with the advantage of requiring one less lens.|$|R
5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|R
50|$|Punctal plugs are {{inserted}} into the puncta to block tear drainage. For {{people who have not}} found dry <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> with drugs, punctal plugs may help. They are reserved for people with moderate or severe dry eye when other medical treatment has not been adequate.|$|R

50|$|In {{the event}} that a {{spectacle}} wearer cannot obtain the <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> that they require, some cameras and microscopes allow prescription lenses to be fitted onto their eyepieces. In this way, the user can temporarily dispense with glasses {{in favor of the}} lens mounted on the optics. Although this method does not afford good incidental vision for the field around them, it might still be of use to some.|$|R
50|$|There are {{binoculars}} {{designed specifically}} for civilian and military use at sea. Hand held models will be 5× to 7× but with very large prism sets combined with eyepieces designed to give generous <b>eye</b> <b>relief.</b> This optical combination prevents the image vignetting or going dark when the binoculars are pitching and vibrating relative to the viewer's eye. Large, high-magnification models with large objectives are also used in fixed mountings.|$|R

50|$|Erfle eyepieces are {{designed}} to have wide field of view (about 60 degrees), but they are unusable at high powers because they suffer from astigmatism and ghost images. However, with lens coatings at low powers (focal lengths of 20 mm and up) they are acceptable, and at 40 mm they can be excellent. Erfles are very popular because they have large eye lenses, good <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> and can be very comfortable to use.|$|R
50|$|The eyepieces of {{binoculars}} are usually permanently {{mounted in the}} binoculars, causing {{them to have a}} pre-determined magnification and field of view. With telescopes and microscopes, however, eyepieces are usually interchangeable. By switching the eyepiece, the user can adjust what is viewed. For instance, eyepieces will often be interchanged to increase or decrease the magnification of a telescope. Eyepieces also offer varying fields of view, and differing degrees of <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> for the person who looks through them.|$|R
50|$|Wide field {{binoculars}} typically utilize {{some kind}} of Erfle configuration, patented in 1921. These have five or six elements in three groups. The groups may be two achromatic doublets with a double convex singlet between them or may all be achromatic doublets. These eyepieces tend not to perform as well as Kellner eyepieces at high power because they suffer from astigmatism and ghost images. However they have large eye lenses, excellent <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> and are comfortable to use at lower powers.|$|R
5000|$|The 4-element orthographic {{eyepiece}} {{consists of}} a plano-convex singlet eye lens and a cemented convex-convex triplet field lens achromatic field lens. This gives the eyepiece a nearly perfect image quality and good <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> but a narrow apparent field of view — about 40°-45°. It was invented by Ernst Abbe in 1880. It is called [...] "orthoscopic" [...] or [...] "orthographic" [...] because of its low degree of distortion and is also sometimes called an [...] "ortho" [...] or [...] "Abbe".|$|R
50|$|The {{adjustable}} iron sights (closed type) {{consist of}} a rotating rear diopter drum and a front post installed in a hooded ring. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation {{with the use of}} a special tool, being adjusted at the factory for firing at 25m with standard 124 grains FMJ 9×19mm NATO ammunition; the drum provides four different apertures of varying width used to adjust the light entrance in the diopter system, according to the user's <b>eye</b> <b>relief</b> and tactical situation.|$|R
50|$|These eyepieces {{work well}} with the very long focal length telescopes (in Huygens day they were used with single element long focal length non-achromatic refracting telescopes, {{including}} very long focal length aerial telescopes). This optical design is now considered obsolete since with today's shorter focal length telescopes the eyepiece suffers from short <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> high image distortion, chromatic aberration, and a very narrow apparent field of view. Since these eyepieces are cheap to make they can often be found on inexpensive telescopes and microscopes.|$|R
50|$|Though {{useful for}} sharpshooting with normal {{infantry}} units, the design was generally rejected by sniper schools and disliked by snipers, because the 1.5x magnifying scope was deemed insufficient for shooting effectively over long distances. Problems were the scope's extreme <b>eye</b> <b>relief,</b> poor functioning in bad light and low magnifying power. Nonetheless, lack of better scopes {{made that the}} Zf-41 was used by snipers at {{the early stages of}} the war against the Soviet Union, though many snipers preferred captured Soviet rifles and custom-equipped German rifles with civilian scopes such as the vintage Gewehr 98.|$|R
