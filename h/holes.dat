5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator <b>holes.</b> This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator <b>holes</b> retain water during the dry season and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive the dry season by seeking refuge in alligator <b>holes</b> are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator <b>holes,</b> as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator <b>holes</b> are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator <b>holes</b> tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Monica Guica, Thomas Hartman, Wei Song, and Andrew Strominger {{showed that}} the ideas of AdS/CFT could {{nevertheless}} be used to understand certain astrophysical black <b>holes.</b> More precisely, their results apply to black <b>holes</b> that are approximated by extremal Kerr black <b>holes,</b> which have the largest possible angular momentum compatible with a given mass. They showed that such black <b>holes</b> have an equivalent description in terms of conformal field theory. The Kerr/CFT correspondence was later extended to black <b>holes</b> with lower angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-resolution}} spectra {{and images}} {{provided by the}} HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black <b>holes</b> in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black <b>holes</b> would {{be found at the}} centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black <b>holes</b> are probably common to the centers of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black <b>holes</b> and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black <b>holes</b> in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black <b>holes.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A “clean ” black <b>hole</b> {{is a black}} <b>hole</b> in vacuum such as the Schwarzschild black <b>hole.</b> However in real {{physical}} systems, {{there are}} matter fields around a black <b>hole.</b> Such a black <b>hole</b> is called a “dirty black hole”. In this paper, the effect of matter fields on the black <b>hole</b> and the greybody factor is investigated. The results show that matter fields make a black <b>hole</b> smaller. They can increase the potential energy to a black <b>hole</b> to obstruct Hawking radiation to propagate. This causes the greybody factor of a dirty black <b>hole</b> {{to be less than}} that of a clean black <b>hole...</b>|$|R

Indeed, two IS layers are identified in <b>Hole</b> C 0008 A whereas six IS zones are identified in <b>Hole</b> C 0008 C.

5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black <b>holes.</b> Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black <b>holes.</b> The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black <b>holes.</b> Eventually, black <b>holes</b> would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation.

40|$|Can we {{determine}} a spin parameter {{of a black}} <b>hole</b> by observation of a black <b>hole</b> shadow in an accretion disk? In order to answer this question, we make a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis of a shape and a position of a black <b>hole</b> shadow casted by a rotating black <b>hole</b> on an optically thick accretion disk and its dependence on an angular momentum of a black <b>hole.</b> We have found black <b>hole</b> shadows with a quite similar size and a shape for largely different black <b>hole</b> spin parameters and a same black <b>hole</b> mass. Thus, it is practically difficult to {{determine a}} spin parameter of a black <b>hole</b> from a size and a shape of a black <b>hole</b> shadow in an accretion disk. We newly introduce a bisector axis of a black <b>hole</b> shadow named a shadow axis. For a rotating black <b>hole</b> a shape and a position of a black <b>hole</b> shadow are not symmetric {{with respect to a}} rotation axis of a black <b>hole</b> shadow. So, in this case the minimum interval between a mass center of a black <b>hole</b> and a shadow axis is finite. An extent of this minimum interval is roughly proportional to a spin parameter of a black <b>hole</b> for a fixed inclination angle between a rotation axis of a black <b>hole</b> and a direction of an observer. In order to measure a spin parameter of a black <b>hole,</b> if a shadow axis is determined observationally, it is crucially important to determine a position of a mass center of a black <b>hole</b> in a region of a black <b>hole</b> shadow.

In order to answer this question, we make a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis of a shape and a position of a black <b>hole</b> shadow casted by a rotating black <b>hole</b> on an optically thick accretion disk and its dependence on an angular momentum of a black <b>hole.</b> We consider two types of inner edges, an event horizon and a marginally stable orbit, of accretion disks. We have found black <b>hole</b> shadows with a quite similar size and a shape for largely different black <b>hole</b> spin parameters and a same black <b>hole</b> mass. Thus, it is practically difficult to {{determine a}} spin parameter of a black <b>hole</b> from a size and a shape of a black <b>hole</b> shadow in an accretion disk. On the other hand, a displacement of a black <b>hole</b> shadow from a rotation axis of a black <b>hole</b> {{is caused by a}} frame dragging effect in the vicinity of a black <b>hole.</b> The extent of the displacement largely depend on a black <b>hole</b> spin parameter. However, {{it is difficult to determine}} a position of a rotation axis of a black <b>hole</b> observationally. So, we can not practically measure a spin parameter of a black <b>hole</b> from the displacement from a rotation axis of a black <b>hole</b> shadow.

Adopted in 1976, the sudden-death playoff was originally formatted to start on the first hole, but was not needed {{for the first three}} years.

5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate <b>holes</b> in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory <b>holes</b> may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill <b>holes</b> in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this family}} are chiefly known for their {{characteristic}} behaviour; they mostly forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beak, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance.
