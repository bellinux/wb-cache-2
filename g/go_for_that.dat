Durocher served as Cubs manager until mid-1972, the season after Banks retired.

2500|$|Wilt Chamberlain {{was such}} a great player and {{dominant}} force that he would be certain to be on the floor in late-game situations if the score was close. [...] However, he {{was such a}} poor free throw shooter (51%) that if the opposition needed to employ intentional fouling late in the game, Chamberlain would always be that team's target. [...] Just as the opposition was eager to send Chamberlain to the free throw line because of his ineptitude there, Chamberlain himself was reluctant to <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> same reason. [...] This led to the spectacle of virtually an entire other game being held away from the ball and almost completely outside of the basketball game being played, as Chamberlain essentially played a de facto game of tag with defenders, attempting to run from and dodge them as they chased him trying to foul him.|$|E
