5|$|Before the {{downfall}} of Mobutu, a small navy operated on the Congo river. One of its installations was at the village of N'dangi near the presidential residence in Gbadolite. The port at N'dangi was the base for several patrol boats, <b>helicopters</b> <b>and</b> the presidential yacht.|$|E

5|$|C-17s {{have also}} {{supported}} ADF training. In this role they have moved <b>helicopters</b> <b>and</b> other equipment between Australian bases, and supported training deployments to the United States. In April 2010, {{members of the}} Australian Army's No. 176 (Air Dispatch) Squadron became the first paratroopers to jump from a non-American Globemaster; the type was first used to support training by the Army's Parachute Training School in June that year. A C-17 transported an Army M1 Abrams tank {{for the first time}} during a training exercise conducted on 11 May 2012. To mark the arrival of the RAAF's final Globemaster, four of the aircraft flew over Brisbane together on 22 November 2012. Each of the C-17s involved in the flight carried a different type of cargo to showcase the type's capabilities; A41-211 was configured for aeromedical evacuation tasks, another C-17 embarked an Abrams tank, one carried two Tiger <b>helicopters</b> <b>and</b> the fourth was loaded with several Bushmasters.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April, the {{evacuees}} {{were flown}} to U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand on HMH-462 <b>helicopters</b> <b>and</b> Amphibious Ready Group Alpha proceeded to the South China Sea to rendezvous with Task Force 76 as it stood by to implement Operation Frequent Wind, {{the evacuation of}} Saigon.|$|E
5|$|Option 3 {{was later}} revised {{to provide for}} the use of USMC {{helicopters}} together with USAF <b>helicopters</b> <b>and</b> C-130 Airborne Mission Command based in Thailand, and for the ground security force to be made up of marines rather than air force security police. The LZs were to be adjacent to the US Embassy in Phnom Penh.|$|E

5|$|She was {{converted}} to an anti-submarine warfare carrier in early 1956, re-designated CVS-21. She completed another {{tour of the}} western Pacific in late 1956 and early 1957, which was her tenth and final deployment to the area. In late 1957, the navy began experimenting {{with the concept of}} a carrier operating entirely with attack <b>helicopters,</b> <b>and</b> Boxer was used to test the concept.|$|E

5|$|Acoli {{then drove}} the car (a white Pontiac LeMans with Vermont license plates)—which {{contained}} Assata Shakur, who was wounded, and Zayd Shakur, who was dead or dying— down the road. The vehicle was chased by three patrol {{cars and the}} booths down the turnpike were alerted. Acoli then exited the car and, after being ordered to halt by a trooper, fled into the woods as the trooper emptied his gun. Assata Shakur then walked towards the trooper with her bloodied arms raised in surrender. Acoli was captured after a 36-hour manhunt—involving 400 people, state police <b>helicopters,</b> <b>and</b> bloodhounds. Zayd Shakur's {{body was found in}} a nearby gully along the road.|$|E
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, <b>helicopters,</b> <b>and</b> fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|At {{the opening}} of 1987, {{the last year of}} the war, the Libyan expeditionary force was still impressive, {{comprising}} 8,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, many multiple rocket launchers (rocket artillery) and regular artillery pieces, Mi-24 <b>helicopters</b> <b>and</b> sixty combat aircraft. These forces did not have a unified command, but were divided into an Operational Group South, active in the Tibesti with 2,500 men, and an Operational Group East, centered in Faya-Largeau.|$|E
5|$|Before {{and during}} the summit US {{president}} George W. Bush, British prime minister Tony Blair, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende made a plea to European NATO members to make more troops available for deployment in Afghanistan, remove the national caveats (i.e. national restrictions on how, when and where forces can be used) and start sending its troops into the conflict-ridden south of the country. According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L. Jones {{it was not the}} lack of combat troops and the caveats were the problem, but the lack of adequate <b>helicopters</b> <b>and</b> military intelligence to support airlift and on-the-ground operations.|$|E

The adjacent Ansel Adams Wilderness and John Muir Wilderness were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906.|$|E

Thousands of police and Carabinieri with <b>helicopters</b> <b>and</b> dogs combed Sicily in vain in search of the reporter. De Mauro’s body has never been found, a victim of the {{so-called}} lupara bianca, despite intensive search efforts by Palermo police assisted by top-level forces from Rome and even a special investigative committee of the Italian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in population after protective legislation was put into place, the Department of Conservation developed a management plan for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990. A draft plan was made available to the public for comment in 1991, and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from <b>helicopters,</b> <b>and</b> instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd. However, core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option. Trial musters were conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and were successful, although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses.|$|E

By 1972, it opened up service to east Greenland with a helicopter based in Tasiilaq, and established Greenlandair Charter. Mining at Maamorilik in the Uummannaq Fjord required still more <b>helicopters,</b> <b>and</b> the airline purchased Bell 206s for the route. Grønlandsfly also {{picked up a}} Danish government contract to fly reconnaissance missions regarding the sea ice around Greenland.|$|E
