50|$|<b>Dry-strength</b> additives, or dry-strengthening agents, are {{chemicals}} that improve paper strength normal conditions. These improve the paper's compression strength, bursting strength, tensile breaking strength, and delamination resistance. Typical chemicals used include cationic starch and polyacrylamide (PAM) derivatives. These substances work by binding fibers, often under {{the aid of}} aluminum ions in paper sheet.|$|E
40|$|Various {{hydrophilic}} polyelectrolytes, including {{cationic starch}} products, {{are used by}} papermakers to promote inter-fiber bonding and increase paper’s <b>dry-strength.</b> Thus, papermakers can meet customer require-ments with a lower net cost of materials, more recycled fibers, or higher mineral content. In the absence of polymeric additives, key mechanisms governing bond development between cellulosic fibers include capillary action, three-dimensional mixing of macromolecules on facing surfaces, conformability of the materials, and hydrogen bonding. <b>Dry-strength</b> additives need to adsorb efficiently onto fibers, have a hydrophilic character, and have a sufficiently high molecular mass. Though {{it is possible to}} achieve significant strength gains by optimal usage of individual polyelectrolytes, greater strength gains can be achieved by sequential addition of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Superior strength can be achieved by in-situ formation of polyelectrolyte com-plexes, followed by deposition of those complexes onto fiber surfaces. Polyampholytes also hold promise as efficient <b>dry-strength</b> additives. Opportunities for further increases in performance of <b>dry-strength</b> agents may involve fiber surface modification, self-assembled layers, and optimization of the dry film characteristics of <b>dry-strength</b> polymers or systems of polymers...|$|E

""The fourth {{confidential}} {{survey of}} selected raw materials consumed by U. S. basic {{pulp and paper}} manufacturers covered the years 1971 and 1972. This report summarizes reported and estimated consumption of white pigments and minerals; latexes for pigment binding, coating and saturation; papermaking additives, including agents for sizing, wet-strength, <b>dry-strength</b> and formation, and for improving retention, drainage and flocculation; {{and a group of}} 26 additional chemicals used in various pulping...|$|E
40|$|Sheets {{formed from}} glass microfibers had almost zero tensile {{strength}} {{in the absence of}} polymer treatment, but paper-like <b>dry-strength</b> was achieved if fiber suspensions were treated with combinations of a cationic and an anionic polyelectrolyte before sheet formation. Strength increases generally were maximized when the ratio between the cationic poly-(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and carboxymethylcellulose was within about 2 : 3 and 3 : 2 stoichiometry of charged groups on the macromolecules. Sequential addition of the polyelectrolytes to fiber slurry generally yielded higher strength than pre-mixing the polyelectrolytes before their addition. Significant effects were observed, depending on the ratio of the two polyelectrolytes, optional cationic pretreatment of the fibers, salt concentrations, and the elapsed time between mixing of polyelectrolytes and their addition to a fiber slurry. Time-dependent electrostatic interactions appear to control the deposition of polyelectrolyte complexes, and {{it was found that the}} details of chemical addition strategies can have major effects on the results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A polymer was {{synthesized}} by emulsion copolymerization of styrene (St), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and isoprene. Sodium dodecyl sulfate {{was used}} as emulsifier, while sodium persulfate was the initiator. The effect of the polymer on paper wet-strength and <b>dry-strength</b> was investigated. The polymer contains phenyl groups which confer hydrophobicity to fibers so as to improve paper wet performance, and epoxy groups that can react with carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups in fibers aiming to increase paper strength, and double bonds toward self-polymerization in certain condition. Prepared polymer was applied to make handsheets of wood pulp and the handsheets were cured by high temperature or UV radiation. The Raman spectra showed that the polymer contained hydrophobic benzene, epoxy groups and double bonds. The SEM analysis indicated that paper fracture was caused by fiber breakage, which supported {{the theory that the}} polymer could increase interfiber-bonding strength. The experimental results indicated that the best monomer molar ratio was 1 : 1 : 1, while the optimum reaction conditions were a temperature of 40 °C and a reaction time of 5 hours...|$|E
