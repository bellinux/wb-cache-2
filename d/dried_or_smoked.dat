25|$|Necrobia rufipes, {{commonly}} known as the red-legged ham beetle, is of particular importance in stored product entomology. N. rufipes infests <b>dried</b> <b>or</b> <b>smoked</b> meats, especially those products that are stored unwrapped for long periods of time. Adults feed {{on the surface of the}} products, while the larvae damage the meat by boring down usually in the fatty parts. N. rufipes has been recorded to have fed upon a large variety of items ranging from hides and dried figs to Egyptian mummies. In addition, products such as wool and silk can become infested, but not destroyed.|$|E

50|$|The adult beetles are 3.5 - 7.0 mm long, convex, {{straight}} sided, and {{the surface}} has indentations called punctures. They are shiny metallic green or greenish blue in colour. The legs and antennae are red (dark clubs). They feed on the meat-infesting larvae of Calliphora or blow flies, Dermestidae and Piophilidae. The adults are surface feeders; the larvae bore into <b>dry</b> <b>or</b> <b>smoked</b> meats and do most damage. The red-legged ham beetle also attacks bones, hides, copra, dried egg, cheese, guano, bone meal, dried figs, and palm nut kernels. Although refrigeration has reduced {{the impact of the}} beetle on meats, they are a significant destructive pest of dried and salt fish including herring. It was well documented as a threat to agriculture by 1925.|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, total {{production}} of fish {{was estimated at}} between 60,000 and 120,000 tons per year. But because these figures represent production for the Logone River and Lake Chad, which are shared with Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria, Chad's fish production amounted to an estimated 70 percent of the total. The largest part of the catch - perhaps two-thirds - was consumed locally. In areas adjacent to urban centers, some portion - usually {{the best of the}} catch, such as large Nile perch (called capitaine in Chad) - was marketed fresh. Along Lake Chad and the river borders with Cameroon, the surplus catch was <b>dried,</b> salted, <b>or</b> <b>smoked</b> before being sold. Between 1976 and 1985, production of <b>dried,</b> salted, <b>or</b> <b>smoked</b> fish was estimated at 20,000 tons annually, representing from 20 to 25 percent of Chad's total annual catch. A large share of the commerce in preserved fish was carried on with markets in Cameroon and Nigeria. Small <b>dried</b> <b>or</b> salted fish called salanga were most popular on the markets of Cameroon. Larger smoked fish called banda were generally exported to the major Nigerian market of Maiduguri.|$|R

5000|$|Chuckwagon food {{typically}} included easy-to-preserve {{items like}} beans and salted meats, coffee, and sourdough biscuits. Food {{would also be}} gathered en route. There was no fresh fruit, vegetables, or eggs available and meat was not fresh unless an animal was injured during the run and therefore had to be killed. The meat they ate was greasy cloth-wrapped bacon, salt pork, and beef, usually <b>dried,</b> salted <b>or</b> <b>smoked.</b> The wagon was also stocked with a water barrel and a sling to kindle wood to heat and cook food.

5|$|The common {{thresher}} {{is widely}} caught by offshore longline and pelagic gillnet fisheries, {{especially in the}} northwestern Indian Ocean, the western, central, and eastern Pacific, and the North Atlantic. Participating countries include the former USSR, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico. The meat is highly prized for human consumption cooked, <b>dried</b> and salted, <b>or</b> <b>smoked.</b> In addition, their skin is made into leather, their liver oil is processed for vitamins, and their fins are used for shark fin soup. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported a worldwide common thresher take of 411 metric tons in 2006.|$|R
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; <b>dried,</b> <b>smoked</b> <b>or</b> salted {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|R

50|$|Wolof {{society is}} patrilineal, and {{agriculture}} land is inherited by the landowning caste. The typical farmers {{in a village}} pay rent (waref) to the landowner {{for the right to}} crop his land. Wolof farmers raise chickens and goats, and <b>dried</b> <b>or</b> <b>smoked</b> fish purchased, both a part of their diet. Cattle too are raised, not for food, but for milk, tilling the land and as a reserve of wealth. Rural Wolof people eat beef rarely, typically {{as a part of a}} ceremonial feast. Some villages in the contemporary times share agricultural machinery and sell the peanut harvest as a cooperative.|$|E
50|$|The meat {{is first}} {{cut into small}} pieces and is fried in palm oil in a pan, and to the pan is added onion, pepper and chilli. Then is added the fish <b>dried</b> <b>or</b> <b>smoked,</b> that is {{previously}} moistened and cut in chunks, the vegetables are sliced and incorporated into the cooking-pan (spinach leaves or bean leaves, cabbage, kale, okra), and finally water is poured to help in the cooking and spices for seasoning.

50|$|Shark meat is a seafood {{consisting}} of the flesh of sharks. Its consumption by humans has been mentioned since fourth century AD literature. Several sharks are fished for human consumption, such as porbeagles, shortfin mako shark, requiem shark, and thresher shark, among others. Shark meat is popular in Asia, where it is often consumed <b>dried,</b> <b>smoked,</b> <b>or</b> salted. Shark meat is consumed regularly in Japan, India, Sri Lanka, areas of Africa and Mexico. In western cultures, shark meat is sometimes considered as an inferior food, although its popularity has increased in Western countries.|$|R
5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, <b>dried,</b> <b>smoked,</b> <b>or</b> salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|R
500|$|The {{blacktip reef shark}} is {{a regular}} catch of coastal fisheries, such as those {{operating}} off Thailand and India, but is not targeted or considered commercially important. The meat (sold fresh, frozen, <b>dried</b> and salted, <b>or</b> <b>smoked</b> for human consumption), liver oil, and fins are used. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip reef shark as Near Threatened. Though it remains widespread and common overall, substantial local declines due to overfishing have now been documented in many areas. This species has a low reproductive rate, limiting its capacity for recovering from depletion. Blacktip reef sharks are popular subjects of public aquarium exhibits, because of their stereotypically [...] "shark-like" [...] appearance, ability to breed in captivity and modest size, and are also attractions for ecotourism divers.|$|R
5000|$|A round steak is a beef steak {{from the}} [...] "round", the rear {{leg of the}} cow. The round is divided into cuts {{including}} the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, {{with or without the}} [...] "round" [...] bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture. The cut is often sliced thin, then <b>dried</b> <b>or</b> <b>smoked</b> at low temperature to make jerky.|$|E
50|$|December 20 {{represents}} the starting day for traditional pig slaughter (Tăiatul Porcului) ending on Christmas Eve. The householder himself or a hired skilled neighbor will {{carry out the}} entire job, starting early in the morning. Everywhere in the village can be heard the scream of pigs. It takes three to four men to drag out from shelter and put down the animal. The skilled butcher stabs directly the pig's heart with a long sharp knife, for a quick death without suffering. The corpse is left a few minutes for blood draining. Meanwhile, the householder will treat the men who helped him {{with a cup of}} home-made brandy (țuică) or wine, preferably hot, thanking them for their help. After that, the pig's body will be cleaned and covered with straws. The pig's entire skin hair will be burned until the skin is cooked enough, all around. While cleaning and washing is done by pouring hot water, the skin is grated using knives, even bricks or simply tin cans, punctured with a nail. At this stage, the skin (șorici) becomes eatable - fresh or slightly salted. Then the hooves are plucked and the body is placed with back on top. A cross sign is cut on pig's back and filled with salt. The housewife is incensing all over and everybody is praying God for food blessing. Only after this moment, the meat can be cut to be kept raw in salt, <b>dried</b> <b>or</b> <b>smoked,</b> or to be prepared using various traditional recipes and kept <b>dried</b> <b>or</b> <b>smoked</b> or even fried in the melted pig's fat. At the end, the householder prepares a meal of pork for those who helped him, this custom being known as Pomana Porcului.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Biriwa are mainly fishermen {{with very few}} of them being farmers. Because most of them live at the coastal area, they naturally become fishermen since that is the available occupation at the shore. The women in the town mostly become fishmongers. As the men come to the shore with a catch the women come and buy them to be sold fried, <b>dried</b> <b>or</b> <b>smoked.</b> Fishing is not done on Tuesdays because is regarded as a taboo of the town. The fishermen travel to as far as Axim in the Western Region of Ghana to catch fish. Fishing is done with canoes and large nets. Fishermen mostly sleep onshore till they get a catch before returning home. The canoes used for fishing belong to families and they are given names to indicate the family which owns them. The canoes are painted beautifully with different colours. Flags are erected on the canoe which are mostly flags of different countries.|$|E
50|$|Smooth hammerheads {{are caught}} by {{commercial}} fisheries throughout the world, including those off the United States (East and West Coasts), Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, the Philippines, southwestern Australia, and western Africa, primarily using gillnets and longlines. Fishery catches of smooth hammerheads {{are difficult to}} quantify due to a frequent lack of distinction between them and other large hammerheads. The meat is sold fresh, <b>dried</b> and salted, <b>or</b> <b>smoked,</b> though in most markets it is considered undesirable and {{there are reports of}} poisoning. Much more valuable are the fins, which have the highest rating for use in shark fin soup and often leads to captured sharks being finned at sea. Additionally, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the skin for leather, and the offal for fishmeal. This shark is also used in Chinese medicine.|$|R
