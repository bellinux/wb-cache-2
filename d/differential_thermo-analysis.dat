40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a post-fire investigation on a Reinforced Concrete industrial warehouse located in Cagliari (Italy). The authors applied several methods in order to identify the maximum temperature distribution and to assess the materials degradation. Optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Thermogravimetric and <b>Differential</b> <b>Thermo-Analysis</b> and calibrated Colorimetry provided useful indications to carefully determine the changes in the mineralogical composition and microstructure of concrete. The absence or presence of some specific phases (like Portlandite) or the variations of colours (reddening of original pinkish-beige aggregates) are benchmark signs capable of assessing the maximum temperature with high accuracy. The approach and the data showcased in this work can be useful for other post-fire investigations and for the tuning of the relevant theoretical and numerical models...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess decay in the {{mechanical}} characteristics of re-exposed Reinforced Concrete (RC), {{it is crucial to}} recon- struct the temperature time history and the evolution of strain and stress elds. In this paper, {{the state of the art}} of assessment methods is presented and applied to a real structure damaged by re. It is a prestressed RC industrial warehouse located in the outskirts of the city of Cagliari (Italy). The collected data of several assessment methods are presented in order to produce the owchart of an integrated approach for post- re investi- gation. Among the various techniques, the authors highlight a thorough laser scanner geometric survey and destructive and non-destructive testing. In addition, the temperature distribu- tion and its time history has been reconstructed by means of optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray diffractom- etry, Thermogravimetric <b>Differential</b> <b>Thermo-Analysis</b> and calibrated Colorimetry. Actually, refurbishment is needed, but the structure withstood the re very well. Central columns displayed the most impor- tant damage, and several beams presented important de ec- tions having lost the prestressing actions of the tendons...|$|E
40|$|Protonated organic single {{crystals}} of Benzimidazolium salicylate (BSL) {{were successfully}} grown by the slow evaporation solution technique at room temperature. The crystal structure and lattice {{parameters of the}} as-grown single crystal have been identified and calculated by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) method. Microanalysis has confirmed the elemental compositions and the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technique has revealed vibrations of the functional groups in these crystals. The optical band gap was calculated indicating that the as-grown crystal exhibits 75 % of optical transparency in the 350 – 800  nm range. Fluorescence study has suggested the blue emission nature of the crystal. The thermal stability of the as-grown crystal has been elaborated from the thermogrativity <b>differential</b> <b>thermo-analysis</b> (TG-DTA) technique. Vickers hardness measurement has revealed the mechanically soft nature of the crystal, which {{is driven by the}} reverse indentation size effect (RISE) and shows an anisotropic behaviour. A linear increase of the photocurrent on illumination suggests the positive photoconductivity of the crystal. The third-order non-linear optical property characteristics, such as the absorption coefficient (β), the refractive index (n 2) and the susceptibility (χ(3)) have been examined using the Z-scan technique...|$|E
