Club reviewer Myles McNutt said the episode had {{the possibility of}} being a great episode of The Office, but that it did not live up to that possibility.

Hannah Lawrence of Hollywood.com called the episode a large improvement over [...] "Gettysburg" [...] and also called it possibly her [...] "favorite episode of the season so far". Chris Plante of New York called Robert California the worst part of The Office and said that he kept Andy from being more of a lead character for the series.

Joseph Kratzer from What Culture? gave the episode three out of five stars and wrote, [...] "I'm going {{to go out on a}} bit of a limb <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that while 'Mrs. California' was of course not a return to form for The Office, it was a good example of how the series might define itself in this new Michael-less era." [...] M. Giant of Television without Pity gave the episode a B+. [...] After viewing [...] "Mrs. California," [...] Washington Post writer Hank Stuever named The Office one of the ten best TV shows of 2011 and said that the episode proved the series could still deliver cringe humor without Carell.
