25|$|Young came to {{love the}} City of London. He relished command of a force small enough to <b>know</b> <b>every</b> constable well. He enjoyed the City's rich social life too, and he much valued the {{invitation}} to join the Goldsmiths Company. The police needed to recruit and with considerable success he set about making service more attractive. Pay and allowances were increased, housing modernised, and catering improved. Uniforms were made more comfortable and practical. At another level, he pushed through changes in career structures. He engineered a national recruitment revolution in the British police, running command courses and seeing through a fast-track entry scheme to attract graduates - and for many years he was director of extended interviews for the Senior Command Course that he had founded.|$|E

All [...] the people who run the festival are members of The Wanderers fan club, all wear Wanderers jackets, and [...] <b>know</b> <b>every</b> line in the film.

500|$|The {{scale of}} horse theft by white thieves {{along the border}} {{increased}} dramatically during the late 1880s, which the police's sporadic deployments were unable to counter. In response, Commissioner Herchmer introduced a system of police patrols across the territories, with scheduled visits and inspections supported by surprise [...] "flying patrols". This approach was enabled by a network of new outposts across the major ranches. Police would visit almost every farm or ranch, seek to get to <b>know</b> <b>every</b> {{member of the community}} personally, gather intelligence and ask each settler to record any issues in a patrol book. Along the way, the police helped to distribute relief, including to the Métis communities affected by the rebellion, provided emergency medical assistance, and delivered mail to the more remote areas. Under the new patrol system, the mounted police travelled a total of [...] on average each year on horseback. Backed by harsh sentences from the courts, the process virtually eliminated rural crime.|$|E

I could have been done, like, a year ago. But being that we were having creative differences — you <b>know,</b> <b>every</b> time they rejected what I was doing, I would {{go back in the}} studio and work on more stuff. The last two songs, 'You Ain't No DJ' and 'Be Still,' were the last two records, but everything else was already on there". Despite his individual release, OutKast as a group remained signed to Jive. After leaving Jive, Big Boi contacted record executive and Island Def Jam CEO/chairman L.A. Reid, who had originally signed OutKast to LaFace in 1992. He played Reid a track from the album, [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", which persuaded him to actualize a contract for Big Boi. Following two months of negotiations, Big Boi signed a three-album deal with Def Jam Recordings in March 2010.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Deccan Herald, Anand talked about how the American sitcom Friends influenced the film's two characters revealing he wanted viewers to respond to Akash and Kiara in a similar way. He said: [...] "I remember when I watched Friends I wanted to meet and <b>know</b> <b>every</b> character. That's how I want audiences to feel about Ranbir and Priyanka." [...] He also wanted the two to resonate with the audience the way the characters in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) did. In another interview discussing the film, Anand revealed that he wanted to make it different from his earlier films, aiming for it to be a [...] "subdued romance," [...] which is not sexy. He said: [...] "Everyone is going to be covered up in scarf's and mufflers and over coats and boots. This is a rare instance that you’ll see Indian actors dressed full up without skin show."(sic) In September 2009, it was announced that Sajid Nadiadwala would produce the film as he was highly impressed by the script.|$|E
500|$|In September 1939, Britain {{entered the}} Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's {{children}} were evacuated {{to avoid the}} frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, [...] "The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave." [...] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived {{for most of the}} next five years. At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments. In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities. She stated: [...] "We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We <b>know,</b> <b>every</b> one of us, that in the end all will be well." ...|$|E
500|$|The music video's {{theme is}} multiplicity. Mor {{said that the}} idea [...] "was {{essentially}} trying to reduce what the song is about to symbols. And that's what it was...just really keeping it clean and iconic." [...] The video opens with intercalated beauty shots of will.i.am and Spears, until the scene cuts to will.i.am using his iPhone camera add-on and social network iam+. will.i.am says [...] "bring the action", and Spears is seen wearing a skin-tight skirt and a long-sleeved top with bare midriff and cleavage. Spears performs fast movements to the song's beat and sings the lyrics. She is then seen atop a white box and posing to the camera. When the track's chorus begins, will.i.am appears {{in front of an}} empty black background and is joined by Spears, who is now wearing a corseted leotard accented with feathers, standing on a moving walkway, and they sing together. After the first [...] "Britney, bitch" [...] line is heard, dancers perform to [...] "Scream & Shout". The video cuts to intercalated scenes of flaming disco balls, Spears image multiplied, and will.i.am wearing several gold accessories, including a cap with a gold plate that reads 'King'. Mor said that the video has no narrative, and that, [...] "there's no deep meaning to any of it...To me it was just about, you <b>know,</b> <b>every</b> scene is like a photo. I just liked it, I liked seeing the human heads, and I liked seeing the gold chains off of the plaques and then making it scroll. And then it was an awesome way to introduce characters, some friends of will...so that it wasn't just about them."

Mitchell said, [...] "My jazz background began with one of the early Lambert, Hendricks and Ross albums." [...] That album, The Hottest New Group in Jazz, was hard to find in Canada, she says.

2500|$|Walker's {{situation}} was not helped by MacArthur's unrealistic demands from Tokyo {{for him not}} to retreat an inch. [...] Attempting to obey, Walker gave a bombastic [...] "not a step back" [...] speech to his staff and subordinate commanders which did not go over well. [...] Nor did it stop the North Korean troops from pushing back American and South Korea troops which had been badly mauled in the opening days of the invasion, even further. As American and South Korean forces retreated further east and south, they finally arrived at a defensible line on the Nakdong River. They took advantage of shortened supply routes and a relatively good road network to exploit the advantages of [...] "interior lines". [...] Walker was able to quickly shift his units from point to point, stopping North Korean attacks before they could be reinforced.

[...] He took his new position to be a mandate to get to <b>know</b> <b>every</b> science student and indeed every other student at St. Johns, Cambridge, and at other colleges. He would arrange [...] "At Homes" [...] in his rooms on Sunday evenings, as well as Sunday morning breakfast meetings; he also organised informal discussions and formal lectures (many of which he gave himself) in the College Hall. He formed a group called The Socratics and brought to it some of his most influential friends, including H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Bertrand Russell and Sassoon. Sassoon (Patient B in Conflict and Dream), remained particularly friendly with Rivers and regarded him as a mentor. [...] They shared Socialist sympathies.|$|E
