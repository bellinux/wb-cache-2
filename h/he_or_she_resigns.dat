50|$|General Synod elects {{three of}} the nine {{officers}} who maintain certain executive responsibilities at and between Synods. Of those, one - the Primate - holds office until <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>resigns,</b> is removed, retires, or dies. The other officers, elected at each General Synod, are the Prolocutor and the Deputy Prolocutor.|$|E
25|$|After the election, the Constitution {{does not}} allow the President {{to be a member}} of any {{political}} party so <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> must <b>resign</b> from membership, if there is one.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} parliament {{had also}} passed some {{amendments to the}} Constitution of Sweden. Election days were moved from the third Sunday of September to the second Sunday of the same month. Another change was that the incumbent Prime Minister of Sweden, should <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> not <b>resign</b> immediately after the election, {{must be approved by}} the new Riksdag.|$|R
50|$|Unlike their {{counterparts}} in the rest of Europe, Norwegian Prime Ministers do not have the option of advising the King to dissolve the Storting and call a snap election. The Constitution requires that the Storting serve out its full four-year term. If the Prime Minister loses the confidence of the Storting, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> must <b>resign.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This law {{applies to}} all establishments {{employing}} 10 or more workers. Gratuity is payable to the employee if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>resigns</b> or retires. The Indian government mandates that this payment be {{at the rate of}} 15 days salary of the employee for each completed year of service subject to a maximum of [...] 1000000.|$|E
50|$|Usually, the President of the Bundestag is {{a member}} of the largest {{parliamentary}} group. This custom had emerged already in times of the Weimar Republic, but this is not required by law. The term ends with the election period, and there is no provision for an early deposition, the Presidents term can only end prematurely, if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>resigns,</b> leaves the Bundestag or dies. He can be reelected in the next election period provided he becomes a member of the Bundestag again.|$|E
50|$|MPs elect the Speaker from amongst {{their own}} ranks. The House must elect a Speaker at the {{beginning}} of each new parliamentary term after a general election, or after the death or resignation of the incumbent. Once elected, a Speaker continues in office until the dissolution of Parliament, unless <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>resigns</b> prior to this. Customarily, the House re-elects Speakers who desire to continue in office for more than one term. Theoretically, the House could vote against re-electing a Speaker, but such an event is extremely unlikely.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, {{the leader}} of a party {{generally}} remains that party's de facto candidate for Prime Minister until such time as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> dies, <b>resigns</b> <b>or</b> is dismissed by the party. In the New Democratic Party and some of its provincial branches, the position of party leader was treated as all other positions on the party's executive committee, and open for election at party conventions generally held every two years, although incumbent leaders rarely face more than token opposition.|$|R
2500|$|One of the Immortels {{is chosen}} {{by his or}} her colleagues to be the Académie's Perpetual Secretary. The Secretary is called [...] "Perpetual" [...] because the holder serves for life, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> may <b>resign,</b> and may thereafter be styled as Honorary Perpetual Secretary; indeed the three post-World War II Perpetual Secretaries resigned due to old age. The Perpetual Secretary acts as a chairperson and chief representative of the Académie. The two other officers, a Director and a Chancellor, are elected for three-month terms. The most senior member by date of election, is the Dean of the Académie.|$|R
5000|$|In Cambridge, the High Steward {{is elected}} {{by the members of}} the University Senate voting in person, one of that body's few {{remaining}} functions, and holds office until <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> voluntarily <b>resigns</b> <b>or</b> until the Senate otherwise determines. The Deputy High Steward is appointed by the High Steward by Letters Patent. The High Steward and the Deputy High Steward perform [...] "such duties as have heretofore been customary and any duties prescribed by Statute or Ordinance". When the office of High Steward is vacant the duties of that office are performed by the Deputy High Steward.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian prime {{minister}} serves at Her Majesty's pleasure, meaning the post {{does not have}} a fixed term. Once appointed and sworn in by the governor general, the {{prime minister}} remains in office until <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>resigns,</b> is dismissed, or dies. The lifespan of parliament is limited by the constitution to five years and, though the governor general may still, on the advice of the prime minister, dissolve parliament and issue the writs of election prior to the date mandated by the Canada Elections Act; the King-Byng Affair was the only time since Confederation that the viceroy deemed it necessary to refuse his prime minister's request for a general vote.|$|E
50|$|The First Minister, once {{appointed}} {{continues in}} office {{as the head}} of the devolved Scottish Government until either <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>resigns,</b> is dismissed or dies in office. Resignation can be triggered off by the passage of a Motion of No Confidence in the First Minister or the Scottish Government or by rejecting a Motion of Confidence in the Scottish Parliament. In those situations, the First Minister must tender their resignation and the resignation of their government to the monarch. In such circumstances, the Presiding Officer appoints an interim First Minister, until the Scottish Parliament determines on a new nominee to be presented to the Sovereign for formal appointment.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} duties of the Crown {{is to ensure that}} a {{democratic}} government is always in place, which means appointing a prime minister (at present Justin Trudeau) to thereafter head the Cabinet. Thus, the governor general must appoint as prime minister the person who holds the confidence of the House of Commons; in practice, this is typically the leader of the political party that holds more seats than any other party in that chamber, currently the Liberal Party. Should no party hold a majority in the commons, the leader of one party—either the one with the most seats or one supported by other parties—will be called by the governor general to form a minority government. Once sworn in by the viceroy, the prime minister holds office until <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>resigns</b> or is removed by the governor general, after either a motion of non-confidence or his party's defeat in a general election.|$|E

50|$|The Kansas Constitution designates {{that the}} justice who has the longest {{continuous}} term of service on the Court {{will serve as the}} chief justice, unless <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> declines <b>or</b> <b>resigns</b> the position.

25|$|The justice who has {{the longest}} {{continuous}} service is designated by the Kansas Constitution as the chief justice, unless <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> declines <b>or</b> <b>resigns</b> the position. The chief justice's duty is to exercise the administrative authority of the court. This merit system or Missouri Plan {{has been used in}} Kansas since 1958, voted in by Kansans upset when Governor Fred Hall resigned after losing the gubernatorial primary so he could be appointed to the Supreme Court by his successor Governor John McCuish.|$|R
50|$|The {{duties of}} the cabinet of ministers are {{described}} in the Article 116 of the Constitution of Ukraine. Members of the government (cabinet) are citizens of Ukraine, who have the right of vote, higher education, and possess the state language (Ukrainian language). The members of the government cannot have judgement against them {{that has not been}} extinguished and taken away in the established legal order. Members of the Cabinet and chief officers of central and local bodies of executive power may not combine their official activity with other work, except teaching, scholarly and creative activity outside of working hours, and/or to be members of an administrative body or board of supervisors of an enterprise that is aimed at making profit. In case if a People's Deputy of Ukraine was appointed to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>resigns</b> as a member of parliament and his/hers letter of resignation is reviewed immediately at the next session of the Ukrainian parliament.|$|E
5000|$|Article 10(c)(1) {{guarantees}} {{the freedom of}} association subject only to restrictions imposed through any federal law {{on the grounds of}} national security, public order or morality or through any law relating to labour or education (Article 10(2)(c) and (3)). In relation to the freedom of incumbent elected legislators to change their political parties, the Supreme Court of Malaysia in the Kelantan State Legislative Assembly v Nordin Salleh held that an [...] "anti party-hopping" [...] provision in the Kelantan State Constitution violates the right to freedom of association. That provision stipulated that a member of the Kelantan legislative assembly {{who is a member of}} any political party shall cease to be a member of the legislative assembly if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>resigns</b> or is expelled from such political party. The Supreme Court held that the Kelantan anti party-hopping provision was void because the [...] "direct and inevitable consequence" [...] of the provision is to restrict the right of members of the assembly from exercising their right to freedom of association. Furthermore, the Malaysian Federal Constitution sets out a complete list of the grounds on which a member of a State Legislative Assembly can be disqualified (e.g. being of unsound mind) and disqualification on the ground of resigning from one's political party is not one of them.|$|E

30|$|The scheme models the {{real-world}} where an employee is given access rights {{based on his}} or her job title. At first, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is given a certain level of privilege. If <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is observed to abuse his or her rights, some of his or her privileges are revoked. On the other hand, if <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> behaves well and gains the trust of <b>he</b> <b>or</b> her colleagues, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is rewarded with progressively higher access rights. This increase in rights may also be {{based on the fact that}} <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> will become more experienced over time and less likely to abuse the system inadvertently.
