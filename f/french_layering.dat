The material analysed is Savonnie?res: a <b>French</b> <b>layered</b> oolitic limestone. Due to the complex microstructure of the material the moisture permeability cannot uniquely be determined based on indirect measurement data. To overcome this problem we present an upscaling technique based on the modelling of transport phenomena on the mesoscale. The technique allows to determine an equivalent macroscopic permeability based on the geometric configuration and the permeability of the composing constituents...|$|R

Free uptake experiments are performed both parallel and {{perpendicular to the}} bedding. It is found that {{the position of the}} different layers, and the exact material properties inside each layer can significantly influence the imbibition process. The experimental results are compared with numerical simulations. For the flow simulations, moisture permeability of the different layers is obtained with the upscaling technique presented in Part 1.

40|$|Savonnières, a <b>French</b> <b>layered</b> oolithic limestone, shows {{important}} ink-bottle effects. As a consequence, a great discrepancy {{is observed}} between {{the results of}} different techniques to determine the pore volume distribution. It is shown that mercury intrusion porosimetry results {{can be considered as}} the main drainage curve and are, for this kind of materials, not convenient to determine the apparent pore volume distribution due to hysteresis phenomena. The main wetting curve is obtained using image analysing techniques on SEM-micrographs, combined with pressure membrane apparatus results on capillary saturated samples. A simple structural hysteresis model is developed to predict the mercury intrusion porosimetry results, starting from the main wetting curve. The good agreement between theory and experiment verifies that the large difference between main wetting and main drainage curve can indeed be attributed to structural hysteresis. In this way, the presented technique gives, in addition to a better knowledge of the pore volume distribution, insight in the pore geometry and connectivity, which can serve as input for microstructure-based transport models...|$|R

40|$|By {{joining a}} {{multidisciplinary}} {{team as a}} work group, {{and with the help}} of technicians, professors and inventors, several projects were presented for the dock. This project has the final target to serve the local population and to improve their quality of life. To do so it is necessary to know the population characteristics as well as the territory were there live. So, the first part of the work presents some characteristics of the territory where Givors is located, starting from a macro scale with the River Rhône, passing to the Rhône- Alpes Region, then the Pole Metropolitaine and finally to Givors Ville (in <b>French).</b> This <b>layer</b> of scale is important to understand the characteristics of the city, and also because they are the administrative scale were the study object is inserted. Finally, it is presented the projects located in the site “ 0 ”. In line with this thought it is also important to now the infrastructures that are present in the region, so that the connection to the surrounding areas of the Rhône can be achieved. The infrastructures that were contemplated were the highways, national roads, the railways, and the “Voie Verte” that is a path dedicated only to soft mobility. A brief characterization of the Rhône River as a cultural place is also presented. After this macro scale description, the document relays on Givors Ville. As the place of implementation of the project it is important to make a quick portrait of the demography, the territory, infrastructures, culture and planning constrains of the city and of the site “ 0 ”.

Although {{a small minority of}} the colon community, their numbers were sufficient in Tunisia to support the French-language publication Petit Monde. It presented humanistic articles that attempted to span the gulf of alienation, was sympathetic to Tunisians, and discussed self-governance. Other colons, however, might heap scorn on any such European who broke ranks. One dissenting colon was the French official and later academic Jacques Berque. Another, the well-known author Albert Camus, was consciously conflicted over his native Algeria. His 1942 novel L'Estranger drew a portrait of a young French colon, his social disconnection and his crime and trial. Camus labored for mutual comprehension between the conflicting sides. Even after the French exodus, Berque remained attached to the Maghrib, and connected to its newly independent peoples. Berque also was able to [...] perceive the multiple faces of the <b>French</b> situation, its <b>layered</b> context.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{considers}} the challenges Jonson's Volpone presents to contemporary performance, where its apparent resistance to comprehension and apprehension frequently results in adaptation. In spite of this, Volpone has captivated the French imagination, {{resulting in a}} prominent national tradition of adapting and performing Jonson's work, evidenced by four screen versions: Maurice Tourneur's 1941 cinematic adaptation and Frédéric Auburtin's television film (2003), {{as well as two}} filmed theatre productions, directed by Jean Mayer (1978) and Francis Perrin (2001). The adaptations are the result of a re-mediation process which has taken the Jacobean play to French stages and screens in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, turning Jonson's work into a specifically 'French' item through more familiar cultural codes such as Molière, Shakespeare, and screen comedy. Through a focus on each film's insistence on the layers of rewriting that separate them from Jonson's text, the article considers how each screen adaptation both figures and disfigures its early modern source while acknowledging its debt to the Jacobean playwright, and their aesthetic and ideological consequences to specific moments of <b>French</b> culture. Such <b>layers</b> of rewriting reveal both the play's flexibility and malleability while also indicating its paradoxical resistance to adaptation, particularly in the play's ending, which is significantly altered {{in each of the four}} adaptations. These alternative endings, the article suggests, destabilise the original's categorisation of comedy mixed with dark satire and are suggestive of the early modern source text having lost significance in the eyes of French film and theatre practitioners and their audiences...|$|R
5000|$|French (1991) [...] {{proposed}} that catastrophic interference arises in feedforward backpropagation networks {{due to the}} interaction of node activations, or activation overlap, that occur in distributed representations at the hidden layer. Specifically, he defined this activation overlap as the average shared activation over all units in the hidden layer, calculated by summing the lowest activation of the nodes at the hidden layer and averaging this sum. For example, if the activations at the hidden layer from one input are (0.3, 0.1, 0.9, 1.0) and the activations from the next input are (0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.9) the activation overlap would be (0.0 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.9 [...] ) / 4 = 0.275. When using number|binary representation of input vector|vectors, activation values will be 0 through 1, where 0 indicates no activation overlap and 1 indicates full activation overlap. French noted that neural networks which employ very localized representations do not show catastrophic interference {{because of the lack}} of overlap at the hidden layer. That is to say, each input pattern will create a hidden layer representation that involves the activation of only one node, so differed inputs will have an activation overlap of 0. Thus, he suggested that reducing the value of activation overlap at the hidden layer would reduce catastrophic interference in distributed networks. Specifically he {{proposed that}} this could be done through changing the distributed representations at the hidden layer to 'semi-distributed' representations. A 'semi-distributed' representation has fewer hidden nodes that are active, and/or a lower activation value for these nodes, for each representation, which will make the representations of the different inputs overlap less at the hidden <b>layer.</b> <b>French</b> recommended that this could be done through 'activation sharpening', a technique which slightly increases the activation of a certain number of the most active nodes in the hidden layer, slightly reduces the activation of all the other units and then changes the input-to-hidden layer weights to reflect these activation changes (similar to error backpropgation). Overall the guidelines for the process of 'activation sharpening' are as follows: ...|$|R
40|$|Semi-automated, multi-source {{cartography}} of {{land cover}}. 1. Geneva transboundary area (medium resolution). - A land cover map {{is an essential}} layer of information for the management and planning of the territory. Within {{the context of a}} trans-boundary endeavour between Switzerland and France (Projet d’Agglomération Franco-Valdo-Genevoise, here- after AFVG), a medium-resolution land cover map (CCSA 04) was developed for the Canton of Geneva, part of the Canton of Vaud, and parts of the French departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie. Within the constraints of the available data, a 27 -class legend was chosen to suit the needs of the AFVG project. This leg- end can be converted to the Swiss OTEMO and European CORINE standards. The applied mapping methodology can be described as multi-source, multi-scale and object-oriented. Multi-source refers to using the SPOT satellite imagery at two dif- ferent resolutions (5 m for the visible bands, 10 m for the infrared), a Digital Elevation/Digital Height Model, and several vec- tor layers. Multi-scale means that the analysis, within the Definiens DeveloperTM software, proceeded on different levels or scales. The object-oriented approach is based on the concept that the semantic information necessary to interpret an image is not contained in isolated pixels, but rather in objects and their mutual relationships. These objects, obtained through a segmentation process, were classified using multiple criteria, such as their spectral values, morphology and context. Some legend classes, such as buildings and roads, are defined by their spatial coincidence with a shapefile. Others, such as forests and water, are derived from their spectral values. The altitude criterion was used to differentiate mountain grasslands from low-altitude meadows. The automated classification process was completed by some manual editing in the following cases: objects adjacent to roads, under-estimation of coniferous forest, agricultural surfaces falsely classified as deciduous forest, confusion between hard surfaces and bare soil, and objects hidden by shadows. In order to control the quality of the land cover map, a statistical procedure was applied. Two control points were randomly selected within each square kilometre of the AFVG area, and their land cover class was visually estimated from colour aerial photographs, based on a simplified legend. A contingency matrix was computed, yielding a Kappa coefficient of 89 %, which exceeds the mandatory threshold of 75 % requested by the project. It is considered that this quality level is quite acceptable, owing to the difficulties stemming from the heterogeneity of data between the Swiss and <b>French</b> entities: vector <b>layers</b> having different meaning and showing mismatch across the border, and the SPOT mosaic being a composite of scenes from two years, resulting in differences in radiometry. The rugged topogra- phy in the Jura and pre-Alps also leads to extensive zones of shadows, which complicate the analysis. As an example of application of the CCSA 04 map, land cover statistics were computed for the four entities. Finally, recom- mendations are presented towards an improvement of the map-making process (revised legend, compatible data across bor- ders and better imagery), in the perspective of future applications such as change mapping for the computation of land cover trends...|$|R
