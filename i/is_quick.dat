5|$|Jon and Tyrion see the Wall for {{the first}} time as they arrive with Benjen and the other recruits. En route to the Wall, Tyrion and Jon discuss the Night's Watch. Tyrion <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> to disabuse Jon of his romantic notions of the Watch as a noble calling battling the mythical horrors beyond the Wall (as it was in history), {{pointing}} out that now it is more a dumping ground for the unwanted of Westeros: criminals, prisoners, and bastards.|$|E
50|$|In 1897, {{the city}} of Groningen got its second {{football}} club with the foundation of Velocitas 1897, which became the labour-class rival of the elitist <b>Be</b> <b>Quick.</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Quick</b> and Velocitas remained the most successful football clubs in {{the city of}} Groningen until the mid-twentieth century, winning 26 northern championships between them (18 won by <b>Be</b> <b>Quick</b> and 8 by Velocitas).|$|R

5|$|The breed <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> {{to learn}} {{but can be}} headstrong, though with correct {{training}} can become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a regular exercise routine to keep them healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm {{leaves the}} table {{only to return}} furious; Archie was lying. A heated debate ensues, and the four men wrestle over the bill until Anya tells them that the meal can be free. Malcolm insists {{it is not about}} the bill, and fetches a knife and {{chopping}} board. Archie and Malcolm are to play stabscotch, with the winner paying. Malcolm <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> but Archie is slower, repeatedly stabbing himself. Craig pulls the knife from Archie, inadvertently slashing Anya. She collapses as blood splatters. Anya is dead, and Malcolm formulates a story blaming Archie, but Archie has called a prison contact who will remove the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{action of}} iodine <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> and works at low concentrations, {{and thus it}} is used in operating theatres. Its specific mode of action is unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as cysteine and methionine), nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death. It also has an antiviral action, but nonlipid viruses and parvoviruses are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped viruses, and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds.|$|E

5|$|In Angry Birds, {{the player}} {{controls}} {{a flock of}} multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen {{by a group of}} hungry green pigs. In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs. The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs.|$|E
5|$|Kyo is an overconfident but well-meaning person, more {{interested}} in enjoying life than taking on responsibilities. He <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> to dismiss subjects that do not interest him and will often carry out his actions with a devil-may-care attitude. He treasures his friends and family, enjoying their presence and particularly dotes on his girlfriend, Yuki. His strong sense of justice and zeal to fight stronger opponents are what he believes drives him {{to carry out his}} destiny. Kyo enters most of The King of Fighters tournaments representing the Japanese team along with teammates Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon. In his fights he uses the clan's martial art style, the , attacking opponents using flames along with several hits. In later series' tournaments he would combine fire with a personal style of kenpō.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that buries itself in sediment and waits for passing prey, mostly benthic bony fishes, but also skates and invertebrates. An aplacental viviparous species, females bear litters of seven to 25 pups every other year. The angelshark normally poses little danger to humans, though if provoked, it <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> to bite. Since the mid-20th century, intense commercial fishing across the angelshark's range has decimated its population via bycatch – it is now locally extinct or nearly so across most of its northern range, and the prospects of the remaining fragmented subpopulations are made more precarious by its slow rate of reproduction. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Critically Endangered.|$|E
50|$|He joined local side <b>Be</b> <b>Quick</b> in 1916 as a masseuge {{and later}} as coach and was allowed {{to play for the}} team in 1918. <b>Be</b> <b>Quick</b> won the Eerste Klasse North and {{qualified}} for the Championship play-off finishing fifth.|$|R
50|$|Trump monologue: <b>Be</b> <b>Quick</b> But <b>Be</b> Careful - To <b>be</b> <b>quick</b> and {{not careful}} {{is a bad}} decision. Trump prefers if {{somebody}} carefully takes their time and makes the right decision; but a good decision made quickly is the best combination.|$|R

5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, he felt as if his own life was fake and all he wanted was to be acknowledged for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{is also a}} good dribbler. This is due to his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> which means he can beat players with his pace. He can also use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become a good player.|$|E
5|$|The Earl {{can be a}} {{grotesque}} caricature of a Victorian gentleman: a rotund figure in cape and top hat (hiding his horns), with a perpetual enormous grin and pince-nez spectacles. Although his attitude is often cheerful, he <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> to reveal his more intimidating, malicious side. The Earl has a golem named , a pink umbrella with a small, talking jack-o-lantern at its tip. It usually talks excitedly or screams, adding {{its name to the}} end of almost every sentence. Lero, used by the Earl as a Mary Poppins-type flying umbrella, is very loyal to him and guards his sword. Road often takes Lero against its will, using it as a witch's broom or an ordinary umbrella. It {{has been used as a}} beacon to summon Akuma, to transport several exorcists to the Ark and to guard the Noah. Lero has a sword similar to Allen Walker's sword of exorcism, which surprises him when they clash on Noah's Ark. Despite his antipathy to the Noah Nea, the Earl grows depressed when he talks about him.|$|E
50|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held {{before the race}} on June 1, 2012. The first session was 85 minutes long, while the second lasted 90 minutes. Mark Martin <b>was</b> <b>quickest</b> {{with a time of}} 22.613 seconds in the first session, 0.039 faster than Hamlin. Truex, Jr. <b>was</b> third <b>quickest,</b> followed by Biffle, Kyle Busch, and Biffle. Ryan Newman was seventh, still within two-tenths of a second of Martin's time. In the second and final practice, Aric Almirola <b>was</b> <b>quickest</b> with a time of 22.900 seconds. Jeff Gordon followed in second, ahead of Earnhardt, Jr. and Johnson.Scott Speed <b>was</b> fifth <b>quickest,</b> with a time of 23.260 seconds. Jamie McMurray, Michael McDowell, Kurt Busch, Joe Nemechek, and J. J. Yeley rounded out the first ten positions. Martin, who <b>was</b> <b>quickest</b> in the first session, could only manage 29th.|$|R

50|$|He also coached Groningen-based club <b>Be</b> <b>Quick</b> 1887. In 1924, Le Figaro {{reported}} {{that he was a}} Champion of Holland during his time there. <b>Be</b> <b>Quick</b> has won the national league title in 1920. The same article also suggested that he won a Belgian championship with Royale Union Saint Gilloise in 1923.|$|R
5|$|The {{international}} space station Horizon sends a distress signal to the ISIS agency, stating that the spaceship has been under attack. Anthony Drake (Bryan Cranston), {{the commander of the}} station, has urged ISIS to assist the crew in controlling the situation. A reluctant Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler) is the first one to voice concern over the issue, as none of them have undergone training in preparation for a flight. Despite these concerns, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter) <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> to take the job for financial gain. The field agents of ISIS—except Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin), who is being evaluated by Doctor Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates) for medical purposes—are subjected to basic astronaut regimens in anticipation for the flight, including a flight simulator (which Archer makes Cyril crash), and weightlessness training, which causes Lana to vomit copiously {{because of the lack of}} gravity.|$|E
5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she <b>is</b> <b>quick</b> to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
