5|$|Benfica {{started the}} {{domestic}} season by winning their fourth Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira, beating Vitória de Setúbal one-nil. In the Primeira Liga, Benfica struggled initially, making their worst entry ever. Results improved following a European win against Lille, with Benfica climbing several places and defeating Porto in the Clássico. In late October, the team experienced {{a drop in}} form, <b>going</b> <b>a</b> month without a win. In December, Benfica's results improved in December, qualifying for the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time}} in eleven years and winning nearly ten matches in a row, allowing them to get within three points of the top of the league.|$|E
5|$|After the break, Richard {{threw an}} 11-inning, 10-strikeout {{game against the}} Expos and {{followed}} with two complete games and another nine-inning performance {{in a game that}} went into extra innings. He was selected as the National League Pitcher of the Month after <b>going</b> <b>a</b> perfect 4–0 with a 1.29ERA and 58strikeouts in 56innings during July. Throughout much of August, his season ERA hovered below 3.00, and he averaged well over a strikeout per inning. On August 21, in an 8–3 victory over the Chicago Cubs, he broke Don Wilson's 1969 club record of 235strikeouts. In the final two months of the season, Richard's strikeout average dramatically increased, and he struck out a double-digit number of batters in three of his last five starts. In his third-to-last start, Richard broke Tom Seaver's NL record of 290strikeouts by a right-hander when he struck out Bob Horner. In his final outing of the season, Richard reached the 300-strikeout pinnacle by striking out Rowland Office in a September 28 victory over the Braves. He also hit his seventh career home run, making him the Astros' career leader in home runs by a pitcher. At that time, he became only the tenth pitcher, third National Leaguer and first NL right-hander in history to strike out more than 300batters in a single season.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{defeated}} Tottenham 1–0 on 25 April 2005, {{which meant}} Chelsea needed {{to wait on}} Saturday in order to mathematically win the title. Second position was the best Arsenal could aim for {{by the time they}} faced West Bromwich Albion on 2 May 2005. Goals from Van Persie and Edu earned a 2–0 win for the team and Arsenal beat Champions League finalists Liverpool at Highbury to all-but secure second spot. Arsenal recorded the biggest win of the league season, against Everton at Highbury. An inspired performance by Bergkamp helped the team win 7–0; he created the opening two goals and scored in the second half. Arsenal lost their final game of the campaign, away to Birmingham City. It was a lacklustre performance by the visitors, who equalised through Bergkamp after <b>going</b> <b>a</b> goal behind, but conceded in the 90th minute.|$|E

5|$|Mario Basler's free kick {{after six}} minutes opened the scoring for Bayern Munich. Bayern then {{had the chance}} to extend their lead with Mehmet Scholl hitting the post and Carsten Jancker the crossbar, forcing Peter Schmeichel to make {{numerous}} saves. In reaction to <b>going</b> <b>a</b> goal down, Ferguson substituted in Solskjær and Sheringham. As the game went to injury time, referee Pierluigi Collina indicated that three minutes would be played. In almost the last attack of the game, United won a corner, which Beckham took and goalkeeper Schmeichel went up front for. The ball was partially cleared by the Bayern defence before being played back to Giggs, who sent a low volley into the path of Sheringham, whose scuffed shot squeezed low inside the post.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} season under Bölöni, Gourcuff rotated between the club's reserve team and the senior team. He appeared in nine matches with the reserve team and 21 with the senior team. Gourcuff only started six matches with the latter team scoring no goals and providing one assist. In the 2005–06 season, he was reassigned the number 10 shirt by Bölöni and giving a starting place within the team. In his first season as a starter, Gourcuff appeared in 42 total matches and scored six goals. He formed midfield partnerships with fellow Frenchman Olivier Monterrubio and the Swede Kim Källström and made his European debut on 15 September in a UEFA Cup first round tie against Spanish club Osasuna appearing as a substitute. Rennes won the tie 3–1 on aggregate and were later eliminated in the group stage portion of the competition. Three days after his European debut, on 18 September, Gourcuff scored his first professional goal against Monaco in a 2–0 win. In November, Gourcuff scored goals in back-to-back matches against Troyes and Toulouse. In {{the latter part of}} the season, Gourcuff went on a scoring run netting three goals in a span of four weeks. He scored the first of these goals on 25 February 2006 in a 4–1 away win over Lyon. After <b>going</b> <b>a</b> week without a goal, Gourcuff responded by scoring goals in back-to-back weeks in wins over Ajaccio and Metz. In the Coupe de France, Gourcuff appeared in all four of the team's matches as Rennes reached the semi-finals where the club was defeated 3–0 by Marseille. Rennes ultimately finished the season in 7th place in the league, which resulted in the club qualifying for the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Gourcuff finished his Rennes career with 80 appearances, six goals, and nine assists.|$|E

He followed this up a week later with a 6th place at the Lifelock 400 at Michigan International Speedway. After racing in the top-10 all day, Montoya got his third top 10 in a row with a 6th place at the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma. Montoya got his best ever finish at Daytona International Speedway in the Coke Zero 400 where after <b>going</b> <b>a</b> lap down twice he battled back to 9th.|$|E

In February 1994, the Clippers traded Manning to the Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins. Wilkins played 25 games for the club, averaging 29.1 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 37.9 minutes per game. After one year on the job, Weiss was fired, and veteran head coach Bill Fitch was brought in to guide a roster of young and inexperienced players.|$|E
25|$|The Suns {{continued}} {{to be successful in}} the regular season, going 178–68 during the 1992–93, 1993–94, and 1994–95 seasons. They {{continued to}} bolster their roster by adding players such as A. C. Green, Danny Manning, Wesley Person, Wayman Tisdale, and Elliot Perry. Despite a Pacific Division title in 1995, the Suns were eliminated in consecutive Western Conference Semifinal rounds by the Houston Rockets, both series <b>going</b> <b>a</b> full seven games. Manning was rarely at full strength with the Suns, injuring his ACL in 1995 just before the All-Star break. In both years, the Suns led the series by two games at one point (2–0 in 1994, 3–1 in 1995) only to see the Rockets come back to win each series.|$|E

Following two periods of extra time, in which neither team was able to score, Italy lost out to Argentina on penalties.

25|$|As {{a result}} of a {{postponed}} league fixture at home to Barrow due to snow, which was originally scheduled to be played on 19 December, Borough did not play again in the league again until Boxing Day, away at Cambridge United. Despite <b>going</b> <b>a</b> goal behind early on, Stevenage won the match 31. A Danny Crow penalty in the sixth minute put the hosts in front after Mark Albrighton was deemed to have tugged Chris Holroyd's shirt in the box. Borough responded well and, twenty minutes later, earned a penalty of their own when Yemi Odubade was sliced down in the box. The striker dusted himself down and duly tucked away the spot-kick to draw the visitors level. A minute later, Cambridge were reduced to ten men, when Wayne Hatswell was sent-off for a two-footed lunge on Chris Beardsley. Stevenage took the lead ten minutes into the second-half when Charlie Griffin slotted home from an acute angle, before Chris Beardsley added a third with a neat finish after good work from Ronnie Henry. Two days later, the side drew 00 with AFC Wimbledon at Broadhall Way.|$|E
