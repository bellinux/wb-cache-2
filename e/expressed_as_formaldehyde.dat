The SML(T), given in European Commission Directive 2002 / 72 /EC as amended is 15 mg/kg. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was carried out on the articles to confirm the plastic type. Articles were exposed to the food simulant 3 % (w/v) aqueous acetic acid under conditions representing their worst foreseeable use. Formaldehyde and HMTA in food simulants was determined by a spectrophotometric derivatisation procedure. Positive samples were confirmed by a second spectrophotometric procedure using an alternative derivatisation agent. As all products purchased were intended for repeat use, three sequential exposures to the simulant were carried out. Formaldehyde was detected in the simulant exposed to 43 samples. Most of the levels found were well below the limits set in law such that 84 per cent of the samples tested were compliant. However, from eight samples formaldehyde levels were clearly above the legal maximum at 6 - 65 times the SML(T) ...|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{problems}} of endodontic origin have a bacterial etiological agent. Thus, there is a continued interest in seeking more effective chemical substances that can replace the camphorated paramonochiorophenol or antibiotics as intracanal medicaments. Among the possible substances, ozone has some interesting biological characteristics: bactericidal action, debriding effect, angiogenesis stimulation capacity and high oxidizing power. The {{purpose of this study was}} to chemically evaluate the presence of ozone in sunflower, castor, olive and almond oil, as well as in propylene glycol and byproducts of ozonation, such <b>as</b> <b>formaldehyde.</b> These compounds were ozonized, inserted into empty and sterile vials, and analyzed by testing the reaction between ozone and indigo, for determining the presence of ozone, and subjected to the chromotropic acid test for determining the presence of formaldehyde. It was observed complete absence of ozone in all samples tested and presence of formaldehyde. The bactericidal and healing action of ozonized oils could be attributed to products formed by the ozonation of mineral oils, such <b>as</b> <b>formaldehyde,</b> not to the ozone itself...|$|R
50|$|Melamine-formaldehyde type crosslinkers in {{particular}} are widely used in anodic electrocoatings. These types crosslinkers are relatively inexpensive and provide {{a wide range of}} cure and performance characteristics which allow the coating designer to tailor the product for the desired end use. Coatings formulated with this type of crosslinker can have acceptable UV light resistance. Many of them are relatively low viscosity materials and can act as a reactive plasticizer, replacing some of the organic solvent that otherwise might be necessary. The amount of free <b>formaldehyde,</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> which may be released during the baking process is of concern as these are considered to be hazardous air pollutants.|$|R

50|$|Performic acid is non-toxic; it does irritate the skin, {{but less}} so than peracetic acid. Concentrated acid (above 50%) is highly reactive; it readily {{decomposes}} upon heating, and explodes upon rapid heating to 80-85 °C. It may ignite or explode {{at room temperature}} when combined with flammable substances, such <b>as</b> <b>formaldehyde,</b> benzaldehyde, or aniline, and explodes violently upon addition of metal powders. For this reason, spilled performic acid is diluted with cold water and collected with neutral, non-flammable inorganic absorbents, such as vermiculite.|$|R
