5|$|Brolgas are monogamous {{and usually}} bond for life, though new pairings may follow a {{fatality}} of one individual. A feature of a bonded couple is the synchronous calling which the female usually initiates. She stands with her wings <b>folded</b> <b>and</b> beak {{pointed to the}} sky and emits a series of trumpeting calls. The male stands alongside in a similar posture but with his wings flared and primaries drooping. He emits one longer call for every two emitted by the female.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{a player}} {{shortage}} {{led to a}} shrinking of the league as several teams <b>folded</b> <b>and</b> others merged. Among the short-lived merged teams were the Steagles (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia) in 1943, the Card-Pitts (Chicago Cardinals and Pittsburgh) in 1944, and a team formed from the merger of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Boston Yanks in 1945.|$|E
40|$|The {{shortening}} {{and extension}} of mechanically layered ductile rock generates <b>folds</b> <b>and</b> pinch-and-swell structures (also {{referred to as}} necks or continuous boudins), which result from mechanical instabilities termed <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> necking, respectively. <b>Folding</b> <b>and</b> necking are the preferred deformation modes in layered rock because the corresponding mechanical work involved is less than that associated with a homogeneous deformation. The effective viscosity of a layered rock decreases during <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> necking, even when all material parameters remain constant. This mechanical softening due to viscosity decrease is solely the result of <b>fold</b> <b>and</b> pinch-and-swell structure development and is hence termed structural softening (or geometric weakening). <b>Folding</b> <b>and</b> necking occur over {{the whole range of}} geological scales, from microscopic up to the size of lithospheric plates. Lithospheric <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> necking are evidence for significant deformation of continental plates, which contradicts the rigid-plate paradigm of plate tectonics. We review here some theoretical and experimental results on <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> necking, including the lithospheric scale, together with a short historical overview of research on <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> necking. We focus on theoretical studies and analytical solutions that provide the best insight into the fundamental parameters controlling <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> necking, although they invariably involve simplifications. To first order, the two essential parameters to quantify <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> necking are the dominant wavelength and the corresponding maximal amplification rate. This review also includes a short overview of experimental studies, a discussion of recent developments involving mainly numerical models, a presentation of some practical applications of theoretical results, and a summary of similarities <b>and</b> differences between <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> necking...|$|R
50|$|A <b>fold</b> <b>and</b> thrust belt is {{a series}} of mountainous foothills {{adjacent}} to an orogenic belt, which forms due to contractional tectonics. <b>Fold</b> <b>and</b> thrust belts commonly form in the forelands adjacent to major orogens as deformation propagates outwards. <b>Fold</b> <b>and</b> thrust belts usually comprise both <b>folds</b> <b>and</b> thrust faults, commonly interrelated. They are commonly also known as thrust-and-fold belts, or simply thrust-fold belts.|$|R

5|$|The {{action of}} {{metamorphism}} {{on the border}} between granite and gneiss bodies produces a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks called greenstone belts. Most Archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts; the green color comes from minerals, such as chlorite, epidote and actinolite that formed during metamorphism. After metamorphism occurred, these rocks were <b>folded</b> <b>and</b> faulted into a system of mountains by the Algoman orogeny.|$|E
5|$|The {{floodplain}} of Johnson Creek is {{a remnant}} of large glacial floods known as the Missoula Floods that deposited thick sediments between 18,000 and 13,000years ago in the Columbia River Basin, including much of the Willamette Valley. Underlying the sediments are substantial thicknesses of basalt lavas from the Columbia River Basalt Group. The lava, exposed mainly in the uplands, has been <b>folded</b> <b>and</b> faulted to form a series of sub-basins, including the Johnson Creek watershed.|$|E

5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are <b>folded</b> <b>and</b> faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. This {{was one of the}} first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith to the creation of a testable hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E
50|$|Folds {{that may}} {{experience}} prolonged 3D growth {{can be divided}} into two groups according to their causes, namely detachment <b>fold</b> <b>and</b> forced <b>fold.</b> They are mainly differentiated by the presence of major fault control on fold structure in forced <b>folds,</b> <b>and</b> the absence of it in detachment folds.

5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such {{as energy}} generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack of}} internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly <b>folded</b> <b>and</b> fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm.|$|E

40|$|SummaryTo {{provide an}} {{integrated}} view of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function in protein export, we {{have described the}} interdependence of protein <b>folding</b> energetics <b>and</b> the adaptable biology of cellular protein <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> transport through the exocytic pathway. A simplified treatment of the protein homeostasis network and a formalism for how this network of competing pathways interprets protein <b>folding</b> kinetics <b>and</b> thermodynamics provides a framework for understanding cellular protein trafficking. We illustrate how <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> misfolding energetics, {{in concert with the}} adjustable biological capacities of the <b>folding,</b> degradation, <b>and</b> export pathways, collectively dictate an adaptable standard for protein export from the ER. A model of folding for export (FoldEx) establishes that no single feature dictates <b>folding</b> <b>and</b> transport efficiency. Instead, a network view provides insight into the basis for cellular diversity, disease origins, and protein homeostasis, and predicts strategies for restoring protein homeostasis in protein-misfolding diseases...|$|R

5|$|The {{opening of}} the rail {{connections}} was a death blow to the stage road.

Two years later, after the railroads began service, the company <b>folded</b> <b>and</b> abandoned the road. Independence itself met the same fate a decade later when its remaining population decamped to Aspen during the severe winter of 1899, leaving its buildings standing as a ghost town (one remaining resident lingered until 1920).|$|E

40|$|Inclusion trails (Si) within 741 equant garnet porphyroblasts show a {{consistent}} orientation across a 100 m 2 outcrop of Precambrian metapelite with later (D 2) <b>folds</b> <b>and</b> shear zones in Posio, Finland. Variation in Si orientations is not systematic {{with respect to}} these later <b>folds</b> <b>and</b> shear zones, but instead represents microfolding and warping of S 1 before the formation of D 2 structures. The development of the D 2 <b>folds</b> <b>and</b> shear zones is investigated by comparing the pattern of Si in the outcrop to those predicted for porphyroblasts in tangential longitudinal strain, axial slip, flexural flow, pure shear, partitioned flexural flow and partitioned pure shear folds. Si patterns are also compared with models for non-coaxial and coaxial shear zones. Along with corroborating evidence from structures in the outcrop and matrix, the comparisons indicate that D 2 <b>folds</b> <b>and</b> shear zones in the outcrop formed in response to NW–SE axially symmetric shortening during which garnet porphyroblasts did not rotate relative to each other, the axial plane of F 2 <b>folds,</b> <b>and</b> D 2 shear zone boundaries...|$|R
