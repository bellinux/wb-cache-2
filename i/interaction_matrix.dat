40|$|This paper studies a {{recently}} proposed continuous-time distributed self-appraisal model with time-varying interactions among {{a network of}} $n$ individuals which are characterized by a sequence of time-varying relative <b>interaction</b> <b>matrices.</b> The model describes {{the evolution of the}} social-confidence levels of the individuals via a reflected appraisal mechanism in real time.

Consequently, landowners are being encouraged to maintain and grow wildflower patches to provide habitat for important pollinators. Research on plant-pollinator <b>interaction</b> <b>matrices</b> indicates that a small number of “core ” plants provide a disproportionately high amount of pollen and nectar to insects. This matrix data can be used to help design wildflower plantings that provide optimal resources for desirable pollinators. Existing <b>interaction</b> <b>matrices</b> from three tall grass prairie preserves in the northern prairies were used to identify core plant species that are visited by wild pollinators of a common insect-pollinated crop, namely canola (Brassica napus L.). The wildflower preferences of each insect taxon were determined using quantitative insect visitation and floral abundance data. Phenology data were used to calculate the degree of floral synchrony between the wildflowers and canola.
