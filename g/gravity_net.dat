40|$|Due {{to limited}} space close to shore and {{environmental}} concerns, {{the trend has}} become to move the fish farms to more exposed areas. This motivates the study of loads on the fish farm in more energetic currents and waves. In this thesis the conventional <b>gravity</b> <b>net</b> cage is analysed from an experimental and numerical point of view. The focus is on mooring line loads, which represent the global loads acting on the system. The numerical program FhSim, which is SINTEF Fisheries and Aquaculture inhouse software, is subject for a comparison study in terms of mooring line loads. Two systems of the <b>gravity</b> <b>net</b> cage are analysed. Experiments conducted by MARINTEK in May 2013 are analysed to investigate the mean load features in large current and waves. The results are compared to mean load predictions from the numerical code FhSim. A comparative study between FhSim and the numerical code developed by Kristiansen and Faltinsen (2014) is also performed. Experimental analysis in irregular waves and currents show that the mean mooring line load is dominated by current. The mean load is found to increase with increased wave height and wave period. These trends are captured by the numerical programs. The mean load in currents and waves is decomposed into a static load which is the current only contribution, and the remaining dynamic force part. Alternative scalings of the mean dynamic force included the squared ratio of wave velocity to current velocity or the wave amplitude squared. From the comparative study, {{it is found that}} FhSim predicts the mean loads with a reasonable agreement in a combination of the current velocity U= 0. 5 m/s and the wave steepness 1 / 30. In a combination of larger currents and steeper waves, FhSim overestimates the mean load for the studied model. This {{can be explained by the}} implemented Morison load model and the increased water flow velocity across the net. In the analysis of a complete mooring line system, a prediction error was detected in the numerical program FhSim. Together with the possible overestimation of mean mooring line loads in large currents and waves this must be accounted for when assessing mooring line loads by use of FhSim. In a comparison study, a set of high accuracy data from both numerical predictions and experimental measurements should be ensured. A reduction of systematic errors and detection of precision errors improves the quality of the data. In order to confirm the observed features regarding mean load predictions from FhSim, further investigations with a wider range of experimental test conditions in large currents and waves are required. </p...|$|E
40|$|The 1975 – 1984 Krafla rifting {{episode was}} a major lava- and dyke-producing event {{associated}} {{with the release of}} extensional strain accumulated over more than 200 years at the divergent plate boundary in North Iceland. The present work provides a unique example of gravity decreases and increases sustained over a long period following a major eruptive episode at a rift volcano. After height correction, persistent <b>net</b> <b>gravity</b> decreases over the source of observed Mogi-type deflation occur with gravity increases occurring further away from this centre of deformation. Gravity decreases are interpreted in terms of drainage from a shallow magma chamber. The <b>net</b> <b>gravity</b> decreases require that at least 4 × 1010 kg of magma must have been drained during the 6 -year observation period. Assuming a density of 2700 kg m− 3, this magma would occupy 1. 5 × 107 m 3 and by analogy with results obtained for Kilauea, this implies a magma chamber volume change of 4. 1 × 106 m 3. This is consistent with the chamber volume change deduced from ground deformation data assuming a Poisson's ratio of 0. 25 and a Mogi source. <b>Net</b> <b>gravity</b> increases are more spatially extensive and are most likely caused by migration of the steam–water interface and/or closure of micro-fractures in lavas above the magma chamber during post-eruptive cooling and contraction. We present a model for the Krafla magma chamber in which a cooling, contracting and draining magma body causes subsidence at the surface. These results contrast with observations from the Askja caldera, Iceland, where post-eruptive deflation {{has been shown to be}} accompanied by negligible <b>net</b> <b>gravity</b> changes above the Mogi-type source in the caldera.

About 190 stations were occupied and an additional 180 stations occupied by the Geological Survey of Japan just after the destructive earthquake of February, 1968, were included to cover the total area of 1, 300 km 2. The IGSN 71 <b>gravity</b> <b>net</b> was used as reference and the 1967 Geodetic Reference System was adopted for the gravity value computation. Regional average density was obtained according to the method proposed by RIKITAKE et al. (1965) and the terrain and Bouguer corrections were computed to the nearest 40 km 2. The contour map of the Bouguer anomaly (Fig. 5) clearly shows two local negative anomalies: one occupying {{the center of a}} conspicuous topographic low, called Kakuto basin; and the other lying immediately east of Kakuto basin. The former gravity low (up to ― 15 mgal) strongly supports the hypothesis by Arita (1957 a, b) and others that Kakuto basin is a caldera of the Crater Lake type formed by collapse following the eruption of large-scale pyroclastic flows. The welded deposits of the pyroclastic flows are found in many places outside Kakuto basin (Fig. 2).

Results from two simulations with the gravity wave spectrum launched at two different heights, the surface and the 110 -hPa pressure level, respectively, are compared. Noteworthy differences found in the simulated middle atmosphere response include the following (1) The average temperature in the southern winter upper stratosphere is about 40 K warmer in the experiment with the surface as the launching height, virtually eliminating the typical cold polar bias that affects many general circulation models. (2) Stronger easterlies in the subtropical summer mesosphere, again in the experiment with the surface as the launching height. Diagnostics of the parameterized gravity waves indicate that in the experiment with the surface as the launching height, the net zonal momentum flux transported by the gravity waves is negative just above the troposphere at middle latitudes. This negative net momentum flux facilitates the deceleration of the mesospheric winter westerlies. The meridional circulation induced by such deceleration is thereafter responsible for the substantial polar winter warming. In contrast, in summer the negative net momentum flux limits the upper mesospheric deceleration of the easterlies. In the experiment with launching height at 110 -hPa, the <b>gravity</b> wave <b>net</b> momentum flux is instead zero by construction at the launching height...|$|R
40|$|Ground tilt {{measurements}} {{demonstrate that}} Askja is {{in a state}} of unrest, and that in the period 1988 - 1991 a maximum 48 +/- 3 µrad tilt occurred down towards the centre of the caldera. This is consistent with 126 mm of deflation at the centre of the caldera with a 2. 5 - 3. 0 km depth to the source of deformation. The volume of the subsidence bowl is 6. 2 x 106 m 3. When combined with high precision microgravity measurements, the overall change in sub-surface mass may be quantified. After correction for the observed elevation change using the free air gradient of gravity measured for each station, the total change in mass is estimated to be less than 109 kg. A small residual ground inflation and <b>net</b> <b>gravity</b> increase in the eastern part of the caldera may be caused by dyke intrusion in this region. The minimum dimensions of such an intrusion or complex of intrusions are 1 m width, up to 100 m deep and up to several hundred metres thick...|$|R
