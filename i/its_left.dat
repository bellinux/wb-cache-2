5|$|Around daybreak, Pike's A Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, {{reached the}} village of Katika, {{which turned out to}} be a {{clearing}} with some dilapidated huts. His company came under fire from Katika Spur, the high ground to the west, which was strongly held by the 9th Company, 80th Infantry Regiment and a company of the 238th Infantry Regiment. The Japanese attempted to outflank A Company on <b>its</b> <b>left,</b> but ran into Capitan L. Snell's D Company, 2/15th Infantry Battalion.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 5/6 August, {{infantry}} in the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade and 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade were at Abu Hamra, the 127th (Manchester) Brigade (42nd Division) at Hod el Enna, the 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade (42nd Division) on <b>its</b> <b>left</b> {{in touch with the}} 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, (52nd Division) which had <b>its</b> <b>left</b> on Redoubt No. 21. The next morning, infantry in the 42nd Division was ordered to advance eastwards at 04:00 and occupy a line from Bir el Mamluk to Bir Katia, while the 52nd (Lowland) Division was to advance from Abu Hamra and prolong the infantry line of the 42nd Division to the north-east. Although they carried out their orders during their two-day march from Pelusium Station to Katia, infantry in the 127th (Manchester) Brigade lost 800 men, victims to thirst and the sun; other infantry brigades suffered similarly. It became clear that the infantry could not go on, and they ceased to be employed in the advance. Indeed, it was necessary for the Bikanir Camel Corps and Yeomanry detachments, as well as the medical services, to search the desert for those who had been left behind.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{bombardment}} caused {{a large number}} of casualties. Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge. The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to <b>its</b> <b>left,</b> as did the Scots Greys, to reduce their casualty rate.|$|E

5|$|The Army of Rhin-et-Moselle led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau was {{deployed}} {{with its}} right flank at Huningue, its {{center on the}} Queich River and <b>its</b> <b>left</b> flank at Saarbrücken. The Army of Sambre-et-Meuse commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was responsible for a line running north from Sankt Wendel to Cologne, while the 22,000 men of <b>its</b> <b>left</b> wing under Jean-Baptiste Kléber held Düsseldorf. The French grand strategy designed by Minister of War Lazare Carnot was for each of their two armies to turn the Austrian flanks. The strategic plan called for Jourdan to start by advancing by his left wing and was designed to accomplish two goals. First, {{it was hoped that}} this would cause the Austrians to abandon {{the west bank of the}} Rhine. Second, the move would draw Austrian strength north and allow Moreau's army a better chance to cross the Rhine in the south.|$|E

5|$|The {{bald eagle}} appears on most {{official}} seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, {{and in the}} logos of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to <b>its</b> <b>left</b> (the viewer's right), which {{gave rise to the}} urban legend that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.|$|E
5|$|The first {{records of}} human {{inhabitants}} in the Zaprešić metropolitan area {{date back to}} the Neolithic, evident through stone axes found in Brdovec, and axes from the Copper Age found in Marija Gorica.

5|$|The {{plan to take}} Bapaume {{involved}} the 1st Infantry Brigade, positioned at Grévillers, moving {{to the south of}} Bapaume with the 63rd Division moving forward to protect the right flank of the New Zealanders. Meanwhile, the 2nd Infantry Brigade would move {{to the north of the}} town. <b>Its</b> <b>left</b> flank would be protected by the 37th Division. Their aim was to envelop Bapaume and force the Germans to abandon the town and thus avoid costly street to street fighting.|$|E

5|$|At {{about this}} time, the 15th Brigade IV Corps {{was sent to}} link up with the Nassauers of Wellington's left flank in the Frichermont-La Haie area, with the brigade's horse {{artillery}} battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to <b>its</b> <b>left</b> in support. Napoleon sent Lobau's corps to stop the rest of Bülow's IV Corps proceeding to Plancenoit. The 15th Brigade threw Lobau's troops out of Frichermont with a determined bayonet charge, then proceeded up the Frichermont heights, battering French Chasseurs with 12-pounder artillery fire, and pushed on to Plancenoit. This sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area, driving Lobau past {{the rear of the}} Armee Du Nord's right flank and directly threatening its only line of retreat. Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit.|$|E
