5|$|The {{expected}} future {{course of}} the disease depends on the subtype of the disease; the individual's sex, age, and initial symptoms; and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> the person has.

5|$|Relapsing-remitting MS is {{characterized}} by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet (remission) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease. This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS. When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is {{sometimes referred to as}} benign MS, although people will still build up some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> in the long term. On the other hand, the term malignant multiple sclerosis is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level of disability in a short period. The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis. 30 to 70% of persons experiencing CIS later develop MS.|$|E

A 2006 Dutch study followed 155 cases and found that 27 individuals (17%) had died at an early age.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{clinical and}} immunological markers associated with HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). METHOD: 237 HTLV-I infected individuals were clinically assessed. They were classified {{according to the}} Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Osames Motor Disability Score (OMDS). Cytokine levels were determined in HTLV-I seropositive individuals. RESULTS: 37 patients had HAM/TSP. There was a correlation between the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> assessed by both scales. There was also a correlation between the duration of HAM/TSP and the severity <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> assessed by either EDSS or OMDS. Higher levels of IFN-gamma were detected in unstimulated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) from HAM/TSP patients as compared with HTLV-I carriers. CONCLUSION: This study shows the validity of the neurological scales to classify the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> neurological <b>disability</b> in HTLV-I carriers and suggests a progressive behavior of HAM/TSP. This study also shows that IFN-gamma in PBMC supernatants are markers of HAM/TSP...|$|R

This was a cross-sectional study including 282 cases diagnosed from 2004 to 2009. The <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> at diagnosis and at discharge from treatment were collected from medical records and the National Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN). A simplified neurological workup was performed after discharge from treatment. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> at diagnosis was 29. 4 %, and 8. 9 % of then was grade II. Between diagnosis and discharge, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> physical <b>disability</b> worsened in 25 % of cases.

40|$|As the Act on Special Education for Disabled Persons, etc {{has been}} enacted {{and the number}} of {{students}} who have severe and multiple disabilities among students with disabilities has increased, the needs for services related to special education have also grown. However, it is not easy to understand the current situation of services related to special education due to the lack of studies on services related to special education in South Korea. This study aimed to make understanding of the current situation of services related to special education in South Korea based on the literature reviews and the latest statistics on services related to special education and to understand and explore their problems. In results of analyzing current services related to special education that have been provided, some problems have been disclosed that only small number <b>of</b> students with <b>disabilities</b> have been therapeutically supported because of the complicated diagnosis and evaluation procedure to receive therapeutic support; and unpaid special education paraprofessionals lack in expertise. Moreover, there are detailed clauses in the Act to assist students with disabilities in attending school by providing mobility, even though it should be given according to the types and <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabilities.</b> To solve the problems of services related to special education in South Korea, the suggestions can be made as follows; (1) the diagnosis and evaluation procedure to provide therapeutic support need to be simplified, (2) the qualification criteria for special education paraprofessionals need to be prepared to secure their expertise, and (3) the vehicle for school attendance needs to be provided according to the types and <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> <b>of</b> students...|$|R
