6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} can do as you like, Charlotte," [...] Eleanor said feebly; [...] "but for my part <b>I</b> <b>would</b> much <b>rather</b> go on as we are. We don't know now that the will really exists, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> much <b>rather</b> go on {{thinking}} {{that there is a}} doubt about it." ...|$|R

25|$|I do support getting animals out in {{the same}} way I would have {{supported}} getting human slaves out, child labor, sex slaves, the whole lot. But I don't support burning. I don't support arson. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing {{if they are going to}} hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E

500|$|Heisman {{also said}} of Strupper [...] "Were I {{compelled}} to risk {{my head on}} what one absolutely unaided gridster might accomplish, football under arm and facing eleven ferocious opponents, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> choose and chance this man on how he might come through the gauntlet than any ball carrier I have ever seen in action." ...|$|E

500|$|Steinitz {{strove to}} be {{objective}} in his writings about chess competitions and games, for example he attributed to sheer bad luck a poor tournament score by Henry Edward Bird, whom he considered no friend of his, and was generous in his praise of great play by even his bitter enemies. He could poke fun at {{some of his own}} rhetoric, for example [...] "I remarked that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> die in America than live in England. ... I added that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having carefully considered the subject in all its bearings, I {{have come to the conclusion}} that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match." [...] At a joint simultaneous display in Russia around the time of the 1895–96 Saint Petersburg tournament, Emanuel Lasker and Steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act.|$|E
500|$|Before turning {{professional}} McBreen {{worked a}} number of jobs along with playing football, saying [...] "I did everything – too many jobs to mention – and I know <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> be on the training ground than sat in an office or hauling concrete all day". He married Gabrielle Stockton in Sydney, New South Wales during December 2014 and the couple have two sons, Noah and Leo.|$|E
500|$|In an April 30, 1956, {{keynote address}} at the Washington and Lee Mock Convention, Barkley spoke of his {{willingness}} to sit with the other freshman senators in Congress, he ended with an allusion to , saying [...] "I'm glad {{to sit on the}} back row, for <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> be a servant in the House of the Lord than to sit in the seats of the mighty." [...] He then collapsed onstage and died of a heart attack. He was buried in Mount Kenton Cemetery near Paducah.|$|E

500|$|He reluctantly {{attended}} Harvard College [...] "because of the brand", {{graduating in}} 1979, with a BA in English. He later reflected negatively on the experience, writing, [...] "With {{a few exceptions}} ... those four years are ones <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> forget." [...] While at Harvard, Baker played on the JV basketball team, utilizing his 6 foot 6 inch stature. He then attended Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, where he received an MBA in management. After graduating, Baker served as corporate communications director for the Massachusetts High Technology Council.|$|E
500|$|Chapter 27 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} films of the 2000s. In April 2006, an on-line petition group calling themselves Boycottchapter27.org campaigned to [...] "pressurise [...] movie theatres not to show the film, to stop the glorification of a murderer." [...] Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, expressed her thought saying, [...] "This is another thing which will hurt me, I'm sure. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> not make a story out of Mr. Chapman at all, although I sympathize with the actors. They need to work. It's not just films, you're always talking about it [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Levin's {{interest}} in indexes developed {{from his work}} on The Pendulum Years. He compiled his own index for the book, [...] "and swore a mighty oath, when I had finished the task, that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> die, and in a particularly unpleasant manner, than do it again". He contrived to include in his index an obscene joke {{at the expense of}} the hapless prosecutor in the Chatterley trial, but found the difficulty of indexing so great that he became a champion of the Society of Indexers. [...] He wrote several articles on the subject, and when reviewing books made a point of praising good indexes and condemning bad ones.|$|E

500|$|Byrne {{was carried}} to [...] "The Woolpack" [...] inn in nearby St Albans, {{where he was}} {{attended}} to by Tom Spring. On {{the evening of the}} fight Byrne was considered to be close to death, but {{over the course of the}} following two days he seemed to be recovering, and was sufficiently conscious to thank his friends for their ministrations. But his condition worsened during the afternoon of Saturday 1 June 1833, and he died the following day; the cause of death was given as [...] "congestion of blood in the brain". Byrne himself was reportedly of a different opinion, telling a chambermaid shortly before his death that [...] "If I should die, it will not be from the beating I received but from mortification. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> have died than been beaten in that fight." [...] He left behind a wife and four children in Dublin.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1979 NFL Draft, new [...] San Francisco 49ers {{head coach}} Bill Walsh flew to Morehead State with {{assistant}} coach Sam Wyche {{to work out}} Simms. Walsh was so impressed {{that he planned to}} draft Simms in the third round, preferring him over the quarterback they ultimately took, Joe Montana of Notre Dame. But the New York Giants decided to make Simms their first round pick (seventh overall) to the surprise of many. As Simms acknowledged, [...] "most people have never heard of me." [...] When Simms's name was announced by Commissioner Pete Rozelle in front of the audience at the draft in New York, his selection was booed loudly by the Giants fans in attendance. (He was the second quarterback taken; Jack Thompson of Washington State went to Cincinnati with the third overall pick.) Simms was not happy being a Giant either, [...] "All I was thinking was which teams <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> play for—the Green Bay Packers, the Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego, San Francisco..." [...] Nonetheless, he became popular with his teammates who jokingly dubbed him [...] "Prince Valiant" [...] in his rookie training camp.|$|E
500|$|In March 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Disney had greenlit the third film with Hedlund reprising his role as Sam and Kosinski returning to direct the sequel. Wilde {{was revealed}} in April to be returning as Quorra. Filming was expected to start in Vancouver in October 2015. However, in May 2015, The Hollywood Reporter stated that Walt Disney Studios had chosen not to continue with a third installment, which was confirmed by Wilde the following month. In the end of July, Boxleitner stated he frequently heard about the pre-production of Tron 3 while shooting Cedar Cove in Vancouver, and was disappointed to hear about the cancellation. While expressing the opinion that Disney decided to [...] "play it safe" [...] and explore other properties, Boxleitner said that this broke his interest in continuing with the franchise, as [...] "it's been too up and down for me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> not just keep going. I don’t want to repeat my career anymore." [...] In September 2015, Hedlund stated that he was told that the third Tron film was not [...] "totally dead", but jokingly suggested that it could be released 30 years later, referencing the near 30-year gap between the first film and Legacy.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was at home}} to Charlton Athletic. The team conceded four {{goals in}} 20 minutes and blew several chances to [...] "kill the game", in what was the club's biggest home defeat in the league under Wenger. An away trip to local rivals Tottenham Hostpur became {{magnified}} with interest, given it marked the return of Campbell following his move to Arsenal. An 81st-minute goal scored by Pirès put Arsenal into the lead, before a lapse by Wright in goal allowed Gus Poyet‘s shot to squirm from his grasp and enter the goalnet. Arsenal then faced league champions Manchester United {{and in spite of}} conceding inside 14 minutes through a Paul Scholes’ strike, Ljungberg equalised for them [...] "with a wonderful chipped finish, following Gary Neville's wretched error." [...] Arsenal improved in the second half but scored in unforeseen fashion: United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez passed the ball directly into the feet of Henry, who profited from the error and scored. Five minutes later, Barthez's failure to grasp the ball presented Henry the chance to score his second, which he did. Both Henry and Wenger defended the opposition goalkeeper, with the former, his international teammate saying: [...] "Of course I was happy to score the goals but it was strange. He's my good friend and I feel sorry for him; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> have got them another way." ...|$|E
500|$|The King had a mixed {{relationship}} with Lord Melbourne. Melbourne's government mooted more ideas to introduce greater democracy, {{such as the}} devolution of powers to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, which greatly alarmed the King, who feared it would eventually lead {{to the loss of}} the colony. At first, the King bitterly opposed these proposals. William exclaimed to Lord Gosford, Governor General-designate of Canada: [...] "Mind what you are about in Canada... mind me, my Lord, the Cabinet is not my Cabinet; they had better take care or by God, I will have them impeached." [...] When William's son Augustus FitzClarence enquired of his father whether the King would be entertaining during Ascot week, William gloomily replied, [...] "I cannot give any dinners without inviting the ministers, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> see the devil than any one of them in my house." [...] Nevertheless, William approved the Cabinet's recommendations for reform. Despite his disagreements with Lord Melbourne, the King wrote warmly to congratulate the Prime Minister when he triumphed in the adultery case brought against him concerning Lady Caroline Norton—he had refused to permit Melbourne to resign when the case was first brought. The King and Prime Minister eventually found a modus vivendi; Melbourne applying tact and firmness when called for; while William realised that his First Minister was far less radical in his politics than the King had feared.|$|E
500|$|Andy says of Jean-Ralphio, [...] "That Ralph Macchio guy's a total douche." [...] This is a {{reference}} to Ralph Macchio, an actor who appeared in the 1983 drama film The Outsiders, which also starred Rob Lowe. The line was improvised by actor Chris Pratt. In another scene, Ben tells Leslie the song he played after getting sworn in as an 18-year-old mayor was [...] "Whoomp! (There It Is)", a 1993 hip hop song by the duo Tag Team. The episode features several quotes from author and outdoorsman Jack London. Among them, which Leslie reads from her master plan proposal, is, [...] "You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club," [...] and [...] "So I say the function of man is to live, not to exist. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot." [...] The original script included about one dozen different London quotes, but most were cut from the final draft. [...] Schur said he used London quotes because he believed the author was one both Leslie and Ron would admire. At {{one point in the}} episode, while discussing April's birthday, Leslie says, [...] "Damn the wheel of the world! Why must it continually turn over?" [...] to which Ron replied approvingly, [...] "Jack London." [...] The line was improvised by actor Nick Offerman.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{thought she}} wasn't looking well {{when she was}} at the office to-day. And so <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come <b>rather</b> than send," [...] Corey {{explained}} in his turn.|$|R
6000|$|... "As much so as possible," [...] Morris promised. [...] "It won't be much use, but I shall try. <b>I</b> {{certainly}} <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> {{have you}} easily than {{have to fight}} for you." ...|$|R
