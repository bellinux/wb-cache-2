5000|$|A queuing {{perspective}} {{suggests that}} labor markets consist of labor <b>queues</b> and <b>job</b> <b>queues.</b> Labor queues consist {{of all possible}} workers in a [...] "queue" [...] to fill a particular job, and the employer determines {{the order of the}} workers in this <b>queue.</b> Similarly, <b>job</b> <b>queues</b> consist of all possible jobs available to a worker, with workers ranking the available jobs. Employers hire workers from as high in the labor queue has possible and the workers will accept the best possible job. By doing this the most wanted jobs go to the most favored workers, while the less preferred jobs go to the less wanted workers. This procedure then leaves the deprived workers with no job or occupying jobs that others have rejected.|$|R

Imagine the program standing in line waiting to use the computer processor.

In 1976 IBM provided another option, JES3 (Job Entry Subsystem 3), a descendant of ASP (Attached Support Processor), which allows one CPU to manage a single <b>job</b> <b>queue</b> feeding work to several physically distinct CPUs, and therefore allows one operator's console to manage the work of all those CPUs.

40|$|Abstract—Much {{work has}} been done to exploit the {{effectiveness}} and efficiency of job scheduling upon distributed computational resources. With regard to existing resource topology and administrative constraints, scheduling approaches are designed for different hierarchic layers, for example, scheduling for <b>job</b> <b>queues</b> of local resource management systems (local scheduling), and scheduling for <b>job</b> <b>queues</b> of high level schedulers (also known as meta-schedulers or grid schedulers). Such scheduling approaches mainly focus on optimizing <b>job</b> <b>queues</b> of the hosting nodes, which are interconnected with computational resources directly or indirectly. In the real world (or in a community-based grid), a grid is comprised of nodes with different computing power and scheduling preferences, which in turn, raise a notable opportunity that is to exploit and optimize the process of job sharing between reachable grid nodes via improving the job allocation and efficiency ratio. In our work, we introduce a novel scheduling protocol which dedicates to disseminate scheduling events happened on each involving node to as many candidate nodes as possible. By means of the proposed protocol, scheduling process of each received job consists of several phases with awareness of grid volatility, and dynamic scheduling and rescheduling is allowed as long as the job execution has not started yet. To this end, a set of concerning algorithms and processing steps are described. A prototype of our scheduling approach is being implemented within the SmartGRID project...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{a new type of}} Globus {{resource}} allocation manager (GRAM) called RMF (Resource Manager beyond the Firewall) for wide-area cluster computing. RMF manages computing resources such as cluster systems and enables utilization of them beyond the firewall in global computing environments. RMF consists of two basic modules, a remote <b>job</b> <b>queuing</b> system (Q system) and a resource allocator. The Q system is a remote <b>job</b> <b>queuing</b> system, which schedules jobs submitted from global computing sites. The resource allocator manages resources and allocates them for requested jobs. For communications beyond the firewall between job processes, we designed the Nexus Proxy, which relays TCP communication links beyond the firewall. RMF and the Nexus Proxy provide a global computing environment in which users can easily utilize such parallel systems as cluster systems and supercomputers beyond the firewall...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: {{to explore}} the {{experiences}} of employees in a local bank merger in the United States and examine the concept of <b>job</b> exit <b>queues.</b> We introduce {{the concept of a}} <b>job</b> exit <b>queue,</b> which describes how workers position themselves or are positioned by employers to leave jobs and enter new jobs following the announcement of a corporate merger. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative interviews with mid-level managers, technical specialists and low status workers during the sale and merger process were conducted and coded thematically. We explore: 1) how workers and managers describe the job search as an “opportunity” or as a recurring cycle of low-wage, high-turnover work and 2) how severance packages structure the <b>job</b> exit <b>queue</b> to meet corporate needs. Findings: The role of severance pay is pivotal in understanding women’s and men’s job relations to <b>job</b> exit <b>queues.</b> We conclude that employers create <b>job</b> exit <b>queues,</b> placing low status workers and mid-level women managers with less formal education at a disadvantage in re-employment. Value: This paper contributes a new concept “job exit queue” to the research and theory on workplace diversity, gender inequality, and queuing theories...|$|R

40|$|Should {{education}} {{become more}} vocational or more general? We address {{this question in}} two steps. We first build and solve a two-sector matching model with generalists and specialists. Generalists pursue jobs in both sectors; however, they come second in <b>job</b> <b>queues.</b> Specialists seek for jobs in a single sector; they come first in <b>job</b> <b>queues.</b> Self-selection in education type vehicles three main externalities: specialists boost job creation in each sector; generalists improve {{the efficiency of the}} matching technology; generalists exacerbate firms' coordination problems. We then calibrate the model on the labor market for upper-secondary graduates in OECD countries. In each country, we match the proportion of specialists and unemployment rates by type of education in 2000. Self-selection is always inefficient: taxing vocational education to reduce the proportion of specialists down to the efficient level could reduce unemployment rates (for upper-secondary graduates) by 1. 1 to 1. 8 percentage points.
