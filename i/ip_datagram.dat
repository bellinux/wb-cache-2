[...] A swIPe packet {{starts with a}} header, which contains identifying data and authentication information; the header {{is followed by the}} original <b>IP</b> <b>datagram,</b> which in turn is followed by any padding required by the security processing. Depending on the negotiated policy, the sensitive part of the swIPe packet (the authentication information and the original <b>IP</b> <b>datagram)</b> may be encrypted.|$|E

50|$|<b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> are {{encapsulated}} in datalink frames, and, therefore, {{the link}} MTU affects larger <b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> and {{forces them to}} be split into pieces equal to or smaller than the MTU size.|$|R
30|$|The most {{frequently}} used method to carry <b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> over MPEG TS is Multiprotocol Encapsulation (MPE);however, MPEG TS is a protocol optimized for broadcasting and not for IP services, so MPE suffers from design constrains as DVB protocol use MPEG TS at the link layer. If we consider the channel bandwidth efficiency, the encapsulation of <b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> by the MPEG TS MPE adds additional overheads to the transmitted data, thus reducing efficiency compared to GSE {{that is designed to}} carry general data, mainly over IP protocol. GSE efficiently encapsulates <b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> over variable length link layer packets, which are then directly inserted to the physical layer baseband frames. If <b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> use GSE, the reduction in overhead is more than two times compared to MPEG-TS transmission.|$|R

50|$|In IPFC, each <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> packet {{is wrapped}} into a FC frame, {{with its own}} header, and {{transmitted}} as a sequence {{of one or more}} frames. The receiver at the other end received the frames, strips the FC headers and reassembles the IP packet. IP datagrams of up to 65,280 bytes in size may be accommodated. ARP packet transmission works in the same fashion. Each <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> exchange is unidirectional, although IP and TCP allow for bidirectional communication within their protocols.|$|E
50|$|The Internet Protocol {{requires}} that hosts {{must be able}} to process IP datagrams of at least 576 bytes (for IPv4) or 1280 bytes (for IPv6). However, this does not preclude Data Link Layers with an MTU smaller than IP's minimum MTU from conveying IP data. For example, according to IPv6's specification, if a particular Data Link Layer physically cannot deliver an <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> of 1280 bytes in a single frame, then the link layer must provide its own fragmentation and reassembly mechanism, separate from IP's own fragmentation mechanism, to ensure that a 1280-byte <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> can be delivered, intact, to the IP layer.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} internetworking protocol in the Internet Layer in {{use today}} is IPv4; the number 4 is the protocol version number carried in every <b>IP</b> <b>datagram.</b> IPv4 is described in RFC 791 (1981).|$|E

50|$|The Gateway-to-Gateway Protocol was {{designed}} as an Internet Protocol (<b>IP)</b> <b>datagram</b> service similar to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). However, it is classified as an Internet Layer protocol.|$|E
50|$|Transmission Control Protocol accepts {{data from}} a data stream, divides it into chunks, and adds a TCP header {{creating}} a TCP segment. The TCP segment is then encapsulated into an Internet Protocol (<b>IP)</b> <b>datagram,</b> and exchanged with peers.|$|E
50|$|IP {{fragmentation}} is {{the process}} of breaking up a single Internet Protocol (<b>IP)</b> <b>datagram</b> into multiple packets of smaller size. Every network link has a characteristic size of messages that may be transmitted, called the maximum transmission unit (MTU).|$|E

50|$|For example, every device (such as an {{intermediate}} router) forwarding an <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> first decrements the time to live (TTL) field in the IP header by one. If the resulting TTL is 0, the packet is discarded and an ICMP time exceeded in transit message {{is sent to the}} datagram's source address.|$|E
50|$|Most Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) routing {{is based}} on a {{two-level}} hierarchical routing in which an IP address is divided into a network portion and a host portion. Gateways use only the network portion until an <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> reaches a gateway that can deliver it directly. Additional levels of hierarchical routing are introduced by the addition of subnetworks.|$|E
50|$|The {{data section}} follows the header. Its {{contents}} are the payload data carried for the application. The {{length of the}} data section is not specified in the TCP segment header. It can be calculated by subtracting the combined length of the TCP header and the encapsulating IP header from the total <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> length (specified in the IP header).|$|E
5000|$|Authentication Headers (AH) {{provides}} connectionless {{data integrity}} and data origin authentication for <b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> and provides protection against replay attacks.|$|R
50|$|In IPv4, hosts {{must make}} a {{best-effort}} attempt to reassemble fragmented <b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> with a total reassembled size of up to 576 bytes. They may also attempt to reassemble fragmented <b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> larger than 576 bytes, {{but they are also}} permitted to silently discard such larger datagrams. Applications are recommended to refrain from sending datagrams larger than 576 bytes unless they have prior knowledge that the remote host is capable of accepting or reassembling them.|$|R

5000|$|In IPv4, the AH {{protects the}} IP payload and all header fields of an <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> except for mutable fields (i.e. those {{that might be}} altered in transit), and also IP options such as the IP Security Option (RFC 1108). Mutable (and {{therefore}} unauthenticated) IPv4 header fields are DSCP/ToS, ECN, Flags, Fragment Offset, TTL and Header Checksum.|$|E
5000|$|IP {{fragment}} overrun: The IP Fragment Overrun exploit {{is when a}} reassembled fragmented datagram {{exceeds the}} declared IP data length or the maximum datagram length. By definition, no <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> should be larger than 65,535 bytes. Systems that try to process these large datagrams can crash, and can be indicative of a denial of service attempt.|$|E

50|$|Receiving hosts {{must make}} a {{best-effort}} attempt to reassemble fragmented <b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> that, after reassembly, contain up to 1500 bytes. Hosts are permitted to make an attempt to reassemble fragmented datagrams larger than 1500 bytes, {{but they are also}} permitted to silently discard any datagram after it becomes apparent that the reassembled packet would be larger than 1500 bytes. Therefore, senders should avoid sending fragmented <b>IP</b> <b>datagrams</b> with a total reassembled size larger than 1500 bytes, unless they have previous assurance that the receiver is capable of reassembling such large datagrams.|$|R
50|$|When {{forwarding}} an <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> {{into the}} MPLS domain, an LER uses routing information {{to determine the}} appropriate label to be affixed, labels the packet accordingly, and then forwards the labelled packet into the MPLS domain. Likewise, upon receiving a labelled packet which is destined to exit the MPLS domain, the LER strips off the label and forwards the resulting IP packet using normal IP forwarding rules.|$|E
5000|$|To set the <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> size {{equal or}} {{smaller than the}} {{directly}} attached medium and delegate all further fragmentation of datagrams to routers, meaning that routers decide if the current datagram should be re-fragmented or not. This offloads {{a lot of work}} on to routers, and can also result in packets being segmented by several IP routers one after another, resulting in very peculiar fragmentation.|$|E
50|$|Any <b>IP</b> <b>datagram</b> with {{a source}} or {{destination}} address set to a loopback address must not appear {{outside of a}} computing system, or be routed by any routing device. Packets received on an interface with a loopback destination address must be dropped. Such packets are {{sometimes referred to as}} Martian packets. As with other bogus packets, they may be malicious and any problems they might cause can be avoided by applying bogon filtering.|$|E
