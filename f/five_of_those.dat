He {{attended}} Victoria College, Jersey, where {{he played in the}} school cricket team for seven summers, from 1866 to 1872, and topped the batting averages in <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> years (1867, 1868, 1869, 1870, and 1872).

5|$|However, {{the first}} {{conclusive}} {{evidence that the}} Balts were uniting {{is considered to be}} the treaty with Galicia–Volhynia signed in 1219. The treaty's signatories include 21 Lithuanian dukes; it specifies that <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> were elder and thus took precedence over the remaining sixteen. Presumably, the eldest Duke was Živinbudas, since his name was mentioned first. Mindaugas, despite his youth, and his brother Dausprungas, are listed among the elder dukes. That would imply that they inherited their titles. The remaining two elder dukes were Daujotas (mentioned second) and his brother Vilikaila (mentioned last of the five).|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Alabama 27-yard line.
