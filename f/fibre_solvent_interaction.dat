40|$|Theoretical {{studies on}} glycyl-alanyl and seryl dipeptides were {{performed}} to determine the probable backbone and side-group conformations that are preferred for <b>solvent</b> <b>interaction.</b> By following the method of Lee & Richards [(1971) J. Mol. Biol. 55, 379 - 400], a solute molecule is represented {{by a set of}} interlocking spheres of appropriate van der Waals radii assigned to each atom, and a solvent (water) molecule is rolled along the envelope of the van der Waals surface, and the surface accessible to the solvent molecule, and hence the solvent accessibility for a particular conformation of the solute molecule, is computed. From the calculated solvent accessibilities for various conformations, solvation maps for dipeptides were constructed. These solvation maps suggest that the backbone polar atoms could interact with solvent molecules selectively, depending on the backbone conformation. A conformation in the right-handed bridge (zetaR) region is favoured for both <b>solvent</b> <b>interaction</b> and intrachain hydrogen-bonding. Also the backbone side-chain hydrogen-bonding within the same dipeptide fragment in proteins is less favoured than hydrogen-bonding between side chain and water and between side chain and atoms of other residues.

40|$|We present recent {{developments}} in the symmetry implementation of the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM). The structure of the matrix, which defines the PCM solvent response, is examined, and we demonstrate how this matrix can be transformed to a block diagonal form where each block belongs to different irreducible representations of the molecular point group. This development is especially important at the Multi-configurational Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF) level where symmetry is needed to avoid problems with symmetry breaking in the wave function and facilitate the optimization of electronic excited states. Moreover, although only the totally symmetric part of the <b>solvent</b> <b>interaction</b> is needed for energy calculations, in response or perturbation theory calculations of molecular properties, other irreps {{play an important role}} and the classification of <b>solvent</b> <b>interaction</b> terms by irrep is, therefore, desirable.

5000|$|The {{interacting}} molecular {{structures that}} break {{the structure of}} solvent exchange the heat or the oscillations or the electron clouds on weakening cohesive force (CF) of solvent. However the solvent structure opposes the interaction of solute molecules to maintain its own structures. Thus the friction and triction both are developed. The triction depicts a thermodynamic restriction to break down or disrupt the solvent structure by solute interaction. Contrary to the triction the friction depicts a molecular force restriction. The thermodynamic disruption of solvent structure leads to develop intermolecular forces (IMF). Friccohesity of solute <b>solvent</b> <b>interactions</b> predicts a quantitative disruption of CF and formation of IMF in the same proportion. Thus the friccohesity is kinetic concept materialized through friction and triction both. Thus in solubilization or dispersion sciences the friccohesity predicts a level of solute and <b>solvent</b> <b>interaction</b> through molecular interaction engineering. Friccohesity becomes a most mobile theory to accommodate the geometrical spaces to support the electronic contact between the similar molecules with definite CF and dissimilar molecules or distributing force factor or friction to overcome opposing resistance. The friccohesity becomes a modern model to simulate not only the molecular contact but also successful exchange of the interacting activities in terms of activation energy, entropy, and Gibbs energy defined by triction.|$|R

Many of these features arise through the <b>solvent</b> <b>interaction</b> with C 60. It is the nature of this interaction and its effect on the vibronic coupling of C 60 that demand further investigation. Better knowledge into the vibronic coupling of C 60 is required to understand more fully many of its promising applications, such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism, and even novel applications such as photovoltaic paint. Although an extensive account of the RR scattering mechanisms in C 60, including Raman excitation profiles and <b>solvent</b> <b>interactions,</b> has been well documented [1 - 3], the unusual intensity behaviour of the 281 -cm− 1 band requires that this behaviour be revisited [4]. For the first time, the intensity behaviour of the C 60 RR band at 281 cm− 1 in three solvents is investigated in relation to the stronger 265 -cm− 1 RR band. In what is believed to be previously unreported RR scattering behaviour, the 281 -cm− 1 band receives intensity only under highly unusual resonance conditions, especially in relation to the Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering, whereas the 265 -cm− 1 band intensity exhibits more usual RR intensity behaviour (see Fig. 1).

A picture emerges of globular proteins as extremely well-fitting jigsaw-puzzles, in which no single driving force dominates the marginal stability of the native conformation. Rather, the folded structure {{is seen as the}} result of a complex global maximization of several strongly-interacting driving forces. In particular, the necessity to maintain very efficient internal hydrogen-bonding, and the role of the solvent as a hydrogen-bond sink, are stressed as strong constraints on the (incomplete) maximization of hydrophobic effects. The possible significance of internal dipole-induced dipole interactions is discussed tentatively. Although quantitative estimates of the various contributions remain uncertain, consideration of effective force constants suggests that polar, including <b>solvent,</b> <b>interactions</b> may largely determine the overall curvatures of the native conformation's potential well, and be important in controlling the flexibility of local regions which are important for the exact positioning of groups during enzyme catalysis, as well as the molecule's overall dynamics.

An inverse correlation {{exists between the}} oxygen quenching efficiency of triplet state zinc tetraphenylporphine and the efficiency of singlet oxygen formation, against solvent polarity, {{in agreement with the}} accepted involvement of a charge transfer complex during the quenching process. No structural volume change was observed for the triplet state formation of zinc tetraphenylporphine using the nitrile variation method, whereas electron transfer between zinc tetraphenylporphine and 1, 4 -benzoquinone resulted in a volume contraction in the four nitrile solvents used. Specific solute <b>solvent</b> <b>interaction,</b> in addition to electrostriction, is needed to fully understand the relatively large and solvent dependent structural volume change observed in the longer chain nitriles.

The free energy of the electron transfer was, however, very similar within the solvent series.
