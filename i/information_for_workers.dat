To this end, the inspection tasks are grouped so that for each group one single inspection device is assigned. This requires a change between {{the views of the}} single-part drawing within each inspection device, which increases worker’s cognitive load.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} {{can only be}} {{prevented}} by eliminating or lowering noise exposure levels. When {{the source of the}} noise cannot be eliminated, workers have to rely on hearing protection equipment. The aim here was to summarize the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to enhance the wearing of hearing protection among workers exposed to noise in the workplace. DATA SOURCE: Studies with random assignment were identified by an electronic search of the medical literature up to 2005. Data were double-entered into the Review Manager software, version 4. 2. 5. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two studies were found. A computer-based intervention tailored to individual workers’ risks and lasting 30 minutes was not found to be more effective than a video providing general <b>information</b> <b>for</b> <b>workers.</b> A second randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of a four-year school-based hearing loss prevention program among schoolchildren working on their parents’ farms. The intervention group was twice as likely to wear some kind of hearing protection as was the control group (which received only minimal intervention). REVIEWERS’ CONCLUSIONS: The limited evidence does not show whether tailored interventions are more or less effective than general interventions among workers, 80 % of whom already use hearing protection. Long-lasting school-based interventions may increase the use of hearing protection substantially. Better interventions to enhance the use of hearing protection need to be developed and evaluated in order to increase the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss among workers...|$|E

The intravenous application of psychoactive substances is associated with many health risks. Transmission and spreading of infection is associated mainly with frequent sharing and use of needles, syringes and other instruments among the users. In recent years the spreading of hepatitides (particularly VHC) has been reported as one of serious consequences of addiction to psychoactive substances, particularly in case of intravenous application. Protection against the spreading of diseases consist mainly in the prevention. The objective of the thesis is to verify whether the people addicted to psychoactive substances are aware of risks of transmission and spreading of infectious diseases (particularly VHC) {{as a result of}} intravenous application. The research was conducted on a group of drug addicts intercepted in the network of contact center and on a group of drug addicts in a therapeutic program of a psychiatric facility.

40|$|Introduction: This guide aims {{to support}} workers and {{agencies}} working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander {{young people who}} use alcohol and other drugs. It is the fourth {{in a series of}} ‘Good Practice Guides’ developed by Dovetail in its role of providing professional support, resources and tools for youth and AOD workers in Queensland. Development of this guide acknowledges the particular knowledge, skills and approaches needed to successfully work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, their families and communities impacted by youth AOD use. The guide covers essential information for culturally secure practice with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, their families and their communities. It builds on the information contained in the three previous ‘Good Practice Guides’ published by Dovetail: Guide 01 A framework for youth alcohol and other drug practice; Guide 02 Legal and ethical dimensions of practice; Guide 03 Practice strategies and interventions. Focus and content of the guide This guide is focused on supporting good practice by workers and services who work to minimise the harm from alcohol and other drug use experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people and their communities. Of course, not all AOD use by young people is problematic. ‘Problematic AOD use’ refers to when the young person or those close to them consider that their AOD use is having a negative effect on their physical or emotional health and wellbeing or is impacting their relationships, or is making it more difficult for them to live life as they want to. The guide provides <b>information</b> <b>for</b> <b>workers</b> in community and government services across a range of sectors as well as workers specifically employed to work with young people around AOD issues. The guide focuses on the importance of understanding history and the context of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the need to build individual and organisational cultural awareness. The guide contains information to enhance workers’ understanding and approaches to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, as well as practical tools and case stories as examples of practice approaches. It is acknowledged that information in the guide is broad and is not able {{to take into account the}} unique elements and histories of each Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community. It aims to complement the knowledge already held by many individuals and services while reminding workers new to a community of the need to gather cultural information about the specific community in which they work. The guide encourages reflection and learning, and highlights the need to use opportunities for a positive impact on the lives of young people and their families and to maintain a sense of hope...|$|E
40|$|How Readable Are Summary Plan Descriptions For Health Care Plans? • SPDs are {{the primary}} source of health plan information: The summary plan {{description}} (SPD) is {{the primary source of}} <b>information</b> <b>for</b> <b>workers</b> who participate in an employment-based health care plan. This study investigates whether private-sector employers’ SPDs are written so that an average plan participant can identify and read important information contained in the document, as required by federal law. The study collected and tested SPDs for 40 health care plans from a diverse national sample and subjected them to content and readability analyses. • Important information contained in many SPDs is written at a reading level that may be too high for the average plan participant: The study found that the average readability level for important information concerning eligibility, benefits, and participant rights and responsibilities in summary plan descriptions is written at a first year college reading level. The average level of readability for SPDs is higher than the recommended reading level for technical material. Some of the SPDs in the study sample use language written at a 9 th grade reading level. Other SPDs use language written at nearly a college graduate (16 th grade) reading level. • Readability levels do not differ between single-employer health care plans and multi-employer health care plans: The study found no statistically significant differences in readability levels between SPDs for health care plans sponsored by single- and multi-employer health care plans for union workers. The language used for both types of plans tested out at a college reading level. • Fundamental literacy a barrier to health care literacy: According to the U. S. Department of Education, about 43 percent of American adults scored at below basic or basic levels of prose literacy (able to read and understand sentences and paragraphs), and 34 percent scored at below basic or basic levels of document literacy (able to read sentence fragments, such as a medical prescription). Given the rapidly rising share of the immigrant, non-English-speaking U. S. population, a major barrier to health care literacy is the underlying issue of fundamental literacy. • Implications: Findings from this study suggest that fundamental improvements are needed in the readability of written SPDs, and that employers and plan administrators should explore the use of alternative methods of communication to plan participants beyond the written SPD. Also, the trend toward consumer-driven health care plans may make the challenge of communicating information to participants through written SPDs even more difficult, since these plans shift significant responsibility to the participants in the plan for decisions concerning the utilization of health care services. This shift in decision-making responsibility to participants makes it more important than ever that participants understand how their health plan works...|$|E
40|$|These {{factors include}} also eating in school canteens. By this we {{understand}} nutrition services for children, pupils, students {{and other people}} whom this food is offered within material sustaining, full direct social security or within preventive care by whole day services or boarding services. In the interest of following nutrition doses, there {{has been set up}} so called consumer basket of foodstuffs. The theoretical part focuses on explaining of the term of school nourishment and form. The main aim of my diploma work was to appraise variety of school lunches in chosen school canteens according to months menus from the nutritious point of view. Partial targets were focused on assessing the quality of lunches according to the consumer baskets of foodstuffs and appraising the method of school canteens of drawing up their menus. In the practical part there has been presented own research and its results. The research for this diploma work started in November 2012 and finished in February 2013. Practical part of this research was worked out on the base of quality research. The choice of searched subjects happened with the aid of pure intentional research. The data file was constituted by menus from December 2012, January 2013 and February 2013 and by the consumer baskets of foodstuff for the same season. The analyses of variety of foodstuffs and was supplemented by half-structured interview. I prepared five researching questions before assessment of the research that were answered during the research. These questions were: ?Do the coefficients of variety of foodstuffs agree with the criteria of canteens? ? ?Do the school canteens fulfil the set up norms for recommended fulfilling of the months consumer basket of foodstuffs? ? Does the management of the school canteens follow the recommended principles of a healthy diet while preparing their menus? ?Do school canteens provide various structures of recipes, dishes and technologies? ? ?Can the offer of dishes in school canteens be improved? In the first part I firstly concentrated on appraisal of variety of soups in school canteens. The variety was appraised on a month bases for each canteen. Next I focused on appraisal of variety of main dishes, side dishes and food supplements. The results were registered in well arranged charts. The next part of diploma work focuses on appraisal of consumer foodstuffs baskets. The last part contains interview with the management of school canteens. I have also managed to get answers to asked research questions so I could set down hypothesis. According to the answers I set three hypotheses. The first one is: ?The chosen school canteens from South district provide their diners with various foods and follow the principles of a healthy diet. ? I came up to this hypothesis while looking for answers to researching questions focused on variety and composition menus. The answers to the research questions helped me in formulation the second and third hypothesis: ?School canteens fulfil set up norms for recommended month consumer foodstuffs basket for commodity meat, milk, dairy products, free fat, free sugar, vegetables and potatoes. Third hypothesis was formulated as follows: ?School canteens don´t fulfil set up norms for recommended month consumer foodstuffs basket for commodity fruit and legume. The management of these canteens get further education in the area according to the interviews. I think that this diploma work can be used as an information material for educating workers in the area of nourishment. The results can be useful as a source of <b>information</b> <b>for</b> <b>workers</b> in school canteens...|$|E
