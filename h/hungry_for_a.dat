500|$|A two-part episode, aired to {{coincide}} with the Canadian National Eating Disorder Awareness Week, earned mixed reviews. Laura Betker of the Winnipeg Sun said [...] "Thankfully, the show moves far away from the health-class ideal that anorexia and bulimia simply stem from self-conscious teens. Rather, it displays it as the ugly disease that it truly is... All aspects of the story were done well. The plot was realistic. The display of the disease was truthful and progressive, while the acting was at an all time high... Miriam McDonald's performance was phenomenal. [...] performs with strength and credibility." [...] Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun criticized the episodes' [...] "ham-fisted handling of anorexia" [...] and wrote: [...] "It’s just that, well, the Degrassi foray, while well-intentioned, leaves you <b>hungry</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fresh insight, some relevant information, a compelling storyline, good writing, believable dialogue, anything." [...] Harris even went as far as saying, [...] "That Degrassi episode was so bad it made me want to throw up." ...|$|E
500|$|The album secured for Dylan an [...] "unstoppable cult following" [...] of {{fans who}} {{preferred}} {{the harshness of}} his performances to the softer cover versions released by other singers. Richard Williams {{has suggested that the}} richness of the imagery in Freewheelin transformed Dylan into a key performer for a burgeoning college audience <b>hungry</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new cultural complexity: [...] "For students whose exam courses included Eliot and Yeats, here was something that flattered their expanding intellect while appealing to the teenage rebel in their early-sixties souls. James Dean had walked around reading James Joyce; here were both in a single package, the words and the attitude set to music." [...] Andy Gill adds that in the few months between the release of Freewheelin in May 1963, and Dylan's next album The Times They Are A-Changin' in January 1964, Dylan became the hottest property in American music, stretching the boundaries of what had been previously viewed as a collegiate folk music audience.|$|E

2500|$|Helping {{the white}} press to {{overcome}} its reluctance to feature a black contender {{was the fact}} that in the mid-1930s boxing desperately needed a marketable hero. Since the retirement of Jack Dempsey in 1929, the sport had devolved into a sordid mixture of poor athletes, gambling, fixed fights, thrown matches, and control of the sport by organized crime. New York Times Columnist Edward Van Ness wrote, [...] "Louis...is a boon to boxing. Just as Dempsey led the sport out of the doldrums...so is Louis leading the boxing game out of a slump." [...] Likewise, biographer Bill Libby asserted that [...] "The sports world was <b>hungry</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> great champion when Louis arrived in New York in 1935." ...|$|E

500|$|Mike Marqusee situates {{the song}} in New York City, [...] "a flickering, electric, ghostly, cityscape". Dylan {{describes}} himself stranded in a fog of detachment which provides a haven, {{and at the same}} time is pained by a piercing clarity: an unmediated response that is [...] "too concise and too clear". For Marqusee, Dylan describes his predicament, suspended between freedom and slavery, yet <b>hungry</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> authentic experience. Johanna and Louise are objects of desire and yearning. [...] "It is their elusiveness and unreality that's the point." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{reason that}} this {{category}} is growing so rapidly is because busy people are typically busy {{at home and}} with the introduction and acceptance of digital video recorders (DVRs), it has diluted {{the frequency with which}} traditional television commercials are viewed. Every day more TV viewers are skipping past commercials with their DVRs, making out-of-home advertising all the more appealing. A Nielsen media research study in 2009 showed that 91 percent of DVR owners skipped commercials. As a result, traditional TV advertisers are <b>hungry</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> effective substitute, and digital out-of-home ads appear {{to be one of the}} solutions.
