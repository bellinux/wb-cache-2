5|$|Males {{initiate}} copulation by mounting {{the female}} and tilting her hear back 90 degrees. The male then secures his position by biting and pulling {{back on the}} hairs {{at the base of}} the female’s skull. The male then uses <b>his</b> <b>thumbs</b> to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals have been noted to be very quiet during the copulation process. Once the process is over the male dismounts the female and flies away to find another mate.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Carllile {{was born}} April 2, 1931 in St. Louis, Missouri {{and grew up}} on his impoverished father's tenant farm in Harrisburg, Illinois. At age eight he began playing a Dobro {{resonator}} guitar won by his sister Evelyn, and after she hid the steel bar, Carllile began using <b>his</b> <b>thumbs.</b> When his father gave him a Silvertone guitar, his small thumb and fingers were too short to make it around the neck, so he played it on his lap like the Dobro.|$|E
25|$|The Rock brothers, {{who already}} {{controlled}} an {{operation in the}} Bronx, refused to buy from Noe and Schultz. However, the Rock brothers underestimated the newcomers. Eventually, the elder brother, John Rock, agreed to cooperate, but younger brother Joe refused. One night the Noe-Schultz gang kidnapped him. They beat him and hung him by <b>his</b> <b>thumbs</b> from a meat hook and then allegedly wrapped a gauze bandage smeared with discharge from a gonorrhea infection over his eyes. His family reportedly paid $35,000 and he was released. Shortly after his return, he went blind. From then on, the Noe-Schultz gang met little opposition as they expanded to control the beer supply for the entire Bronx.|$|E

25|$|Entwistle's playing {{technique}} incorporated fingerstyle, plectrum, tapping, {{and the use}} of harmonics. He {{changed his}} style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> position from pick-up to the E string and occasionally even positioning <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> near the pick-up. His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> and forefinger, {{with the rest of his}} fingers outstretched for balance.|$|R

25|$|Adebolajo {{also gave}} a {{bystander}} {{at the scene}} a handwritten two-page note which set out his justification for his actions. The assailants remained at the scene and asked bystanders to call the police. The Metropolitan Police received the first 999 call about an assault at 14:20 and unarmed police were deployed. Subsequent 999 calls said the attackers had a firearm, and armed police were ordered to the scene at 14:24. Unarmed police arrived at 14:29, set up a cordon, and remained behind it. Authorised Firearms Officers arrived at 14:34. The two men, one brandishing a cleaver {{and the other a}} revolver, charged at the police. Armed police fired eight times and both men were wounded. They were arrested and taken to separate hospitals. A revolver, knives, and a cleaver were seized at the scene. The victim, Rigby, was pronounced dead and formally identified. The revolver was later determined to be a non-functioning 90-year-old Dutch KNIL 9.4mm. Adebowale pointed the gun at responding armed police officers, who opened fire and shot off one of <b>his</b> <b>thumbs.</b>|$|E

500|$|When frogs mate, {{the male}} climbs {{on the back}} of the female and wraps his fore limbs round her body, either behind the front legs or just in front of the hind legs. This {{position}} is called amplexus and may be held for several days. The male frog has certain hormone-dependent secondary sexual characteristics. These include [...] the development of special pads on <b>his</b> <b>thumbs</b> in the breeding season, to give him a firm hold. The grip of the male frog during amplexus stimulates the female to release eggs, usually wrapped in jelly, as spawn. In many species the male is smaller and slimmer than the female. Males have vocal cords and make a range of croaks, particularly in the breeding season, and in some species they also have vocal sacs to amplify the sound.|$|E

This works, and Justin finds <b>his</b> <b>thumb</b> distasteful, but falls deeper into frustration without the crutch. After Justin conspires with his brother to disrupt Dr. Lyman in a bicycle race with Justin's father, his school counselor prods the Cobbs to give him Ritalin. While his parents wring their hands over the idea, Justin insists that he needs the help.|$|R
500|$|On July 7, he was {{selected}} to his seventh consecutive All-Star Game, played at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. [...] In the Reds' clubhouse for the All-Star Game, Molina shared a locker with Reds' second baseman Brandon Phillips. [...] Since the brawl between the Cardinals and Reds in 2010, [...] the two mended their schism, and Molina has a photograph of their families together. [...] When informed whose locker he was using, Molina replied, [...] "This is Phillips' locker? [...] How about that? [...] I'll have to write something to him." [...] While the pregame roster introductions were made, Reds fans booed all six Cardinals players who were selected, and even former Cardinal Albert Pujols. [...] When Molina was introduced, he smiled and turned and pointed <b>his</b> <b>thumbs</b> {{toward the back of}} his jersey. [...] Pujols provided levity when he then joined in the booing. [...] After the game, Molina remarked to reporters, [...] "when you spend 12 years coming to Cincinnati and you beat them so many times, they’re going to boo you." [...] In his career to that point, he hit [...]319 with a [...]352 on-base percentage and [...]500 slugging percentage in 270 career at-bats at Great American Ball Park.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{was unable}} to work in {{television}} {{until the end of}} his 1951 MGM movie contract; a renegotiation to extend the pact provided permission after that point. He signed a contract for television on NBC with Procter and Gamble as his sponsor on May 4, 1951, and said he would be performing the same characters on television as he had been doing on radio. The MGM agreement with Skelton for television performances did not allow him to go on the air before September 30, 1951. His television debut, The Red Skelton Show, premiered on that date: {{at the end of his}} opening monologue, two men backstage grabbed his ankles from behind the set curtain, hauling him offstage face down. [...] A 1943 instrumental hit by David Rose, called [...] "Holiday for Strings", became Skelton's TV theme song. [...] The move to television allowed him to create two non-human characters, seagulls Gertrude and Heathcliffe, which he performed while the pair were flying by tucking <b>his</b> <b>thumbs</b> under his arms to represent wings and shaping his hat to look like a bird's bill. He patterned his meek, henpecked television character of George Appleby after his radio character, J. Newton Numbskull, who had similar characteristics. His [...] "Freddie the Freeloader" [...] clown was introduced on the program in 1952, with Skelton copying his father's makeup for the character. [...] He learned how to duplicate his father's makeup and perform his routines through his mother's recollections. [...] A ritual became established at the end of every program, with Skelton's shy boyish wave and words of, [...] "Good night and may God bless." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{symbolic}} {{that the man}} who designed replicant eyes shows the replicants the way to Tyrell. Eyes are widely regarded as [...] "windows to the soul", eye contact being a facet of body language that unconsciously demonstrates intent and emotion and this is used to great effect in Blade Runner. The Voight-Kampff test that determines if you are human measures the emotions, specifically empathy through various biological responses such as fluctuation of the pupil and involuntary dilation of the iris. Tyrell's trifocal glasses are a reflection of his reliance on technology for his power and his myopic vision. Roy eye gouges Tyrell with <b>his</b> <b>thumbs</b> while killing him, a deeply intimate and brutal death that indicates judgement of Tyrell's soul.|$|E

[...] Dragged out for interrogations with his stumps dangling, he would return with his face bloodied from beatings. Another had frostbite on one finger and a military surgeon amputated all his fingers, leaving only <b>his</b> <b>thumbs.</b> A third complained of a toothache and the dentist pulled his healthy teeth. Wounds and fractured limbs, including fingers broken during interrogations, were left untreated.
