25|$|Oblate {{spheroid}} waveguide (OSWG) horn designs improve <b>directivity</b> pattern control, {{provide a}} lower frequency of <b>directivity</b> (the lower {{the better to}} match woofers and mid-woofers' <b>directivity),</b> and--as claimed by the inventor -- Dr.Earl Geddes they mitigate higher order modes (HOM), a form of linear phase/amplitude-distortion. A major contribution to said comb-filter effects, namely the practically limited hornlength is explicitly not addressed by the theory of OSWG. Realized specimen attempt constant <b>directivity</b> and a smooth transition between the compression driver and the horn. OSWG designs are applied to the higher frequency range, above about 1kHz.|$|E
25|$|Far field methods achieve longer ranges, often {{multiple}} kilometer ranges, {{where the}} distance {{is much greater}} than the diameter of the device(s). The main reason for longer ranges with radio wave and optical devices is the fact that electromagnetic radiation in the far-field can be made to match the shape of the receiving area (using high <b>directivity</b> antennas or well-collimated laser beams). The maximum <b>directivity</b> for antennas is physically limited by diffraction.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} inlet shape on forward {{radiated}} fan tone noise <b>directivities</b> was investigated under experimentally simplified zero flow conditions. Simulated fan tone noise was radiated {{to the far}} field through various shaped zero flow inlets. Baseline data were collected for the simplest baffled and unbaffled straight pipe inlets. These data compared well with prediction. The more general inlet shapes tested were the conical, circular, and exponential surfaces of revolution and an asymmetric inlet achieved by cutting a straight pipe inlet at an acute angle. Approximate theories were developed for these general shapes and some comparisons with data are presented. The conical and exponential shapes produced <b>directivities</b> that differed considerably from the baseline data while the circular shape produced <b>directivities</b> similar to the baseline data. The asymmetric inlet produced asymmetric <b>directivities</b> with significant reductions over the straight pipe data for some angles...|$|R

A novel Channel Alternation and Rotation (CAR) scheme is proposed to coordinate channel assignments with antenna <b>directivities.</b> CAR employs a multi-interval cell-reuse layout. Each cell type is allocated extra channel set(s) to provide network designers the flexibility to assign channels avoiding nearest front lobe interference to enhance the carrier to interference ratio (C/I). CAR allows deployment of smaller and non-integer reuse factors based on C/I requirements, thus increasing channel capacity.

25|$|Most popular {{constant}} <b>directivity</b> horns (also {{known as}} CD horns) suffer from non-spherical wavefronts, limitations in arrayability, distortion at high sound pressure levels {{as well as}} reflections and distortions related to the transition from diffraction slot to secondary horn.

25|$|A planar source radiates sound uniformly for low frequencies' {{wavelengths}} {{longer than}} {{the dimensions of the}} planar source, and as frequency increases, the sound from such a source focuses into an increasingly narrower angle. The smaller the driver, the higher the frequency where this narrowing of <b>directivity</b> occurs. Even if the diaphragm is not perfectly circular, this effect occurs such that larger sources are more directive. Several loudspeaker designs approximate this behavior. Most are electrostatic or planar magnetic designs.|$|E
25|$|This large {{reflector}} can {{be avoided}} in the end-fire array. In this case the dipoles are again side by side, but are fed in different phases. Rather than being directive perpendicular to the line connecting their feedpoints, now the <b>directivity</b> is along the line connecting their feedpoints. By using an appropriate spacing and phasing, the radiation can be directed in a single direction along that line, with radiation mainly cancelled in the reverse direction {{as well as most}} other directions.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{platform}} for real-time transmission of immersive audiovisual impressions using model- and data- based audio wave-field analysis/synthesis and panoramic video capturing/projection. The audio subsystem considered in this paper is based on microphone arrays with different element counts and <b>directivities</b> as well as weakly directional loudspeaker arrays. We report on both linear and circular setups that feed different wave-field synthesis systems. In an attempt to extend this, we present first findings for a data-based approach derived using experimental simulations. This data-based wave-field analysis/synthesis (WFAS) approach uses a combination of cylindrical-harmonic decomposition of cardioid array signals and enforces causal plane wave synthesis by angular windowing and a directional delay term. Specifically, our contributions include (1) a high-resolution telepresence environment that is omnidirectional in both the auditory and visual modality, as well as (2) a study of data-based WFAS realistic microphone <b>directivities</b> as a contribution towards for real-time holophonic reproduction...|$|R
25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} are {{the oldest}} form of loudspeaker system. The use of horns as voice-amplifying megaphones dates {{at least to}} the 17th century, and horns were used in mechanical gramophones as early as 1857. Horn loudspeakers use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the <b>directivity</b> of the loudspeaker and to transform a small diameter, high pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low pressure condition {{at the mouth of the}} horn. This improves the acousticâ€”electro/mechanical impedance match between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.|$|E
25|$|Neglecting {{electrical}} inefficiency, {{the antenna}} gain {{is equal to}} the directive gain, which is 1.5 (1.76 dBi) for a short dipole, increasing to 1.64 (2.15 dBi) for a half-wave dipole. For a 5/4 wave dipole the gain further increases to about 5.2 dBi, making this length desirable for that reason even though the antenna is then off-resonance. Longer dipoles than that have radiation patterns that are multi-lobed, with poorer gain (unless they are much longer) even along the strongest lobe. Other enhancements to the dipole (such as including a corner reflector or an array of dipoles) can be considered when more substantial <b>directivity</b> is desired. Such antenna designs, although based on the half-wave dipole, generally acquire their own names.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of typical}} {{measurements}} are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under {{one or more}} conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); <b>directivity</b> vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); harmonic and intermodulation distortion vs. sound pressure level (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw sound pressure level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified valueâ€”sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in decibels (dBspl).|$|E
40|$|Flight {{tests to}} define the far field tone source at cruise {{conditions}} were completed on the full scale SR- 7 L advanced turboprop which was installed on the left wing of a Gulfstream II aircraft. This program, designated Propfan Test Assessment (PTA), involved aeroacoustic testing of the propeller over a range of test conditions. These measurements defined source levels for input into long distance propagation models to predict en route noise. Inflight data were taken for 7 test cases. The sideline <b>directivities</b> measured by the Learjet showed expected maximum levels near 105 degrees from the propeller upstream axis. However, azimuthal <b>directivities</b> based on the maximum observed sideline tone levels showed highest levels below the aircraft. An investigation {{of the effect of}} propeller tip speed showed that the tone level of reduction associated with reductions in propeller tip speed is more significant in the horizontal plane than below the aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Due to {{discrete}} {{reuse cluster}} sizes, disjoined and uniformed channel assignment, conventional tri-sectored cellular systems {{have not taken}} full advantage of antenna <b>directivities.</b> In this paper, we present a novel Channel Alternation and Rotation (CAR) scheme to coordinate channel assignment with antenna <b>directivities.</b> In CAR, cell layout is based on two-tier cell-reuse structure and each cell is allocated one extra channel set for channel alternations and rotations. The extra channel set gives network designer the flexibility to assign channels according to nearest front lobe interference avoidant strategy to enhance co-channel interference ratio (CII). CAR allows deployment of smaller, non-integer reuse cluster sizes based on CII requirements, thus increases frequency reuse efficiency. CAR reuse plans can increase channel capacity up to 31. 25 % while still maintain comparable CII margins. CAR is simple and can be employed in any existing directional antenna system, Therefore, it truly does not impose any additional cost...|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{equipment}} with {{ultrasonic sensor}} {{has been developed}} for the granular surface pattern recognition in a hopper. The estimation algorithm was proposed which utilized {{the intensity of the}} received sound and the period in which the wave moved back and forth. The inclination angle and spatial position of the measured point on the surface were determined from the values taking into account the <b>directivities</b> of the sensors, surface condition of the reflection, and attenuation of the sound through the path. The pattern was depicted by microcomputer considering the mutual relations between the locations of the measuring points and the constraint due to the physical properties of the materials treated. The method was applied to the instrument whose resonance frequency and half width were 66 kHz and 5 degrees, respectively. The fundamental characteristics of the measuring unit such as frequency dependence, <b>directivities,</b> attenuation, and measurement error have been studied experimentally.

25|$|Full-range drivers often employ an {{additional}} cone called a whizzer: a small, light cone {{attached to the}} joint between the voice coil and the primary cone. The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high frequency <b>directivity,</b> which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the outer diameter cone material failing {{to keep up with}} the central voice coil at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the outer diameter than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent single larger diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|A {{parabolic}} antenna is an antenna {{that uses a}} parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a {{parabolic antenna}} {{is that it has}} high <b>directivity.</b> It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the parabolic reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.|$|E
25|$|The inner {{elements}} of a microphone are {{the primary source of}} differences in <b>directivity.</b> A pressure microphone uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.|$|E

25|$|One simple {{combination}} is two simple sources {{separated by a}} distance and vibrating out of phase, one miniature sphere expanding while the other is contracting. The pair {{is known as a}} doublet, or dipole, and the radiation of this {{combination is}} similar to that of a very small dynamic loudspeaker operating without a baffle. The <b>directivity</b> of a dipole is a figure 8 shape with maximum output along a vector that connects the two sources and minimums to the sides when the observing point is equidistant from the two sources, where the sum of the positive and negative waves cancel each other. While most drivers are dipoles, depending on the enclosure to which they are attached, they may radiate as monopoles, dipoles (or bipoles). If mounted on a finite baffle, and these out of phase waves are allowed to interact, dipole peaks and nulls in the frequency response result. When the rear radiation is absorbed or trapped in a box, the diaphragm becomes a monopole radiator. Bipolar speakers, made by mounting in-phase monopoles (both moving out of or into the box in unison) on opposite sides of a box, are a method of approaching omnidirectional radiation patterns.|$|E

Even if <b>directivities</b> from raw experimental data exhibit significant variations of noise level in the azimuthal direction proving that correlation effect between modes seems to be not negligible for tonal noise, the hypothesis of incoherent modes inducing axisymmetric <b>directivities</b> allow to compare reasonably well with measured data averaged azimuthally. Comparisons between theoretical and numerical predictions confirm the practical interest of using simplified analytical methods even if clear improvement are provided by more complex and time consuming methods like CAA.
