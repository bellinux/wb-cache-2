50|$|A cotton mill {{was built}} by the stream at White Coppice. At first it was powered by a {{waterwheel}} but later the mill lodge was built to provide water for the steam engine. Around 1900 the mill was owned by Alfred Ephraim Eccles {{a supporter of the}} Temperance movement. Another small mill was built {{on the bank of the}} River Yarrow at the end of Bradley Wood of which no trace remains. Roger Lester lived in Anglezarke in 1769. The mill gave its name to the Lester Mill Quarry, a major contributor to the economy in the 19th century producing gritstone flags, stone setts and <b>kerbs</b> <b>for</b> paving the streets of the industrialised towns. Between 1880 and 1920, quarry men, sett-makers and two blacksmiths were employed. Dressed stone was carted to Adlington station for transport.The quarry is no longer operational. Millstones were produced at Black Coppice, where some remain.|$|R

5000|$|Roman aqueducts {{required}} a comprehensive system of regular maintenance. The [...] "clear corridors" [...] created {{to protect the}} fabric of underground and overground conduits were regularly patrolled for unlawful ploughing, planting, roadways and buildings. Frontinus describes the penetration of conduits by tree-roots as particularly damaging. Quite apart from this, the aqueducts themselves would have been regularly inspected and maintained by working patrols, to reduce algal fouling, repair accidental breaches, to clear the conduits of gravel and other loose debris, and to remove channel-narrowing accretions of calcium carbonate in systems fed by hard water sources. Inspection and access points were provided at regular intervals on the standard, buried conduits. Accretions within syphons could drastically reduce flow rates, due to the already narrow diameter of their pipes. Some had sealed openings {{that might have been}} used as rodding eyes, possibly using a pull-through device. In Rome, where a hard-water supply was the norm, mains pipework was shallowly buried beneath road <b>kerbs,</b> <b>for</b> ease of access; the accumulation of calcium carbonate in these pipes would have necessitated their frequent replacement.|$|R
