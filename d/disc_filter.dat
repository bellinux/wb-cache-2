50|$|The most {{important}} operating parameters of <b>disc</b> <b>filters</b> are {{the height of}} the slurry tank, agitation and the intensity and rotation speed of the disc as these will determine the cake formation and drying times.

In 2010 the WWTP was extended with post-denitrification and a discfilter plant for tertiary filtration of the effluent {{in order to meet}} the new discharge limits of 10 mg total nitrogen and 0. 3 mg/l of total phosphorus. The <b>disc</b> <b>filters</b> receive effluent from both the moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and the secondary settlers. The <b>disc</b> <b>filters</b> are equipped with filter cloths with 15 ?m pore openings. The concentration of suspended solids was generally kept below 5 mg/l and total phosphorus was < 0. 2 mg/l for approximately 60 % of the days during the experimental period, with generally lower concentration of particles in the effluent from the <b>disc</b> <b>filters</b> during the summer. The mass load of suspended solids from the MBBR was higher compared to the load from the secondary settlers but this did not influence the concentration of suspended solids in the effluent from the <b>disc</b> <b>filters.</b> The particles in the MBBR effluent are larger and easier to filter compared to the secondary settler effluent which contain a larger number of small particles. During passage through the <b>disc</b> <b>filters,</b> some particles break-up leaving a larger number of particles (1 – 5 ?m) in the effluent. Due to their small mass, this does not affect the effluent suspended solids concentration significantly. The removal of indicator and pathogenic microorganisms was only marginal. Since the discfilter plant has been placed in operation, the operational strategies have improved (e. g. more frequent cleaning of the filter cloths) which has increased the treatment capacity. The study demonstrates successful operation of a large discfilter plant with large variation in flow and particle loading...|$|R
50|$|A vacuum {{ceramic filter}} is {{designed}} to separate liquids from solids for dewatering purposes. The device consists of a rotator, slurry tank, ceramic filter plate, distributor, discharge scraper, cleaning device, frame, agitating device, pipe system, vacuum system, automatic acid dosing system, automatic lubricating system, valve and discharge chute. The operation and construction principle of vacuum ceramic filter resemble those of a conventional <b>disc</b> <b>filter,</b> but the filter medium {{is replaced by a}} finely porous ceramic disc. The disc material is inert, has a long operational life and is resistant to almost all chemicals. Performance can be optimized by taking into account all those factors which affect the overall efficiency of the separation process. Some of the variables affecting the performance of a vacuum ceramic filter include the solid concentration, speed rotation of the disc, slurry level in the feed basin, temperature of the feed slurry, and the pressure during dewatering stages and filter cake formation.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>disc</b> <b>filter</b> {{is a type}} {{of water}} filter used {{primarily}} in irrigation, similar to a screen filter, except that the filter cartridge is made of a number of plastic discs stacked {{on top of each other}} like a pile of poker chips. Each disc is covered with small grooves or bumps. The discs (or rings) each have a hole in the middle, forming a hollow cylinder in the middle of the stack. The water passes through the small passages in between and the impurities are trapped behind. The filtration quality is based on the quantity and size of particles that the filtering element is able to retain. Higher quality filtration simply means cleaner water. This depends on the geometry of the channels, including the size, length, angle, and number of generated intersection points. [...] The discs are typically color coded to denote the level of filtration. [...] Filtration quality is usually measured in microns, based on the smallest size particle filtered. The typical range is from 25 microns for the finest level of filtration to 400 microns for the coarsest. [...] Sometimes the filtration quality is given as the equivalent mesh size of a comparable screen filter. Typical mesh sizes range from 40 to 600. [...] When using mesh sizes, 40 is the coarsest and 600 is the finest or highest level of filtration.|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} water {{available}} is usually restricted, {{which leads to a}} situation where a complete understanding of the process, including water circulations and the influence of water components, is essential. The main aim of this thesis was to clarify the possibilities for the efficient use of residual peroxide by means of water circulation rearrangements. Rearranging water circulations and the reduction of water usage may cause new problems, such as metal induced peroxide decomposition that needs to be addressed. This thesis introduces theoretical methods of water circulations to combine two variables; effective utilization of residual peroxide and avoiding manganese in the alkaline peroxide bleaching stage. Results are mainly based on laboratory and mill site experiments concerning the utilization of residual peroxide. A simulation model (BALAS) was used to evaluate the manganese contents and residual peroxide doses. It was shown that with optimum recirculation of residual peroxide the brightness can be improved or chemical costs can be decreased. From the scientific perspective, it was also very important to discover that recycled peroxide was more effective pre-bleaching agent compared to fresh peroxide. This can be due to the organic acids i. e. per acetic acid in wash press filtrate that have been formed in alkaline bleaching stage. Even short retention time was adequate and the activation of residual peroxide using sodium hydroxide was not necessary. There are several possibilities for using residual peroxide in practice regarding bleaching. A typical modern mechanical pulping process line consist of defibering, screening, a <b>disc</b> <b>filter,</b> a bleach press, high consistency (HC) peroxide bleaching and a wash press. Furthermore there usually is not a particular medium consistency (MC) pre-bleaching stage that includes additional thickening equipment. The most advisable way to utilize residual peroxide in this kind of process is to recycle the wash press filtrate to the dilution of <b>disc</b> <b>filter</b> pulp (low MC pre-bleaching stage). An arrangement such as this would be beneficial in terms of the reduced convection of manganese to the alkaline bleaching stage. Manganese originates from wood material and will be removed to the water phase already {{in the early stages of}} the process. Recycling residual peroxide prior to the <b>disc</b> <b>filter</b> is not recommended because of low consistencies. Regarding water circulations, the novel point of view is that, it would be beneficial to divide water circulations into two sections and the critical location for the division is the <b>disc</b> <b>filter.</b> Both of these two sections have their own priority. Section one before the disc filter: manganese removal. Section two after the disc filter: brightening of pulp. This division can be carried out if the <b>disc</b> <b>filter</b> pulp is diluted only by wash press filtrate before the MC storage tower. The situation is even better if there is an additional press after the <b>disc</b> <b>filter,</b> which will improve the consistency of the pulp. This has a significant effect on the peroxide concentration in the MC pre-bleaching stage. In terms of manganese content, it is essential to avoid the use of <b>disc</b> <b>filter</b> filtrate in the bleach press and wash press showers. An additional cut-off press would also be beneficial for manganese removal. As a combination of higher initial brightness and lower manganese content, the typical brightness increase varies between approximately 0. 5 and 1 % ISO units after the alkaline peroxide bleaching stage. This improvement does not seem to be remarkable, but as it is generally known, the final brightness unit is the most expensive and difficult to achieve. The estimation of cost savings is not unambiguous. For example in GW/TMP mill case 0. 6 % ISO units higher final brightness gave 10 % savings in the costs of bleaching chemicals. With an hypothetical 200 000 ton annual production, this means that the mill could save in the costs of bleaching chemicals more than 400 000 euros per year. In general, it can be said that there were no differences between the behavior of different types of processes (GW, PGW, TMP and BCTMP). The enhancement of recycling gave a similar response in all cases. However, we have to remember that the utilization of residual peroxide in older mills depends a great deal on the process equipment, the {{amount of water}} available and existing pipeline connections. In summary, it can be said that processes are individual and the same solutions cannot be applied to all cases...|$|E

Some catalytic <b>filter</b> <b>discs</b> were tested in typical filtration conditions for the decomposition of the model tar compound benzene in a simulated biomass gasification gas containing representative amounts of H 2 S. H 2 S-deactivation studies showed a significant improvement in the sulfur resistance of the nickel catalyst on the <b>filter</b> <b>discs</b> {{by the addition of}} CaO to the catalyst formulation. The optimisation of the ratio between Ni and CaO and the effect of nickel content in the catalyst formulation on the catalytic performance were investigated.
