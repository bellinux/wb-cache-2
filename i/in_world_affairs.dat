5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready to}} commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested <b>in</b> <b>world</b> <b>affairs.</b> The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 20th century, New Zealand was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>world</b> <b>affairs,</b> {{fighting in the}} First and Second World Wars and suffering through the Great Depression. The depression led to {{the election of the}} First Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy. New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War and Māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work. A Māori protest movement developed, which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and of the Treaty of Waitangi. In 1975, a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985. The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi, although Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s.|$|E

25|$|Social Darwinism {{suggested}} {{that the success of}} these different ethnic groups <b>in</b> <b>world</b> <b>affairs,</b> and social classes in a society, were the result of evolutionary struggle in which the group or class more fit to succeed did so; i.e., the ability of an ethnic group to dominate other ethnic groups, or the chance to succeed or rise to the top of society was determined by genetic superiority.

25|$|India's {{relations}} with the world have evolved since the British Raj (1857–1947), when the British Empire monopolised external and defence relations. When India gained independence in 1947, few Indians had experience in making or conducting foreign policy. However, the country's oldest political party, the Indian National Congress, had established a small foreign department in 1925 to make overseas contacts and to publicise its independence struggle. From the late 1920s on, Jawaharlal Nehru, who had a long-standing interest <b>in</b> <b>world</b> <b>affairs</b> among independence leaders, formulated the Congress stance on international issues.

25|$|A mid-2012 Pew Research {{study of}} public {{opinions}} found that Clinton was viewed positively in Japan and most European countries {{in terms of}} people having confidence that she would do the right thing <b>in</b> <b>world</b> <b>affairs.</b> She received mixed marks in China, Russia, and some Central and South American countries, and low marks in Muslim countries, on this question. Overall, Clinton's attempts to improve the image of America in Muslim countries did not find any immediate success due to many factors, including the unpopularity of drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere. Perceptions of the U.S. in those countries declined during her tenure according to a Pew Research, which found that only 15 percent of Muslims had a favorable impression of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 25 percent in 2009. Specifically in Pakistan, only 12 percent of Pakistanis had a favorable impression of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 16 percent in 2009, and only 3 percent had confidence in Clinton compared to 37 percent not.|$|E
25|$|From 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy {{escalated}} {{their demands}} for territorial claims and greater influence <b>in</b> <b>world</b> <b>affairs.</b> Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935 resulting in its condemnation by the League of Nations and its widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936, Germany remilitarized the industrial Rhineland, {{a region that}} had been ordered demilitarized by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1938, Germany annexed Austria and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on Czechoslovakia by arranging the Munich Agreement that gave Germany the Sudetenland and was perceived {{at the time to}} have averted a European war. These hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of Slovakia in 1939. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain. In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means. The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands.|$|E
50|$|According to Albert Hancock, Coleridge {{tended to}} focus his life on two things.

500|$|Since its founding, {{there have}} been many calls for reform of the UN but little {{consensus}} on how to do so.

There have also been numerous calls for the UN Security Council's membership to be increased, for different ways of electing the UN's Secretary-General, and for a UN Parliamentary Assembly. Jacques Fomerand states the most enduring divide in views of the UN is [...] "the North–South split" [...] between richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations. Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice <b>in</b> <b>world</b> <b>affairs,</b> while Northern nations prefer an economically laissez-faire UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism.|$|E
