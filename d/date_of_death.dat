5|$|Halotus died {{close to}} the end of the century, his public {{reputation}} somewhat restored after his rise in stature and wealth. His <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> is not mentioned by ancient historians of the time, such as Tacitus or Suetonius, who were also some of the main recorders of the events around Claudius' death and the political trauma that followed. Whether Halotus was involved in the murder of Claudius and to what extent remains an unresolved point, as do many other aspects related to Claudius' passing.|$|E
5|$|His feast day was {{included}} in the General Roman Calendar in 1899, for celebration on 27 May rather than on his <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> 26 May, which was then the feast day of Pope Saint Gregory VII.

5|$|Hygeberht had {{resigned}} his see before Lichfield was demoted {{back to a}} bishopric. He was still named as archbishop in 799, but evidence suggests {{that he no longer}} controlled all of the suffragan bishops that he once had. Possibly, he was replaced at Lichfield; his successor Ealdwulf attended a council in 801, and was named bishop in the council's records. By the time that Æthelhard held another council at Clovesho in 803, Hygeberht was no longer even named as a bishop, and appears at that council as an abbot. Which abbey he was abbot of, and his exact <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Irish annals record Áedán's {{campaigns against}} his neighbours, in Ireland, and in {{northern}} Britain, including expeditions to the Orkney Islands, the Isle of Man, {{and the east}} coast of Scotland. As recorded by Bede, Áedán was decisively defeated by Æthelfrith of Bernicia at the Battle of Degsastan. Áedán may have been deposed, or have abdicated, following this defeat. His <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> is recorded by one source as 17 April 609.|$|E
5|$|The last {{important}} {{source for the}} history of Ludgarda are Annals of Jan Długosz, who wrote about this events almost two centuries after (around 1480). Długosz was the first chronicler who locates Poznań as the place of Ludgarda's death. Besides, he established her <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> on 14 December, who is corroborated by contemporary sources as a date of her burial. Modern historiography generally supports the complete innocence of Przemysł II in the sudden death of his wife.|$|E

5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ecgfrith only reigned for 141 days. Offa {{is known}} to have died in 796, on either 26 July or 29 July, so Ecgfrith's <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> is either 14 December or 17 December of the same year. Coenwulf succeeded Ecgfrith as king. Coenwulf's father's name was Cuthberht, who may have been the same person as an ealdorman of that name who {{witnessed}} charters during the reign of Offa. Coenwulf is also recorded as witnessing charters during Offa's reign. According to the genealogy of Mercian kings preserved in the Anglian collection Coenwulf was descended from a brother of Penda named Cenwealh, of whom there is no other record. It is possible that this refers to Cenwealh of Wessex, who was married to (and later repudiated) a sister of Penda.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the group {{dispersed}} after the events. Peter the Painter was never seen or heard from again. It was assumed he left the country, and there were several possible sightings in the years afterwards; none were confirmed. Jacob Peters returned to Russia, rose to be deputy head of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, and was executed in Joseph Stalin's 1938 purge. Trassjonsky had a mental breakdown and was confined for a time at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum. Her eventual fate and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> are unknown. Dubof, Federoff and Hoffmann disappeared from the records; Vassilleva remained in the East End for the remainder of her life and died at Brick Lane in 1963. Smoller left the country in 1911 and travelled to Paris, after which he disappeared; Milstein later emigrated to live in the United States.|$|E

5|$|On a {{fence in}} front of the wall, there were {{memorial}} crosses with the names and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> on them. However, since the government moved to Berlin, the white crosses had to be relocated in 1995 from {{the eastern side of the}} Reichstag. The new location is on the west side of the building at a fence of the Tiergarten. 2003, Wolfgang Thierse inaugurated a new memorial designed by Jan Wehberg with the same name as the one on Reichstagufer. On seven both-sided inscribed crosses are the names of the 13 deaths. Another memorial of the Civil Association was in Bernauer Straße. Other victims are remembered through commemorative plates embedded in sidewalks and other installations which are nearby their death spot. On October 2004, the Working Group 13 August built the Freedom Memorial at Checkpoint Charlie. It reminds people of the victims of the Berlin Wall and the inner German border with 1067 crosses. The memorial had to be removed after about half a year because the landowners terminated the lease with the working group.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, {{state that}} Deusdedit died on 14 July 664. The main argument was {{put forward by}} Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was Maundy Thursday in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that the best method for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14July 664 as the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12March 655. Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does not give a specific consecration date beyond March. Abels adds to Grosjean's arguments Bede's association of Deusdedit's death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that the plague of 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1May. Nothing in Bede contradicts the date of 14July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date {{to be the best}} fit for the available data. The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does not give a precise date within that year.|$|E
5|$|Peter drowned while {{crossing}} the English Channel {{on the way}} to Gaul, at a place called Ambleteuse, near Boulogne. At first he was buried hastily nearby, but Bede reports that after a light illuminated the grave every night, the locals realised Peter was a saint and exhumed him and re-interred him in Boulogne. The actual <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> is unknown, and since his feast day was celebrated on two different days, 30 December or 6 January, that information does not clear up the mystery. The date of his death is reported to have been 1 year, 7 months and 3 weeks after Augustine's, by Thomas of Elmham, a 15th-century chronicler. If this is true, this would give a year of death between 605 and 611. This information, however, is contradicted by the fact that Peter was present at the Council of Paris in 614, convened by Chlothar II. It is possible that he died during his return from the Council of Paris.|$|E
