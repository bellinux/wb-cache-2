5000|$|According to Ritchie Yorke, who {{published}} his biography, Into the Music in 1975, the album enjoyed rave reviews {{at the time}} of release. He cited one dissenting critic Charlie Gillett, who wrote in Let It Rock: [...] "The trouble with <b>Hard</b> <b>Nose</b> the Highway is that although the music is quite often interesting, it doesn't have a convincing emotional basis...Despite the lack of inspiration and of melodic focus, the record is attractive to listen to.

2500|$|Stephen Holden in his 1973 Rolling Stone review said: [...] "Hard Nose the Highway is psychologically complex, musically {{somewhat}} uneven and lyrically excellent. Its surface pleasures are {{a little}} less than those of St. Dominic's Preview and a great deal less than those of Tupelo Honey, while its lyric depths are richer and more accessible than those of either predecessor.

50|$|Hector: Fat Arse of the Law, is a <b>hard</b> <b>nosed</b> {{and soft}} bellied Detective Inspector with the Clappers Wreake Police Department.

Hector struggles to eliminate the plague of warped, perverse killers infesting the damp, sweaty corners of Clappers Wreake, crime capital of England, and the town that took the 'Great' out of Britain.|$|R

50|$|After this {{association}} with Jonathan Edwards, Labes returned to Van Morrison's band, playing piano and writing string arrangements for his seventh studio album <b>Hard</b> <b>Nose</b> the Highway, released in 1973. He is also credited {{on the album}} as assistant producer. Morrison had recently assembled an eleven-piece band for his concerts, The Caledonia Soul Orchestra, which Labes had joined to play piano and organ in early 1973, replacing the previous keyboard player James Trumbo. The band included the string section Labes had arranged for on <b>Hard</b> <b>Nose</b> the Highway, so {{he was asked to}} arrange string parts for some more of Morrison's songs for the live performances. The double live album It's Too Late to Stop Now was released the following year of highlights from three concerts in the summer of the tour. After the tour ended Morrison dismantled the band and Labes was, this time, replaced by Trumbo. Although he was not touring with Morrison, Labes was asked to play on two tracks on Morrison's next studio album, Veedon Fleece, whilst his string and woodwind arrangements were dubbed onto most of the other recordings on the album.|$|R
5000|$|Drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 1st {{round of}} the 1982 MLB amateur draft, Karkovice would make his Major League Baseball debut with the Chicago White Sox on August 17, 1986, and {{appeared}} in his final game on September 26, 1997. He was called [...] "Officer Ron Karkovice" [...] by White Sox broadcaster Ken [...] "Hawk" [...] Harrelson due to Karkovice's physical resemblance to a stereotypical patrol officer, his <b>hard</b> <b>nosed</b> demeanor, and his skill in solving clubhouse crimes.|$|R
5000|$|On October 29, 2015, Azotam inked {{with the}} Island Storm of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL).

Head coach Joe Salerno said, [...] "Ike is a tough, <b>hard</b> <b>nose,</b> physical player, who has a great mid-range game and isn't scared to mix it up a bit in the paint." [...] Salerno also believed that Azotam would have an even more successful second season in professional basketball.|$|R
5000|$|Ricky Riley of The Celebrity Cafe gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{saying that it}} was a great one. [...] "This episode was amazing {{primarily}} because we see the two most influential men from season one lose everything. Datak thought that things would return to normal after jail but it has not and people are not of his <b>hard</b> <b>nose</b> tactics anymore. Rafe has become a shell of himself. His family is gone, Christie is a Tarr now, and he has no more wealth." ...|$|R
50|$|Lofty England {{attracted}} {{some criticism}} for his decision {{after the race}} but, as he maintained {{for the rest of}} his life, England did not regard Hawthorn as being at all responsible for the tragedy and therefore the team had no reason to withdraw. The decision was typical of the unsentimental, <b>hard</b> <b>nosed</b> manner in which Lofty England ran the team, demanding complete loyalty and adherence to the team principal from his drivers. When, at Reims in early 1956, Le Mans hero Duncan Hamilton ignored England's pit signals, the team manager fired him on the spot.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{then turns}} its {{attention}} to {{the man behind the}} legacy, former Mount Saint Charles Academy rink manager turned coach, Bill Belisle. At that time Mount, a perennial contender for the state title had lost its luster, but with Belisle's tough grit and <b>hard</b> <b>nosed</b> approach their legacy began. [...] "It was said he knew how to fix the Zamboni, the soda machines, and the team." [...] Tales from former players and parents put a face on the historic streak and help explain how one man could will generation after generation to win.|$|R
5000|$|Shane Scully is a tough, <b>hard</b> <b>nosed</b> cop {{who often}} bends {{the rules in}} order to get things done. He has an {{extremely}} open mind that allows him to [...] "think outside the box" [...] when needed. Examples include Hollywood Tough, where he convinced the LAPD to finance a major motion picture in order to solve the murder of a prostitute. In Cold Hit, he convinced the LAPD to challenge the authority of the Department of Homeland Security in order to solve a series of unsolved serial murders.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title was}} {{ceremonial}} only {{to provide an}} authority figure to announce major decisions on television, as Tunney held no backstage power beyond that of a regional promoter; as such, his main roles were that of a storyline authority figure, to make matches, arbitrate disputes between wrestlers and announce major decisions or events on television. Still, he was thrown onto TV whenever a major decision had to be announced and his <b>hard</b> <b>nosed</b> {{way of doing things}} earned him the nickname [...] "The Hammerhead". His on-air decisions were portrayed as legitimate in storylines.|$|R
