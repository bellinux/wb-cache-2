5|$|However, the Imme {{began to}} develop problems, {{especially}} with the single-sided crankshaft bearings and the freewheel for the kick starter. Riedel corrected the problem beginning with the Model D version, which had a conventional crankshaft with two bearings. However, the profit from sales was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> warranty expenses, and, {{by the end of}} 1950, Riedel AG went bankrupt with debts of 1.25millionDeutschmark.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to the dealership to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. The customers then negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E
5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares {{to go to the}} laundromat, Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and it turns out to be just <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> damage to the washing machine.|$|E

But they were not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> repairs necessary, which raised safety issues for Self Help's workers and liability concerns for the organization. There was the additional complication of the ownership of the building, which still belonged to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|An {{observer}} {{situated on}} the Martian surface, {{in a position to}} observe Phobos, would see regular transits of Phobos across the Sun. Several of these transits have been photographed by the Mars Rover Opportunity. During the transits, Phobos's shadow is cast on the surface of Mars; an event which has been photographed by several spacecraft. Phobos is not large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> Sun's disk, and so cannot cause a total eclipse.|$|E
25|$|Tongan men wear a tupenu, a cloth that {{is similar}} to a sarong, which is wrapped around the waist. It should be long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> knees or the shins of the legs. In daily life, any shirt (T-shirt, jersey, woven shirt) will do to top the tupenu.

25|$|The {{ice rink}} problem {{highlighted}} {{a major issue}} confronting Four Seasons Arena. The cost of running an average four-day basketball tournament was about $16,000, and the arena lost about $3,000 per tournament. But basketball tournaments generated more than $1 million in additional spending to the city, {{far more than the}} revenues generated by ice hockey and more than <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> losses on the tournament. Permanently losing {{some or all of the}} ice at Four Seasons would greatly expand the arena's ability to host money-making events.|$|E
25|$|A corset dress (also {{known as}} hobble corset because it {{produces}} similar restrictive effects to a hobble skirt) {{is a long}} corset. It is like an ordinary corset, but it is long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> legs, partially or totally. It thus looks like a dress, hence the name. A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in {{walking up and down}} the stairs (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.|$|E
25|$|This {{provided}} a practical detection range of 100 miles, just <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> Hanoi urban {{area and the}} main MiG base at Phúc Yên. A major disadvantage of this arrangement, however, was that most MiG contacts were beyond the 70-mile range of the Big Eye's APS-45 Height Finder radar, so that {{they were unable to}} provide this crucial data to USAF strike forces. Furthermore, technical shortcomings in the EC-121D's systems precluded either controlling a fighter intercept or identifying a specific flight under attack.|$|E

25|$|Although artisanal logging {{provides}} some {{income for the}} community in the short-run, it ultimately does not improve local living conditions. In the end, the communities receive payments which are not large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> loss of their natural resources. Since there is no monitoring mechanism, the loggers report lower harvested amounts than they actually {{do in order to}} pay less tax to the local government. Some loggers cut one tree within the woods and leave the rest intact to mimic natural disturbance. To improve the situation, the DRC government needs better monitoring and better forest code to manage the logging activities.|$|E

Harry arrives and toasts George. A bell on the Christmas tree rings, and his daughter recalls a story that says the sound means that an angel has just earned his wings, signifying Clarence's promotion.|$|E
25|$|When {{the library}} opened in 1963, the mural {{had not been}} yet installed. American artist Millard Sheets was {{commissioned}} to create a work large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> entire side of the library facing Notre Dame's football stadium. Fr. Theodore Hesburgh suggested that the theme should be saints and scholars through the ages. The artwork cost $200,000 and was donated by Mr. and Mrs. Howard V. Phalin of Winnetka, Illinois. Installation {{took place in the}} spring of 1964; the dedication ceremony was held on May 7, 1964. The mural is composed of 324 panels. Its creation employed 81 different stones from 16 countries in 171 finishes that included 46 granites and syenites, 10 gabros and labradorites, 4 metamorphic gneisses, 12 serpentines, 4 crystalline marbles, and 5 limestones.|$|E

2500|$|In 1959, he {{was looking}} {{to pursue a career}} in the Grand National series. He {{purchased}} a Junior Johnson Ford for $2,000.

25|$|He was {{commissioned}} as a {{lieutenant in the}} 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars on 28 February 1874, a prestigious regiment whose officers often drank claret for breakfast, {{but there is no}} evidence that he ever served with them. He transferred to the 19th Hussars on 11 March 1874, possibly as it was cheaper—following the sale of the family home at Ripple Valley French’s private income of £1,000 per annum was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> £500–£600 required by his new regiment. He was posted to Aldershot Command, which then contained a division (three infantry brigades and one cavalry) under Sir Hope Grant. He became an expert hunter and steeplechaser, permanently damaging the little finger of his right hand in a fall.|$|E
25|$|The furnace {{was placed}} in the space between the tube banks. Early boilers were {{manually}} coal fired, later oil fired. The boiler was enclosed in a sealed casing of steel, lined with firebricks. Brick-lined end walls to this casing housed the firedoors or oil burner quarls, but had no heating surface. The uptake flue from the boiler was in the centre top of the casing, the exhaust gases passing around the steam drum. To reduce corrosion from flue gases over the drum, it was sometimes wrapped in a simple deflector shroud. Usually {{the lower part of the}} water drums were exposed outside the casing, but only the ends of the steam drum emerged. The water level was at around one-third of the steam drum diameter, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> ends of the submerged water-tubes.|$|E
25|$|The Panic of 1837 hit the {{following}} year, causing a sharp decrease in tax revenues, {{even as the}} state budget was already faced a large deficit because of the interest on the debt. Property taxes were the state's primary regular income, and to increase the revenue Noble proposed that the tax be levied ad valorem. The change would save the state a significant amount in administrative and collection costs, and make more land subject to taxation. The tax was approved {{and led to a}} 25% increase in revenue {{the following}} year, but it was still not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> deficit. Noble proposed the projects be prioritized, and work halted on the less important ones to conserve funds, but the plan was rejected. By the time Noble left office, the state's financial situation was bleak, but it was not yet fully apparent that far more had been borrowed than could be paid back. Despite the dire situation, Noble left office in 1837 as a popular political figure and was able to use his prestige to help elect David Wallace, his lieutenant governor, as governor.|$|E
