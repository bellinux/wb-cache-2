5|$|Certain quantum effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles <b>is</b> <b>observed,</b> they exist in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state <b>is</b> <b>observed,</b> the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, {{it is impossible to}} control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it <b>is</b> <b>observed,</b> so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.|$|E

5|$|Different {{areas of}} the brain exhibit {{different}} forms of LTP. The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP <b>is</b> <b>observed.</b> For example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus. The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the NMDA receptor, others may depend upon the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether. The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP <b>is</b> <b>observed.</b> For example, LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor-dependent, whereas LTP in the mossy fiber pathway is NMDA receptor-independent.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the hepatotoxic effect of DNOC in rats, using biochemical serum parameters as indicators of liver disease. Experimental groups were injected intraperitoneally with 2. 8 mg/kg DNOC.

In general, increased AST and ALP activities were recorded up to the 8 th hour. Thereof, at later periods inhibition <b>was</b> <b>observed.</b> Inhibition <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in female rats, while ALT activation <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in male rats.

For the month of April, minimum snow cover <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in the year 2004 (56, 236  km 2) and maximum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in the year 2002 (114, 588  km 2).

In case of July, the minimum and maximum temperatures <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> in 2004 (7.20  °C) and 2006 (8.85  °C), respectively.

Apart from the role of temperature, other factors should also be taken into account to explain the reason behind the difference in snow melt trend of the other 2  months from that of January. For example, if the snow is older, its albedo will be lower and in such situation it absorbs more solar radiation. Again, if the temperature variation is not significant, snow melts faster in the windy condition than in the calm conditions. However, temperature being a dominant factor, this study evaluated the impact of increase in temperature on the snow cover.|$|R
