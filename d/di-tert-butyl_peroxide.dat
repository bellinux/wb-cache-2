The effect of the solvent on the thermochemistry of this process is remarkably large with the reaction being ca. 10 kcal mol- 9 more exothermic in acetonitrile or ethyl acetate than in isooctane. The relationship between the observed enthalpy changes and the PhO-H bond energy is discussed in detail. It is shown that in order to extract the bond energy from the experimental (apparent) enthalpy change, it is necessary to account for a number of processes, viz., the volume change for the overall reaction, the solvent effect associated with the conversion of 1 mol of <b>di-tert-butyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> to 2 mol of tert-butyl alcohol, and the differences in solvation of phenol and the phenoxyl radical. The contributions from each of these processes to the observed reaction enthalpy were derived from a separate set of experiments with 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene instead of phenol or from data available in the literature. These data allow one to determine solution bond energies, Le., the enthalpy of homolysis for which the standard state is the solvated reactant and products, and to quantify the solvent effect on these values. Thus, PhO-H bond energies in isooctane (88 kcal mol- 9), benzene (89 kcal mol- 9), carbon tetrachloride (90 kcal mol- 9), ethyl acetate (95 kcal mol- 9), and acetonitrile (95 kcal mol- 9) have been obtained.

(i) Results from recent work 8 in which RMeSiCl (R = Me, Cl) radicals are generated {{in the presence of}} chlorosilanes suggested that the abstraction of chlorine from silicon- chlorine bonds is a very rapid process despite there being no substantial thermodynamic driving force. In order to obtain quantitative results, the following reaction: was studied using both thermal and photolytic means of generating trimethylsilyl radicals. Azomethane, <b>di-tert-butyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> and mercury dimethyl, in conjunction with trimethyl- silane, were used as thermal sources of trimethylsilyl radicals, but, when azomethane and <b>di-tert-butyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> were used, no hexamethyldisilane was obtained so preventing the determination of any rate constants. However, with mercury dimethyl, hexamethyldisilane was observed, but the absence of dimethylchlorosilane suggested the presence of a non-steady state concentration of trimethylsilyl radicals, which, when coupled with the relatively small temperature range used, produced large errors in the values of the Arrhenius parameters. With the mercury photosensitised generation of trimethylsilyl radicals from trimethylsilane, a steady state concentration of trimethylsilyl radicals is set up, and rate constants obtained over a larger temperature range. Combination of the rate constants from both the thermal and photolytic methods gave the following Arrhenius parameters:- log 10 and a reaction scheme which accounts for all the products and kinetic features is proposed.

The reactivity of the uridine moieties of 3 '-UMP, 5 '-UMP, and uridylyl-(3 ', 5 ') -uridine is not affected by the location of the phosphate group. However, the uridine moiety of uridylyl-(3 ', 5 ') -adenosine is modified faster than that of adenylyl-(3 ', 5 ') -uridine. It is suggested that steric hindrance imposed by the phosphate group determines the reactivity of adenosine moieties, while base stacking involving adenosine determines the reactivity of uridine moieties.

Experimental evidence suggests that O 2 −·, which was directly observed in the APPI source, {{plays a key role}} in the formation of [M − H]− ions by way of proton transfer. Introduction of anions more basic than O 2 −·, i. e., C 6 H 5 CH 2 −, into the APPI source, via addition of <b>di-tert-butyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> in the solvent and/or dopant, i. e., toluene, enhanced the deprotonation ability of negative ion-APPI. Although the use of halogenated solvents could hinder efficient EC, dissociative EC, and proton transfer of negative ion-APPI due to their EC ability, the subsequently generated halide anions promoted halide attachment to compounds that otherwise could not be efficiently ionized. With the four available ionization mechanisms, it becomes obvious that negative ion-APPI is capable of ionizing a wider range of compounds than negative ion chemical ionization (NICI), negative ion-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (negative ion-APCI) or negative ion-electrospray ionization (negative ion-ESI) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe radical {{copolymerisation}} in {{solution of}} vinylidene fluoride (or 1, 1 -difluoroethylene (VDF)) with hexafluoropropylene (HFP) initiated by <b>di-tert-butyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> is presented. A series of eight copolymerisation reactions was investigated with initial [VDF]o/[HFP]o molar ratios ranging from 5. 0 / 95. 0 to 85. 2 / 14. 8. Both co-monomers copolymerised in this range of copolymerisation. Moreover, only VDF homopolymerised in these conditions. The copolymer compositions of these random-type copolymers were calculated {{by means of}} 19 F NMR spectroscopy which allowed the respective amount of each monomeric unit in the copolymer to be quantified. The Tidwell and Mortimer method led to {{the assessment of the}} reactivity ratios, ri, of both co-monomers showing a higher incorporation of VDF in the copolymer (rHFP = 0. 12 0. 05 and rVDF = 2. 9 0. 6 at 393 K). Alfrey–Price's Q and e values of HFP were calculated to be 0. 002 (from QVDF = 0. 008) or 0. 009 (from QVDF = 0. 015) and + 1. 44 (versus eVDF = 0. 40) or + 1. 54 (versus eVDF = 0. 50), respectively, indicating that HFP is an electron-accepting monomer. The thermal properties of these fluorinated copolymers were also determined. Except for those containing a high amount of VDF, they were amorphous. Each showed one glass transition temperature (Tg) only, and from known laws of Tg, that of the homopolymer of HFP was assessed. It was compared with that obtained from the literature after extrapolation and is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Dimethylamino, diethylamino, and diisopropylamino {{radicals}} {{have been}} {{generated in the}} cavity of an epr spectrometer by photolysis of the appropriate tetraalkyltetrazenes and by photolysis of <b>di-tert-butyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{in the presence of}} the dialkylaminodiethoxyphosphines. The second-order decay of dimethylamino and diethylamino occurs at the diffusion controlled limit, (2 1 1) 7 109 M- 1 sec- 1. The decay of diisopropylamino is second order at temperatures below ambient (k 2 epr 2 ̆ 248 1. 0 X 107 M- 1 sec- 1) and first order above. For radicals generated from the tetrazene, the first-order process is rather slow and represents thermal decomposition of an intermediate which is probably the cis tetrazene. For radicals generated from the phosphine the first-order process is quite rapid and probably corresponds to a true unimolecular reaction of diisopropylamino radicals, except when the solvent is a good hydrogen donor. 2, 2, 6, 6 -Tetramethylpiperidyl radicals were generated from the tetrazene. The decay is first order in hydrocarbon solvents. The variation in the rate constants for decay with hydrocarbon structure, the rate constants in perdeuterated solvents, and product studies show that this reaction is usually a hydrogen abstraction from the solvent. The tetramethylpiperidyl radical is more reactive in abstractions than are peroxy radicals. Tetramethylpiperidyl (aN = 14. 66 G, g = 2. 0048 in isopentane at 270) reacts rapidly with oxygen and is converted to the corresponding nitroxide (aN = 15. 3 G, g = 2. 0064 at - 1000). With 17 O labeled oxygen this nitroxide has a(17 O) = 19. 35 G. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{synthesis}} of four 3, 3, 3 -trifluoroprop- 1 -ene telomers (RF(C 3 H 3 F 3) nI, n = 1, 2, RF = n-C 6 F 13 - or (CF 3) 2 CF-) and their allyl derivatives RF(C 3 H 3 F 3) nCH 2 CH=CH 2 are presented. The allyl telomers were prepared by a three-step reaction. The first step involved the thermal and peroxide-induced bulk telomerization of 3, 3, 3 -trifluoroprop- 1 -ene (TFP) with heptafluoro- 2 -iodopropane or tridecafluoro- 6 -iodohexane leading to monoadduct and diadduct, {{the ratio of}} which depends on the R 0 = [RFI] 0 /[TFP] 0 initial molar ratio and the reaction temperature. The amount of monoadduct increased up to 50 – 60 % and of the diadduct to 25 – 30 % at temperatures up to 180 °C (thermal-initiated) and 150 °C (initiated with <b>di-tert-butyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> DTBP), R 0 up to 1. 5. It was observed that {{the addition of the}} (CF 3) 2 CF• radical onto the =CH 2 of TFP was regioselective leading to selective formation of a single isomer in contrast to the addition of the n-C 6 F 13 • radical. Then, the telomers reacted with allyl acetate yielding RF(C 3 H 3 F 3) nCH 2 CH(I) CH 2 OCOCH 3 (n = 1, 2) in 50 – 80 % yields. The third step consisted of a deiododeacetatization of these iodoacetates into RF(C 3 H 3 F 3) nCH 2 –CH=CH 2 (C,n) giving 50 – 80 % yields...|$|E
