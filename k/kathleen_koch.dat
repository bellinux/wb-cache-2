5000|$|<b>Kathleen</b> Day <b>Koch</b> (December 1991 - ~1997). Prior to {{appointment}} by President George Herbert Walker Bush, Koch previously {{held the}} position of General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority from December 1988 to December 1991. In her term as General Counsel, she encouraged a heightened emphasis on conflict resolution through cooperation and dispute avoidance. She {{has been instrumental in}} creating a conflict resolution seminar program that has been utilitized by various federal agencies nationwide. Koch’s entire legal career has been in public service, where she has developed expertise in federal employee and government ethics issues. Prior to her appointment to the FLRA, she served as Associate Counsel to the President. She was asked to join the White House staff while serving as Senior Attorney in the Personnel Law Division at the Commerce Department. During the significant formative period of the Merits Systems Protection Board (1979-84), Koch participated {{in the development of the}} adjudicatory agency’s procedural and substantive precedents. Her government career began in 1977 when she was appointed an Honors Program attorney at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Koch studied at Concordia College in Riverside, Illinois. She received her B.S. degree with honors from the University of Missouri at St. Louis in 1971, and was honored that year as a finalist in the Danforth Urban Leadership Fellow competition.

Huge thanks goes to Mark Allen and Fran Tiffany of the Clerk’s Office for all of their efforts on the workflows, with an extra thanks to Fran for assisting with the conversion of the Appendices. Thank you to <b>Kathleen</b> Gunn, Sarah <b>Koch,</b> and Liz Tate of the Clerk’s Office for their assistance with pre-testing the surveys and entry of data from self-represented litigants, and to Julie Sweeney, who volunteered her time to administer the surveys to self-represented litigants.
