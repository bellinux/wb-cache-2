40|$|Most machine {{strength}} grading methods {{are based on}} rather poor statistical relationships between edgewise bending strength and modulus of elasticity (MOE), the latter determined either as <b>flatwise</b> <b>bending</b> MOE measured over a length of about one meter, or as global axial dynamic MOE. Furthermore, European Standards stipulate that local MOE in both edgewise bending and tension shall be determined at a critical section and over a length of five times {{the depth of the}} piece. However, a study of tensile strain fields determined on side board surfaces using contact-free measurement technique showed that stiffness reduction occurs very locally. This characteristic was used for development of a new indicating property (IP) defined as local edgewise bending MOE and determined by means of scanned fibre direction fields and stiffness integration over cross-sections.

This is a situation for which IBC, based on a collocated actuator-sensor arrangement along the blade, and tailored to act specifically on the bending and the torsion modes, is expected to bring further improvements to the reduction of the overall dynamic response of helicopters. The results indicate that there are already real situations for which the adaptive material has enough power to accomplish the task without saturation of the applied electrical field...|$|R
40|$|Laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is a {{high-performance}} {{engineered wood product}} made of several wood veneers bound together mostly in grain direction. Veneers are obtained thanks to peeling process. This cutting process induces lathe checks of the veneer with variable depth and spatial frequencies. In this work, we studied the influence of lathe checks on the mechanical properties of LVL thanks to a finite element model of LVL beams made of checked veneers. The checks were modelled as free spaces in the cross-section. Several typical check depths and frequencies were compared, with the beam tested edgewise or flatwise. The {{results show that the}} longitudinal modulus of elasticity and the shear modulus in <b>flatwise</b> <b>bending</b> are marginally affected by checking, while the shear modulus of the LVL beam is significantly reduced in edgewise bending if the check depth is important. This phenomenon is due to high shear deformations in the edgewise bending case, because checks are mainly horizontal in this state. Therefore, the check depth may also affect the resistance of LVL in edgewise bending, thus experimental testing of this assumption will be done...|$|R
40|$|PROPX is a FORTRAN {{computer}} program that predicts {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} performance. Although not as sophisticated as some codes, {{it gives a}} good initial impression of performance with a minimal of required input data. PROPX accounts for effects such as: Prandtl tip losses, wake expansion effects, cascade effects, rotating wake effects, blade coning, gap corrections, generator losses, blade twist, and airfoil characteristics for variable thickness blade sections. The program also calculates the frequency and static tip displacement of the rotor blades for the first <b>flatwise</b> <b>bending</b> mode as a function of wind speed. The core of the program uses a combined blade element/momentum theory approach to the determine force, torque, and power acting on the rotor blade as a function of wind speed.

40|$|This paper mainly {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the physical and mechanical properties of LVL panels made from Eucalyptus grandis, from reforestation at the region of Sengés, in Paraná state, Brazil. LVL panels were manufactured using 23 veneers (2, 4 mm thick each one) in commercial dimension of 2. 500 mm long and 1, 200 mm wide. The properties of static bending were analyzed (strength and rigidity) in beams of the LVL, in the flatwise and edgewise positions. The properties of compression parallel to grain and shear parallel in the plans L-X and L-Y and density in this LVL panels were also analyzed according to ASTM-D 5456 / 4761 and ASTM-D 198 codes. The mean values to <b>flatwise</b> <b>bending</b> MOE and MOR were 13114 MPa and 88. 76 MPa, respectively, and for edgewise bending MOE and MOR were 15871 MPa and 88. 63 MPa, respectively. T he density (12 %) of the LVL panels and of the veneers were 690 kg/m 3 and 649 kg/m 3. The mean values to parallel compression MOE and MOR were 16856 MPa and 58. 05 MPa, respectively. The mean values of the maximum resistance to shear parallel in the plans L-X and L-Y were 5. 96 MPa and 591 MPa, respectively.

40|$|The {{results from}} a wind tunnel test of a small scale free-tip rotor are analyzed. The free-tip rotor has blade tips that are free to weathervane into the tip's {{relative}} wind, thus producing a more uniform lift around the azimuth. The free-tip assembly, which includes the controller, functioned flawlessly throughout the test. In {{a test of the}} free-tip's response after passing through a vertical air jet, the tip pitched freely and in a controlled manner. Analysis of the tip's response characteristics showed the free-tip system's damped natural frequency to be 5. 2 per rev. Tip pitch angle responses to the local airstream are presented for an advance-ratio range of 0. 1 to 0. 397 and for a solidity weighted rotor lift coefficient range of 0. 038 to 0. 092. Harmonic analysis of the responses showed a dominance by the first harmonic. As a result of the tip being free, forward flight power requirements were reduced by 8 % or more. More power reduction was recorded for high thrust conditions. In addition to the power reduction, <b>flatwise</b> blade <b>bending</b> moments were reduced by as much as 30 % at the inboard blade stations...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the pursued {{research}} is to increase knowledge {{of the effects of}} knots in structural timber so that characteristics of weaker timber may be determined and applied to improve current grading techniques. In the process, a three-dimensional fiber paradigm was established, which describes variations of local principle material axes in timber containing knots. The adaptability of the paradigm allows practically any softwood knot and its effect on surrounding wood material to be modeled with an accuracy that is limited only by input data. In the description of the fiber paradigm, considerations are given to Shigo’s knot formation theory, which predicts two separate patterns of fiber direction within annual growth layers related to live knots. In order to determine the possibility to practically and non-destructively predict local material directions in structural timber with the three-dimensional fiber paradigm, variations of knot and knot bump geometry and related fiber disturbance of eleven knots from two trees of Nordic Spruce (Picea Abies) grown in Southern Sweden were analyzed. Results showed that the paradigm could be calibrated to describe measured projected fiber orientations in the radial and tangential planes from two visual knot parameters with a coefficient of correlation R 2 = 0. 88. Spiral grain was considered in the investigation, and was shown to correspond well to results from previous research on Nordic Spruce. When modeling the mechanical behavior of timber containing knots, variation of material properties within the stem wood, and the effect of altering fiber patterns within a single annual growth layer were modeled with the principles of homogenization and assumed constant material properties of the earlywood, transientwood, and latewood. <b>Flatwise</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness along a timber beam was predicted numerically with the model and compared to measured values. The results indicated that the proposed model of the effect of knots on sawn timber, and the assumed properties of earlywood, transientwood, and latewood in relation to variations of annual ring thickness throughout the beam account for the measured variations of stiffness. The results also suggest that variation of annual ring thickness may cause larger variations in stiffness than the distribution and properties of knots along the beam. The derived and verified model of knot effects on sawn timber was applied to predict the severity of stress states for various knot positions in tensile loaded timber members. From these results a definition of a critical knot was derived. The applicability of the critical knot definition was analyzed in relation to actual tensile load carrying capacities experimentally determined for structural timber. Based on these results it is concluded that the derived critical knot definition offers an efficient method to sort out particularly weak members (tensile capacity less than 20 MPa) ...|$|R

40|$|Machine {{strength}} grading is a production {{process in the}} sawmill industry used to grade sawn timber boards into different strength classes with specific characteristic values of the bending strength, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and density. These properties are called grade determining properties. Each of these is predicted {{on the basis of}} a statistical relationship between the property and a so-called indicating property (IP), which is based on non-destructively assessed board properties. In most cases, the prediction of strength is crucial for the grading. The majority of commercial grading machines rely on a statistical relationship of strength to an IP, which is either a global dynamic MOE or an averaged <b>flatwise</b> <b>bending</b> MOE measured over a board length of about one meter. The problem of today’s machine {{strength grading}} is that the accuracy of the strength prediction is rather poor with a coefficient of determination of about R 2 ≈ 0. 5 − 0. 6. One consequence of this is that much of the strength potential of timber is unused. The intention of this research is to contribute to a long-term goal, which is development of a method for prediction of bending strength that is more accurate than the methods available today. The research relies on three hypotheses. First, accurate prediction of bending strength can be achieved using an IP that is a localized MOE value (determined over a short length) that represents the lowest local bending stiffness of a board. Second, knowledge of the local bending stiffness with high resolution along a board’s longitudinal direction can be established on the basis of fibre direction within the board in combination with dynamic MOE. Third, fibre directions in the interior of a board can be determined by application of fibre angle models utilizing data of fibre directions on the board’s surfaces obtained from tracheid effect scanning.  Following these hypotheses, this work has included laboratory investigations of local material directions, and development of models for fibre directions of the interior of boards. The work also included application of one-dimensional (1 D)  analytical models and three-dimensional (3 D) finite element models of individual boards for the mechanical behaviour, analysis of mechanical response of boards based on experiments and based on the suggested models. Lastly, the suggested models were evaluated by comparisons of calculated and experimentally determined local bending stiffness along boards, and of predicted and experimentally determined bending strength. The research contributes with in-depth knowledge on local fibre directions close to knots, and detailed information on variation of the local bending stiffness in boards. Moreover, fibre angle models for fibre directions in the interior of boards are presented. By application of the fibre angle models in the 3 D model of the whole board, the local bending stiffness along timber boards can be determined over a very short length (l < 50 mm). A comparison with results determined on an experimental basis show a very close similarity implying that the applied models are sufficient to capture the variation of local bending stiffness, caused by knots and fibre distortions, with very high accuracy.  Furthermore, it is found that by means of IPs derived using the suggested models, bending strength can be predicted with high accuracy. For a timber sample comprising 402 boards, such IPs results in coefficient of determination as high as R 2 = 0. 73. However, using IPs based on the 3 D finite element model did not improve the R 2 value achieved when using the IPs based on the 1 D model...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the within- and between-tree variations in the physical and mechanical properties of Pinus radiata (radiata pine). Forty eight trees from a 25 -year-old plantation on the Canterbury plains near Dunsandel in the South Island of New Zealand were felled and cross-cut to give three 3. 6 meter logs. Each log was identified by tree number and position up the height of the tree (butt, middle and top log). At the sawmill the logs were sawn, first by removing 40 mm thick slices known as flitches from opposite sides of the trunk until a 100 mm thick plank known as a cant was left at the centre. The flitches were re-cut at the breast bench circular saw to yield timbers of nominal dimensions 100 x 40 mm. In re-cutting the 100 mm wide cant gave 3 - 5 boards depending on the diameter of the log. The position of every board was recorded relative to the pith and numbered. A total of 915 boards from the 48 trees (144 logs) were obtained. The boards were filleted (i. e. stacked with uniform and sufficient spacing between each layer both in the vertical and horizontal directions so as to ease air circulation) and air-dried to approximately 12 % moisture content. After drying the boards were dressed to 90 x 35 mm and grouped into. one of the four Australian structural grades (F 4, F 5, F 8 and F 11) as each board passed through a stress grading machine. The modulus of elasticity of the boards was measured both in <b>flatwise</b> <b>bending</b> and axial tension. The strength of the boards was determined by destructive testing in tension and compression parallel to the grain. After failure in tension short clear planks (i. e. planks with no knots and any other natural defects) were cut from each board. From these short planks small clear specimens were prepared for the determination of stiffness, bending strength and compression strength parallel to the grain. The investigation of density, stiffness and strength in relation to the vertical and radial positions within a tree revealed that there is a significant variation in all properties with changes in radial positions across the diameter, and a significant variation in strength properties, but not stiffness with change in vertical position up the height of the tree. Regarding between-tree variation, all properties changed significantly. With reference to the production of structural framing timber, stiffness and density were compared as criteria for sorting trees and identifying superior material within logs. This analysis revealed that stiffness is a better criterion for selecting superior trees within the natural population of a forest stand, to improve the value of mill production and to achieve a better outturn in higher value grades (F 5 and above). A regression analysis between the properties of the in-grade timber and clearwood showed that there is a very strong relationship between the modulus of elasticity of clearwood and that of the in-grade timber. As expected there was a general decrease in strength and stiffness of the graded timber as the grade value decreased from F 11 to F 4. Strength and stiffness values in tension, bending and compression have been compared with the current New Zealand, Australian and European code design values, generally giving good recovery of higher value grades (F 5 and above), especially for strength...|$|R

The blade is assumed to have twist, precone, droop, sweep, torque offset and blade root offset, and the elastic axis and the axes of center of mass, tension, and aerodynamic center coincident at the quarter chord. The blade is cantilevered in bending, but has a torsional root spring to simulate pitch link flexibility. Aerodynamic forces acting on the blade are derived from strip theory based on quasi-steady two-dimensional airfoil theory. The equations are hybrid, consisting of one integro-differential equation for root torsion and three integro-partial differential equations for <b>flatwise</b> and chordwise <b>bending</b> and elastic torsion.
