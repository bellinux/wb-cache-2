40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{national}} guidelines {{issued by}} all hospital radiology departments concerning {{the use of}} gonadal <b>protection</b> <b>shields</b> for taking X-rays of the pelvis. It is important to follow these guidelines especially when paediatric X-rays are taken. Gonads are very susceptible to radiation as they fall directly {{in the line of}} radiation exposure when pelvic X-rays are taken. AIM: To examine whether these guidelines were being followed. METHODS: This audit considered 355 radiographs taken in a 6 -month period on 149 patients, under the age of 16 years, attending the orthopaedic department at King's Mill Hospital. RESULTS: In only 23 % of the cases studied, the correct use of gonad <b>protection</b> <b>shields</b> had been performed. In 67 % of the unprotected patients, the shields were not used at all. In the remainder, the shield was incorrectly applied. Out of all the patients, 45 % had more than one X-ray thus exposing the gonads to unnecessary radiation. In addition, 8 % of patients had a CT scan, 6 % had fluoroscopy and 42 % had radiographs of other regions of the body. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines should be adhered to as far as possible and efforts always be made to decrease radiation exposure. Application of the current guidelines excludes the first X-ray exposure of the female pelvis and of the pelvis of trauma patients from the use of shields, thus adding to the number of the X-rays done without protection...|$|R
