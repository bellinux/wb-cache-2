25|$|In imperial-times Chinese {{social and}} {{religious}} culture there were charitable organizations for virtually every social service: burial of the dead, care of orphans, provision {{of food for}} the hungry. The wealthiest in every community—typically, the merchants—were expected to give food, medicine, clothing, and even cash to those in need. According to Caroline Reeves, a historian at Emmanuel College in Boston, that began to change {{with the arrival of}} American missionaries in the late 19th century. One of the reasons they gave <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>there</b> was to help the poor Chinese.|$|E

25|$|A German {{exchange}} student {{said he was}} beaten randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, his only reason <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>there</b> that he had accompanied other students to eat. The student gives a horrifying description of the violence he endured, he cowered in a corner when he saw police because {{a few weeks before}} he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. He claims that upon spotting him, about six police officers started beating him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police. The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which clearly violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.|$|E

500|$|... "Boston-style" [...] songwriting {{refers to}} the introspective and literate breed of singer-songwriter so {{prevalent}} in the modern folk music landscape. According to Paul, Boston-style songwriting grew out of Boston's thriving folk scene with its dense collection of colleges, college radio stations and listening rooms. [...] Boston radio includes the University of Massachusetts' WUMB, the country's foremost radio station for folk and acoustic music 24-hours a day. [...] Paul said the Boston songwriters {{tend to be more}} thoughtful and soft because in an intimate listening room, [...] "all you've got is you and your words." [...] Boston-style songwriting tends to be more about lyric than melody, is intimate and thoughtful but also relevant, often addressing social issues. [...] Boston-style songwriting does not only refer to Boston musicians, but includes national artists such as Shawn Colvin, John Gorka, Susan Werner, Bill Morrissey, and Dar Williams. [...] In an interview with Paul Freeman for the East Bay Daily News, Paul commented on how he hopes audience members relate to his songs, [...] "Each song is supposed to be like a little three-dimensional world. I'm hoping to invite them in, have them make out the details and the reasons <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>there,</b> and apply them to their own lives. But I'm also hoping to entertain them." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>For</b> <b>Being</b> <b>There,</b> Tweedy {{wanted to}} blend the {{experiences}} he had making music with {{the ones he}} had listening to music. One of the first songs that Tweedy wrote was [...] "Misunderstood", a song about a tortured musical artist {{from the point of}} view of a fan. The song contains several overt references to the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, including the addition of insults that Farrar used against Tweedy—specifically one calling him a [...] "mama's boy". Part of the song's lyrics ("Take the guitar player for a ride/See, he ain't never been satisfied/He thinks he owes some kind of debt/Be years before he gets over it") are originally from Peter Laughner, an underground alternative rock artist from Cleveland that died at 24 in 1977, taken from his song [...] "Amphetamine". The song concludes with the artist lashing out against the listener with satirical self-pity, a rebellion against the way that fans saw Uncle Tupelo as only an archetype of Gram Parsons inspired country rock. To induce a feeling of chaos on the track, the members of Wilco recorded a track where the members switched to novel instruments and placed sections of it into the song. The theme of a [...] "tortured artist" [...] is found in other songs as well; the end of [...] "Sunken Treasure" [...] features Tweedy calling for the renewal of his youth as a punk rocker.|$|E

Needing to keep another appointment, Gluck installed Greenwich in an office {{and asked her to}} wait. The office turned out to be that of songwriter-producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.

This time, she is whisked back to a bedroom where a red-haired boy has set his bedroom drapes aflame. The boy {{turns out to be}} Rufus, now a few years older. Dana quickly puts out the fire and speaks to Rufus, who, unafraid, confesses he set fire to the drapes to get back at his father for beating him after he stole a dollar. During their ensuing conversation, Rufus's casual use of the word [...] "nigger" [...] to refer to Dana, who is black, initially upsets Dana, but then leads her to figure out that she has been transported back in time as well as space, specifically to Maryland, circa 1815. Following Rufus's advice, Dana seeks refuge at home of Alice Greenwood and her mother, free blacks who live {{on the edge of the}} plantation. Dana realizes that both Rufus and Alice are her ancestors, and will one day have children.
