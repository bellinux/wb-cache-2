50|$|Hydroforming is a {{specialized}} type of die forming {{that uses a}} high pressure hydraulic fluid to press room temperature working material into a die. To hydroform aluminium into a vehicle's frame rail, a hollow tube of aluminium is placed inside a negative mold that has {{the shape of the}} desired result. High pressure hydraulic pumps then inject fluid at very high pressure inside the aluminium tube which causes it to expand until it matches the mold. The hydroformed aluminium is then removed from the mold.Hydroforming allows complex shapes with concavities to be formed, which would be difficult or impossible with standard solid <b>die</b> <b>stamping.</b> Hydroformed parts can often be made with a higher stiffness-to-weight ratio and at a lower per unit cost than traditional stamped or stamped and welded parts. Virtually all metals capable of cold forming can be hydroformed, including aluminium, brass, carbon and stainless steel, copper, and high strength alloys.|$|E

Initially he resisted, but the T's sagging market share finally forced him to admit a replacement was needed. When he finally agreed to begin development of this new model, he focused on the mechanical aspects and on what today is called design for manufacturability (DFM), which he had always strongly embraced and for which the Model T production system was famous. Although ultimately successful, {{the development of the}} Model A included many problems that had to be resolved. For example, the <b>die</b> <b>stamping</b> of parts from sheet steel, which the Ford company had led to new heights of development with the Model T production system, was something Henry had always been ambivalent about; it had brought success, but he felt that it was not the best choice for durability. He was determined that the Model A would rely more on drop forgings than the Model T; but his ideas to improve the DFM of forging did not prove practical. Eventually, Ford's engineers persuaded him to relent, lest the Model A's production cost force up its retail price too much.|$|E
40|$|Various {{methods have}} been {{explored}} for the fabrication of the large trapezoidal plates used {{in the construction of}} the Tile-Cal hadronic calorimeter for ATLAS.

Very early in the program, the Argonne group began investigating the possibility of <b>die</b> <b>stamping</b> the master plates.

Concern was expressed by many members of the collaboration that due to the very precise tolerances required, <b>die</b> <b>stamping,</b> using standard dies, would not be adequate. Fine blanking techniques were felt to be adequate, but were cost prohibitive.

40|$|Approximately 41, 000 master plates (Fig. 1) are {{required}} for the Extended Barrel Hadronic Calorimeter for the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Early in the R&D program associated with the detector, it was recognized that the fabrication of these steel laminations was a significant issue, {{both in terms of}} the cost to produce these high precision formed plates, as well as the length of time required to produce all plates for the calorimeter. Two approaches were given serious consideration: laser cutting and <b>die</b> <b>stamping.</b> The Argonne group was a strong supporter of the latter approach and in late 1995 initiated an R&D program to demonstrate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of <b>die</b> <b>stamping</b> these plates by constructing a die and stamping approximately 2000 plates for use in construction of three full size prototype modules. This was extremely successful and <b>die</b> <b>stamping</b> was selected by the group for production of these plates. When the prototype die was constructed it was matched to the calorimeter envelope at that time. This subsequently changed. However with some minor adjustments in the design envelope and a small compromise in terms of instrumented volume, it became possible to use this same die for the production of all master plates for the Tile Calorimeter. Following an extensive series of discussions and an evaluation of the performance of the stamping presses available to our collaborators in Europe, it was decided to ship the US die to CERN for use in stamping master plates for the barrel section of the calorimeter. This was done under the supervision of CERN and JINR, Dubna, and carried out at the TATRA truck plant at Koprivinice, Czech Republic. It was a great success. Approximately 41, 000 plates were stamped and fully met specification. Moreover, the production time was significantly reduced by avoiding the need of constructing and then qualifying a second die for use in Europe. This also precluded small geometrical differences between the barrel and extended barrel plates (and therefore submodules) being an issue, with the result that standard submodules are fully exchangeable between the two types of module...|$|E

In this paper, two criteria for the detection of localised necking during stamping of sheets are introduced and used for orthotropic and Barlat's anisotropic laws. The first approach uses perturbation techniques to calculate how the stability of the local mechanical equilibrium can be violated locally. The second criterion is based on the study of diffuse necking. It assumes that the material in the localisation band tends to a plane strain deformation mode and the maximum force for this local configuration is calculated. Both criteria are used with 3 D finite element analysis of Nakazima and cross <b>die</b> <b>stamping</b> tests. Numerical predictions are compared to experimental results.
