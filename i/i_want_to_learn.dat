2500|$|In {{his younger}} days, Xiang Yu was {{instructed}} in scholarly arts and swordsmanship {{but he did}} not manage to master what he was taught, and his uncle Xiang Liang was not very satisfied with him. Xiang Yu said, [...] "Books are only useful in helping me remember my name. Mastering swordsmanship allows me to face only one opponent, so it's not worth learning. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to defeat thousands of enemies." [...] Hence, his uncle tried to educate him in military strategies and the art of wars instead, but Xiang Yu stopped learning after he had grasped the main ideas; Xiang Liang was disappointed with his nephew, who showed no sign of motivation or apparent talent apart from his great strength, so he gave up and let Xiang Yu decide his own future.|$|E

50|$|Because {{we were so}} {{innocent}} about psychic literature, we werent {{hampered by}} superstitious fears about such psychic phenomena.

5000|$|... "I {{caught the}} science bug very early from {{watching}} science fiction programs, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about real science," [...] Alibaruho has said.

5000|$|Murphy's career also {{included}} {{work as a}} singer. She commented: [...] "My singing voice isn't like my speaking voice...I've just always kept it a secret and never taken credit because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> work behind the microphone in a recording studio, {{and some of the}} singers don't even know it was me recording on their albums." ...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding {{his growing}} up {{listening}} to the band, Darlington stated: [...] "I definitely listened to Pink Floyd. I remember Another Brick In The Wall being No. 1 in the UK. It was December 1979. Probably my first memory of Pink Floyd. Then I actually heard The Wall album in its entirety and that's what particularly drew me to Pink Floyd {{about the age of}} 12 or 13.

I was already <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> play guitar and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> play some of these wonderful guitar solos. That was my introduction to Pink Floyd. I was a fan from quite an early age." ...|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} time I liked school and for {{the first time}} I made good marks.

6000|$|... "'I {{saw your}} friend Captain Abner {{about a week}} ago,' she said, 'as I drove through Shamrick, and he looked dreadfully solemn. I think his {{disappointment}} is wearing on him.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} {{is to find a}} simple body of knowledge that will provide teachers and students with the understandings needed to appreciate the visual passion of prominent abstract artists' works.

50|$|In {{the early}} years of study he didn't even dreamed of {{becoming}} a teacher. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from my teachers, Fioravanti, Bigatti, Troiano Troiani, and then worked in their studios for a living. Teaching comes in 1949, when I won a prize in the Students and Alumni Association of Fine Arts (MEEBA) and its president called me to give classes. 'Not at all, I did not finish the Pueyrredón' I remember I answered. I resisted a little, and offered me to test a month. Then was born that kind of passion aroused by the teaching , which is a form of learning.|$|R
