5|$|Before the 2014 season, the Phillies signed Mayberry to a {{guaranteed}} $1.5875 million contract. Mayberry entered the season {{a member of}} the Phillies bench who some writers thought was not worth his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was successful early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would have value in a potential trade, as the Phillies were not expected to make the playoffs, and thus might prefer to get a prospect for future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that the}} Phillies used him in an appropriate role, rather than trying to utilize <b>him</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

Shaun Harris collaborated with Lloyd to release Harris's self-titled debut solo album in 1973, which explored his country rock influences. Later on, he became the president of Barry Manilow's publishing company and most recently Harris has written a play about his life. Although Danny Harris was initially disillusioned with the music industry, he recorded the gospel album Thank <b>Him</b> <b>Every</b> <b>Day</b> in 1980.

Morgan helped found Three Dog Night (though left before they found commercial success) and joined the Electric Prunes for their album Just Good Old Rock and Roll. He died in 1989 aged 44.|$|E

Apparently Prasad never recovered, and at the time, there was a controversy that the man who, through satyagraha, had resisted multiple British governments and Viceroys and been jailed by them for so many years, had said his last words to an Englishman.|$|E

25|$|In the 2016 {{video game}} , the {{character}} Sorin Sprocket is eventually revealed to have anterograde amnesia, which he developed after unintentionally causing {{a car accident}} which killed his sister. This causes his memories to completely reset every time he wakes up from sleeping, {{to the day after}} this accident. This depiction is notable for demonstrating the relationship issues that arise between Sorin and his fiancee, Ellen Wyatt, {{as a result of this}} disorder, most noticeably with how Sorin's feelings towards her to coming across as distant and cold. As the storyline continues, however, the player comes to uncover that Sorin in fact deeply loves his fiancee, and is able to maintain this love despite his disorder, but in fact feels a sense of guilt over the fact that he has to constantly remind himself of the fact that this love exists inside of <b>him</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> due to his disorder. It is also noticeable in that it depicts how Sorin deals with his disorder, by keeping a journal where he writes down every minuet detail of every day after his sister's death. He carries this journal around everywhere he goes as a substitution to his memories, and uses what is written in the notebook to become aware each time he wakes up of the fact that he he his condition, what the current date apparently is, and everything important that have apparently occurred on every day since he first developed the condition. The episode also deals with legal issues concerning the disorder, when it is debated during Ellen Wyatt's trial as to whether Sorin's journal can be considered a proper substitution to his memories for the sake of viable witness testimony. Danger's imposed by this also come into play when it is revealed that a page in Sorin's journal had been altered by someone, which causes him to go into mental collapse that any of his other memories and thoughts could also have arisen from someone else's manipulation.|$|E

The following May, Goddard entered negotiations with the studio to write and direct The Martian. Goddard wrote a screenplay for the film, and Matt Damon expressed interest in starring under Goddard's direction. Goddard then pursued an opportunity to direct Sinister Six, a comic book film about a team of supervillains. Kinberg then brought the book to Scott's attention. In May 2014, Scott entered negotiations with the studio to direct the film with Damon cast as the film's stranded astronaut. Scott said he was attracted by the emphasis on science and thought a balance could be struck between entertainment and learning. Damon said he was attracted by the novel, the screenplay {{and the opportunity to}} work with Scott. Following Scott's commitment, the project picked up the pace and was quickly approved.

His sentence was to be carried out on November 14, 1842. Colt asked that he be allowed to marry Caroline Henshaw on the morning of his hanging. While imprisoned, Colt lived luxuriously in his prison cell, receiving daily visits from friends and family, smoking Cuban cigars, sleeping in an actual bed instead of a mound of straw and wearing silk dressing gowns inside and a seal skin overcoat for his daily walks in the prison yard.

500|$|A murderous and psychopathic {{criminal}} mastermind who portrays {{himself as}} an [...] "agent of chaos" [...] and rises to power by terrorizing Gotham and plunging it into anarchy. Before Ledger was confirmed for the role in July 2006, Paul Bettany, Lachy Hulme, Adrien Brody, Steve Carell, and Robin Williams publicly expressed interest in it. However, Nolan had {{wanted to work with}} Ledger on a number of projects in the past (including unsuccessfully approaching Ledger for the role of Batman in Batman Begins) and was agreeable to Ledger's chaotic interpretation of the character. When Ledger saw Batman Begins, he had realized a way to make the character work that was consistent with the film's tone: he described his Joker as a [...] "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy." [...] In the film, the Joker has a Glasgow smile, and his trademark chalk-white skin and red lips are makeup rather than the result of chemical bleaching, as in the traditional portrayal of the character. Throughout the film, the Joker states his desire to upset social order through crime, and comes to define himself by his conflict with Batman. To prepare for the role, Ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month, formulating the character's posture, voice, and personality, and kept a diary, in which he recorded the Joker's thoughts and feelings. While he initially found it difficult, Ledger eventually generated a voice unlike Jack Nicholson's character in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. He was also given [...] and , which he [...] "really tried to read and put it down." [...] Ledger also cited A Clockwork Orange and Sid Vicious as [...] "a very early starting point for Christian [...] and I. But we kind of flew far away from that pretty quickly and into another world altogether." [...] "There's a bit of everything in him. There's nothing that consistent," [...] Ledger said, and added, [...] "There are a few more surprises to him." [...] Ledger was allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the Joker sends out as warnings. Each take Ledger made was different from the last. Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot that he chose to not be present when Ledger shot the video with a kidnapped reporter (Anthony Michael Hall). On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose, leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. [...] "It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at <b>him</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> ," [...] Nolan recalled. [...] "But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish." [...] All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no [...] "digital effects" [...] to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously. Nolan has dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory.|$|E
