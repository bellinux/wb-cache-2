500|$|By 23 July, Wedel had {{received}} direct {{orders from the}} impatient Frederick to secure a [...] "good position", by which the king meant defensible ground, {{and to use the}} preferred means of attack, by which the King meant [...] "oblique order". Wedel knew he must bring the Russians to battle before they could move on Frankfurt or risk his reputation with the King. On 23 July, Wedel ordered another reconnaissance of Saltykov's troops at Langen Meil, a small settlement outside Key, and found them in motion; assuming they meant to move on Frankfurt, he subsequently ordered an advance on the Russian right flank. Wedel's best opportunity seemed to be securing the Paltzig heights before the Russians could do so, {{and the best way to}} <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be through Kay.|$|E
500|$|An {{enhanced}} remake titled Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, or [...] in Japan, {{was released}} worldwide for the PSP between 2005 and 2008. With {{the launch of}} the PSP, Keiji Inafune and his team debated on whether or not to create a Mega Man X9. [...] "So, we decided that instead of going the X9 route, let's go back to the series' roots and rediscover what makes the X series so classic," [...] Inafune concluded. [...] "We felt {{that the best way to}} <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be to make an X remake." [...] Although the remake stays true to the original game in both gameplay and basic storyline, Maverick Hunter X features a total graphical overhaul with 3D character models and backgrounds, a remixed soundtrack, voice acting, and anime cutscenes. According to Yoshikawa, the character illustrations were updated to resemble both toys and the designs of Mega Man X8.|$|E
500|$|... "Leonard Betts" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz and {{directed}} by Kim Manners. Scripts written by Gilligan, Shiban, and Spotnitz would later go on to be humorously referred to as creations of a [...] "John Gillnitz"—a portmanteau of the three writers' names. According to Spotnitz, the script for [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was [...] "not particularly well-loved at the time". Spotnitz later noted, however, that the episode became [...] "one of [...] favorite monster shows". Originally, the episode [...] "Never Again" [...] {{was supposed to come}} before the episode. Vince Gilligan explained, [...] " [...] really wanted to grab viewers who had never seen us before , and we knew the best way to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be with a really creepy stand-alone monster story." [...] Thus, the air date of [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was flipped with [...] "Never Again" [...] {{in order to ensure that}} the former episode, which featured the show's two stars in their traditional roles, aired after the Super Bowl. Anderson has said that she would have played the part differently in [...] "Never Again"—which featured Scully acting notably out of character—had she been aware that Scully would get cancer at the time, as Scully only discovers this at the end of [...] "Leonard Betts".|$|E

2500|$|Vera Elizabeth Claythorne, a cool, efficient, {{resourceful}} {{young woman}} who is on leave from her position as a sports mistress at a third-rate girls' school. She has largely worked at secretarial jobs ever since {{her job as a}} governess was ended by the death of her charge, Cyril Hamilton, whom she intentionally allowed to swim out to sea – as the child had wanted to do, but had theretofore been denied as too dangerous – and drowned. She did this so her lover, Cyril's uncle, Hugo Hamilton, could become the family heir, inherit the estate and marry her, which had been their original plan before Cyril's birth changed things. She swam out to sea to [...] "save" [...] Cyril to make it seem he had disobeyed her – as she had consistently told him it was too dangerous – but knowing she would not arrive in time. Her plan backfired when Hugo, who loved his nephew, abandoned her after he somehow sensed what she had done. Hugo, ironically, did become the heir but has become a miserable drunkard. On a fateful transatlantic journey, he met Wargrave and, inebriated, told the judge, [...] "I've known a murderess – known her, I tell you [...] ... Women are fiends – absolute fiends – you wouldn't think a girl like that – a nice straight jolly girl – you wouldn't think she'd <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>would</b> you? That she'd take a kid out to sea and let it drown – you wouldn't think a woman could do a thing like that?"Wargrave was able to trace Vera with this information, and lure her to the island. In the penultimate scene of the novel, she manages to take Lombard's gun, and shoot him dead in what she believed was self-defence. She returns to the house, relieved she has survived. When she goes to her room, she finds a readied noose, complete with chair beneath it, suspended from a hook hanging from the ceiling. She, in what Wargrave, [...] hidden from her sight, describes first hand as a post-traumatic state, sees and hears Hugo, her former lover, encouraging her. She adjusts the noose round her neck and kicks the chair away, fulfilling the rhyme's final verse ("One little Soldier Boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.") ...|$|E
