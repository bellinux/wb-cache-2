This retrospective {{study was designed}} to assess concomitant injuries and develop a correlation between <b>fracture</b> <b>location</b> and the severity of injury. Methods. All patients () diagnosed with a fracture of the sternum by means of a CT scan were analysed with respect to accident circumstances, fracture morphology and topography, associated injuries, and outcome. Results. Isolated sternal fractures occurred in 9 %. In all other admissions, concomitant injuries were diagnosed: mainly rip fractures (64 %), injury to the head (48 %), the thoracic spine (38 %), lumbar spine (27 %), and cervical spine (22 %). Predominant <b>fracture</b> <b>location</b> was the manubrium sterni. In these locations, the observed mean ISS was the highest.

This main {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of AD on the incidence of hospitalization due to fall-related bone fracture in elderly Chinese patients. A secondary aim was to investigate whether AD has an effect on <b>fracture</b> <b>location.</b> Methods: Patients aged ≧ 65  years who were hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in north China from 2002 to 2012 were recruited. Consecutive patients with the diagnosis of AD at discharge were compared with an age-matched control group of patients without dementia. Results: The study included 345 AD patients and 1380 controls. The proportion of patients in the AD group hospitalized because of fall-related bone fracture (15. 7 %) was significantly higher than in the control group (2. 4 %). Multivariate analysis showed that age and osteoporosis increased the risk of hospitalized AD patients having a history of bone fracture. There was no significant difference in <b>fracture</b> <b>location</b> between the groups. Conclusion: On the basis of our findings, we conclude that AD may increase the incidence of hospitalization due to falls and bone fracture. We also found that AD has no effect on <b>fracture</b> <b>location,</b> but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{potential}} exposure to respirable crystalline silica experienced by fuel distributing employees on hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>locations.</b> Hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> is an {{oil and gas}} technique used to develop shale formations all across the United States of America. This is done by injecting large volumes of water, sand, and treatment chemicals under high pressure into oil wells within the shale formation. This well stimulation is possible due to the high pressure of the fluid, which creates and opens cracks and fissures in the formation. The sand contained inside the fluid flows into these opened fissures and becomes wedged, holding the fissures open after the fluid pressure has been removed. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued warnings of the hazard created by using sand containing crystalline silica. They have reported that 99 % of hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>locations</b> have {{the possibility of being}} exposed to this hazard. In 2003 NIOSH collected 111 samples at 11 sites in five states evaluating respirable crystalline silica during hydraulic fracturing operations. Only two of the 111 samples were performed on fuel distributing employees on location. The evaluations of these employees showed that fuel distributing employees received an average of dose of 57 % compared to the 8 hour time weighted permissible exposure limit and 114 % of a 12 hour extended work shift exposure limit set by OSHA. This study is to be used to determine compliance with the OSHA existing PEL the proposed PEL changes and ACGIH TLV. This study collected 10 breathing zone samples from fuel distributing employees on hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>locations</b> on five sites in two states. This report focuses on the shale formation development in Oklahoma and Kansas. Four of the sites were located in Oklahoma and one in Kansas. The results from each sample showed that the exposure does not exceed the exposure limits using the current OSHA PEL limit but was over exposed under the proposed PEL and ACGIH’s TLV. These assessments are adjusted to the occupation exposure limit for extended work shifts typical of the fuel company. It is necessary for the company to provide a safe work environment free of known hazards, and limiting the hazards within the exposure limits set by the national government. With new limits and the research that documents old standards do not adequately protected employees, the company should provide safeguards for its employees...|$|R

Moreover, the larger the peak value of the internal pressure is, the better material filling ability and higher accurate the tube bulged profile are. Furthermore, the higher forming accuracy, the better material filling ability and wall-thickness distribution are gained in THFRC than those in free hydro-bulging (FHB) process, and they can be obtained under constant than linear pressure loading paths. Finally, the potential <b>fracture</b> <b>location</b> of the bulged tube in THFRC process is quite different from that in FHB process...|$|E

This {{in vitro}} study was {{designed}} to test the hypothesis that a structural analysis based on intravascular ultrasound images of atherosclerotic vessels obtained before angioplasty can be used to predict plaque <b>fracture</b> <b>locations</b> and balloon pressures required to cause fracture. Background. Intravascular ultrasound imaging performed before interventional procedures has potential for providing information useful for guiding therapeutic strategies. Methods. Intravascutar imaging was performed on 16 atherosclerotic human iliac vessel segments obtained freshly at autopsy; balloon angioplasty was then performed with 1 -min inflations at 2 atm, increasing in 2 -atm increments until fracture of the lumen surface occurred. <b>Fracture</b> <b>locations</b> were confirmed by histopathologic examination. Structural analysis of these images was performed with a large strain finite element analysis of the image that calculated the distribution of stress in the vessel with 2 atm of lumen pressure. Results. Structural analysis demonstrated a total of 30 high circumferential stress regions in the vessels (mean 1. 9 high stress regions/vessel). A total of 18 plaque fractures occurred in the 16 vessel segments. Of the 17 fractures that occurred in the 15 specimens with regions of high circumferential stress, 14 (82 %) occurred at a high stress region (p < 0. 0001). However, (there was no significant relation between the peak stresses estimated by structural analysis and the ultimate balloon inflation pressure required to cause fracture. Conclusions. Structural analysis based on imtravascular ultrasound imaging performed before in vitro balloon angioplasty can predict the <b>locations</b> of plaque <b>fracture</b> that usually accompany angioplasty. However, these data suggest that intravascullar ultrasound may not be useful for predicting the ultimate balloon inflation pressure necessary to cause fracture, possibly because of the variable fracture properties and microscopic structure of atherosclerotic tissues...|$|R

Post-weld heat treatments are performed on laser-welded specimens to obtain underaged (WU), peak-aged (WP), and overaged (WO) specimens. Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) affects the tensile fracture behavior of the welded specimens; HE changes not only the fracture mode but also the <b>fracture</b> <b>location.</b> Without the in-fluence of hydrogen, the <b>fracture</b> <b>location</b> is at the softest region, the weld metal (WM), and the fracture appearance reveals a ductile dimple fracture. For welds sensitive to HE, the fracture is initiated at the heat-affected zone (HAZ) with coarse grain size, and the associated fracture surface exhibits intergranu-lar and quasi-cleavage fractures that are brittle in nature. In addition, the HAZ with coarse grain size is more prone to HE, as compared to other regions in the welded specimens.

Compared with indirect methods, the direct tension test method gives results closer to the true tensile strength under pure tension condition. Herein, a new direct tension test method for prismatic specimens that uses bonded steel end plates to apply tension load to the concrete has been developed. A three-dimensional finite element analysis of the test assembly showed that the tensile stresses transmitted to the specimen are very evenly distributed. Approximately 200 concrete prisms with compressive strengths ranging from 10 to 70 MPa were tested using this method.

40|$|Downhole {{temperature}} measured by distributed temperature sensors shows distinct response during multi-stage fracture treatments. A forward model {{is needed to}} interpret the measured dynamic temperature data during injection and shut-in of a well in complex flow systems to quantitatively diagnose fracturing treatments and characterize created fractures. In this study, a forward thermal model predicting temperature distribution along a wellbore is established considering formation, wellbore, and fracture heat transfer. The fracture model can predict fracture propagation, fluid distribution, and fracture temperature based on mass and energy conservation equations. Temperature distribution in the reservoir can also be obtained by coupling a reservoir model with fracture model and wellbore model. For multi-stage fracture treatments, a sequential simulation method is applied by introducing real time control. Using the algorithm from single-stage treatment, a work flow for multi-stage fracture simulation is created by performing a single-stage stimulation, shutting in the stage, and moving along the wellbore to the next stage. Warm-up of the entrained fracturing fluid during shut-in periods is simulated by removing the fluid injection term and implementing different boundary conditions. Due to the large temperature difference between the injection fluid and the surrounding formation, simulated results show temperature signal change occurs at <b>fracture</b> <b>locations</b> during the injection period. Warm-back behavior is also obvious at <b>fracture</b> <b>locations</b> after shut-in the well. The effect of injection flowrate, fluid distribution, fluid properties, and reservoir characteristics on temperature behavior are investigated.

The solder joints were subject to thermal aging for accelerating the growth of IMCs. The brittle fracture of IMCs was investigated using high speed ball pull/pin pull and Charpy impact tests. In addition to qualitative analysis of failure mechanism, quantitative characterization of ball pull force and impact toughness was also performed.

Importantly, a Transitional Region was observed, below which the probable <b>location</b> of <b>fracture</b> is uncorrelated to the parameters studied. This is because introduced roughness is insufficient to compete with impurities, internal and external manufacturing flaws, and scratches, due to handling and machining, on the samples...|$|R
