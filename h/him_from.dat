This prevented <b>him</b> <b>from</b> leaving the King William's Town magisterial district, prohibited <b>him</b> <b>from</b> speaking either in public or {{to more than}} one person at a time, barred his membership of political organisations, and forbade the media from quoting him. As a result, he returned to Ginsberg, living initially in his mother's house and later in his own residence.|$|E

5|$|Gambira started {{attending}} school at age five, but the 1988 pro-democracy protests caused school closings that interrupted Gambira's schooling.

Once his parents located him, they removed <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the unit and returned with him to their home in Pauk Township. When the authorities came to investigate, Gambira's parents enrolled him in a local monastery to protect <b>him</b> <b>from</b> arrest or conscription into further military service.|$|E

5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited <b>him</b> <b>from</b> playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded <b>him</b> <b>from</b> a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the court date following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E
