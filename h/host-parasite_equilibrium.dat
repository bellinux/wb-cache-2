40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{remains a}} major {{global health problem}} and is the second biggest cause of death by {{infectious}} disease worldwide. Here, we investigate in vitro the Th 1, Th 2, Th 17, and Treg cytokines and transcriptional factors produced after Mycobacterium-specific antigen stimulation in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, clinically cured pulmonary tuberculosis, and healthy donors with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST+). Together, our data indicate that clinical cure after treatment increases the percentages of Mycobacterium-specific Th 1, Th 2, and Th 17 cells compared with those found in active-TB and TST+ healthy donors. These {{results show that the}} <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in latent TB breaks in favor of the microorganism and that the subsequent clinical recovery posttreatment does not return the percentage levels of such cells to those observed in latent tuberculosis. Additionally, our results indicate that rather than showing an increase in the percentage of Mycobacterium-specific Tregs, active-TB patients display lower Th 1 [*]:[*]Treg and Th 17 [*]:[*]Treg ratios. These data, together with lower Th 1 [*]:[*]Th 2 and Th 17 [*]:[*]Th 2 ratios, may indicate a mechanism by which the breakdown of the <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> leads to active-TB and changes in the repertoire of Mycobacterium-specific Th cells that are associated with clinical cure after treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{introduction}} of Anguillicola crassus into Lake Balaton, by 1991 the entire eel population became infected. At the same time, marked differences existed in the prevalence and intensity of infection between {{different areas of the}} lake. The highest prevalence values occurred in the eastern basin less densely populated with eels, while in the western basin {{a large proportion of the}} fish were free of infection. Helminth-free status accompanied by thickening of the swimbladder wall developed after intensive infections. In 1991, eel mortality could be observed only in the western basin. In 1992, the number of eels with swimbladders having a thickened wall but not containing helminths increased also in the central and eastern areas of the lake. Parallel to this, a mortality less expressed than the one in 1991 occurred in the central part of the lake. By 1993, a <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> had become established in Lake Balaton...|$|E
40|$|The {{course of}} Strongyloides stercoralis {{infection}} is usually asymptomatic {{with a low}} discharge of rhabditoid larva in feces. However, the deleterious effects of alcohol consumption seem to enhance the susceptibility to infection, as shown by a fivefold higher strongyloidiasis frequency in alcoholics than in nonalcoholics. Moreover, the association between S. stercoralis infection and alcoholism presents a risk for hyperinfection and severe strongyloidiasis. There are several possible mechanisms for the disruption of the <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in ethanol-addicted patients with chronic strongyloidiasis. One explanation is that chronic ethanol intake stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to produce excessive levels of endogenous cortisol, which in turn {{can lead to a}} deficiency in type 2 T helper cells (Th 2) protective response, and also to mimic the parasite hormone ecdysone, which promotes the transformation of rhabditiform larvae to filariform larvae, leading to autoinfection. Therefore, when untreated, alcoholic patients are continuously infected by this autoinfection mechanism. Thus, the early diagnosis of strongyloidiasis and treatment can prevent serious forms of hyperinfection in ethanol abusers...|$|E
40|$|Superparasitism is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in mosquito-parasitic mermithid nematodes. Multiple nematodes are needed in a single host to produce males. Host selection behavior and intraspecific competition among Romanomermis iyengari and Strelkovimermis spiculatus were investigated against their host, Culex pipiens pipiens in laboratory experiments. In a choice assay between previously infected and uninfected host larvae, infectious preparasites of both nematode species could distinguish not only between infected and uninfected hosts, but even between different parasite loads in showing a strong preference for uninfected hosts or hosts with a low parasite load. Host heart rate declined briefly immediately after parasitism. Superparasitism resulted in increased parasite mortality. Scramble competition within mosquito larvae for limited host nutrients, coupled with a skewed sex ratio favoring males, is assumed to lead to parasite population decline and subsequently toward <b>host-parasite</b> population <b>equilibrium.</b> The ability of mermithid preparasites to accurately assess parasite load likely {{plays an important role}} in host population dynamics and regulation...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} questions of the biology of Entamoeba histolytica {{directly related to the}} understanding of human amebiasis concerns the nature of the factors that determine the virulence of the parasite. The initiation of invasive amebiasis may result from the rupture of a <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> that is maintained while E. histolytica is restricted to a commensal phase. No specific host factor has been shown to play a decisive role in the establishment of intestinal or liver lesions in those countries in which invasive amebiasis represents a common and important health problem. For these reasons, the emphasis of recent investigators has concentrated on the study of parasite virulence factors (1). The degree of virulence of cultured E. histolytica varies according to the strain (2, 3) and culture condition (4). The factors responsible for these variations remain obscure. Despite a large amount of information on the subject, ultrastructural (5) and biochemical (6) studies {{have not been able to}} demonstrate differences that could explain the variable degree of virulence. Certain cell surface properties appear to characterize pathogenic strains: adhesion to epithelial cell...|$|E
40|$|Trypanosoma cruzi, {{the agent}} of Chagas' disease, {{promotes}} neuron survival through receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glial cell-derived family ligand receptors (GFRÎ±). However, these receptors are expressed by only a subset of neurons and at low levels {{or not at all}} in glial cells. Thus, T. cruzi might exploit an additional neurotrophic receptor(s) to maximize <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in the nervous system. We show here that T. cruzi binds TrkC, a neurotrophic receptor expressed by glial cells and many types of neurons, and that the binding is specifically inhibited by neurotrophin- 3, the natural TrkC ligand. Coimmunoprecipitation and competition assays show that the trans-sialidase/parasite-derived neurotrophic factor (PDNF), previously identified as a TrkA ligand, mediates the T. cruzi-TrkC interaction. PDNF promotes TrkC-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, neurite outgrowth, and survival of genetically engineered PC 12 neuronal cells and glial Schwann cells in a TrkC-dependent manner. Thus, TrkC is a new neurotrophic receptor that T. cruzi engages to promote the survival of neuronal and glial cells. The results raise the possibility that T. cruzi recognition of TrkC underlies regenerative events in nervous tissues of patients with Chagas' disease...|$|E
40|$|Pathological {{aspects of}} a {{subclinical}} form of experimental canine leishmaniasis is reported {{here for the first}} time. Fifteen mongrel dogs were used in the present study. Eight dogs were infected and seven were used as control. Four of the control dogs were inoculated with spleen cells from non-infected hamsters. The eight mongrel dogs inoculated intravenously with amastigotes forms of Leishmania chagasi envolved for periods as long as 25 months without any clinical characteristic sign of classical Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). Most of the laboratory test results were compatible to those of the seven control animals but culture of bone marrow aspirated material and serologic testing (IIF) demonstrated or provided evidence that the animals were infected. The most important and predominant histopathological lesion in infected animals were epitheloid granulomas presented in the liver, spleen, adrenal gland and lung of some animals. Channels containing erythrocytes in some granulomas of the liver suggeste that these granulomas are formed inside sinusoidal capillaries. Despite the animals were proved to be infected and presented characteristic histologic lesions, they did not present external signs of disease. The granulomatous aspect of the lesions indicates a good immunologic reactivity and suggest that a <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> does exist in the dog experimental mode...|$|E
40|$|PMN {{migration}} {{into the}} gingival sulcus is a tightly regulated process aimed at selectively increasing leukocyte availability {{at the site}} of bacterial plaque aggression, i. e. the superficial portion of the junctional epithelium. The evidence reviewed in this paper indicates that, besides the action of complement fragments, arachidonic acid metabolites, formyl peptides and other bacterial products, the establishment of a gradient of ICAM- 1 expression across the junctional epithelium and the expression of IL- 8 in its superficial layers probably represent important regulatory mechanisms leading to PMN migration into the gingival sulcus. Such mechanisms can be regulated by the autocrine and paracrine action of some pro-inflammatory cytokines and could possibly be initiated by specific bacteria-keratinocyte interactions. The advantage of such a redundant regulatory mechanism leading to PMN transepithelial migration is probably related to the key role of the neutrophil in the maintenance of a local <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> on one side, and on the tissue injury associated with PMN persistence or random migration within periodontal tissues on the other. Several investigations are in progress aimed at identifying the initial environmental stimuli leading to PMN recruitment into the gingival sulcus and at further exploring the important regulatory events.

We analyzed the conditions necessary for the long term maintenance of Leishmania major in genetically resistant C 57 BL/ 6 mice after spontaneous healing of their dermal lesions. Interleukin (IL) - 10 was found to play an essential role in parasite persistence as sterile cure was achieved in IL- 10 âdeficient and IL- 4 /IL- 10 double-deficient mice. The requirement for IL- 10 in establishing latency associated with natural infection was confirmed in IL- 10 âdeficient mice challenged by bite of infected sand flies.

40|$|THE EXPRESSION OF ADHESION MOLECULES and {{the local}} {{production}} of chemotactic cytokines within the epithelium {{are considered to be}} key events in neutrophil (PMN) migration at sites of mucosal infections. In their journey toward the gingival sulcus, PMNs have been shown to selectively migrate through the junctional epithelium. Little, however, is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in this key process aimed at the control of subgingival bacterial plaque. This investigation describes the expression of IL- 8 mRNA-positive cells and the establishment of a gradient of inter-cellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) receptors within the junctional epithelium of clinically healthy gingiva. Expression of ICAM- 1 and IL- 8 was topographically associated with the area of PMN migration; i. e., the junctional epithelium. Levels of ICAM- 1 expression increased from the basal cells toward the surface of the junctional epithelium and thus toward areas exposed to bacterial challenges. IL- 8 mRNA-positive cells were also present at highest density in the most superficial junctional epithelial layers. The combination of the haptotactic stimuli, resulting from the interaction of the PMN's Î² 2 integrin receptors with the gradient of ICAM- 1 expression, and the location of IL- 8 mRNA-positive cells, consistent with the establishment of a discrete PMN chemotactic source, may play an important physiologic role in efficiently routing PMNs to the gingival sulcus. This process contributes to the maintenance of a local <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and to the limitation of PMN-associated tissue damage. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{concepts}} of pathogenicity and virulence have governed {{our perception of}} microbial harmfulness {{since the time of}} Pasteur and Koch. These concepts resulted in the recognition and identification of numerous etiological agents and provided natural and synthetic agents effective in therapy and prevention of diseases. However, Koch's postulates [...] the premier product of this view [...] place the onus of harmfulness solely on the microbial world. Our recent experiences with polymicrobic and nosocomial infections, legionellosis, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome point to the host as the major determinant of disease. The principles of parasitism, enunciated by Theobold Smith, approximate more accurately the disturbances of the <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> we designate as infection. Many complex attributes of microbial anatomy and physiology have been obscured by our dependency on the pure-culture technique. For example, bacterial attachment organelles and the production of exopolysaccharides enable microorganisms to interact with mammalian glycocalyces and specific receptors. In addition, selection, through the use of therapeutic agents, aids in the progression of environmental organisms to members of the intimate human biosphere, with the potential to complicate the recovery of patients. These factors emphasize further the pivotal significance of host reactions in infections. Parasitism, in its negative aspects, explains the emergence of "new" infections that involve harm to more than host organs and cells: we may encounter subtler infections that reveal parasitic and host cell nucleic acid interactions in a form of genomic parasitism...|$|E

40|$|Chagas {{disease is}} a Trypanosoma cruzi-induced {{zoonosis}} that has no natural cure. Local damage induced by the parasite and the immune response causes chronic heart and digestive lesions. Efforts to develop a therapeutic vaccine that boosts the immune response to completely clear the parasite are needed {{because there is no}} effective treatment for chronically infected patients. In an attempt to modify the <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> to increase parasite destruction, we analyzed cardiopathy and the immune response in chronically infected mice that were challenged with live homologous parasites. Challenge with a single dose of parasite increased CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell populations, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production, and serum-specific IgG levels. However, subpatent parasitemias and cardiac tissue were not affected. Because of the short duration of the immune boost after a single challenge, we next evaluated the impact of four parasite doses, administered 3 weeks apart. At 1 to 2 months after the last dose, the numbers of CD 4 (+) T cells and IFN-gamma-producing CD 4 (+) memory cells and the CD 4 (+) T cell proliferative response to T. cruzi antigen were increased in the spleen. The frequency of IFN-gamma-producing CD 8 (+) memory cells in the blood was also increased. However, the sustained challenge did not favor TH 1 development; rather, it induced an increase in serum-specific IgG 1 levels and mixed TH 1 /TH 2 cytokine production. Moreover, there were no significant changes in cardiac lesions and subpatent parasitemias. In conclusion, we believe that this study may help in elucidating the necessary elements for a successful therapeutic vaccine which may reduce cardiomyopathy in chronically infected human patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{anti-hypertensive}} drug captopril is used commonly {{to reduce}} blood pressure {{of patients with}} severe forms of Chagas disease, a cardiomyopathy caused by chronic infection with the intracellular protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Captopril acts by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the vasopressor metallopeptidase that generates angiotensin II and promotes the degradation of bradykinin (BK). Recent studies in mice models of Chagas disease indicated that captopril can potentiate the T helper type 1 (Th 1) -directing natural adjuvant property of BK. Equipped with kinin-releasing cysteine proteases, T. cruzi trypomastigotes were shown previously to invade non-professional phagocytic cells, such as human endothelial cells and murine cardiomyocytes, through the signalling of G protein-coupled bradykinin receptors (B 2 KR). Monocytes are also parasitized by T. cruzi and these cells {{are known to be}} important for the host immune response during infection. Here we showed that captopril increases the intensity of T. cruzi infection of human monocytes in vitro. The increased parasitism was accompanied by up-regulated expression of ACE in human monocytes. While T. cruzi infection increased the expression of interleukin (IL) - 10 by monocytes significantly, compared to uninfected cells, T. cruzi infection in association with captopril down-modulated IL- 10 expression by the monocytes. Surprisingly, studies with peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that addition of the ACE inhibitor in association with T. cruzi increased expression of IL- 17 by CD 4 + T cells in a B 2 KR-dependent manner. Collectively, our results suggest that captopril might interfere with <b>hostâparasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> by enhancing infection of monocytes, decreasing the expression of the modulatory cytokine IL- 10, while guiding development of the proinflammatory Th 17 subset...|$|E
40|$|Intense immune {{responses}} are observed during human or experimental infection with the digenetic protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The reasons why such immune {{responses are}} unable to completely eliminate the parasites are unknown. The survival of the parasite leads to a parasite-host equilibrium found during the chronic phase of chagasic infection in most individuals. Parasite persistence is recognized as the most likely cause of the chagasic chronic pathologies. Therefore, a key question in Chagas' disease is to understand how this equilibrium is established and maintained for a long period. Understanding the basis for this equilibrium may lead to new approaches to interventions that could help millions of individuals at risk for infection or who are already infected with T. cruzi. Here, we propose that the phenomenon of immunodominance may be significant in terms of regulating the <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> observed in Chagas' disease. T. cruzi infection restricts the repertoire of specific T cells generating, in some cases, an intense immunodominant phenotype and in others causing a dramatic interference in the response to distinct epitopes. This immune response is sufficiently strong to maintain the host alive during the acute phase carrying them to the chronic phase where transmission usually occurs. At the same time, immunodominance interferes {{with the development of}} a higher and broader immune response that could be able to completely eliminate the parasite. Based on this, we discuss how we can interfere with or take advantage of immunodominance in order to provide an immunotherapeutic alternative for chagasic individuals.

40|$|AbstractThe {{control of}} {{gastrointestinal}} nematodes (GIN) is mainly {{based on the}} use of drugs, grazing management, use of copper oxide wire particles and bioactive forages. Resistance to anthelmintic drugs in small ruminants is documented worldwide. Host genetic resistance to parasites, has been increasingly used as a complementary control strategy, along with the conventional intervention methods mentioned above. Genetic diversity in resistance to GIN has been well studied in experimental and commercial flocks in temperate climates and more developed economies. However, there are very few report outputs from the more extensive low-input/output smallholder systems in developing and emerging countries. Furthermore, results on quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with nematode resistance from various studies have not always been consistent, mainly due to the different nematodes studied, different host breeds, ages, climates, natural infections versus artificial challenges, infection level at sampling periods, among others. The increasing use of genetic markers (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, SNPs) in GWAS or the use of whole genome sequence data and a plethora of analytic methods offer the potential to identify loci or regions associated nematode resistance. Genomic selection as a genome-wide level method overcomes the need to identify candidate genes. Benefits in genomic selection are now being realised in dairy cattle and sheep under commercial settings in the more advanced countries. However, despite the commercial benefits of using these tools, there are practical problems associated with incorporating the use of marker-assisted selection or genomic selection in low-input/output smallholder farming systems breeding schemes. Unlike anthelmintic resistance, there is no empirical evidence suggesting that nematodes will evolve rapidly in response to resistant hosts. The strategy of nematode control has evolved to a more practical manipulation of <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in grazing systems by implementation of various strategies, in which improvement of genetic resistance of small ruminant should be included. Therefore, selection for resistant hosts can be considered as one of the sustainable control strategy, although it will be most effective when used to complement other control strategies such as grazing management and improving efficiency of anthelmintics currently...|$|E
40|$|Chagasic {{cardiopathy}} {{has become}} one of the most frequent causes of heart failure and sudden death, as well as one of the most common causes of cardio-embolic stroke in Latin America. The myocyte response to oxidative stress involves the progression of cellular changes, primarily targeting the mitochondria and modifying therefore the energy supply. In this paper we analysed the effect of the infection of mice with 2 different strains of Trypanosoma cruzi (Tulahuen and SGO Z 12) in the chronic indeterminate stage (75 days post-infection), upon the structure and function of cardiac mitochondria. The structural results showed that 83 % of the mitochondria from the Tulahuen-infected mice presented an increase in their matrix and 91 % of the mitochondria from the SGO Z 12 -infected group showed a reduction in their diameter (P< 0 Â· 05). When the Krebs cycle and mitochondrial respiratory chain functionality was analysed through the measurement of the citrate synthase and complexes I to IV activity, it showed that their activity was altered in all cases in a similar manner in both infected groups. In this paper we have demonstrated that the chronic indeterminate phase is not âsilentâ and that cardiac mitochondria are clearly involved in the genesis and progression to the chronic chagasic cardiopathy when different factors alter the <b>host-parasite</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Fil: Baez, Alejandra Lidia.
