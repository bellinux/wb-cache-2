5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran {{through the middle of}} Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the Maumee River, and possibly even of the Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.|$|E
5|$|In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989), the {{plaintiff}} {{argued that the}} 1989 amendments to the Constitution had violated the basic features of the Constitution by breaching the principle of separation of powers by usurping judicial power, and contravening the rule of law. The Court rejected {{the application of the}} basic features doctrine owing to the differences in the making of the Singapore Constitution and the Indian Constitution, {{and the fact that the}} <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for limitations to be placed on Parliament's power of amendment. The Court also held that, in any case, there had been no violation of the Constitution's basic features on the facts of the case. On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the case on other grounds, and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the basic features doctrine applies in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Freedom {{is covered}} in Articles 19-22, with the view of guaranteeing {{individual}} rights that were considered vital by the <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, and these Articles also include certain restrictions that may be imposed by the State on individual liberty under specified conditions. Article 19 guarantees six freedoms {{in the nature of}} civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted, and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences, and defamation. The State is also empowered, {{in the interests of the}} general public to nationalise any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one site on the Potomac River near Georgetown; and another site on the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a site on the Delaware River near Germantown, Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and the subject was deferred until the second session.|$|E

5|$|On October 15, 1937, Danville {{resident}} Emma Weisiger {{donated the}} land that comprises Constitution Square Historic Site to the Commonwealth of Kentucky in memory of her brother, John. The state made the land into a state park; it was originally called Old Public Square, then Constitutional Square. Using a combination {{of state and local}} funds, the Danville Chamber of Commerce and the local chapter of the American Legion began constructing replicas of the jail, courthouse, and meetinghouse that originally occupied the square. At the time of the park's dedication on April 20, 1942, it was dubbed the John G. Weisiger Memorial State Park. Later, the name was changed to Constitution Square State Shrine. At the time of the dedication ceremony, all non-essential construction projects in the U.S. had been halted by the War Production Board due to the country's entry into World War II, and renovations to the park's attractions had consequently ceased. Dedication speeches by Governor Keen Johnson and Centre College president Robert L. McLeod, Jr. contained reminders of the ongoing war and praise for the ideals of democracy. In addition, a plaque honoring the <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Kentucky Constitution was dedicated by Louisville judge Lafon Allen and unveiled by Johnson's daughter, Judith, and Louise McDowell, a descendent of Judge Samuel McDowell, who presided over all ten constitutional conventions {{that took place in the}} original Constitution Square courthouse.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{held that}} the Corporations power did not enable the Parliament to make a valid law {{controlling}} the intra-State trading operations of foreign, trading or financial corporations. In giving their reasons, {{each member of the}} Court {{held that the}} corporations power does not confer on the Commonwealth Parliament power to create corporations. While four of the judges agreed as to the outcome, there was no majority view of the meaning of the corporation power. As all five members of the Court had been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and are properly seen as among the <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, these differences of opinion deny that there was then any settled understanding, accepted by these <b>framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, of what meaning or effect was to be given to the corporations power. Three of the judges, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, relied upon the doctrine of reserved powers, holding that intra-State trading activities were reserved to the States. The importance of the reserved powers doctrine does not however explain all aspects of the differences in opinion about the ambit of the corporations power, in particular the distinction between regulating a corporations relations with outside parties and regulating the internal affairs of a corporation.|$|E

40|$|The {{representative}} fiction. Political representation between {{old order}} and modernity In this article some connections are explored in Dutch thinking on political representation between <b>the</b> old order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Republic and post-revolutionary modernity. Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp, <b>the</b> <b>framer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch constitution <b>of</b> 1814, {{has been dubbed}} — with almost equal justification — an enlightened conservative and the Netherlands’ first liberal. He tried {{to come to terms}} with <b>the</b> innovations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolution, whilst at the same time attempting to preserve much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Constitution (even if only in name). This required some inspired constitutional juggling. Hogendorp’s formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> representative principle in 1814 is presented as a conscious attempt to connect <b>the</b> ‘representative fiction’ <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Constitution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic, as it had been conceptualised since the Dutch Revolt, with <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> representation laid down in the various Batavian constitutions (and constitutional projects) since 1795. In more general terms it is suggested that <b>the</b> professed antimodernity <b>of</b> much Restoration thinking was intimately linked to revolutionary modernity and in itself hardly less modern. Thus many anti-modernists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Restoration were paradoxically exemplifying both the great breach and <b>the</b> underlying continuities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary era. </p...|$|R

He rejected Rehnquist's assertion that discrimination based on municipal residence could not escape scrutiny under the Privileges and Immunities Clause because both in-state and out-of-state citizens could be equally harmed by such protectionist legislation. He also wrote that the Clause was never intended by the <b>Framers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution to reach this type of discrimination by municipalities. Finally, he believed that out-of-state residents could benefit indirectly from the political action of in-state residents' opposition to such discriminatory measures by municipalities because some states (California and Georgia) had already passed laws prohibiting exactly the type of protectionist ordinances {{as the one in}} this case.|$|E
25|$|Rep. John Bingham, <b>the</b> {{principal}} <b>framer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment, advocated {{that the}} Fourteenth applied {{the first eight}} Amendments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bill <b>of</b> Rights to <b>the</b> States. The U.S. Supreme Court subsequently declined to interpret it that way, despite the dissenting argument in <b>the</b> 1947 case <b>of</b> Adamson v. California by Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black that the framers' intent should control <b>the</b> Court's interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment (he included a lengthy appendix that quoted extensively from Bingham's congressional testimony). Although the Adamson Court declined to adopt Black's interpretation, the Court during the following twenty-five years employed a doctrine of selective incorporation that succeeded in extending to the States almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protections in <b>the</b> Bill <b>of</b> Rights, as well as other, unenumerated rights. <b>The</b> Bill <b>of</b> Rights thus imposes legal limits on <b>the</b> powers <b>of</b> governments and acts as an anti-majoritarian/minoritarian safeguard by providing deeply entrenched legal protection for various civil liberties and fundamental rights. The Supreme Court for example concluded in the West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) case that the founders intended <b>the</b> Bill <b>of</b> Rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities, ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities. As the Court noted <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bill <b>of</b> Rights “was to withdraw certain subjects from <b>the</b> vicissitudes <b>of</b> political controversy, to place them beyond <b>the</b> reach <b>of</b> majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.” This is why “fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> no elections.” <b>The</b> 14th Amendment has vastly expanded civil rights protections and is cited in more litigation than any other amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|R
