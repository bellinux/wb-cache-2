5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} offer as {{he felt that the}} audience would not want to see him as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E
5|$|His {{success in}} Gruban v Booth allowed Hastings to switch his {{practice}} {{from the county}} courts to the High Court, and {{at the beginning of}} Hilary term 1919 he applied to become a King's Counsel (KC). Becoming a KC was a risk; he would go from competing with other junior barristers to coming up against the finest minds in the profession. Despite this <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the risk, and he was accepted later that year.|$|E
5|$|In March 1915, Ball began a {{short-lived}} engagement to Dot Allbourne (or Ellbourne), {{though he was}} still interested in other girls such as Thelma Starr. In June, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> private flying lessons at Hendon Aerodrome, which would give him an outlet for his interest in engineering and possibly help him to see action in France sooner.

5|$|On December 21, 1918, Baker {{received}} {{orders to}} return to the United States. Reluctant to leave France and return to his life in America, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a final flight at his squadron's airfield in Toul. As he went for his own plane, the mechanic brought out a recently repaired one instead, in need of a test flight. The other pilots remonstrated with Baker, but he maintained that as commanding officer he could not let anyone else test the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|He won a {{government}} {{scholarship to the}} University of Melbourne and Queen's College, a university residential college. Woodruff studied electrical engineering and mathematics, receiving some instruction from the influential physicist Harrie Massey, then a tutor. Despite success in engineering, Woodruff {{decided that he would}} have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia because of the Great Depression. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up medical studies {{at the end of his}} third year of undergraduate study, but his parents wanted him to finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours.

5|$|In 1996 John Sykes {{decided to}} reactivate Thin Lizzy, {{presenting}} the band {{as a tribute}} to Phil Lynott's life and work. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on the role of lead vocals himself in the absence of Lynott, and persuaded Scott Gorham, Brian Downey and Darren Wharton to return to the fold. To complete the line-up, Marco Mendoza continued in Lynott's role as bass player. They received criticism for using the Thin Lizzy name without Lynott being present, but the band only played hits from Thin Lizzy's back catalogue, and did not compose any new material.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Roberts {{stunned the}} racing world {{when he left}} Yamaha after more than 25 years {{to start his own}} {{motorcycle}} company. Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England {{to take advantage of the}} Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility and handling advantage of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time the motorcycle had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any advantage over four-cylinder bikes had been negated. The motorcycle did manage to win a pole position with rider Jeremy McWilliams taking the top qualifying position at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix against the new breed of 990cc four-stroke MotoGP motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{returned}} to Dublin in mid-1909 with George, {{to visit his}} father and work on getting Dubliners published. He visited Nora's family in Galway and liked Nora's mother very much. While preparing to return to Trieste <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> one of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time {{as a representative of}} some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the Volta Cinematograph, which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He {{returned to}} Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow. Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent {{the rest of her life}} on the continent, eventually marrying Czech bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{continued}} {{to expand his}} practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. Macdonald became both a director of and {{a lawyer for the}} new Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto. Meanwhile, he was suffering from some illness, and in 1841, his father died. Sick and grieving, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842. He left for the journey well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling at the card game loo and winning substantially. Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, Isabella Clark. As Macdonald did not mention her in his letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known. In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister. The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843.|$|E

5|$|The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed {{their enemy}} {{to have the}} {{battlefield}} of his choosing. Even then they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage. Khalid knew all along that he was up against a force superior in numbers and, until {{the last day of}} the battle, he conducted an essentially defensive campaign suited to his relatively limited resources. When <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the offensive and attack on the final day of battle, he did so with a degree of imagination, foresight and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display. Although he commanded a numerically inferior force and needed all the men he could muster, he nevertheless had the confidence and foresight to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat he anticipated for the enemy army.|$|E
5|$|Warwick {{had planned}} for Edward {{to marry a}} French princess—Bona of Savoy—to create an {{alliance}} between the two countries. The young king, however, favoured ties with Burgundy and, in 1464, further angered the Earl by secretly marrying Elizabeth Woodville; as an impoverished Lancastrian widow, she was regarded by the Yorkists as an unsuitable queen. Edward bestowed gifts of land and titles on her relations and arranged their marriages to rich and powerful families. Eligible bachelors were paired with the Woodville females, narrowing the marriage prospects for Warwick's daughters. Furthermore, the Earl was offended by two matches involving his kin. The first was the marriage of his aunt, Lady Katherine Neville, over 60years old, to Elizabeth's 20-year-old brother, John Woodville, a pairing considered outside of normal wedlock by many people. The other was his nephew's fiancée, the daughter of Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, who was taken as a bride by the Queen's son, Thomas Grey, with Edward's approval. Exasperated by these acts, Warwick decided the Woodvilles were a malignant influence on his liege. He felt marginalized: his influence over the young king was failing, and <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> drastic action to force Edward's compliance. Warwick's alternative plan was to replace the King with his fellow conspirator, the Duke of Clarence, Edward's younger brother.|$|E
