HexA groups contribute significantly to the total content of carboxyl groups, and their degradation during chlorine dioxide bleaching is reflected by a decrease of the carboxyl content.

Aiming at promoting higher brightness stability, a partially <b>bleached</b> Eucalyptus globulus <b>pulp</b> (DED) of c. 88 % ISO brightness was involved in a study of a final enzymatic stage (X) alternative to conventional chlorine dioxide (D) and hydrogen peroxide (P) bleaching stages (DEDX vs. DEDD and DEDX vs. DEDP). X stage was also applied before and after the final P or D stages (DEDDX/DEDXD and DEDPX/DEDXP) to produce high brightness pulps (c. 91 %). RESULTSX stage with xylanase Pulpzyme HC allowed an increase of c. 1. 5 % in pulp brightness while decreasing the brightness reversion and a concomitant pulp yield loss of only 0. 5 %.

The oxidizing rates of BPFs, SPFs, and CPFs were different. These differences {{could be attributed}} to crystallinity. Crystallinity affected microstructures, chemical process, and the efficiency of ultrasonication. Crystallinity also shaped the nanocrystals, since nanocrystals consist of the residual crystalline regions after chemical oxidation and ultrasonication.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hardwood}} admixture (15 - 25 % birch or aspen) in kraft cooking {{on the strength}} properties of the <b>fully</b> <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> was investigated. Results obtained from both lab- and mill-processed ECF bleached pulps showed that adding 15 - 25 % birch or aspen {{to the production of}} fully bleached softwood kraft pulp had a minor effect on the strength properties. No significant effect was observed for the hardwood admixture on the apparent density over a wide range of breaking length. Under the conditions studied, the results showed that pulping of mixed softwood/hardwood chips (chip blending) resulted in overall better strength properties than the pulp blending at a given freeness. It was hypothesized that the softwood fibers would be cooked to a higher kappa number in the cooking of mixed softwood/hardwood chips for the same target kappa number, thus having higher fiber strength due to higher pulp viscosity and preservation of the hemicellulose. This was supported by the results from zero-span tensile strength of the long fiber fraction of the samples from chip blending and pulp blending. The implication is that some softwood kraft pulp mills can add up to 25 % of hardwood chips to the kraft cooking of softwood chips without significantly affecting the overall pulp strength properties...|$|E
40|$|During kraft cooking a {{significant}} part of the wood material, especially lignin and hemicelluloses, is degraded and dissolved in the cooking liquor, rendering a broad range of degradation products with different molecular mass and functional groups. The main part of this thesis has been devoted to clarify the role of these dissolved wood components (DWC) during kraft cooking. The investigations have covered their influence on e. g. the delignification rate, pulp yield, point of defibration, unbleached pulp c olour and pulp bleachability, i. e. the amount of bleaching chemicals consumed per kappa number or lignin unit to reach a certain brightness. Both softwood (Picea Abies) and hardwood (Eucalyptus urograndis) have been studied. During kraft cooking, many reactions occur simultaneously. Therefore emphasis has been put on separating the effects of hydroxide ions, hydrogen sulphide ions, sodium ions and DWC. This has been enabled by the use of a so called constant-composition-cooking technique, which enables the use of almost constant concentrations of the cooking chemicals during the cook and also results in a very low concentration of DWC in the cooking liquor. The presence of DWC has been controlled by the addition of industrial black liquor. To further scrutinise the role of DWC, the effect of different molecular mass fractions were studied and representative model substances were used to clarify the origin of the observed effects. A kinetic study showed that the delignification rate was significantly affected by the presence of DWC in the cooking liquor and resulted in a rate increase in the part of the cook where the bulk phase dominates and a decreased delignification rate when the residual phase dominates. The increase in delignification rate was dependent on the concentration of DWC and was observed in softwood as well as hardwood kraft cooks. The rate increasing effect was investigated further by the use of ultra- and nanofiltra tion. This way the DWC was divided into fractions with different molecular mass distributions. The results showed that the increase in delignification rate related more strongly to the content of free phenolic groups in the DWC than on the total amount of DWC. By cooking in the presence of representative model substances the effect was further clarified. Aromatic structures with free phenolic groups gave a rate increasing effect while no visible effect could be seen from other structures. This supports the finding that the delignification rate relates to the amount of free phenols in the cooking liquor and shows that the phenolic functionality take active part in the delignification reactions. Free phenolic groups in the degraded lignin may explain a large part of the rate increasing effect seen from the presence of DWC. Further, the presence of DWC increased the point of defibration in a eucalyptus kraft cook and made it possible to terminate the cook at a higher kappa number with the same amount of reject. By terminating the cook at a higher kappa number it was possible to noticeably increase the <b>fully</b> <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> yield. The content of hexenuronic acids (HexA) in the eucalyptus pulp depends on the H-factor and increases with delignification, providing that the bulk phase still dominates. Therefore, by increasing the rat e of delignification and terminating the cook at a higher kappa number it was possible to significantly decrease the amount of HexA in the pulp. The presence of DWC causes a darkening of the unbleached pulp. Bleachability in a D(EOP) DD sequence was negatively affected by the presence of DWC during pulping of softwood, while no effect was seen on the bleachability of hardwoodQC 2010092...|$|E
40|$|The modern pulp {{industry}} has endeavoured to maximize its efficiency and minimize its environmental impact for decades.

The polyelectrolytes used were a polyamideamine epichlorohydrine condensate (PAE), traditionally used as a wet-strength additive, and carboxymethylcellulose. Since the complexes prepared from these chemicals bear an anionic charge, they can only be used after fibre pre-treatment with the cationic PAE. Results indicate that the addition of 2 % PAE and 2 % PEC can improve all the measured tensile strength properties of the sheets as much as is commonly achieved by mechanically beating the pulps. In fact, for the chemical pulps, PEC addition at the chosen level produced better results than did traditional beating, since the improved tensile index and tensile energy absorption could be achieved without any significant deterioration in the light scattering coefficient of the papers produced. However, with the BCTMP {{a significant decrease in}} light scattering could be detected, especially following the addition of PEC. Adding the chemicals (especially the PEC) increased the sheet density, so chemical treatment left the bending stiffness of the sheets unaffected.

The study was conducted as a function of pH (2 - 7), and both in the absence and presence of an excess of Na+ ions, 0 - 100 mM Na(Cl). For both fibre materials, adsorption data collected in the absence of Na+ were fully explained by the unspecific Donnan ion-exchange model. However, in an excess of Na(Cl), data clearly indicated that higher amounts of divalent metal ions adsorbed, than predicted by the Donnan model. Therefore, to model these data, specific metal ion-fibre surface complexes were assumed to form, in addition to the Donnan ion-exchange. A neutral surface species involving two Surface carboxylate groups and one metal ion was, for both metal ions, found to yield a good description of data at all ionic strengths. In the case of Cu 2 + the existence of this complex was corroborated by Cu K-edge EXAFS data, suggesting that copper ions interacts directly with carboxyl groups present int the fibres.

The hemicellulose extracted from B-HWP was relatively pure with zero percent lignin and 89. 5 % xylose content whereas the partially delignified SWG hemicellulose contained about 6 - 3 % lignin and 72 – 82 % xylose, depending on the NaOH concentration during extraction (3 – 17 % NaOH solution). A maximum molecular weight of SWG hemicellulose of 64, 300 g/mol was achieved for the 10 % NaOH solution extraction, whereas the MW of B-HWP hemicellulose at 10 % NaOH solution extraction was lower at 49, 200 g/mol.

40|$|The {{climate change}} {{on our planet}} {{is an issue of}} great concern. The dignity of this issue was {{confirmed}} by the award of the international panel of climate change (IPCC) the Nobel peace prize. This problem arises from the way that we live our lives, how we produce energy, materials and chemicals from a fossil source. One solution to the problem is to more efficiently utilize the enormous source of biomass that is produced annually. Wood has traditionally been used as timber and as a raw material for pulp and paper production. In traditional pulping, lignin and heteropolysaccharides, so called hemicelluloses, are degraded, which is unfortunate since it is possible to use these polymers to create new renewable products. In order to increase the utilization of biomass, new innovative methods for the isolation and fractionation of wood components must be developed through better knowledge of wood polymer interactions, both chemically and physically. 	The aim of this thesis was to isolate hemicellulose by mild conditions from birch and to study their assembly characteristics in both aqueous solutions and at cellulosic surfaces. The isolation of xylan, the main hemicellulose in hardwood, was optimized with regard to prehydrolysis conditions. The prehydrolysis was followed by a mild alkaline extraction. The best prehydrolysis conditions with regard to xylan yield, molecular weight and lowest weight loss (i. e. preservation of wood mass for subsequent pulp production) were achieved at 0. 01 M acetic acid, 140 °C, for 1 h. This fraction was composed mainly of glucuronoxylan but also of considerable amounts of lignin (12 %). This fraction and other extracts (other prehydrolysis conditions) readsorbed onto <b>fully</b> <b>bleached</b> <b>pulps</b> to different extents (5 - 25 %) depending on their composition and solubility. It was concluded that the adsorbed material consisted of more lignin and less glucuronic acid than the fraction in total. A lignin extraction was therefore performed to study the influence of lignin on agglomeration and adsorption. In total, 75 % of the lignin was removed; this lignin (L) was essentially water soluble in the presence of xylan (X) (i. e. in form of the XL complex), but not on its own. This behavior suggests that xylan is capable of forming inclusion complexes with lignin that result in lignin solubility in water and that are based on secondary rather than primary (covalent) bonds. This was also seen in terms of agglomeration in aqueous solutions, where the amounts and size of agglomerates decreased by the removal of lignin. Finally, the tendency for adsorption onto model cellulose surfaces for xylan fractions containing different amounts of lignin was analyzed, and it was observed that lignin enhanced the adsorption process. This work contributes to knowledge about glucuronoxylan and its interaction with lignin in aqueous solutions and their combined adsorption onto cellulosic surfaces. My intention is that this work will lead {{to the development of a}} novel pulping process that better utilizes wood. I also believe that my work can act as a new platform for an understanding of the agglomeration and adsorption mechanisms of glucuronoxylan.

The <b>pulps</b> were <b>bleached</b> to 90 ± 1 using delignification oxygen and D 0 E OP D 1 <b>bleaching</b> sequence. <b>Bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> of low basic density clone showed, significantly, lowest revolutions number in the PFI mill to reach tensile index of 70 N. m/g, low Schopper Riegler degree and generated sheets with higher values to bulk and opacity. These characteristics and properties allow concluding that <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> of low basic density clone was the most indicated to produce printing and writing sheets. The <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> of high basic density clone showed higher values of bulk and capillarity Klemm and lower water retention value when analyzed without beating. The <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> of high basic density clone showed more favorable characteristics to the production of tissue papers. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{peroxide}} bleaching of {{high yield}} pulps from wood with Mg(OH) 2 {{has been developing}} recently in the pulp and paper industry. However, {{there is still a}} lack of data on the application of Mg(OH) 2 in peroxide bleaching of non-wood fibres. In this work, our purpose was to study the effect of Mg(OH) 2 on peroxide bleaching of wheat straw soda-AQ pulp. The results showed that Mg(OH) 2 significantly improved peroxide bleaching efficiency (expressed as the ratio between the brightness gain and the H 2 O 2 consumption) and selectivity (expressed as the ratio between the brightness gain and the viscosity losses) of wheat straw soda-AQ pulp. The brightness, viscosity, and yield of <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> can be significantly enhanced by increasing the replacement ratio of Mg(OH) 2. However, at 100 % replacement of NaOH with Mg(OH) 2, the brightness of <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> was much lower than that of the <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> with NaOH as the sole alkaline source. When 24 to 73 % of the NaOH was replaced with Mg(OH) 2, the COD of the bleaching filtrate was 11 to 38 % lower than that of the NaOH as the sole alkaline source. The lower solubility and alkalinity of Mg(OH) 2, as well as the reduction of Cu ion content in <b>bleached</b> <b>pulp</b> were proposed as accounting for the favorable effect of Mg(OH) 2 on peroxide bleaching of wheat straw soda-AQ pulp...|$|R
