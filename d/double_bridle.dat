5|$|Campaign school, Campagneschule or Campagne, {{where the}} horse learns {{collection}} and balance through all gaits, turns and maneuvers. The horse learns to shorten and lengthen his stride, perform lateral movements to the side, and is {{introduced to the}} more complex <b>double</b> <b>bridle.</b> This is the longest training phase and may take several years.|$|E
5|$|In classes where {{horses are}} {{turned out in}} saddle seat equipment, it is typical for the horse to be shown in a single curb bit with a bit shank under , rather than the <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> more common to other saddle seat breeds. Riders wear typical saddle seat attire. Hats are not always mandatory, but use of safety helmets is allowed and ranges from {{strongly}} encouraged to required in some pleasure division classes.|$|E
25|$|A type of bridle {{that carries}} two bits, a bradoon and a curb, and is ridden with {{two sets of}} reins is called a Weymouth or <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> after the {{customary}} use of the Weymouth-style curb bit in a <b>double</b> <b>bridle.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>bridles</b> are {{a type of}} English bridle {{that use}} two bits in the mouth at once, a snaffle and a curb. The two bits allow the rider to have very precise control of the horse. As a rule, only very {{advanced}} horses and riders use <b>double</b> <b>bridles.</b> <b>Double</b> <b>bridles</b> are usually seen in the top levels of dressage, but also are seen in certain types of show hack and Saddle seat competition.|$|R
5000|$|Double bridle: Also {{called a}} Weymouth <b>bridle,</b> <b>double</b> <b>bridles</b> use two bits at once, a small snaffle called a bradoon and a curb or Weymouth bit, and {{require the use}} of two sets of reins. <b>Double</b> <b>bridles</b> are usually only seen used in upper level dressage, in Saddle seat riding, and for showing in certain other events that require formal attire and equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The young stallions are not {{exhibited}} in the same equipment as the more mature animals. They are ridden in a plain snaffle bridle and a simple dressage-style English saddle. For training sessions, black bridles, both snaffle bit <b>bridles</b> and <b>double</b> <b>bridles,</b> are used for all horses.|$|R
25|$|At {{the lower}} levels of dressage, a bridle {{includes}} a plain cavesson, drop noseband, or flash noseband. Currently, drop nosebands are relatively uncommon, with the flash more common. At the upper levels a plain cavesson is used on a <b>double</b> <b>bridle.</b> Figure-eight (also called Grackle) nosebands are not allowed in pure dressage, however they are allowed in the dressage phase of eventing. Riders are not allowed to use Kineton nosebands, due to their severity. Beads and colored trim are permitted along the brow band of the bridle.|$|E
25|$|The {{dressage}} horse {{at lower}} levels is only permitted to be shown at recognized competitions in a snaffle bit, though the detail regarding bitting varies slightly from organization to organization. The loose-ring snaffle with a single- or double-joint is most commonly seen. Harsher snaffle bits, such as twisted wire, corkscrews, slow-twists, and waterfords are not permitted, nor are pelhams, kimberwickes, or gag bits. Upper level and FEI dressage horses are shown in a <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> using both a bradoon and a curb bit with a smooth curb chain.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a variety}} of {{headgear}} used to control horses, predominantly bridles with assorted designs of bits. [...] Many of the bits used during the Middle Ages resemble the bradoon, snaffle bit and curb bit that are still in common use today. [...] However, they often were decorated to a greater degree: [...] the bit rings or shanks were frequently covered with large, ornamental [...] "bosses." [...] Some designs were also more extreme and severe than those used today.The curb bit was known during the classical period, but was not generally used during the Middle Ages until the mid-14th century. [...] Some styles of snaffle bit used during the Middle Ages had the lower cheek extended, {{in the manner of}} the modern half-cheek or full cheek snaffle. Until the late 13th century, bridles generally had a single pair of reins; after this period it became more common for knights to use two sets of reins, {{similar to that of the}} modern <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> and often at least one set was decorated.|$|E
5000|$|Riding {{horses are}} shown in brown tack, with a {{coloured}} browband. <b>Double</b> <b>bridles</b> or pelham bits are used. Saddles should be straight-cut {{to show off the}} animal's shoulder. (This style is called an [...] "English showing saddle" [...] in some places, to distinguish it from both the [...] "Forward Seat" [...] and the [...] "Dressage" [...] saddle). Manes should be plaited, tails pulled and legs and faces trimmed.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>bridles</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} associated with dressage and certain horse show classes where formal tack, attire and turnout is standard. They are required for upper level FEI dressage tests (Prix St. Georges (PSG), Intermediare, and Grand Prix), and are optional at the USDF third and fourth level. They are also permitted in the dressage phase of eventing at the Intermediate or Advanced levels, although not required. (In eventing, even at the advanced level, snaffle bridles are still the norm.) ...|$|R
2500|$|To {{allow for}} {{communication}} with the horse even with a loose rein, the bridle also evolved. [...] The biggest difference between [...] "English" [...] and [...] "Western" [...] bridles is the bit. [...] Most finished [...] "Western" [...] horses are expected to eventually perform in a curb bit with {{a single pair of}} reins that has somewhat longer and looser shanks than the curb of an English <b>Double</b> <b>bridle</b> or a pelham bit. Two styles of Western reins developed: [...] The long split reins of the Texas tradition, which are completely separated, or the closed-end [...] "Romal" [...] reins of the California tradition, which have a long single attachment on the ends that {{can be used as a}} quirt. [...] Young horses are usually [...] started under saddle with either a simple snaffle bit, or with the classic tool of the vaquero, the bosal-style hackamore.|$|E
2500|$|Some bits combine both direct {{pressure}} and leverage, {{the most common}} examples being the Pelham bit, which has shanks and rings allowing both direct and leverage pressure on a single bit and is ridden with four reins; the Kimblewick or Kimberwicke, a hybrid bit that uses minimal leverage on a modified snaffle-type ring combined with a mouthpiece that is usually seen more often on curb bits, ridden with two reins; and the <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> which places a curb and a snaffle bit simultaneously in the horse's mouth so that each may act independently of the other, ridden with four reins. [...] Another bit that combines direct {{pressure and}} leverage in a unique manner is the Gag bit, a bit derived from the snaffle that, instead of having a rein attached to the mouthpiece, runs the rein {{through a set of}} rings that attach directly to the headstall, creating extra pressure on the lips and poll when applied. [...] Usually used for correction of specific problems, the gag bit is generally illegal in the show ring and racecourse.|$|E
50|$|A type of bridle {{that carries}} two bits, a bradoon and a curb, and is ridden with {{two sets of}} reins is called a Weymouth or <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> after the {{customary}} use of the Weymouth-style curb bit in a <b>double</b> <b>bridle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The main use of {{the curb}} chain is to enhance and control the lever action of a curb bit. Additionally, it helps to keep the bit steady and in place within the mouth. On English Pelham and <b>Double</b> <b>bridles</b> the curb chin is {{attached}} by a ring ("fly link" [...] (UK)) to a lip strap, which helps keep the lip strap in place while the lip strap in turn prevents the curb chain from being lost if it becomes unhooked.|$|R
5000|$|During performances, {{the fully}} trained stallions wear a {{traditional}} gold-plated breastplate and crupper, called a Goldzeug. They also carry a [...] "school saddle", {{which is made}} from buckskin and larger than the more commonly seen English saddle used by the school when training the stallions and riders. Gold-plated <b>double</b> <b>bridles</b> are only used for performances. All horses, except the young stallions, wear red and gold or green and gold shabracks, or saddlecloths, under the saddle. Red is for [...] "All Steps and Movements of the High School", [...] "Pas de Deux", [...] "On the Long Rein", [...] "The Grand Solo" [...] and [...] "The School quadrille." [...] Green is used for [...] "Work In-Hand" [...] and the [...] "Airs above the Ground". The shabrack {{is also used to}} differentiate the status of each rider: the director of the school has three gold bands and gold fringe, the chief riders have three bands and no fringe, riders have two bands, and assistant riders have one.|$|R

5000|$|The pelham bit {{has several}} uses. In the English riding disciplines, {{it is used}} {{in place of a}} <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> when it is {{desirable}} to have double reins but not two bits. The pelham bit is also used for polo, when the action of a <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> is desired, but the rider's ability to make rein adjustments is limited.In training, a pelham bit sometimes is used in both English and western disciplines to transition a horse from a snaffle bit to a curb bit or <b>double</b> <b>bridle.</b>|$|E

50|$|Riders must be skilled before {{attempting}} {{to use the}} <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> and the horse should be far enough along in his training that the <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> would be accepted and understood. It is a refined piece of equipment that can greatly enhance the riding in good hands, or destroy the animal's training and mouth. Because it uses two bits, it has a much greater chance of damaging the horse's mouth if used incorrectly.|$|E

50|$|Double bridles {{are rarely}} used by show jumping riders and eventers {{in the stadium}} and {{cross-country}} phases. The <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> is still sometimes used by cavalry and police horses.|$|E
50|$|The saddle seat horse {{traditionally}} wears a <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> (full bridle), {{with both}} a curb bit and a bradoon. A pelham bit is also legal for pleasure classes, though not common. The <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> is preferred (and mandatory in most equitation classes) because it allows more fine-tuning of the horse's head and neck position, though a pelham {{can be used in}} a few specialized classes such as Saddlebred Pleasure Equitation. A single curb bit is used for gaited horses such as the Tennessee Walker and Missouri Fox Trotter. The shanks of the curb bit are often longer than those found on the Weymouth style <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> used in dressage, often 7 inches in overall length (some breeds have length limits in the rules). The browband is commonly brightly colored leather or vinyl, red being the most common color. The cavesson is sometimes plain leather, and sometimes colored to match the browband, depending on breed and fashion trends in tack.|$|E
50|$|Bridles are {{plain and}} workmanlike, without {{coloured}} browbands or embellishments. A <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> or a pelham bit {{is used in}} open classes, while a snaffle bit is used in novice classes.|$|E
50|$|Weymouth or Weymouth curb: {{commonly}} used in a <b>double</b> <b>bridle.</b> It is an English style with a straight shank. The mouthpiece {{can be one of}} numerous styles, but usually it is solid, with a low port.|$|E
50|$|Novice ponies and ponies {{for young}} {{children}} must be shown in simple snaffle bridles, and non-novice working hunter and heritage ponies for older children may be shown in any suitable bridle, though a <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> or a pelham bit is most often used. A Rugby pelham, which, with its separate loose rings imitating the <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> is preferred by many as it removes the necessity for a pony to have two bits in its mouth. In the working hunter and non-jumping hunter pony classes it is considered more 'correct' for ponies to be shown in plain leather 'hunt type' bridles, while fancy browbands are used in children's riding pony classes.|$|E
50|$|Riders were {{required}} to wear informal uniform if they were military officers, or black or pink coats with silk hats if they were civilians. Horses had to be ridden in a <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> and martingales and bearing reins were prohibited.|$|E
50|$|While the snaffle bridle is more common, the <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> in {{the hands}} of an {{experienced}} rider, is able to transmit more nuanced commands and obtain more sophisticated responses from the horse. Thus, for advanced forms of riding, it is preferred.|$|E
50|$|The rider {{must have}} an {{independent}} seat and soft hands. Additionally, {{they should be able}} to keep their horse moving uphill with elevated shoulders, or else activating the curb will cause him to hollow, fall onto the forehand, and flex incorrectly at the 3rd vertebra rather than the poll. The rider must also take care to determine if a <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> is proper for the individual horse's training and temperament. Certain sensitive horses will do better if kept in a snaffle for a longer period of time. Horses that tend to be lazy or behind their rider's leg will also become more so if ridden in <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> before they are consistently forward.|$|E
50|$|If {{a running}} {{martingale}} is {{used with a}} <b>double</b> <b>bridle,</b> only the snaffle reins should run through the rings. Running curb reins through the martingale creates excessive amounts of leverage and can cause pain to the horse if misused. While fox hunters once were known to ride with a running martingale attached to the curb rein, today this practice is relatively non-existent, partly because the <b>double</b> <b>bridle</b> is only common in equestrian disciplines that usually do not use a running martingale. However, if a running martingale is used on the curb, however ill-advised, it is extremely important to use rein stops, as the martingale ring is sometimes larger than the ring on the curb bit shank, and can get caught on the bit with potentially disastrous consequences.|$|E
