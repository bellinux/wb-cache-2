25|$|A termite-bored didgeridoo has an {{irregular}} shape that, overall, usually increases in diameter towards the lower end. This shape means that its resonances occur at frequencies {{that are not}} harmonically spaced in frequency. This contrasts with the harmonic spacing of the resonances in a cylindrical plastic pipe, whose resonant frequencies fall in the ratio 1:3:5 etc. The second resonance of a didgeridoo (the note sounded by overblowing) is usually around an 11th higher than the fundamental frequency (a <b>frequency</b> <b>ratio</b> somewhat less than 3:1).|$|E
25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the {{analysis}} of pitch is primarily controlled by the right temporal region of the brain. The right secondary auditory cortex processes pitch change and manipulation of fine tunes; specifically, this region distinguishes the multiple pitches that characterize melodic tunes as contour (pitch direction) and interval (<b>frequency</b> <b>ratio</b> between successive notes) information. The right superior temporal gyrus recruits and evaluates contour information, while both right and left temporal regions recruit and evaluate interval information. In addition, the right anterolateral part of Heschl's gyrus (primary auditory cortex) is also concerned with processing pitch information.|$|E

50|$|In {{the years}} that followed, the <b>frequency</b> <b>ratios</b> of these {{intervals}} on keyboards and other fixed-tuning instruments would change slightly as different systems of tuning, such as meantone temperament, well temperament, and equal temperament were developed.|$|R
25|$|Perfect fifths may be justly tuned or tempered. Two notes whose {{frequencies}} {{differ by}} {{a ratio of}} 3:2 make the interval known as a justly tuned perfect fifth. Cascading twelve such fifths does {{not return to the}} original pitch class after going round the circle, so the 3:2 ratio may be slightly detuned, or tempered. Temperament allows perfect fifths to cycle, and allows pieces to be transposed, or played in any key on a piano or other fixed-pitch instrument without distorting their harmony. The primary tuning system used for Western (especially keyboard and fretted) instruments today, twelve-tone equal temperament, uses an irrational multiplier, 21/12, to calculate the frequency difference of a semitone. An equal-tempered fifth, at a <b>frequency</b> <b>ratio</b> of 27/12:1 (or about 1.498307077:1) is approximately two cents narrower than a justly tuned fifth at a ratio of 3:2.|$|E
500|$|Therefore, {{logarithms}} {{can be used}} {{to describe}} the intervals: an interval is measured in semitones by taking the [...] logarithm of the <b>frequency</b> <b>ratio,</b> while the [...] logarithm of the <b>frequency</b> <b>ratio</b> expresses the interval in cents, hundredths of a semitone. The latter is used for finer encoding, as it is needed for non-equal temperaments.|$|E

500|$|Logarithms {{are related}} to musical tones and {{interval}}s. In equal temperament, the <b>frequency</b> <b>ratio</b> depends only on the interval between two tones, not on the specific frequency, or pitch, of the individual tones. For example, the note A has a frequency of 440 Hz and B-flat has a frequency of 466Hz. The interval between A and B-flat is a semitone, as is the one between B-flat and B (frequency 493Hz). Accordingly, the frequency ratios agree: ...|$|E

40|$|The width (W), root mean squared {{amplitude}} (Rs) {{of lower}} and upper kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from accreting neutron stars vary with frequency. Similarly, the QPO frequency {{varies with the}} source count rate (S). Hence, the significance of a QPO, scaling as S x Rs^ 2 /W^(1 / 2) will also depend on frequency. In addition, the significance also scales up with the square root of the integration time of the Fourier power density spectrum (T). Consequently, depending on the way data are considered, kHz QPOs may be detected only over a limited range of their frequency spans or detected predominantly at some frequencies, leading potentially to biases in the observed distributions of <b>frequencies</b> or <b>frequency</b> <b>ratios.</b> Although subject of much controversy, an observed clustering of QPO <b>frequency</b> <b>ratios</b> around 3 / 2 in Sco X- 1, also seen in other sources, has been previously used as an argument supporting resonance based models of neutron star QPOs. In this paper, we measure how the statistical significance of both kHz QPOs vary with frequency for three prototype neutron star kHz QPO sources, namely 4 U 1636 - 536, 4 U 0614 + 091 and Sco X- 1. As the significance of QPO detection depends on frequency, we show that in sensitivity-limited observations (as {{in the case of}} the RXTE/PCA), a simultaneous detection of both the lower and upper kHz QPOs can only be achieved over limited frequency ranges. As a result, even a uniform distribution of QPO frequencies will lead to peaks (in particular around 3 / 2) in the histogram of <b>frequency</b> <b>ratios.</b> This implies that the observed clustering of ratios does not provide any evidence for intrinsically preferred <b>frequency</b> <b>ratios,</b> thus weakening the case for a resonance mechanism at the origin of neutron star kHz QPOs.
