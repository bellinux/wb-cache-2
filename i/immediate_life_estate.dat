50|$|Many jurisdictions {{retain the}} {{possibility}} of creating a <b>life</b> <b>estate,</b> although this is uncommon. In the United States, <b>life</b> <b>estates</b> are most commonly used either to grant someone use of the property {{for the remainder of}} that person's life in a will, or by a grantor to reserve the right to continue using the property {{for the remainder of the}} grantor's life after it is sold. The right to ownership of the property after the death of the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> owner is called the remainder estate. In England and Wales fee simple is the only freehold estate that remains; a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> can only be created in equity and is not a right in property.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> pur autre vie (Law French, [...] "for {{the life}} of another") is held {{for the rest of}} the {{lifetime}} of a person who does not hold the estate. This form of <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> arises where a life tenant has disposed of the property, assuming such a disposal does not trigger any special forfeiture under the life interest instrument. It also arises where the grantor chooses to make the measuring life that of someone other than the life tenant's <b>life.</b> A <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> pur autre vie is most commonly created in one of two circumstances.|$|R

5000|$|Reversions are {{commonly}} created in real property transactions, particularly during lease arrangements {{as well as}} devise (the transfer of real property through a will). In {{the context of a}} will, a testator may devise a simple <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> to a devisee. The testator may retain the reversion in the estate or give it to another individual. The owner of the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> will retain ownership of the property during the devisee's life, and may freely alienate this interest. However, upon the death of the devisee the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> will terminate and ownership of the real-property will fully vest in the holder of the reversion.|$|R
5000|$|A {{land owner}} of an estate cannot give a [...] "greater interest" [...] in the estate than he or she owns. That is, a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> owner cannot give {{complete}} and indefinite ownership (fee simple) to another person because the life tenant's ownership in the property ends when {{the person who is}} the measuring life dies. For instance, if Ashley conveyed to Bob for the life of Bob, and Bob conveys a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> to another person, Charlie, for Charlie's <b>life</b> embedded <b>life</b> <b>estate,</b> then Charlie's <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> interest would last only until Charlie or Bob dies. Charlie's life interest or pur autre vie interest (interest for the life of another, whichever has applied) and most often the remaining rights of ownership in the property (the 'reversionary interest') devolve to the persons {{under the terms of the}} will/rules of intestacy/declaration of trust/trust deed (UK) or will/rules of intestacy/'grant or deed of life interest' (or similar) (U.S.) in remainder or revert to the original grantee, depending on terms of Ashley. Such a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> in the U.S. can also be conveyed for the life of the grantor, such as [...] "A conveys X to B until A dies" [...] and in the UK by trust transferring upon trust or assigning rather than conveying X.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> is {{typically}} {{used as a}} tool of an <b>estate</b> planning. A <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> can avoid probate and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al's death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> in the home. Al keeps a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> and Bill receives a vested fee simple remainder. As soon as Al dies, the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> interest merges with Bill's remainder, and Bill has a fee simple title. Such a transfer risks the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered fee simple, selling the estate prematurely to an innocent purchaser such as when Al is on vacation but makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman's consent. [...] "Beneficiary deeds" [...] have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.|$|R

5000|$|A {{reversion}} {{in property}} {{law is a}} future interest that is retained by the grantor after the conveyance of an estate of a lesser quantum that he has (such {{as the owner of}} a fee simple granting a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> or a leasehold estate). Once the lesser estate comes to an end (the lease expires or the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> tenant dies), the property automatically reverts (hence reversion) back to the grantor.|$|R
