These fuel injectors, termed fluidic valves, utilize their geometry and a supply pressure to deliver fuel and contain no moving parts. Behavior of these fluidic valves is characterized {{in order to determine}} their feasibility for integration with high-frequency pulsed or rotating detonation wave engines. Fuel flow is initiated just prior to ignition of the detonation tube to understand the interaction between the fluidic valves and the wave. Parametric studies have been conducted with the type of fuel injected, the orifice diameter, and the plenum cavity pressure. Results indicate that the <b>detonation</b> wave <b>pressure</b> temporarily shuts off the fluidic valve supply, but the wave products can be quickly expelled by the fresh fuel supply to allow for refueling.

40|$|We {{consider}} the energy accumulation in meta-stable clusters. This energy {{can be much}} larger than the typical chemical bond energy (~;; 1 ev/atom). For example, polymeric nitrogen can accumulate 4 ev/atom in the N 8 (fcc) structure, while helium can accumulate 9 ev/atom in the excited triplet state He 2 *. They release their energy by cluster fission: N 8 -> 4 N 2 and He 2 * -> 2 He. We study the locus of states in thermodynamic state space for the detonation of such meta-stable clusters. In particular, the equilibrium isentrope, starting at the Chapman-Jouguet state, and expanding down to 1 atmosphere was calculated with the Cheetah code. Large <b>detonation</b> <b>pressures</b> (3 and 16 Mbar), temperatures (12 and 34 kilo-K) and velocities (20 and 43 km/s) are a consequence of the large heats of detonation (6. 6 and 50 kilo-cal/g) for nitrogen and helium clusters respectively.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the detonation performance of an explosive charge can be gained by directly measuring pressure, temperature and velocity of detonation (VOD). This is particularly important with commercial explosives because their performance is directly influenced by the degree of confinement given by the borehole diameter and the surrounding rock mass. A project funded by the Australian Coal Association Research Program (ACARP) was initiated in early 2009 with the view to design and build cost effective prototype instrumentation to measure the relative differences in <b>detonation</b> <b>pressures</b> and temperatures of commercial mining explosives. The project’s primary focus was on low density explosives. Low density (also referred to as low shock) explosives have been available in various forms for nearly 20 years. Identifying the pressure release patterns of both conventional and low density explosives under different geotechnical conditions should provide the necessary information to both validate detonation codes and better define input parameters for breakage and fragmentation models.

Plastic balloons of five different sizes ranging from 0. 05 mm to 2. 42 mm in average diameter were used as void.

The fraction of the emulsion explosives reacted in reaction zone was estimated from the comparison of observed detonation velocity and pressure with those theoretically calculated. For the emulsion explosives containing large voids, the fraction of the emulsion explosives reacted in reaction zone was considerably low.

40|$|During gaseous {{diffusion}} plant operations, conditions {{leading to the}} formation of flammable gas mixtures may occasionally arise. Currently, these could consist of the evaporative coolant CFC- 114 and fluorinating agents such as F 2 and ClF 3. Replacement of CFC- 114 with a non-ozone-depleting substitute is planned. Consequently, in the future, the substitute coolant must also be considered as a potential fuel in flammable gas mixtures. Two questions of practical interest arise: (1) can a particular mixture sustain and propagate a flame if ignited, and (2) what is the maximum pressure that can be generated by the burning (and possibly exploding) gas mixture, should it ignite? Experimental data on these systems, particularly for the newer coolant candidates, are limited. To assist in answering these questions, a mathematical model was developed to serve as a tool for predicting the potential <b>detonation</b> <b>pressures</b> and for estimating the composition limits of flammability for these systems based on empirical correlations between gas mixture thermodynamics and flammability for known systems. The present model uses the thermodynamic equilibrium to determine the reaction endpoint of a reactive gas mixture and uses detonation theory to estimate an upper bound to the pressure that could be generated upon ignition.

40|$|Background: Because the {{characteristics}} of blast waves in water {{are different from those}} in air and because kinetic energy is liberated by a pressure wave at the water-air interface, thoracic injuries from mine blasts in shoals may be serious. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate {{the characteristics}} and mechanisms of cardiopulmonary injury caused by mine blasts in shoals. Methods: To study {{the characteristics of}} cardiopulmonary injury, 56 animals were divided randomly into three experimental groups (12 animals in the sham group, 22 animals in the land group and 22 animals in the shoal group). To examine the biomechanics of injury, 20 animals were divided randomly into the land group and the shoal group. In the experimental model, the water surface was at the level of the rabbit’s xiphoid process, and paper electric detonators (600 mg RDX) were used to simulate mines.

Conclusion: The results indicate that severe cardiopulmonary injury and dysfunction occur following exposure to mine blasts in shoals.
