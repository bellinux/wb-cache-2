2500|$|AllMusic editor Stanton Swihart {{found the}} {{production}} innovative and deemed Critical Beatdown [...] "an undeniable hip-hop classic [...] {{one of the}} finest rap albums from the mid- to late-'80s 'new school' in hip-hop." [...] He noted the [...] "lyrical invention" [...] of Kool Keith's and Ced-Gee's respective styles, adding that [...] "Somewhere in the nexus between the two stylistic extremes, brilliant music emanated. Critical Beatdown maintains all its sharpness and every ounce of its power, and it has not aged one second since 1988." [...] Trouser Press journalist Jeff Chang called it [...] "an amazing debut" [...] and complimented Kool Keith's [...] "shifty rhyme patterns". Pitchforks Alex Linhardt called it [...] "a flawless album—one that stands tall today as one of Golden Age's most ageless," [...] lauding Kool Keith's [...] "lyrical ingenuity" [...] and citing Ced-Gee as [...] "the source of the album's most insane, digitalk-quantum gibberish, spouting lines [...] hey should be studied in seminars alongside general relativity." [...] Linhardt attributed its music's [...] "surging psychosis" [...] to DJ Moe Love's turntablism and Ced-Gee's dense funk sampling, particularly his arrangement of vocal samples, writing that they [...] "are ingrained in the very fabric of the beat, concealed and crippled amidst the relentlessly <b>fuzzing</b> bass. And like most great rap albums, many of them come from the patron saint of yelps, James Brown, and flurry and flux with such abstraction and chaos that they make the beats feel deceptively fast-paced." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Fuzzing</b> can be {{considered}} to be a special case of mutation testing. In <b>fuzzing,</b> the messages or data exchanged inside communication interfaces (both inside and between software instances) are mutated to catch failures or differences in processing the data.

50|$|<b>Fuzzing</b> is used {{mostly as}} an {{automated}} technique to expose vulnerabilities in security-critical programs {{that might be}} exploited with malicious intent. More generally, <b>fuzzing</b> is used to demonstrate the presence of bugs rather than their absence. Running a <b>fuzzing</b> campaign for several weeks without finding a bug does not prove the program correct. After all, the program may still fail for an input {{that has not been}} executed, yet; executing a program for all inputs is prohibitively expensive. If the objective is to prove a program correct for all inputs, a formal specification must exist and techniques from formal methods must be used.|$|E

50|$|A mutation-based fuzzer leverages an {{existing}} corpus of seed inputs during <b>fuzzing.</b> It generates inputs by modifying (or rather mutating) the provided seeds.

40|$|Fuzzy {{tungsten}} is a {{phenomena that}} could potentially occur in future fusion reactors. There are three conditions for <b>fuzz</b> to form, the existence of He ions impinging on a tungsten sample for a sufficient amount of time, that these ions be of sufficient energy, and that the surface temperature of the tungsten is hot enough. These conditions will likely be fulfilled in ITER, the future flagship fusion reactor. Therefore efforts to understand and characterise the <b>fuzz</b> formation are of importance. A thorough literature review has been provided, bringing {{together for the first}} time works from over 100 papers on the area. The history of its discovery is explained and the characteristics of the structure are detailed. The potential for <b>fuzz</b> to occur in ITER is shown, and positive and negative aspects of <b>fuzz</b> for fusion operation are discussed. The current accepted growth mechanisms are explained and a brief summary of the current work on simulating the phenomena is given. <b>Fuzz</b> appearing on other metals is introduced, and evidence of creating <b>fuzz</b> in a tokamak is shown. Methods for removing <b>fuzz</b> are presented should it be deemed necessary to do so in ITER. Results are compiled from many <b>fuzz</b> samples created in the literature spanning four orders of magnitude of fluence. This provided the foundation for a collaboration with the UC San Diego, and lab time at their facilities. Several samples were created to complement the dataset. The compilation provides new insights into the growth equation surrounding <b>fuzz</b> formation. A new addition to the equation is introduced in the form of an incubation fluence, a minimum fluence required before <b>fuzz</b> can develop. The growth model is expanded to <b>fuzz</b> grown in erosive regimes, and a new equation is proposed that encompasses the competition between growth and erosion, giving good predictions for the resulting equilibrium thickness. A new method for creating <b>fuzz</b> has been developed in a cheap and simple way. Conventional methods involve using large scale expensive devices, only available in a select few places worldwide. Magnetrons are apparent in many laboratories around the world and a technique for making <b>fuzz</b> in them has been developed. The three parameters controlling <b>fuzz</b> formation have been studied in the magnetron by making samples at many different conditions. The results provide new insight into early <b>fuzz</b> formation, providing results in a fluence range often over-looked. A cross-over fluence is noted from pre-fuzz to fully formed <b>fuzz,</b> overlapping with the predicted incubation fluence. The results differ slightly from <b>fuzz</b> created in other devices at similar fluence. The most probable cause is due to the unique existence of deposition of metallic particles in a magnetron incident on the samples during the growth of <b>fuzz...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{basis for}} the <b>Fuzz</b> Factory is a {{traditional}} <b>fuzz</b> effect circuit using New old stock Germanium Transistors, as used on the <b>Fuzz</b> Face, the seminal device used by Jimi Hendrix and many others during the late 1960s/early 1970s. The <b>Fuzz</b> Factory innovates by use of internal feedback loops and component-level bias adjustments to achieve unprecedented control, or deliberate lack thereof, of the distorted signal. Designed by electronic trial-and-error, closely tied to circuit bending, the controls of the <b>Fuzz</b> Factory are highly interactive, and represent {{a wide spectrum of}} tonal ability, often extending into self-oscillation and noise. Many musicians find the promise of near-infinite new sounds and textures inherent to the device to be inspiring to their music, and the <b>Fuzz</b> Factory has a well-known following among professional guitarists.|$|R
