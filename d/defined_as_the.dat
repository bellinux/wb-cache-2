5|$|In Proposition 45 of his Principia, Newton applies his theorem of {{revolving}} orbits {{to develop}} a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets. Johannes Kepler had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses, and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements. The long axis is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point, i.e., the line connecting the two apses. For illustration, the long axis of the planet Mercury is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion. Over time, the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually, generally {{no more than a}} few degrees per complete revolution, because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies, oblateness in the attracting body, general relativistic effects, and other effects. Newton's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets.|$|E
