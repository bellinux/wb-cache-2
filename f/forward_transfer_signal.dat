The solvents were chosen to have similar chemical and dielectric properties, but vastly different viscosities. Systems of an electron donor, rubrene, and varying concentrations of an electron acceptor, duroquinone, were studied.

40|$|Abstract- The QoS {{signalling}} {{across multiple}} domains {{is an open}} issue: {{in this paper we}} propose a QoS interdomain signalling solution for SIP-based multimedia sessions. Our solution refers to a signalling architecture proposed by ETSI in which the interdomain QoS signalling flows on the application layer along with the session signalling. In our solution we extend the precondition set attributes defined in the “Integration of Resource Management and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) ”, RFC 3312, to allow the exchange of information about resources required by multimedia sessions and local availability of resources in each domain, between all the domains along multimedia session paths. Moreover in this paper we provide a signalling solution that integrates interdomain signalling and SIP end-to-end session negotiation signalling. Keywords: QoS, multi-domain, SIP, SDP. The task of signalling service is to <b>transfer</b> <b>signalling</b> information originated by the terminal nodes between the switching and policing nodes of a network.

40|$|The ΔpH-driven and Sec-related thylakoidal protein translocases {{recognise}} distinct {{types of}} thylakoid <b>transfer</b> <b>signal,</b> yet all <b>transfer</b> <b>signals</b> resemble bacterial signal peptides in structural terms. Comparison of known <b>transfer</b> <b>signals</b> reveals a single concrete difference: signals for the ΔpH-dependent system contain a common twin-arginine motif immediately before the hydrophobic region. We {{show that this}} motif is critical for the ΔpH-driven translocation process; substitution of the arg-arg by gin-gin or even arg-lys totally blocks translocation across the thylakoid membrane, and replacement by lys-arg reduces the rate of translocation by > 100 -fold. The targeting information {{in this type of}} signal thus differs fundamentally from that of bacterial signal peptides, where the required positive charge can be supplied by any basic amino acid. Insertion of a twin-arg moth into a Sec-dependent substrate does not alter the pathway followed but reduces translocation efficiency, suggesting that the motif may also repel the Sec-type system. Other information must help to specify the choice of translocation mechanism, but this information is unlikely to reside in the hydrophobic region because substitution by a hydrophobic section from an integral membrane protein does not affect the translocation pathway. </p...|$|R
