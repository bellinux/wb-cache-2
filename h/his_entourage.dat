5|$|The General and <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> {{arrive at}} the port of Mompox. Here they are stopped by police, who fail to {{recognize}} the General. They ask for his passport, but he is unable to produce one. Eventually, the police discover his identity and escort him into the port. The people still believe him to be the President of Gran Colombia and prepare banquets in his honor; but these festivities are wasted on him due to his lack of strength and appetite. After several days, the General and <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> set off for Turbaco.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} night of the voyage, the General stays at Facatativá with <b>his</b> <b>entourage,</b> which {{consists}} of José Palacios, five aides-de-camp, his clerks, and his dogs. Here, as throughout the journey that follows, the General's loss of prestige is evident; the downturn in his fortunes surprises even the General himself. His unidentified illness has led to his physical deterioration, which makes him unrecognizable, and his aide-de-camp is constantly mistaken for the Liberator.|$|E
5|$|The General finally {{receives}} his passport, and {{two days}} later he sets off with <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> for Cartagena and the coast, where more receptions are held in his honor.

The General is deeply affected when he hears that his good friend and preferred successor for the presidency, Field Marshal Sucre, has been ambushed and assassinated.|$|E

50|$|Rama IV thus came {{to welcome}} western {{intrusion}} in Siam. Indeed, the king himself and <b>his</b> <b>entourages</b> were actively pro-British. This came in 1855 {{in the form}} of a mission led by the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir John Bowring, who arrived in Bangkok with demands for immediate changes, backed by the threat of force. The King readily agreed to his demand for a new treaty, called the Bowring Treaty, which restricted import duties to 3%, abolished royal trade monopolies, and granted extraterritoriality to British subjects. Other western powers soon demanded and got similar concessions.|$|R
50|$|Two envoys {{came back}} to Ryukyu in 1665. Soon Chatan found the truth: the pirates were {{actually}} Ryukyuans disguised as Chinese, {{and all of them}} were <b>his</b> <b>entourages.</b> When the ship passed through Iheya Island, he threw all participants into the sea in order to hush up the incident. But finally the truth was known by Satsuma Domain. Both Chatan and Eso were sentenced to death by Satsuma, and decapitated by Ryukyu Kingdom. Their eight sons were exiled to outlying islands and imprisoned at temples (寺預). This incident was known as Chatan Eso Incident (北谷恵祖事件).|$|R
5|$|In 1320, {{following}} the death of Michael IX Palaiologos (eldest son of Andronikos II and co-emperor from 1295 on), his son Andronikos III was crowned as co-emperor by Andronikos II. Although initially popular with his grandfather, the younger Andronikos and <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> of young nobles, to which Syrgiannes belonged, had by that time caused the elder emperor's displeasure by their extravagance. Their excesses culminated in the mistaken-identity murder of the young emperor's younger brother, Manuel; enraged, the elder Andronikos annulled his grandson's titles, and a deep personal rift was opened between the two.|$|E
5|$|Arkansas {{participated in}} the Yorktown Sesquicentennial {{celebrations}} in October 1931, marking the 150th anniversary of the Siege of Yorktown. She embarked President Herbert Hoover and <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> on 17 October, and {{took them to the}} exposition, and returned them to Annapolis on 19–20 October. She then went into drydock for an extensive refit in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which lasted until January 1932. During this time, she was under the command of George Landenberger. Arkansas was transferred to the Pacific Fleet after completing the refit; while en route, she stopped in New Orleans to participate in the Mardi Gras celebration. She operated off the west coast through early 1934, at which point she was transferred back to the Atlantic Fleet, where she served as the flagship of the Training Squadron.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
50|$|Burntisland {{developed}} as a seaport, being second only to Leith in the Firth of Forth, and shipbuilding became an important industry in the town. In 1633 one of the barges, the Blessing of Burntisland, carrying Charles I and <b>his</b> <b>entourage's</b> baggage from Burntisland to Leith sank {{with the loss of}} Charles' treasure. In 1601, King James VI chose the town as an alternative site for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. This was when a new translation of the Bible was first discussed, a project which James brought to fruition a decade later in the King James Bible.|$|R
5000|$|In 1663, King Shō Shitsu {{dispatched}} Chatan as a gratitude envoy for his investiture to Qing China. The mission stayed Fuzhou {{on their}} way home in the next year. King Shō Shitsu dispatched Eso Jūkō ( [...] , also known as Ei Jōshun [...] ) as congratulatory envoy to celebrate Kangxi Emperors coronation at the same time. But Esos envoy was shipwrecked near Meihua Port ( [...] , a port in mordern Changle, Fuzhou) in the mouth of Min River, and was attacked by pirates.

5|$|At about 04:30 on June 30, 1934, Hitler and <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> {{flew into}} Munich. From the airport {{they drove to}} the Bavarian Interior Ministry, where they {{assembled}} the leaders of an SA rampage {{that had taken place}} in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the epaulets off the shirt of Obergruppenführer August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city on the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery. Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst Röhm and his followers were staying.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of ArchelausI in the 5th century BC, the ancient Macedonian elite was {{importing}} customs and artistic traditions from other regions of Greece while retaining more archaic, perhaps Homeric, funerary rites connected with the symposium that were typified by items such as the decorative metal kraters that held the ashes of deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among these is the large bronze Derveni Krater from a 4th-centuryBC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god Dionysus and <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career. Macedonian metalwork usually followed Athenian styles of vase shapes from the 6thcenturyBC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.|$|E
5|$|Following her commissioning, Arkansas {{participated in}} a fleet review on 14 October 1912, for President William Howard Taft. The ship took Taft aboard that day {{for a trip to}} Panama to inspect the Panama Canal, which was still under construction. Arkansas began her {{shakedown}} cruise after delivering Taft and <b>his</b> <b>entourage</b> to the Canal Zone. On 26 December, she returned to the Canal Zone to take Taft to Key West, Florida. After completing the voyage, Arkansas was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and participated in fleet maneuvers off the east coast of the United States. Arkansass first overseas cruise, to the Mediterranean Sea, began in late October 1913. While there, she stopped in several ports, including Naples, Italy on 11 November, where the ship celebrated the birthday of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
