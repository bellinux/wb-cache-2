The <b>energy</b> <b>embodied</b> in substructure, superstructure and finishes elements was investigated for five Melbourne office buildings of the following heights: 3, 7, 15, 42 and 52 storeys. The two high-rise buildings have approximately 60 percent more <b>energy</b> <b>embodied</b> per unit gross floor area (GFA) in their materials than the low-rise buildings.

25|$|The {{balancing}} period is often {{assumed to be}} one year (suitable to cover all operation energy uses). A shorter period (monthly or seasonal) could also be considered {{as well as a}} balance over the entire life cycle (including <b>embodied</b> <b>energy,</b> which could also be annualized and counted in addition to operational energy uses).|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} steel, {{concrete}} and glass needed {{to construct a}} single skyscraper is large, and these materials represent {{a great deal of}} <b>embodied</b> <b>energy.</b> Skyscrapers are thus energy intensive buildings, but skyscrapers have a long lifespan, for example the Empire State Building in New York City, United States completed in 1931 and is still in active use.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{demand for}} more {{affordable}} homes {{in recent years has}} led to recent resurgences in the use of prefabricated construction method. Although there have been various environmental advantages associated with prefabricated construction techniques, the judgement against it is believed to be based on limited understanding and without the necessary detailed research on its environmental performance. The main environmental issues associated with prefabricated houses lies in its transportation pattern and the effect it has to the overall <b>embodied</b> transport <b>energy.</b> The complexity and dynamics of transportation processes, e. g. from forest to site in the case of building prefabricated timber houses, reveals the importance in having {{a better understanding of the}} significance of <b>embodied</b> transport <b>energy</b> consumption associated with prefabricated construction. Due to high dependency on imported timber, concern has been raised over transport energy consumption when using prefabricated timber elements on UK construction sites in contrast to masonry materials that are readily available locally. This research therefore analyses the <b>embodied</b> transport <b>energy</b> consumption when using prefabricated timber elements for building affordable homes in the UK with particular reference to the use of prefabricated timber wall panelling unit. The evaluation of <b>embodied</b> transport <b>energy</b> has been carried out through the use of process flow analysis. This research has developed a generic process flow model for using prefabricated timber wall system in the UK. Primary data has been gathered through questionnaires to identify the most commonly used prefabricated timber panelling system, its components, the origins of raw material along with the transportation and material processes involved for each component. The questionnaires revealed that open wall panelling system is the most marketed prefabricated timber wall type in the UK. Based on the findings of the questionnaires and the developed process flow model, a number of mathematical formulae have been developed in order to systematically quantify the intricate <b>embodied</b> transport <b>energy</b> consumption associated with using prefabricated timber wall panelling unit on construction sites. Scenario analysis has been employed in order to test the functionality of the system methodology and to demonstrate the way <b>embodied</b> transport <b>energy</b> may vary within a set of variables. The results suggest that the unit difference between the <b>embodied</b> transport <b>energy</b> of a scenario when delivering a single wall panelling unit to site compared to having vehicles fully loaded with panelling units is as much as 16. 83 GJ/panel. The process flow analysis concludes that it is environmentally friendly to employ prefabricated timber frame construction for large housing development projects such that delivery to site is always with a full load. Another important finding is that waste factor of building materials has a significant effect on the overall <b>embodied</b> transport <b>energy</b> consumption especially the waste factor of converting the logs onto plywood and studs used to produce the prefabricated timber wall panelling unit. The research has provided a better understanding of the effect of transport load, choice of transport, and the transportation distances on the overall <b>embodied</b> transport <b>energy</b> for prefabricated building elements and their associated materials. It can be concluded that the developed process flow analysis model has potential to be used as a base model to analyse other type of materials used within prefabricated house construction to aid decision making...|$|R

25|$|Although LCA {{is widely}} {{recognized}} {{as the best way}} to evaluate the environmental impacts of buildings (ISO 14040 provides a recognized LCA methodology), it is not yet a consistent requirement of green building rating systems and codes, despite the fact that <b>embodied</b> <b>energy</b> and other life cycle impacts are critical to the design of environmentally responsible buildings.|$|E
25|$|A {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental, social and economic concerns by assessing {{a full range of}} impacts associated with all cradle-to-grave stages of a process: from extraction of raw materials through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling. Impacts taken into account include (among others) <b>embodied</b> <b>energy,</b> global warming potential, resource use, air pollution, water pollution, and waste.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{requirements}} for transportation of concrete are low {{because it is}} produced locally from local resources, typically manufactured within 100 kilometers of the job site. Similarly, relatively little energy is used in producing and combining the raw materials (although large amounts of CO2 are produced by the chemical reactions in cement manufacture). The overall <b>embodied</b> <b>energy</b> of concrete at roughly 1 to 1.5 megajoules per kilogram is therefore lower than for most structural and construction materials.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} system boundary is split into a physical boundary which determines which renewable resources are considered (e.g. in buildings footprint, on-site or even off-site, see) respectively how many buildings {{are included in}} the balance (single building, cluster of buildings) and a balance boundary which determines the included energy uses (e.g. heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, lighting, appliances, IT, central services, electric vehicles, and <b>embodied</b> <b>energy,</b> etc.). It should be noticed that renewable energy supply options can be prioritized (e.g. by transportation or conversion effort, availability over the lifetime of the building or replication potential for future, etc.) and therefore create a hierarchy. It may be argued that resources within the building footprint or on-site should be given priority over off-site supply options.|$|E
25|$|Green {{vehicles}} {{are intended to}} have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when {{the environmental impact of}} a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle {{this may not be the}} case. Electric vehicle technology has the potential to reduce transport CO2 emissions, depending on the <b>embodied</b> <b>energy</b> of the vehicle and the source of the electricity. The primary sources of electricity currently used in most countries (coal, gas, oil) mean that until world electricity production changes substantially, private electric cars will result in the same or higher production of CO2 than petrol equivalent vehicles. The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface.|$|E

Standard maintenance include removing debris, controlling weeds, deadhead trimming, checking moisture levels, and fertilizing. The maintenance energy use for green roofs has many variables including: climate, intensity of rainfall, type of building, type of vegetation, and external coatings. The most significant effect comes from scarce rainfall which will increase the maintenance energy due to the watering required.

50|$|Stanley Sandler, in his 1989 Chemical and Engineering Thermodynamics, {{described}} how given any thermodynamic process, a quantity TS {{can be interpreted}} as the amount of mechanical energy that has been converted into thermal energy by viscous dissipation, dispersion, and other system irreversibilities. In 1997, John Wrigglesworth described spatial particle distributions as represented by distributions of energy states. According to the second law of thermodynamics, isolated systems will tend to redistribute the energy of the system into a more probable arrangement or a maximum probability energy distribution, i.e. from that of being concentrated to that of being spread out. By virtue of the First law of thermodynamics, the total energy does not change; instead, the energy tends to disperse from a coherent to a more incoherent state. In his 1999 Statistical Thermodynamics, M.C. Gupta defined entropy as a function that measures how energy disperses when a system changes from one state to another. Other authors defining entropy in a way that <b>embodies</b> <b>energy</b> dispersal are Cecie Starr and Andrew Scott.|$|R
