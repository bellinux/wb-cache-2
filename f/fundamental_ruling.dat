40|$|Civil Law codices are analytic, {{abstract}} and {{removed from the}} specific influence of particular cases. When rules are codified In Common Law systems they reflect a collection of rulings and not a collection of analytic principles. These differences stem from the nature and the motivations of the legislative enterprise. Civil-continental legislation originates in a legislative initiative “from above”. It {{is driven by the}} aspiration for legal harmony and completeness, and was originally formulated by academics. Legislation in the common-law countries results from a "bottom up" effect in which reality dictates the nature of the developing rules, step by step. Civil law systems like Common Law systems accept the supremacy of the statutory law over judge-made law. Yet when the judiciary has the authority or the power to influence the legislative agenda there is a veritable role switch. In a manner resembling continental-style legislation, the court reviewing existing legislation determines an abstract principle, usually in reliance on a particular constitutional text, and it is the legislature that is required to distill the principles into specific legislative norms, a function normally fulfilled by the common law court. The question forming the basis of this paper {{is the nature of the}} legislative process and the legislation produced by this kind of relationship. The paper addresses this question through the narrow prism of a detailed examination of a particular Israeli test case in which the Israeli Supreme Court handed down a ruling on a fundamental principle but on its own initiative delegated to the legislature the task of implementing it and providing a specific legislative enactment of this principle, on the basis of which the Court would then rule on the concrete case. The result in this particular case was that the traditional roles of the respective branches were reversed. The practical result of the move to delegate the implementation of a far-reaching and <b>fundamental</b> <b>ruling</b> to the legislature was a subversion of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>ruling</b> and delayed justice for the parties who sought a resolution of the matter. The paper claims that this mechanism leads to the creation of a new variety of a "mixed-system". The judiciary abandoned its primary obligation, namely to serve as an instance for resolving disputes, while the legislature became an executor of judicially enunciated principles. The law thus enacted resembles, in its detailed and complex language, a common law text while the principle formulated in the judgment of the court resembles a section of an analytical "civil law" statute. When the motivation for legislation stems from the court's directives, rather than the governmental or legislative interests, the legislature or the executive branch has an interest in thwarting the court’s intention through the use of various tactics readily at its disposal. This process also affects the vague and detailed formulation of the legislation, which has a character rather different from the abstract nature of civil law legislation. The lesson that this episode teach us, which the court itself internalized, is that a court cannot really dictate a legislative agenda and that it should instead focus on its designated role – the resolving of concrete disputes...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new method allowing {{the study of the}} thermodynamic phase behavior of mesoscopic colloidal systems consisting of amyloid protein fibers in water, obtained by heat denaturation and aggregation of β-lactoglobulin, a dairy protein. The fibers have a cross section of about 5. 2 nm and two groups of polydisperse contour lengths: (i) long fibers of 1 − 20 μm, showing semiflexible behavior, and (ii) short rods of 100 − 200 nm long, obtained by cutting the long fibers via high-pressure homogenization. At pH 2 without salt, these fibers are highly charged and stable in water. We have studied the isotropic−nematic phase transition for both systems and compared our results with the theoretical values predicted by Onsager’s theory. The experimentally measured isotropic−nematic phase transition was found to occur at 0. 4 % and at 3 % for the long and short fibers, respectively. For both systems, this phase transition occurs at concentrations more than 1 order of magnitude lower than what is expected based on Onsager’s theory. Moreover, at low enough pH, no intermediate biphasic region was observed between the isotropic phase and the nematic phase. The phase diagrams of both systems (pH vs concentration) showed similar, yet complex and rich, phase behavior. We discuss the possible physical <b>fundamentals</b> <b>ruling</b> the phase diagram as well as the discrepancy we observe for the isotropic−nematic phase transition between our experimental results and the predicted theoretical results. Our work highlights that systems formed by water−amyloid protein fibers are way too complex to be understood based solely on Onsager’s theories. Experimental results are revisited in terms of the Flory’s theory (1956) for suspensions of rods, which allows accounting for rod−solvent hydrophobic interactions. This theoretical approach allows explaining, on a semiquantitative basis, most of the discrepancies observed between the experimental results and Onsager’s predictions. The sources of protein fibers complex colloidal behavior are analyzed and discussed at length...|$|R

40|$|A {{solar cell}} {{is a solid}} state device that {{converts}} the energy of sunlight directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect. When light with photon energies greater than the band gap is absorbed by a semiconductor material, free electrons and free holes are generated by optical excitation in the material. The main characteristic of a photovoltaic device {{is the presence of}} internal electric field able to separate the free electrons and holes so they can pass out of the material to the external circuit before they recombine. Numerical simulation of photovoltaic devices plays a crucial role in their design, performance prediction, and comprehension of the <b>fundamental</b> phenomena <b>ruling</b> their operation. The electrical transport and the optical behavior of the solar cells discussed in this work were studied with the simulation code D-AMPS- 1 D. This software is an updated version of the one-dimensional (1 D) simulation program Analysis of Microelectronic and Photonic Devices (AMPS) that was initially developed at The Penn State University, USA. Structures such as homojunctions, heterojunctions, multijunctions, etc., resulting from stacking layers of different materials can be studied by appropriately selecting characteristic parameters. In this work, examples of cells simulation made with D-AMPS- 1 D are shown. Particularly, results of Ge photovoltaic devices are presented. The role of the InGaP buffer on the device was studied. Moreover, a comparison of the simulated electrical parameters with experimental results was performed...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} an {{extensive}} {{characterization of the}} cracking noise produced by charcoal samples when dampened with ethanol. We argue that the evaporation of ethanol causes transient and irregularly distributed internal stresses that promote the fragmentation of the samples and mimic some situations found in mining processes. The results show that, in general, the most <b>fundamental</b> seismic laws <b>ruling</b> earthquakes (Gutenberg-Richter law, unified scaling law for the recurrence times, Omori's law, productivity law and Bath's law) hold under {{the conditions of the}} experiment. Some discrepancies were also identified (a smaller exponent in Gutenberg-Richter law, a stationary behavior in the aftershock rates for long times and a double power-law relationship in productivity law) and related to the different loading condition. Our results thus corroborate to elucidate the parallel between seismic laws and fracture experiments caused by a more complex loading condition that also occurs in natural and induced seismicity (such as long-term fluid injection and gas-rock outbursts in mining processes).

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{a study of}} bubble {{dynamics}} in adiabatic conditions (i. e. with no heat and mass transfer) is carried out {{in order to understand}} the <b>fundamental</b> physics <b>ruling</b> the evolution of their interface, and open the way to the comprehension of more complex heat and mass transfer issues involving them. An external electric field is applied to the system to investigate the potentiality of this technique to enhance phase separation and heat transfer. A new numerical method for EHD action on a growing bubble has been developed combining VOF and level-set methods. To experimentally validate it, well-defined and simple boundary conditions have been selected: all the forms of heat and mass transfer have been excluded from the system, and an axisymmetric electric field configuration has been chosen in order to adopt a 2 -D simulation. In the experimental apparatus a steady bubble stemming from an orifice in a still fluid (FC- 72) has been produced, and a dc potential up to 20. kV was applied to a ring-shaped electrode coaxial with the orifice. In this way, in a first instance, all the dynamical effects have been eliminated, and a clear location of the three phase contact line, which is pinned to the orifice, has been defined. The bubble profile obtained from the experiment has been digitized and compared successfully with the outcomes of the numerical method. Furthermore, the study of the local curvature of the interface allowed the development of a new theory of the local electrical stress to be included in the capillary equation, which compares well with experimental data. Finally, the validated numerical method has been used to predict the bubble shape in the absence of gravity, in preparation of microgravity experiments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In 1995 Slater argued both against Priest’s paraconsistent system LP (1979) {{and against}} paraconsistency in general, invoking the <b>fundamental</b> {{opposition}} relations <b>ruling</b> the classical logical square. Around 2002 Béziau constructed a double defence of paraconsistency (logical and philosophical), relying, in its philosophical part, on Ses-mat’s (1951) and Blanche’s (1953) “logical hexagon”, a geometrical, conservative {{extension of the}} logical square, and proposing a new (tri-dimensional) “solid of opposition”, meant to shed {{new light on the}} point raised by Slater. By using n-opposition theory (NOT) we analyse Beziau’s anti-Slater move and show both its right intuitions and its tech-nical limits. Moreover, we suggest that Slater’s criticism is much akin to a well-known one by Suszko (1975) against the conceivability of many-valued logics. This last criticism has been addressed by Malinowski (1990) and Shramko and Wansing (2005), who developed a family of tenable logical counter-examples to it: trans-Suszkian systems are rad-ically many-valued. This family of new logics has some strange logical features, essentially: each system has more than one consequence opera-tor. We show that a new, deeper part of the aforementioned geometry of logical oppositions (NOT), the “logical poly-simplexes of dimension m”, generates new logical-geometrical structures, essentially many-valued, which could be a very natural (and intuitive) geometrical counterpart to the “strange”, new, non-Suszkian logics of Malinowski, Shramko and Wansing. By a similar move, the geometry of opposition therefore sheds light both on the foundations of paraconsistent logics and on those of many-valued logics...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho trata do papel desempenhado pelo Supremo Tribunal Federal na apreciação de questões relativas ao Sistema Constitucional Tributário brasileiro à luz dos direitos fundamentais. Com efeito, o STF é responsável por guardar os direitos fundamentais também quando decide controvérsias constitucionais tributárias, o que significa {{considerar}} o delicado equilíbrio entre a proteção dos contribuintes e a necessidade de o Estado arrecadar os recursos suficientes à concretização dos direitos fundamentais. Assim, a tese tem dois objetivos. Por um lado, pretende identificar se o Supremo Tribunal Federal adota algum parâmetro condizente com os direitos fundamentais ao julgar questões constitucionais relativas ao sistema tributário. Nessa perspectiva, diversos acórdãos do Supremo Tribunal Federal, proferidos na égide da CF/ 1988, são analisados com vistas a examinar se a Corte tem cumprido bem suas responsabilidades constitucionais. Por outro lado, sugere o Estado Fiscal como parâmetro adequado aos direitos fundamentais e ao sistema constitucional tributário, considerando sua preocupação tanto com a proteção dos contribuintes quanto com a existência de meios mínimos para o financiamento das atividades públicas. This work {{is about}} the role of the Supremo Tribunal Federal in the Brazilian constitutional tax system in light of the fundamental rights. Doubtlessly, the Brazilian Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal) is responsible for safekeeping and enforcing fundamental rights even when it decides constitutional tax controversies. The enforcement of fundamental rights in tax issues means accounting for the delicate balance between the protection of taxpayers and the necessity for the State to raise enough funds to implement fundamental rights. Thus the thesis has two objectives. On the one hand, the study aims to identify if the Supremo Tribunal Federal abides by any guideline consistent with the <b>fundamental</b> rights when <b>ruling</b> constitutional cases regarding the tax system. Therefore, various decisions of the Supremo Tribunal Federal, taken in the scope of the Federal Constitution of 1988, will be selected and analysed in order to examine if the Court has fulfilled its constitutional duties. On the other hand, the work suggests the Tax State as an adequate guideline to the fundamental rights and to the constitutional tax system, regarding its concern not only with taxpayers´ protection but also with the existence of minimum resources to fund public activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to give an {{overview}} on the rules of private international law existing at national and at international level and concerning relationships between parents and children, regardless of other conditions. In fact the thesis deals with jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of judgements {{in the field of}} parental authority, parental responsibility and child protection. Whereas the relevant legislation on parents – children relationships does not consider this topic as an unicuum, but takes into account differently the abovementioned categories, the thesis focuses on each of them separately. As a consequence, the first topic to be addressed is the relationship between the different relevant legislations, with reference to their material scope. The legislations taken into account are hereafter listed: - Council Regulation (EC) No 2201 / 2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347 / 2000; - Hague Convention of 5 October 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of infants; - Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and co-operation in respect of parental responsibility and measures {{for the protection of the}} child, that is expected to repeal the 1961 Hague Convention; - Articles 36, 37 and 42 of Italian Private International Law, n. 218 / 1995. After explaining the relationship among the abovementioned legislations, the thesis deals with jurisdiction, focusing on the <b>fundamental</b> principle <b>ruling</b> jurisdiction - the best interest of the child - and on the general criterion for determining jurisdiction: the habitual residence of the child, which is increasingly used in international acts. On the other hand, nationality is relevant under the 1961 Hague Convention and under Art. 36 of the Italian private international law, as a connecting factor for determining the applicable law. As far as connecting factors in the field of parents - children relationships, the research focuses on several topics, such as the problems arising from the discrimination based on nationality, and on multiple nationalities. Finally, the research explores the recognition as well as the enforcement of judgments: procedures differ from each other on the basis of where decisions are held, whether in a Member State or not. Also the object of the decision could lead to a different proceeding: for example, a judgment concerning access rights is directly recognized and enforceable in another Member State provided it is accompanied by a certificate, which shall be issued by the judge of origin who stated the judgment. The certificate guarantees that some procedural safeguards have been respected during the procedure in the State where the decision has been adopted. Finally, some recent aspects about public order exception are described. Parental responsibility is considered by Art. 2 of the Council Regulation (EC) No 2201 / 2003, and by Art. 1 of the 1996 Hague Convention, which both widely define the concept: in fact “parental responsibility” covers all rights and duties of a parent, guardian or legal representative, relating to the person or the property of the child. This encompasses not only rights of custody and rights of access, but also matters such as the guardianship and the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional care and child protection. It is worth underlining that: i) the list of matters qualified as “parental responsibility” pursuant to the Regulation in Art. 2 is not exhaustive, but merely illustrative; ii) it includes also measures for the protection of the child; iii) the concept of parental responsibility pursuant to the 1996 Hague Convention includes parental authority. As a consequence, parental responsibility may be considered the only relevant category in the field of parents – children relations. This hypothesis may lead to a uniform private international law regulations on family relations...|$|R
