5|$|The final {{took place}} on 11 and 12 December, with each episode lasting two hours. During the first show, the voting lines were frozen and the fourth placed {{contestant}} was eliminated. The votes carried over and the third placed contestant left on the second show following another <b>freeze.</b> <b>The</b> final two performed the potential winner's singles before the winner was announced.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} {{a time limit}} of ten minutes, which ends the game if it is exceeded. A player losing all lives is {{presented}} with a choice to continue or return to the title screen. Power-ups scattered across each world, presented as picture frames, include carrots that extend Robbit's health, extra lives, time-outs that stop the clock and <b>freeze</b> <b>the</b> level's dynamics for a few seconds, hourglasses that extend the player's time, and power pills that make Robbit invincible {{for a short period}} of time. Enemies in the game vary from anthropomorphic versions of creatures to robots and plants.|$|E
5|$|Prospective {{customers}} included ILFC, CIT Aerospace, Lufthansa, and Hapag-Lloyd. The latter two, however, were unimpressed {{with the}} long-range variant, preferring a shorter-range aircraft, which was {{better suited to}} their route structure. Singapore Airlines was also an expected customer because it {{was looking for a}} replacement for the A310. Airbus intended to <b>freeze</b> <b>the</b> design in late 2001, with the first flight scheduled for the third quarter of 2003 and entry into service within a year. The programme was later abandoned, as interest from customers was lacking.|$|E

5|$|Where possible, the University of Chicago {{attempted}} to re-employ workers {{who had been}} transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to other projects once their work had ended.

From a peak of 2,008 staff on 1 July 1944, the number of people working at the Metallurgical Laboratory fell to 1,444 on 1 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{monetary}} reform of 1991, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, was the last {{monetary reform}} prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initiated on 22 January 1991, it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to the production of consumer goods, which were in short supply. In a speech, Pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government's belief that money was being sent to the Soviet Union from abroad, fuelling inflation. Although ridiculed by the Soviet press at the time, three years later the truth of Pavlov's statement was verified. Mikhail Gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the Soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in 1961. The directive also included 50-rouble and 100-rouble banknotes issued in 1991. On 23 January 1991, the government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to 500 rubles with the official explanation that this was to <b>freeze</b> <b>the</b> income of corrupt officials, capitalists and criminals.|$|E
5|$|Villagers in {{northern}} Albania and western Kosovo reported hearing explosions {{in the vicinity}} of the ambush and seeing helicopters flying overhead for much of the following day. Albanian officials later alleged that two of these helicopters had violated the country's airspace, and Albania moved elite army units to the Yugoslav border in response. Yugoslav authorities accused Albania of backing the KLA. In response to the ambush, U.S. officials indicated that they would push for sanctions to be re-implemented against Yugoslavia, and said they would look to <b>freeze</b> <b>the</b> country's assets overseas. Some Albanian sources alleged that the men had not been ambushed, rather they were abducted and killed by Yugoslav security forces. Such claims could not be verified by Western journalists, and later that year, Amnesty International affirmed that the men were killed in an ambush while smuggling weapons across the border.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep <b>freeze.</b> <b>The</b> reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of the Master Production Schedule (MPS) is a critical issue in managing production operations with a Material Requirements Planning System. One method of achieving stability is to freeze some portion or all of <b>the</b> MPS. While <b>freezing</b> <b>the</b> MPS can {{limit the number of}} schedule changes, it can also produce an increase in production and inventory costs. This paper examines three decision variables in <b>freezing</b> <b>the</b> MPS: <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> method, <b>the</b> <b>freeze</b> interval length, and the planning horizon length. Simulation experiment results are reported which suggest that freezing up to 50 % of the planning horizon has a marginal effect on production and inventory cost under a wide range of operating conditions. These results also suggest that an order based freezing method produces superior results in comparison with a period based method. production/scheduling: material requirements planning, simulation: applications, inventory/production: planning horizons...|$|R
