40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was first the {{determination}} of data of knee joints of dogs, boththose with disease through luxation of the patella and those in good health. Secondly the data were tested whether it could objectively prove the existence of a luxation of the patella. For this purpose 89 knee joints from 46 dogs of different breed, age and sex were analysed. Before starting examination the limbs were classified according to PUTNAM (1968) into their different clinical degrees of patella luxation. 16 dogs out of the total of 46 showed unilateral and 6 dogs a bilateral luxation of the patella. All animals in this study were allocated to different groups, sorted by sex and weight. Within these groups a comparison of the values determined was performed and differentiated into luxated limbs and limbs without luxation. Through computed tomography every limb was analysed in axial layers followed by detailed measuring of the knee joints. This comprised measuring the depth of the trochlea ossis femoris, the angle of congruence, furthermore <b>depht,</b> width and length of the patella and the <b>depht</b> of the trochlea as an area. The measurements were followed by mathematical analysis in forming ratios of <b>depht</b> of trochlea and <b>depht</b> of patella, <b>depht</b> of trochlea and width of patella as well as lenght of patella and angle of congruence, finally also <b>depht</b> of trochlea as an area and <b>depht</b> of patella.

Thus, {{the aim of this}} investigation was to evaluate the effects of various mucin-containing solutions to be used as saliva substitutes differing in calcium and phosphate concentrations on demineralised bovine dentin in vitro. Method and materials: 153 bovine specimens were embedded in epoxy resin, polished (4000 grit), and partly covered with nail varnish (control of sound dentin). After demineralisation for 14 days (pH 5, 5) the specimens (n = 9) were exposed to 14 mucin-based solutions (30 g/l) at two different pH values (5, 5 or 6, 5) differing in their saturations with respect to apatites. Two fluoride-free solutions as well as the commercially available saliva substitutes Saliva Orthana® served as controls. The differences in mineral loss (&# 8710;&# 8710;Z) and lesion <b>dephts</b> (&# 8710;LT) between the values prior to (&# 8710;ZDemin; LTDemin) and after the storage (&# 8710;ZEffect; LTEffect) in the various solutions were evaluated from microradiographs (TMR) of thin sections (100 µm).

Objectives: For this in vitro study, the effects of experimental modifications (with respect to calcium, phosphate and fluoride) of Saliva natura and simultaneous application of high-concentrated fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm, Duraphat) were examined. Materials and methods: One hundred each of both demineralized bovine enamel and dentin specimens (subsurface lesions; 37 °C, enamel: 14 d, dentin 7 d) were stored in three different modifications {{with respect to the}} degree of saturation with octacalcium phosphate (OCP) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) (SOCP 1 - 3) of Saliva natura (SN 1 - 3), the original solution (SN) and a remineralizing solution (PK) for two and five weeks. Simultaneously all specimens were treated (2 ´ 2 min/ d) with a standardized high-concentrated fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm; Duraphat) -saliva substitute-slurry (1 : 3) (enamel: with brushing, 5 s/ specimen; dentin: without brushing). Successively, surfaces of specimens were divided in subareas (control/sound, demineralized, effect 2 and 5), and covered with nail varnish. After preparation, thin sections for microradiography were obtained. Differences in mineral loss (deltadeltaZ) and lesion depth (deltaLt) before/after exposure were evaluated microadiographically with contact microradiographs (TMR). Results: After two and five weeks SN 1 - 3 (supersaturated with respect to OCP) showed remineralizing effects on bovine demineralized enamel and dentin specimens. The specimens differed significantly from those stored in the original solution Saliva natura (p 0, 005).

40|$|ABSTRACT. El Salvador is the {{smallest}} and most densely populated country in Central America; its coast has an approximate lenght of 320 km, 29 municipalities and more than 700. 000 inhabitants. In El Salvador there were 15 recorded tsunamis between 1859 and 2012, 3 of them causing damages and resulting in hundreds of victims. Hazard assessment is commonly based on propagation numerical models for earthquake-generated tsunamis and can be approached through both probabilistic and deterministic methods. A deterministic approximation has been applied in this study as it provides essential information for coastal planning and management. The objective of the research was twofold: {{on the one hand}} the characterization of the threat over the entire coast of El Salvador, and on the other the computation of flooding maps for the three main localities of the Salvadorian coast. For the latter we developed high-resolution flooding models. For the former, due to the extension of the coastal area, we computed maximum elevations maps, and from the elevation in the near shore we computed an estimation of the run-up and the flooded area using empirical relations. We have considered local sources located in the Middle America Trench, characterized seismotectonically, and distant sources in the rest of Pacific Basin, using historical and recent earthquakes and tsunamis. We used a hybrid finite differences-finite volumes numerical model in this work, based on the linear and non-linear shallow water equations, to simulate a total of 24 earthquake-generated tsunami scenarios. Our results show that at the wastern Salvadorian coast, run-up values higher tan 5 m. are common, while in the eastern area, approximately from La Libertad to the Gulf of Fonseca, the run-up values are lower. The more exposed areas to flooding are the lowlands in the Lempa River delta and the Barra de Santiago Western Plains. The results of the empirical approximation used for the whole country are similar to the results obtained with the high-resolution numerical modelling, being a good and fast approximation to obtain preliminary tsunami hazard estimations.

So far river flowing datashowed rather good agreements to these critical lines, whereas, tsunami data did not. Themain reason to this discrepancy was attributed to the difference of mechanism of externalforce between flow and wave. Resistance of a window glass against hydrodynamic pressure were examined and the riskof the glass window failure which may result in a severe damage to the house was discu-ssed. Moreover, in relation to hydraulic force, effects of existance of the other houses withvarious arrangement were also examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} developed x-ray system 3 D-DELTA (3 -dim. Defect Localization and <b>depht</b> Analysis) for automatic PCB testing is presented. The system {{was developed for}} faster spatial data extraction by use of only two x-ray images of the PCBs. The result is the 3 -dimensional classification of defects within solder joints and of the solder joints itself {{without the use of}} complex computer tomographic algorithms. First, the x-ray imaging system for data acquisition is shown. In order to achieve the required data for evaluation, two micro focus x-ray sources are used to produce a stereo image pair during one scan. The use of a line scanning x-ray detector allows the image acquisition line by line with contrast enhancement during object movement. Time loss by stop and go of the assembly line is avoided with this method. Second, the data preparation by matching and subsequent division of an adapted reference image form the x-ray data is described. Finally, the algorithm for testing the solder joi nts for completeness and faint flaws is outlined. A combination between absolute thickn ess measurement by evaluation of polychromatic intensity distribution of the solder pads and 3 D-localization by stereoscopic technics is presented...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} the oral health development among patients at the Public Dental Care clinic in Bromölla who made an agreement regarding Healthy Dental Care during the years 2001 and 2004, compared with patients who did not made such an agreement. The study material was obtained from dental journals in total at 150 patients. Data regarding age, sex, health status, tobacco use, plaque- and gingivitis values, pocket <b>depht,</b> initial- and manifest caries, risk assessments, preventive measures by dental personel and acute dental care between year 2001 and 2004 was obtained from dental results. Almost twice as many man made an agreement compared to women. Tobacco use was higher in control group both 2001 and 2004. The dental professions worked much with preventive dental care that we can see in the low values of plaque and gingivitis during 2001 and 2004. Its means that patients follow up the advice they get. The healthy dental care is still a new phenomenon and has been exist only in four years. That´s why we can not made a conclusion of wich effect it´s has on the oral health...|$|E
40|$|The {{irrigation}} {{performance of}} any irrigation systems is highly facilitated when using a fitted model {{to represent the}} measured data. Several statistical distribution models, such as uniform, normal, lognormal, specialized power, beta, and gamma, {{have been used to}} fit applied water from irrigation, as na aid to evaluate the irrigation performance. However, the goodness of fitting the model to the observed values is very important to warrant reliable results. The purposed model resembles a power function and has desirable flexibilities for adjusting data. It uses four adjusting parameters, conferring to the model a great deal of power to adjust a variety of possible shapes of normally found distribution profiles from water irrigation applications. Its adjusting parameters can be easlily estimated using the "Solver" routine from Microsoft Excel. The new mathematical model is used to represent the applied water to derive the formulations needed to calculate all the necessary parameters for compute uniformities and efficiency measures. Additionally, it is purposed and irrigation factor to adjust a given crop water <b>depht</b> so that the resulting average applied water will match a established goal, defined in terms of the desired amount of fully irrigated area. 200...|$|E
