40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} student aid on the success <b>of</b> academic <b>studies.</b> I focus on two dimensions, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> and the probability of actually graduating with a degree. To determine the impact of financial student aid, I estimate a discrete-time duration model allowing for competing risks to account for different exit states (graduation and dropout) using individual level panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the years 1984 - 2007. My {{findings suggest that the}} <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> is responsive to the type of financial support a student receives. There are three main results. First, student aid recipients finish faster than comparable students who are supported by the same amount of parental/private transfers only. Second, although higher financial aid does on average not affect the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>study,</b> this effect is (third) dominated by the increased probability of actually finishing university successfully.

50|$|With the {{appointment}} of Gottfried Semper, not only a successful architect of monumental buildings but also an established theorist and teacher becomes the first {{professor and director of}} the Building School. His educational model of the atelier libre, oriented on the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, conflicts with the polytechnic school’s profile, which is chiefly practical and technically oriented. The pupils work in the drafting room on practical assignments, compete in rivalries and contribute to Sempers’s own projects.Semper succeeds in changing the title of the degree from ‘master builder’ to ‘architect’, but he nonetheless fails to extend the three-year <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|E

50|$|Until the 1970s, {{the normal}} <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> was four years, but {{later it was}} reduced to three years of study, {{followed}} by a year of practical training in the courts.

The arrival of new concepts dealing with democracy, {{the rule of law and}} equality before the law, necessitated deep reforms in the academic and educational conception of the law and of the role of the lawyer. Thus, starting from 1991 the curriculum was developed according to Western models, and after 2000 there were efforts to transition the degrees offered by the Faculty to the Bologna process, thus now the Faculty of Law offers Bachelor of laws, Master of laws and PhD in Law degrees.|$|E

French University in Armenia Foundation, which has approximately 1,000 students, aims to prepare highly qualified specialists that correspond to the needs of Armenian labor market and Caucasia economic region. The graduates of UFAR apply their knowledge to the advantage of relationships between Armenia, France and Europe, as well as the development of Armenia. They are the leaders and managers of tomorrow. At the end of their studies each year, roughly 70% of graduates find a job in their profession, some of whom pursue their education abroad. In three years’ time this percentage amounts to almost 100.|$|E
50|$|The {{situation}} in Spain {{is very similar}} to France but without the grandes écoles and Germany-U.k. in relation to the Technical Engineering Degrees. Long cycle Engineer's degrees (Ingenieros) traditionally used to be (at least nominally) six-year programs but the tendency since the mid-1990s has been to reduce them to five years. The last step to get the degree is the Proyecto de Fin de Carrera (Degree Project), which involves a combination of application development and some research work. Students submit a dissertation that they have to defend. The Spanish official name for the degree is Ingeniero (Engineer), or other degree called Ingeniero Técnico (Technical Engineer), which is a three-four years degree (involving also a Final Degree Project) and is equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering, the Technical Engineer in Spain has full competencies and legal authority in their field. A distinctive characteristic of Spanish engineering degrees is that the average <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> up to graduation is about 40% above the nominal duration and that the drop-out rate is considerable due to stricter examination standards.|$|E

The findings reject both hypotheses; working students do not achieve lower grades than their non-working peers; the negative impact of the length of studies on grades is not linked to status, and affects both working and non-working students in the same way. students, academic performance, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies.</b> ...|$|E
