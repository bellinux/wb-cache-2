40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a tractable model for analyzing non-coherent joint transmission base station (BS) cooperation, {{taking into account}} the irregular BS deployment typically en-countered in practice. Besides cellular-network specific aspects such as BS density, channel fading, average path loss and inter-ference, the model also captures relevant cooperation mechanisms including user-centric BS clustering and channel-dependent co-operation activation. The locations of all BSs are modeled by a Poisson point process. Using tools from stochastic geometry, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distribution with cooperation is precisely characterized in a generality-preserving form. The result is then applied to practical design problems of recent interest. We find that increasing the network-wide BS density improves the SINR, while the gains increase with the path loss exponent. For pilot-based channel estimation, the average spectral efficiency saturates at cluster sizes of around 7 BSs for typical values, irrespective of backhaul quality. Finally, it is shown that intra-cluster frequency reuse is favorable in moderately loaded cells with generous cooperation activation, while intra-cluster coordinated scheduling may be better in lightly loaded cells with conservative cooperation activation.

The network geometry is modelled by random geometric graphs, and the locations of network nodes by point processes on the edges of these graphs. In particular, the locations of high-level components (HLC) are modeled by Cox processes concentrated on the edge sets of random graphs, where their serving zones are the cells of Voronoi tessellations induced by these Cox processes. The locations of low-level components (LLC) are either modeled by planar Poisson processes or by Cox processes concentrated on the same edge sets as the HLC.

40|$|Abstract-Outcrop {{observations}} and laboratory experiments show that many small chevron folds form by interference of monoclinal kink bands in multilayer buckling. Kink-band interference {{has also been}} proposed for some map-scale folds. Furthermore, fault-related folding provides additional mechanisms of monoclinal fold generation, other than buckling, and thus makes kink-band interference all the more conceptually plausible as a significant large-scale process. In this paper we document several relatively simple examples of map-scale monoclinal fold interference, including three interfering monoclines of the Colorado Plateau, a seismically-imaged example in the Perdido foldbelt of the Gulf of Mexico, and a more complex example from seismic mapping in the Santa Barbara Channel, California.

40|$|In North Canterbury, on the SE {{edge of the}} New Zealand plate {{boundary}} zone, deformation in late Cretaceous and younger cover rocks is complex. Detailed mapping of the cover sequence (which is about 1 km. thick), has revealed a pattern of synchronous faulting and folding about orthogonal E-ESE and N-NNE orientations younger than early Pleistocene. Complex and irregular basin and dome fold interference patterns are defined by distinctive limestone marker horizons, and partial star, triangular and corrugated hose fold surface geometries (defined by structure contours) are common. These geometries are often associated with folds that vary in shape along their hinge line and secondary folds developed oblique to the main interfering fold sets. Fold <b>interference</b> <b>geometries</b> are also characterised by composite conical geometries, composed of several distinct cone segments. Folding in the cover sequence has developed in response to: (1) fault propagation and displacement in the basement; and, (2) shortening within the fault bounded blocks. The folds related to faulting are asymmetric and parallel the major faults. Fold amplitudes of 0. 5 - 1. 6 km. are proportional to vertical fault displacements, and wavelengths of 5 - 20 km. are approximately equal to the strike-normal distances between the major faults. Fold interference patterns are indicative of the styles and levels of activity of the orthogonal faulting. Analysis of fault and slickenside striation geometries suggests that faulting is dominated by oblique-reverse faults and thrusts, which verge north, south, east and west. Interspersed with the regional contractional faulting are, local areas of E-ESE oblique-normal faults, inferred to be reactivated late Cretaceous structures. Computed stress tensors derived from minor fault motion {{data suggest that the}} principal stress axes most commonly plunge at shallow to moderate angles. Locally they have variable orientations but regionally these data imply a predominant NW-SE compression, comparable to local geodetic shortening and focal mechanism compression directions. Geometric and spatial analysis of large numbers of sets of small scale, mainly brittle structures, documents the local history of deformation. Multiple joint, pressure solution seam and stylolite, macrofracture and mesofault sets record only two periods of deformation since the mid-Cenozoic. The first was a weak regional mid-late Oligocene compression; the second involving a NW-SE compression since the Pliocene. Post Pliocene deformation is characterised by initial NW-SE shortening, followed by approximate N-S and E-W shortening associated with folding. The sequence of structural development during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene implies a progressive increase in the intensity of deformation and a rapid widening of the {{plate boundary}} zone during the last 2 - 3 ma.

40|$|Abstract—In {{heterogeneous}} cellular networks (HCNs), {{the interference}} received at a user is correlated over time slots since {{it comes from}} the same set of randomly located BSs. This results in the correlations of link successes, thus affect-ing network performance. Under the assumptions of a K-tier Poisson network, strongest-candidate based BS association, and independent Rayleigh fading, we first quantify the correlation coefficients of interference. We observe that the interference correlation is independent of the number of tiers, BS density, SIR threshold, and transmit power. Then, we study the correlations of link successes in terms of the joint success probability over multiple time slots. We show that the joint success probability is decided by the success probability in a single time slot and a diversity polynomial, which represents the temporal interference correlation. Moreover, the parameters of HCNs have an impor-tant influence on the joint success probability by affecting the success probability in a single time slot. Particularly, we obtain the condition under which the joint success probability increases with the BS density and transmit power. We further show that the conditional success probability given prior successes only depends on the path loss exponent and the number of time slots.

40|$|Abstract—While the {{performance}} of maximum ratio com-bining (MRC) is well understood for a single isolated link, the same is not true {{in the presence of}} interference, which is typically correlated across antennas due to the common locations of interferers. For tractability, prior work focuses on the two extreme cases where the interference power across antennas is either assumed to be fully correlated or fully uncorrelated. In this paper, we address this shortcoming and characterize {{the performance}} of MRC in the presence of spatially-correlated interference across antennas. Modeling the interference field as a Poisson point process, we derive the exact distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) for the case of two receive antennas, and upper and lower bounds for the general case. Using these results, we study the diversity behavior of MRC and characterize the critical density of simultaneous transmissions for a given outage constraint. The exact SIR distribution is also useful in benchmarking simpler correlation models. We show that the full-correlation assumption is considerably pessimistic (up to 30 % higher outage probability for typical values) and the no-correlation assumption is significantly optimistic compared to the true performance.

Uplink training with pilot reusing is adopted to acquire the channel state information (CSI) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) or zero forcing (ZF) reception is used for handling multiuser <b>interference.</b> Leveraging stochastic <b>geometry</b> to model the spatial distribution of UEs, we analyze the statistical distributions of the interferences experienced by a typical uplink: intra-cell interference, inter-cell interference and interference due to pilot contamination. For a practical but still large number of BS antennas, a key observation for MRC reception is that it is the intra-cell interference that accounts for the dominant portion of the total interference. In addition, the interference due to pilot contamination tends to have a much wider distribution range than the inter-cell interference when shadowing is strong, although their mean powers are roughly equal. For ZF reception, on the other hand, we observe a significant reduction of the intra-cell interference compared to MRC reception, while the inter-cell interference and the interference due to pilot contamination remains almost the same, thus demonstrating a substantial superiority over MRC reception.

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} dual-hop relaying with DF and AF protocols in a wireless ad hoc {{network in the}} presence of both interference and noise. Each interfering node in the network independently transmits data and is randomly distributed in a Poisson law over a plane. The motivation behind imposing Poisson interference and noise is threefold: (i) many previous works neglected either interference or noise in analysis of a relay network; (ii) previous work on relay networks with interference considered {{only a limited number of}} interferers (iii) randomly distributed nodes(i.e., interferers) allowing a Poisson distribution are suitable for realistic communication model. To the best of our knowledge, relay network to qualify <b>interference</b> using stochastic <b>geometry</b> has not been addressed before. Hence, we analyze exact outage probability of a dual-hop relay with both noise and interference in a wireless ad hoc network. Unlike previous work in a relay network, when the node locations are distributed as a Poisson point process (PPP), we need to analyze relay networks using a metric for decentralized wireless network, termed transmission capacity. Furthermore, as transmission capacity has considered single-hop transmission without noise, we focus on the transmission capacity of dual-hop relay with noise and specific relaying protocols. It is worth of finding maximum successful transmitting nodes per unit area to satisfy outage probability and data rate from transmission capacity of dual-hop relay. Although both noise and interference with Poisson distribution are considered, it is noted that dual-hop relay is still beneficial in terms of transmission capacity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Spatial Aloha is {{probably}} the simplest medium access protocol {{to be used in}} a large mobile ad hoc network: each station tosses a coin independently of everything else and accesses the channel if it gets heads. In a network where stations are randomly and homogeneously located in the Euclidean plane, {{there is a way to}} tune the bias of the coin so as to obtain the best possible compromise between spatial reuse and per transmitter throughput. This paper shows how to address this questions using stochastic geometry and more precisely Poisson shot noise field theory. The theory that is developed is fully computational and leads to new closed form expressions for various kinds of spatial averages (like e. g. outage, throughput or transport). It also allows one to derive general scaling laws that hold for general fading assumptions. We exemplify its flexibility by analyzing a natural variant of Spatial Aloha that we call Opportunistic Aloha and that consists in replacing the coin tossing by an evaluation of the quality of the channel of each station to its receiver and a selection of the stations with good channels (e. g. fading) conditions. We show how to adapt the general machinery to this variant and how to optimize and implement it. We show that when properly tuned, Opportunistic Aloha very significantly outperforms Spatial Aloha, with e. g. a mean throughput per unit area twice higher for Rayleigh fading scenarios with typical parameters.

40|$|Abstract—Propagation {{delays in}} {{underwater}} acoustic networks can be large {{as compared to}} the packet size. Conventional medium access control protocol design for such networks focuses on mitigation of the impact of propagation delay. Most proposed protocols to date achieve, at best, a throughput {{similar to that of the}} zero propagation delay scenario. In this paper, we systematically explore the possibility that propagation delays can be exploited to make throughput far exceed that of networks without propagation delay. Under the assumptions of the protocol model in a single collision domain for a half-duplex unicast network, we show that the upper bound of throughput in an N-node wireless network with propagation delay is N/ 2. We illustrate network geometries where this bound can be achieved and study transmission schedules that help achieve it. We show that for any network, the optimal schedule is periodic and present a computationally efficient algorithm to find good schedules. Finally, we show that N-node network geometries that achieve throughput close to the N/ 2 bound exist for any N and present a lower bound on achievable maximum throughput for bounded geometries. This paper chiefly endeavors to explore the impact and potential of nonzero propagation delays on network throughput. We believe that the novel observations in this paper could motivate further research into this area, especially random access networks with large propagation delay, with a fundamentally changed outlook on maximum achievable throughput. This could lead to novel scheduling and network configuration approaches with applications in underwater and satellite networks.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is {{to bridge the gap between}} CAD modeling and kinematic analysis packages by extracting kinematic information directly from part genometries. It will relieve the designers from the tedious task of specifying assembly constraints and specifying redundant information for creating kinematic models. Automatic generation of kinematic assembly models is achieved by characterizing the lower kinematic pairs: cylindrical, spherical, prismatic, planar and revolute; from the geometries point of view. Based on characterization, the algorithms are developed to recognize these kinematic pairs from a pair of part genometries. The combinations of primitive genometric entities: vertices, edges and faces; forming point, line, arc and surface contacts are studied. The signature geometry is found to be associated with each type of joint. The contacts are analysed for restraining the relative motion between a pair of parts. Based on this, the form closure conditions are derived for surface, line, arc and point contacts for each type of joint. The algorithms are developed to automatically recognize these joints and to assemble them into a kinematic assembly model represented as a graph. The strength and novelty of the present procedure is that kinematic pairs can be recognized for conforming as well as non conforming genometries. A Visual Basic for Application (VBA) for Solid Works has been developed using Application Programming Interface (API) for user interaction. The part genometries can be in any 3 D solid modeling neutral file format (. sat,. igs, etc) or some of the native formats of CAD softwares supported by Solid Works.

The implementation of interference phenomena and the development in experimental investigations applied in inhomogeneous, anisotropic, shape variant, multilayered, multicomposition cultural heritage objects, paves the way to implement “fringe patterns” as a scaleless (scale independent) diagnostic detector allowing generation of novel tools and practices on problem solving projects. The developments are beyond the specific application and are extended to other fields of science and technology. The articles and bibliography cited within the text including author's publications utilised as sources in the writing of this thesis are referenced in square brackets and are explicitly listed in ANNEX I The list of publications of the author is shown in ANNEX II. The originals of author's publications supporting the thesis are provided after the Annex II as have been published. Due to limitation in number of pages there is not included a section to present the fundamental principles of the phenomena presented here instead a list of books commonly found in most University libraries is provided for interested readers as BIBLIOGRAPHY at the last paragraphs of ANNEX I...|$|R
