Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>ears.</b> And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.|$|E
5|$|The breed is the {{smallest}} of the sporting dogs recognised by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately recognisable. In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an ideal working dog. Members of the breed suffer {{from a wide variety of}} health ailments including problems with their hearts, <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E

5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>ears</b> are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E

5|$|In Lightning Returns, Hope {{resides in}} a special base {{constructed}} within the new Cocoon called the Ark, communicating with Lightning via a wireless com-link. Hope is returned to his 14-year-old image and stripped of his emotions by Bhunivelze, but retains his memories from the past two games. He is instrumental in keeping the world going, for as Lightning completes quests and fulfills missions, he uses energy generated from those acts to prolong the world's life. On the final day, Hope reveals that he acted as Bhunivelze's <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>ears,</b> and will now be disposed of. Bhunivelze then uses Hope as an avatar, speaking with Lightning and capturing her allies. During the final battle Lightning frees him from Bhunivelze's control, then Hope aids her in defeating Bhunivelze for good.|$|E
5|$|The {{action is}} {{compressed}} and truncated, beginning in medias res with Pandarus already working for Troilus and praising his virtues to Cressida over {{those of the}} other knights they see returning from battle, but comically mistaking him for Deiphobus. The Trojan lovers are together only one night before the hostage exchange takes place. They exchange a glove and a sleeve as love tokens, but the next night Ulysses takes Troilus to Calchas' tent, significantly near Menelaus' tent. There they witness Diomedes successfully seducing Cressida after taking Troilus' sleeve from her. The young Trojan struggles with what his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>ears</b> tell him, wishing not to believe it. Having previously considered abandoning the senselessness of war in favour of his role of lover and having then sought to reconcile love and knightly conduct, he is now left with war as his only role.|$|E

5|$|Gestation lasts {{nearly two}} to three months, {{following}} which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvark and porcupines. Kittens are born with their <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>ears</b> shut and the claws non-retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around {{the same time the}} kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them everyday. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{played a}} key role in the Australian-led {{international}} peacekeeping force (INTERFET) in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. In the days prior to the commencement of INTERFET, the SASR was involved in the RAAF evacuation of United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) staff, Australians and refugees from East Timor following increasing violence by Indonesian military-backed militia after the East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. The SASR subsequently provided the initial INTERFET forces to secure the point of entry at the airport and seaport in Dili. 3 Squadron, along with Allied Special Forces elements from the NZ SAS and British SBS, formed INTERFET's special forces element, known as Response Force (RESPFOR). The SASR spearheaded most operations conducted by the international force during the early days of the intervention in East Timor and, as in Vietnam, served as the <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>ears</b> of the force, patrolling extensively through militia-controlled areas in vehicles and on foot as INTERFET expanded to take control of the rest of East Timor. It was involved in a number of significant contacts with pro-Indonesian militia, including at Suai on 6 October 1999 during which two SASR soldiers were wounded, and later at Aidabasalala on 16 October 1999. On 22 October 1999, the SASR conducted a combined air insertion in Black Hawk helicopters and an amphibious landing from HMAS Brunei into the Oecusse Enclave to secure the beachhead ahead of an amphibious assault by the main force, after the insertion of Navy Clearance Divers by submarine the previous night to conduct a reconnaissance and survey of the amphibious landing site. It was reported that the SASR also conducted covert patrols in the Enclave before the landings. Other tasks included VIP protection and other special forces tasks as required by the task force commander. 3 Squadron was later awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation on 25 March 2000. 1 Squadron replaced 3 Squadron in December 1999, and completed its tour in February 2000.|$|E
