5|$|Jeff Jarrett {{defended the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Monty Brown {{in the main}} event. Near the closing minutes, Brown grabbed a guitar, which Jarrett had tried to use earlier, and bashed Jarrett {{over the head with}} it. Jarrett {{retained}} the championship in the bout after performed a maneuver he named the Stroke three times by grabbing Brown's head, and tucking his leg between Brown's two. He follows by extending Brown's near arm and tripping him to force <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the mat. Jarrett then pinned Brown to end the match.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama {{tries to}} track her down using her résumé, but as Yoshikawa warned, {{all of the}} {{contacts}} are dead ends. At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man sticks <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the vomit and hungrily consumes it.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which {{defending}} champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a cello. Jarrett went to hit Nash with the cello, however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken cello {{and placed it on}} the canvass. He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the cello to perform what he dubbed the Jackknife Powerbomb. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. Monty Sopp then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, which led to a fight between the two. After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. Sean Waltman then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them. A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him to fall and force <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the canvass, which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the Stroke. Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

60|$|He put {{his hand}} down firmly on the table, and set <b>his</b> sunburnt <b>face</b> <b>into</b> a {{resolute}} expression.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} the constable {{appeared}} about to go, and then <b>his</b> <b>face</b> expanded <b>into</b> a genial grin.|$|R
25|$|The second {{match was}} a tag team match between {{the team of}} Johnny Weaver and Scott McGhee, and the team of Kevin Sullivan and Mark Lewin (accompanied by Gary Hart). The match started back and forth until Sullivan and Lewin gained the {{advantage}} over McGhee by targeting his left arm. McGhee and Weaver fought back when Weaver performed a bulldog on Sullivan, sending <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the canvas. Weaver attempted another bulldog, but Sullivan pushed him into the corner. Lewin performed a knee drop from the top turnbuckle on Weaver's left arm as Hart and Sullivan held onto him. Lewin then pinned Weaver to win the match. After the match, Lewin and Sullivan beat down McGhee and lacerated his forehead with a foreign object provided by Hart. Angelo Mosca attempted to help McGhee, but was also attacked.|$|E
500|$|In Twelfth Night (1600–1601), Shakespeare {{alluded to}} the Wright–Molyneux Map when Maria says of Malvolio: [...] "He does smile <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> more lynes, than is in the new Mappe, with the {{augmentation}} of the Indies." ...|$|E
500|$|Accidents also {{happened}} in stunts {{that did not}} involve weapons. A stuntman smashed <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> a camera while riding a horse at full gallop, and Schwarzenegger was attacked {{by one of the}} trained dogs. The use of live animals also raised concerns about cruelty; the American Humane Association placed the film on its [...] "unacceptable list". The transgressions listed by the association included the kicking of a dog, the striking of a camel, and the tripping of horses.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tillotson looked up, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> {{puckered}} <b>into</b> a smile, {{and nodded}} his head in affirmation of his words.|$|R
60|$|He {{took a quick}} stride forward. He thrust <b>his</b> <b>face</b> almost <b>into</b> hers. She {{drew back}} with a gesture of disgust.|$|R
60|$|Lord Pabham {{stared at}} Clovis {{for a moment}} in pardonable bewilderment; then <b>his</b> <b>face</b> broke <b>into</b> a {{wrinkled}} network of laughter.|$|R
500|$|Eddie escapes by {{transforming}} <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> {{that of the}} booking cop {{and knocking}} him out with {{a blow to the}} head. Mulder and Scully visit his father, who still has his tail and is a former circus performer. Mulder and Scully soon realize that he's actually Eddie when he addresses Mulder by name without having been introduced. The agents give chase but Eddie escapes. He then transforms into one of the husbands of the women he had previously slept with and goes and hides out in their house. When the real husband comes home early, he next transforms into Mulder and leaves the couple seriously confused. Mulder and Scully meanwhile discover the dried up body of Eddie's actual father hidden up in the attic, thoroughly desiccated. Performing an autopsy on the body, Scully finds that he has an extra sheet of supple muscle under his skin, which Mulder believes Eddie also inherited and can use to transform his appearance.|$|E
500|$|The first map to be {{prepared}} according to Wright's projection was published in his book, and showed the route of Cumberland's expedition to the Azores. A manuscript version of this map is preserved at Hatfield House; it {{is believed to have}} been drawn about 1595. Following this, Wright created a new world map, the first map of the globe to be produced in England and the first to use the Mercator projection since Gerardus Mercator's 1569 original. Based on Molyneux's terrestrial globe, it corrected a number of errors in the earlier work by Mercator. The map, often called the Wright–Molyneux Map, first appeared in the second volume of Richard Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation (1599). Unlike many contemporary maps and charts which contained fantastic speculations about unexplored lands, Wright's map has a minimum of detail and blank areas wherever information was lacking. The map was one of the earliest to use the name [...] "Virginia". Shakespeare alluded to the map in Twelfth Night (1600–1601), when Maria says of Malvolio: [...] "He does smile <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> more lynes, than is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies." [...] Another world map, larger and with updated details, appeared in the second edition of Certaine Errors (1610).|$|E
2500|$|On a Friday evening, Cromartie forces Dr. Lyman, {{a plastic}} surgeon, to sculpt <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> {{the same as}} another patient the doctor had already treated—unemployed actor, George Laszlo (Garret Dillahunt); after {{receiving}} his surgery Cromartie kills the doctor and leaves. [...] The recurring Agent Ellison arrives on the murder scene as it's tied to his previous cases by Cromartie's mysterious faux blood. [...] Investigating the real Mr. Laszlo, his blood does not match that at the scenes, and he is released by the FBI only to be killed and replaced by the doppelgänger Cromartie.|$|E

60|$|Then Duncombe became grave. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> fell <b>into</b> firm, hard lines. Yet as {{he spoke}} there was {{something}} boyish about his expression.|$|R
2500|$|Of several 299 {{games that}} were bowled on {{televised}} championships, {{the most memorable}} occurred on April 4, 1970 when Don Johnson defeated Dick Ritger to win the 1970 Firestone Tournament of Champions at Riviera Lanes in Fairlawn, Ohio. [...] With 11 strikes already down, he threw his 12th ball, stepped back and dropped to the floor. [...] The ball hit the pocket, but the 10-pin remained standing. [...] Johnson, still on the floor, briefly lowered <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> his hands, then stood up to a thunderous ovation. Johnson's wife Mary Anne was also crying prior to the shot, and crying even more after Johnson {{got up from the}} floor. Along with the trophy and $25,000 check from Firestone, Johnson also received the 10-pin that denied him both an extra $10,000 and a new Mercury Cougar automobile for a perfect game (In the post-match interview with the Johnsons, Mary Anne was holding the pin). [...] The footage of this has been replayed many dozens of times in flashback segments on PBA telecasts. The online bowling channel Xtra Frame has named this the most memorable moment of the events history.|$|E
60|$|A look of fear {{came into}} his eyes, and he sank <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> his hands.|$|E

60|$|Little Sir John ground his teeth, {{and twisted}} <b>his</b> pippen-like <b>face</b> <b>into</b> a scowl that looked absurdly {{out of place}} on {{anything}} so jovial.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} looked up. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> flashed <b>into</b> a broad smile. [...] "Hello! Brad Talcott, by thunder! Well, well. When'd you get back?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was getting}} hot. Sweat trickled down <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>into</b> his collar. His mouth was dry.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Ogle {{was growing}} impatient. His arm still gripped by Blood, he thrust <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> the Captain's.|$|E
60|$|Gerald drew <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> {{a horrible}} {{caricature}} of the {{expression in the}} portrait, and set his sister laughing.|$|E

60|$|He {{laughed and}} <b>his</b> <b>face</b> melted <b>into</b> {{a mass of}} wrinkles. Nedda laughed also and drank {{up the rest of}} her wine. She felt blissful.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly <b>his</b> <b>face</b> broke <b>into</b> a {{smile of}} {{profound}} melancholy, almost a grin, like a gargoyle. It was the real Italian melancholy, very deep, static.|$|R
60|$|He screwed <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>into</b> an {{intended}} {{likeness of}} Ethel's imitation of an orchis, winked one eye, and looked comical.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sophia!" [...] Thick eyebrows {{were raised}} until they almost met {{the line of}} his {{ponderous}} peruke. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> broke <b>into</b> malevolent creases expressive of contempt.|$|R
60|$|He came in {{at eleven}} o'clock, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> knotted <b>into</b> anxious lines. They {{smoothed}} out as his eyes fell upon Mary, who met him in the hall.|$|R
60|$|Mabane, too, was for {{a moment}} sad and silent. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> fell <b>into</b> stern lines, but when he {{answered}} me his tone was steady and resolute enough.|$|R
