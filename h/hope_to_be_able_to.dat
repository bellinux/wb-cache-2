25|$|The {{relationship}} of an increasing fractal dimension with space-filling {{might be taken}} to mean fractal dimensions measure density, {{but that is not}} so; the two are not strictly correlated. Instead, a fractal dimension measures complexity, a concept related to certain key features of fractals: self-similarity and detail or irregularity. These features are evident in the two examples of fractal curves. Both are curves with topological dimension of 1, so one might <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> measure their length or slope, as with ordinary lines. But we cannot do either of these things, because fractal curves have complexity in the form of self-similarity and detail that ordinary lines lack. The self-similarity lies in the infinite scaling, and the detail in the defining elements of each set. The length between any two points on these curves is undefined because the curves are theoretical constructs that never stop repeating themselves. Every smaller piece is composed of an infinite number of scaled segments that look exactly like the first iteration. These are not rectifiable curves, meaning they cannot be measured by being broken down into many segments approximating their respective lengths. They cannot be characterized by finding their lengths or slopes. However, their fractal dimensions can be determined, which shows that both fill space more than ordinary lines but less than surfaces, and allows them to be compared in this regard.|$|E

Four of these vessels however were captured and carried into Abu Qir Bay with only one escaping to the coast of Italy. On the 6th of June Colonel Lloyd with his detachment of the 86th regiment numbering about 150 men set out to march across the desert to Cairo a distance by a route intended to be taken in order to avoid meeting a superior force. By the 10th these men joined Colonel John Stewart's detachment which was to be attached to Yusuf Pashas' (the Grand Vizier) army on the right bank of the Nile.|$|E

2500|$|The York Factory Whistle {{holds the}} world record for the loudest music without {{amplification}} from a non-musical instrument. Every Christmas Eve the whistle uses a compressor to create air pressure, then releases it {{through a series of}} tubes using a device much like a slide whistle.

Various Christmas music is played for a short time around midnight. It is thought that this annual tradition was started around 1925. After the hosting New York Wire Cloth Company plant closed in 2013, Metso moved the whistle to their factory in York and the annual concert tradition has continued.
