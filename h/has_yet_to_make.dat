5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a sale is because he thinks he knows everything, and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E

Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss Howard Wagner {{to allow him to}} work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda that their son, Biff, <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> good on his life. Despite Biff's promising showing as an athlete in high school, he failed in mathematics and was unable to enter a university.|$|E
25|$|Sebastopol meadowfoam {{habitat is}} {{threatened}} {{by a number of}} human activities, particularly urbanization spreading out from nearby cities Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park and Cotati. In spring 2005, a controversy erupted when the plant was reported at the site of a proposed commercial/residential development project within the boundary of the City of Sebastopol known as Laguna Vista. State wildlife officials concluded that the meadowfoam had been deliberately transplanted from elsewhere, presumably to block the development project, and ordered the plants to be dug up. Opponents of the project disagreed and have presented testimony from experts who argue that the state used incomplete analysis to arrive at its finding. In spring 2006, the plants reappeared, although officials said they had likely sprouted from seeds scattered the previous year. Sebastopol's city council <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a final decision regarding the Laguna Vista project.|$|E
25|$|Hou has {{attempted}} to balance chess with life outside of it. She enrolled in Peking University in 2012, studying International Relations, against the wishes of her trainer. She took a full course load and participated in many extracurricular activities; after graduation she applied to and was accepted by the University of Chicago for a masters in social work. Compared to the best professional male players who dedicate their lives to chess, Hou's split focus puts her as a disadvantage, {{and as a consequence}} her results against them have been lackluster. These competitors give her credit for what she has achieved in spite of her lack of preparation, and for her life outside of chess. However, they recognize that while Hou can probably remain the best female player in the world without extra effort, she cannot compete with the best male players unless she dedicates herself to chess. Hou is aware of this as well, but <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the choice.|$|E

500|$|The Albums 2000–2010 {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most reviewers. A writer from The Sun awarded the box set a perfect five star rating, stating [...] "Whether you like hot-pant Kylie, indie Kylie, girl-next-door Kylie or dark Kylie, there's something for every Kylie fan {{in this special}} box-set. Made up of five albums and celebrating ten years of tunes, we challenge you {{to get them out}} of your head." [...] Scott Harrah from Stagezine awarded the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, but did not review the box set; instead, he reviewed each album individually because [...] "all [...] are so different in both sound and concept." [...] Jon O'Brien from AllMusic awarded the album three-and-a-half stars, labelling her earlier work as [...] "infectious". Despite being critical towards the lack of inclusion of her 1994–1998 Deconstruction work, and the inclusion of her albums, X, and Aphrodite, he concluded [...] "Kylie <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." ...|$|E
500|$|Wave 1 {{received}} generally positive reviews {{upon its}} release; the EP holds a weighted mean of an aggregate 69 out of 100 from Metacritic based on six reviews, indicating that, {{according to the}} site, the album's critical reception was favorable in general. Daniel Sylvester of Exclaim! called the EP [...] "looser, more focused and much more imaginative" [...] that Com Truise's past work, writing that while the artist <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> [...] "a truly transcendent piece of art, Wave 1 shows the young beatmaker in transition, fearlessly searching for his definitive sound." [...] Similarly, Sputnikmusic reviewer hyperion praised Wave 1 for making a unique new sound with the chillwave palette instead of having limits from the genre, assuming that it could've been {{the peak of the}} microgenre if the record's other songs were as good as [...] "Valis (Called Control)" [...] and [...] "Subsonic". Mark Jenkins reviewed it for The Washington Post, and mainly highlighted its unpredictable melodic and rhythmic moments, while Pat Levy, reviewing for Consequence of Sound, honored Haley for getting out of his comfort zone while still having the same sounds and style of his past records. Pitchfork Media's Paul Thompson liked the EP as [...] "a mostly welcome return," [...] but criticized its focus of having perfectly-detailed sound instead of new musical ideas.|$|E
500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{with a number of}} honorific nicknames. She has been compared to American recording artist Madonna in many media outlets, with Madonna identified as Queen of Pop and Minogue as the Princess of Pop. Birmingham Post said in 2000; [...] "nce upon a time, long before anybody had even heard of Britney, Christina, Jessica or Mandy, Australian singer Kylie Minogue ruled the charts as princess of pop. Back in 1988 her first single, I Should Be So Lucky, spent five weeks at number one, making her the most successful female artist in the UK charts with 13 successive Top 10 entries." [...] She is sometimes referred to as the Goddess of Pop/Pop Goddess. She has also been dubbed a Disco Queen. William Baker, co-author of her book , talking about her song [...] "Better the Devil You Know", commented, [...] "The track transferred well onto the dance-floor and heralded a long reign for Kylie as the new queen of disco... a pop princess." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic reviewed her box-set [...] and stated [...] "Kylie <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." [...] In November 2011, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards, she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Many celebrities have named Minogue as a role model. Many media outlets have said many people, particularly woman, have undergone regular checks for cancer symptoms since her breast cancer diagnosis. In December 2006, Sugar named her the Most Inspirational Celebrity as voted by teenage girls. Editor of the magazine Annabel Brog stated, [...] " [...] couldn't be any more inspirational. She's friendly, gorgeous, talented – and this year she's shown just how strong she is too." [...] Television host Giuliana Rancic cited Minogue's cancer story as [...] "inspirational" [...] when she too was diagnosed with cancer. She said, [...] "When you get diagnosed, you don't know what to do… you Google. I went online and I read your story, and it gave me the strength to go public as well." [...] Musical entertainers who have cited Minogue as an influence include September, Diana Vickers, Paris Hilton, and The Veronicas.|$|E

2500|$|After the United States Federal Aviation Administration {{downgraded}} Israel's {{aviation safety}} rating to 2 in February 2009, an IATA member has warned El Al, {{as well as}} competing airlines Arkia and Israir, that they may appear on the European blacklist of banned carriers. Giora Romm, head of the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel, responded to the claim, stating: [...] "We are {{in close contact with}} the Europeans," [...] He added, [...] "I don't know what the fuss is about.

2500|$|Woods {{returned}} to tournament play in early August, following a break of 11 weeks, at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, {{where he is}} a seven-time champion. He had Bryon Bell as caddy; Bell is a childhood friend, former high school golf teammate, and current employee of Tiger Woods Design; Bell had caddied for Woods on several previous occasions, dating back to amateur golf. Woods stated in a pre-tournament press conference that Bell is serving temporarily as his caddie, and that he <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a decision on a permanent replacement for Williams. Woods also stated he is [...] "completely healthy". He tied for 37th place after rounds of 68-70-71-70, as Adam Scott won with a 17-under-par total 263.

2500|$|Leo Steinberg's {{controversial}} The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion {{points out}} that, [...] "Renaissance Art ... {{became the first}} Christian art in a thousand years to confront the Incarnation entire, the upper and the lower body together, not excluding even the body's sexual component." [...] He goes on to reference several works in which Christ's genitals are {{the focal point of}} the image, intentionally, so as to counter a heresy denying Christ's humanity. [...] He indicates that the sexuality of Christ – of God – is indeed within the canon of Catholicism itself. This controversy continues into the contemporary Catholic religion as well, revealing still a deep-seated uneasiness over how fleshly an imagination is too fleshly an imagination. [...] Greeley makes this point:The propensity to protect God from profanation, at the heart of the dialectical imagination, is very strong even among Catholics because official Catholicism <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up its mind whether it really believes that sexual passion is not in itself lewd or lustful.Postmodern artists and artists today, influenced by the Catholic imagination, who are using aspects of the body to pose their questions to society, are frequently working out of the inherently complex contradictions of sacramental vision.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{difficult}} to suppose that he had {{read some of the}} works on which he passes a summary sentence. The comedy of Love's Riddle, which he says, [...] "adds little to the wonders of Cowley's minority," [...] deserved to be commended at least for the style, which is a specimen of pure and unaffected English. Of Congreve's novel, he tells us, that he had rather praise it than read it. Judging from the letters of Congreve, his only writings in prose which it has been my good fortune to meet with, and which, as I remember, contain some admirable remarks on the distinction between wit and humour, I should conclude that one part of his character as a writer <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> its way to the public notice. I have heard it observed by a lady, that Johnson, in his Life of Milton, is like a dog incensed and terrified at the presence of some superior creature, at whom he snarls, then runs away, and then returns to snarl again. If the comparison be a just one, it may be added, in extenuation of Johnson's malignity, that he is at least a dog who thinks himself to be attacking the inveterate foe of his master; for Milton's hostility to a kingly government was the crime which he could not forgive.|$|E
