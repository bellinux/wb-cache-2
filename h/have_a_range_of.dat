5|$|The content, organization, and {{updating}} of {{the vocabulary}} on an SGD {{is influenced by}} a number of factors, such at the user's needs and the contexts that the device will be used in. The development of techniques to improve the available vocabulary and rate of speech production is an active research area. Vocabulary items should be of high interest to the user, be frequently applicable, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> meanings, and be pragmatic in functionality.|$|E
5|$|The {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were asymmetrical. This {{has been interpreted}} as evidence {{that it was a}} flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> asymmetry in their feathers, and that the {{feathers of}} Archaeopteryx fall into this range. The degree of asymmetry seen in Archaeopteryx is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} {{threat to}} mass-producing plants for harvest is their susceptibility to diseases. Wild species <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> genetic variability that allows some individuals to survive should a disturbance occur. In agriculture, resistance through variability is compromised, since genetically uniform seeds are planted under uniform conditions. Monocultural agriculture thus causes low crop diversity, {{especially when the}} seeds are mass-produced or when plants (such as grafted fruit trees and banana plants) are cloned. A single pest or disease could threaten a whole crop due to this uniformity. A well-known historic case was the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-1847, where a vital crop with low diversity was destroyed by a single fungus. Another example is when a disease caused by a fungus affected the monocultured 1970 US corn crop, causing a loss of over one billion dollars in production.|$|E
5000|$|Hyunmoo-3A, {{which was}} nicknamed [...] "Eagle-1" [...] (독수리-1) during the testing, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 500 km, while Hyunmoo-3B, nicknamed [...] "Eagle-2" [...] (독수리-2), <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 1,000 km. Hyunmoo-3C, or [...] "Eagle-3" [...] (독수리-3), will {{be capable of}} {{striking}} its target up to 1,500 km away. This is a significant improvement from Hyunmoo I which <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 180 km and Hyunmoo-2A, which only <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 300 km, {{both of which were}} ballistic and not cruise missiles.|$|R

The HN-1 <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 600 km, the HN-2 <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 1,800 km, and the HN-3 <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 3,000 km.|$|R
50|$|Tropomi will {{be taking}} {{measurements}} every second covering an area of approximately 2600km wide and 7km long in a resolution of 7x7km. Light will be separated into different wavelengths using grating spectrometers and then measured with four different detectors for respective spectral bands. The UV spectrometer <b>has</b> <b>a</b> spectral <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 270-320nm, the visible light spectrometer <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 310-500nm, NIR <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 675-775nm, and SWIR <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 2305-2385nm.|$|R
5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- the cell {{membrane}} (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded {{by one or more}} lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.|$|E
5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they {{must be aware of}} their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E
5|$|The leader Uruk will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> {{strengths}} and weaknesses, the latter {{that can be}} exploited in combat to quickly weaken and defeat the leader. The player can gain knowledge of these through finding intelligence mostly by draining and interrogating marked Uruks for this. Being able to exploit such weaknesses in defeating the leader will gain a better quality rune and more experience points in this manner. Once the player gains the ability to brand Uruks, they can brand these leaders and convert portions of Sauron's army to their side. At this point, the player can use the Nemesis system to trigger infighting within the Uruk forces which they can then directly participate in, helping to weaken the army further. Uruks that survive their encounter with Talion will remember this when Talion combats them again; for example, an Uruk who was thrown into a fire by Talion might want revenge on him for being disfigured.|$|E

5|$|New {{research}} indicates that many white dwarfs—at least in certain types of galaxies—may not approach that limit by way of accretion. It has been postulated {{that at least some}} of the white dwarfs that become supernovae attain the necessary mass by colliding with one another. It may be that in elliptical galaxies such collisions are the major source of supernovae. This hypothesis is based on the fact that the X-rays produced by those galaxies are 30 to 50 times less than what is expected to be produced by type Ia supernovas of that galaxy as matter accretes on the white dwarf from its encircling companion. It has been concluded that no more than 5 percent of the supernovae in such galaxies could be created by the process of accretion onto white dwarfs. The significance of this finding is that there could be two types of supernovae, which could mean that the Chandrasekhar limit might not always apply in determining when a white dwarf goes supernova, given that two colliding white dwarfs could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> masses. This in turn would confuse efforts to use exploding white dwarfs as standard candles in determining distances.|$|E
