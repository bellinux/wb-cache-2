40|$|Existing {{methods for}} single <b>document</b> {{summarization}} usually {{make use of}} only {{the information contained in}} the specified <b>document.</b> This paper proposes the technique of <b>document</b> expansion to provide more knowledge to help single <b>document</b> summarization. A specified <b>document</b> is expanded to a small <b>document</b> set by adding a few neighbor <b>documents</b> close to the <b>document,</b> and then the graphranking based algorithm is applied on the expanded <b>document</b> set for extracting sentences from the single <b>document,</b> by making use of both the within-document relationships between sentences of the specified <b>document</b> and the cross-document relationships between sentences of all <b>documents</b> in the <b>document</b> set. The experimental results on the DUC 2002 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on <b>document</b> expansion. The cross-document relationships between sentences in the expanded <b>document</b> set are validated to be very important for single <b>document</b> summarization...|$|R

Secondly, the hierarchical structure of <b>document</b> elements is extracted and is described using a DOM tree. Thirdly, this <b>document</b> structure is converted into a pivot XML <b>document</b> described as an XHTML <b>document</b> by an XML parser. Finally, this pivot XML <b>document</b> is transformed into the target XML <b>document</b> by the XML parser with XSLT scripts or specific programs.

40|$|Abstract: We {{proposed}} an algorithm {{to improve the}} precision of top retrieved <b>documents</b> by reordering the retrieved <b>documents</b> in the initial retrieval. To re-order the <b>documents,</b> we first automatically extract key terms and key phrases from top N retrieved <b>documents</b> and generate a <b>document</b> index for each <b>document.</b> Using the standard similarity metrics, a <b>document</b> similarity matrix is generated for these <b>documents.</b> The <b>document</b> similarity matrix is considered as an adjacency matrix, where the nodes are <b>documents</b> and the distances are their similarity measures. The objective of this algorithm is, to rerank the <b>documents</b> so as to minimize the similarity mean absolute distance between them. Moreover, the user can choose a <b>document</b> of interest as the seed <b>document</b> and initiate the reranking algorithm by which <b>documents</b> are reranked based on is similarity distance from the seed <b>document.</b> From the experimental results, it is demonstrated that the algorithm reduces the mean absolute difference. Further it is proved that the proposed reranking algorithm minimizes the mean absolute distance between the top N results obtained from search engines and helps users to rerank <b>documents</b> based on any seed <b>document</b> as a query.
