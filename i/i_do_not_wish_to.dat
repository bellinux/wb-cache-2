5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

500|$|The man was Dickson; {{the little}} movie, {{approximately}} three seconds long, is now {{referred to as}} Dickson Greeting. On August 24, three detailed patent applications were filed: the first for a [...] "Kinetographic Camera", the second for the camera as well, and the third for an [...] "Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects". In the first Kinetograph application, Edison stated, [...] "I {{have been able to}} take with a single camera and a tape-film as many as forty-six photographs per second...but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> limit the scope of my invention to this high rate of speed...since with some subjects a speed as low as thirty pictures per second or even lower is sufficient." [...] Indeed, according to the Library of Congress archive, based on data from a study by historian Charles Musser, Dickson Greeting and at least two other films made with the Kinetograph in 1891 were shot at 30 frames per second or even slower. The Kinetoscope application also included a plan for a stereoscopic film projection system that was apparently abandoned.|$|E
500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed. I {{have reason to believe}} they will attack us this night. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> conceal our real state, because I do not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger. We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

[...] The Italian traveler Nicolo Conti who visited the city in 1420 CE, estimated the circumference of the city to be sixty miles and was impressed by the strength of its fortifications.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these hostilities, Callas {{managed to}} {{continue}} and made her debut in {{a leading role in}} August 1942 as Tosca, going on to sing the role of Marta in Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland at the Olympia Theatre. Callas's performance as Marta received glowing reviews. Critic Spanoudi declared Callas [...] "an extremely dynamic artist possessing the rarest dramatic and musical gifts", and Vangelis Mangliveras evaluated Callas's performance for the weekly To Radiophonon:The singer who took the part of Marta, that new star in the Greek firmament, with a matchless depth of feeling, gave a theatrical interpretation well up to the standard of a tragic actress.

Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the wedding, and in their stead, they sent her brother, Crown Prince Frederick. Her brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales, had also travelled to Saint Petersburg for the ceremony; pregnancy had prevented the Princess of Wales from attending. After the wedding night, Alexander wrote in his diary, [...] "I took off my slippers and my silver embroidered robe and felt the body of my beloved next to mine... How I felt then, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> describe here. Afterwards we talked for a long time."

'At the end of The Progress Tour I began to question whether it might be the right time for me to not continue on with Take That,' he continued. 'There have been no fallings out, only a decision on my part that I no longer wish to do this,' he added. Barlow, Donald and Owen issued a joint statement about Orange's decision which said: [...] "This is a sad day for us. Jason leaving is a huge loss both professionally and even more so personally... Jason's energy and belief in what this band could achieve has made it what it is today, and we'll forever be grateful for his enthusiasm, dedication and inspiration over the years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orelli {{signed up}} for active duty {{at the age of}} 21 and joined the Austro-Hungarian front {{at the onset of the}} war in May 1915. Entrenched with the 320 Infantry Regiment, he served as a foot soldier within the Italian Army and engaged in combat {{activity}} in the trenches near Trieste, which was the main battleground in the east. He also participated in combat operations around the Isonzo river. In his autobiography, Orelli went into great detail about his experiences, including the large amount of casualties that he witnessed during his time in the trenches and widespread illiteracy among the peasant soldiers. He referred to them as having [...] "died in silence." [...] He also recalled many violent deaths, such as a friend who bled to death after his feet were severed and another who was decapitated in mid-conversation with Orelli. He remarked of episodes such as this that they were [...] "things <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> remember." ...|$|E

Later that year (2 November 1810), she {{was presented}} to the next elected heir to the throne, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. He regarded her with suspicion and believed that she did not wish to see him, but she commented: [...] "I am grateful for the sensitivity of the Crown prince, but he is mistaken, if he believe that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> see him! It would be unfair if I were to hold the least bit dislike toward him, for it is not he who has deposed my son!"

2500|$|Right upon {{setting up}} camp in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Romanian troops joined the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel-organized Einsatzgruppen in mass shootings of Bessarabian and Ukrainian Jews, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 10,000 to 20,000 people. Scholar Christopher R. Browning compares these killings with similar atrocities perpetrated by locals in Reichskommissariat Ukraine, Lithuania and Latvia (see Holocaust in Latvia, Holocaust in Lithuania, Holocaust in Ukraine). From then on, as the fighting troops progressed over the Dniester, the local administration deported large numbers of Jews into the fighting zone, in hopes that they would be exterminated by the Germans. Antonescu himself stated: [...] "I am in favor of expelling the Jews from Bessarabia and [...] Bukovina {{to the other side of}} the border [...] There is nothing for them to do here and I don't mind if we appear in history as barbarians [...] There has never been a time more suitable in our history to get rid of the Jews, and if necessary, you are to make use of machine guns against them." [...] He also explained that his aim was: [...] "the policy of purification of the Romanian race, and I will not give way before any obstacle in achieving this historical goal of our nation. If we do not take advantage of the situation which presents itself today [...] we shall miss the last chance that history offers to us. And <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> miss it, because if I do so further generations will blame me." [...] He made a contradictory statement about the murder of Jews in Chișinău, claiming that their perpetrators were [...] "bastards" [...] who [...] "stained" [...] his regime's reputation. Antonescu saw the [...] "war" [...] against the Jews as being just as important as the war against the Soviet Union, and regularly demanded reports from his officers in Bessarabia and Transnistria about their measures against the Jews. In late August 1941 in Tighina Antonescu called a secret conference attended by himself, the governors of Bessarabia and Bukovina and the governor-designate of Transnistria to discuss his plans regarding the Jews in those regions.|$|E
