"Yes, my Lord, {{the action}} of the thing is {{absolutely}} certain, if the distance of the object aimed at be ascertained to a nicety, and the arrangements of the watch-work indicator adjusted to those of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>wheel</b> and the pneumatic engine with mathematical precision. This, of course, in these days of thorough education, can be easily done by even the youngest officer in a ship. I should have mentioned, however, that if it were required to send the torpedo into a citadel or fortress on a hill, it would be necessary to use a stronger explosive than any yet known,--gun-cotton and dynamite being too weak, and nitro-glycerine too dangerous, therefore inadmissible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You observe, my Lord," [...] said I, {{pointing}} to my drawing, which lay {{spread out on}} the table, [...] "that this watch-work arrangement {{in the heart of the}} machine is so intimately connected with that lever and screw on its exterior, that in passing out of the case from which it is launched into the sea, the machinery is set in motion, and the first act of the torpedo is to set or regulate itself for the special purpose for which it is designed. Thus it may be styled an automatic torpedo. The celebrated Whitehead fish-torpedo, beautiful and cleverly contrived though it be, can only advance straight to its object at a certain depth below the surface; but mine, as you see, by this arrangement of the main pneumatic engine, which connects the watch-work regulator with an <b>eccentric</b> <b>wheel</b> or fin outside, causes the torpedo to describe a curve of any size, and in any direction, during its progress. Thus, if you wish to hit an enemy's vessel, but cannot venture to fire because of a friendly ship happening to lie between, you have only to set the eccentric indicator to the required curve, and send the torpedo on its mission of destruction right under the bottom of the friendly ship; or by laying the torpedo on its side, it will easily go round it, and afterwards hit the enemy." ...|$|E

50|$|Mickey's Fun Wheel is an <b>eccentric</b> <b>wheel,</b> differing from {{conventional}} Ferris wheels in that 16 of its 24 gondolas ride on interior rails {{so that they}} slide inward and outward as the wheel rotates.

50|$|The {{usefulness}} {{of such a}} system had been noted earlier, and experimental designs with raisable platforms or <b>eccentric</b> <b>wheels,</b> with built-in counterweights, were built or proposed. Some used paired guns, in which one cannon acted as the other's counterweight. An unsuccessful attempt at a disappearing carriage was King's Depression Carriage, designed by Rufus King, Jr. of the United States Army in the late 1860s. This used a counterweight to allow a 15-inch (381 mm) Rodman gun to be moved {{up and down a}} swiveling ramp, so the weapon could be reloaded, elevated, and traversed behind cover. It was not adopted. Part of a test installation at Fort Foote, Maryland remains. King's design was better suited for breech-loaders; had the US not had a plethora of new muzzle-loaders just after the Civil War it may have seen wider use.|$|R

50|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, not all threshing {{boards are}} equipped with stones: some have metal knife blades embedded along {{the full length of}} the threshing board, and others have smaller blades encrusted here and there. Threshing sledges with metal knives usually have a few small wheels (four to six, depending on the size) with <b>eccentric</b> axes. These <b>wheels</b> protect the blades. They also make the threshing board wobble, causing parts of the board to rise and fall at random in an oscillating motion that improves the effectiveness of the threshing.|$|R
50|$|A cam is a {{rotating}} or sliding piece in a mechanical linkage used especially in transforming rotary motion into linear motion or vice versa. It {{is often a}} part of {{a rotating}} wheel (e.g. an <b>eccentric</b> <b>wheel)</b> or shaft (e.g. a cylinder with an irregular shape) that strikes a lever at one or more points on its circular path. The cam can be a simple tooth, as is used to deliver pulses of power to a steam hammer, for example, or an eccentric disc or other shape that produces a smooth reciprocating (back and forth) motion in the follower, which is a lever making contact with the cam.|$|E
50|$|Waulis design {{describes}} a crank device and an adjusting device of a combustion engine. The system adjusts the cylinder {{pressure of the}} motor {{in accordance with the}} required power. Adjustment of the cylinder pressure is achieved by changing the compression ratio by means of the adjusting device. The adjusting device moves an <b>eccentric</b> <b>wheel</b> to a set position using an adjusting wheel; this results in the connecting rod moving the piston to a desired distance from the cylinder head. The adjusting device measures the volume of the air entering the cylinder and adjusts the compression ratio appropriately. The adjusting device also takes into account the speed of rotation to adjust the compression pressure accordingly.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{applications}} of graph theory in mathematics that determined the shortest path from one city to another {{that consists of}} several routes, or path from one city to another of an area. This problem is equal to determine the eccentricity of a vertex on the graph. Eccentricity vertex n is denoted by e(n) of a vertex n connected graph G {{is defined as the}} maximum distance (maximum shortest path) from vertex n to another vertex on the graph G, so that the eccentricity of the vertex n can be written e (n) = max d (n,i) | i  V (G). Vertex i is called eccentric vertex of n if the distance from n to i equal to the eccentricity of n or e (n) = d (i,n) with i ∈ V (G). Eccentric digraph is denoted as ED (G) that a graph has the same set of vertex with a set of vertex in G or V (ED (G)) = V (G) and there will be an arc mn in ED (G) if m is an eccentric vertex of n. The purpose of the research is to get the general shape eccentric digraphs of platonic graph and wheel graph also characteristics eccentric digraph the platonic graph and wheel graph. The result of research are. (1). Eccentric digraph of platonic graph (other than tetrahedron graph) is a digraph ED (P) = (E,V) with E(ED(P)) =(v_ 1 v_ 2) ⃡,(v_ 3 v_ 4) ⃡,Â…,(v_(n- 1) v_n) ⃡ where n is the number of vertex on the platonic graph and V(ED(P)) =V(P).

40|$|How to use {{control devices}} to enhance system {{identification}} and damage detection {{in relation to}} a structure that requires both vibration control and structural health monitoring is an interesting yet practical topic. In this study, the possibility of using the added stiffness provided by control devices and frequency response functions (FRFs) to detect damage in a building complex was explored experimentally. Scale models of a 12 -storey main building and a 3 -storey podium structure were built to represent a building complex. Given that the connection between the main building and the podium structure is most susceptible to damage, damage to the building complex was experimentally simulated by changing the connection stiffness. To simulate the added stiffness provided by a semi-active friction damper, a steel circular ring was designed and used to add the related stiffness to the building complex. By varying the connection stiffness using an <b>eccentric</b> <b>wheel</b> excitation system and by adding or not adding the circular ring, eight cases were investigated and eight sets of FRFs were measured. The experimental results were used to detect damage (changes in connection stiffness) using a recently proposed FRF-based damage detection method. The experimental results showed that the FRF-based damage detection method could satisfactorily locate and quantify damage. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
