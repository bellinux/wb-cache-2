These sleeves are a tool {{used to hold}} machine cutting tools or holders in the spindles of machines such as a drill or milling machine. The reamer shown is a <b>finishing</b> <b>reamer.</b> A roughing reamer would have serrations along the flutes {{to break up the}} thicker chips produced by the heavier cutting action used for it.|$|E
40|$|The MITCH PCRTM Cup is an {{evolution}} of the anatomic, flexible Cambridge Cup. The Cambridge Cup two layer mechanical interlock design has been converted to a mono-block structure, where the bearing articulation is formed of the same material as {{the bulk of the}} cup. The cup has an outer surface that should enhance long term bony fixation. The Cambridge Cup metal on polyethylene bearing has been changed to a ceramic on polyetheretherketone bearing. Prior to seeking Ethical Committee approval for the first MITCH PCRTM Cup clinical study, validation that the acetabulum could be prepared in a manner which would allow the MITCH PCRTM Cup to be implanted safely, was undertaken. This study describes the four phases of the validation process and the modification made to the cup design in order to ensure safe acetabular preparation. The first study investigated the effect of interference fit on cup deflection. An interference fit of O. 5 mm or less was required to ensure polar contact necessary for safe tribological performance. The second study examined the variability of socket dimensions achieved in foam blocks, using reamers provided by five different commercial manufacturers. Excessive socket undersizing was a common finding with all but the EPM reamers. These reamers were validated for accuracy and precision. In the third study, EPM reamers were used to ream cadaveric bone. The socket dimensions obtained were variable with an interference fit of up to 1. 8 mm obtained. Bony protrusions were observed which could also increase cup deflection and compromise proper cup seating. As a consequence, the cup internal geometry was modified to accommodate the spectrum of findings observed. The fourth study used the modified cups and a new reaming strategy comprising both conventional and custom MITCH PCRTM <b>finishing</b> <b>reamers</b> to achieve safe acetabular preparation. The results showed satisfactory clearance was achieved at the cup side arms in all cases. The reaming solution was appropriate for progression to the first clinical implantation. The surgical technique manual was completed and the cup was CE marked. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
