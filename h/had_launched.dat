5|$|Free-flights of Progress {{spacecraft}} typically lasted {{two days}} from launch to docking with Mir, however Progress M1-5 took {{three days to}} reach Mir in order to conserve fuel for the deorbit burn. If it <b>had</b> <b>launched</b> on 18 January it would have spent four days in free flight.|$|E
5|$|If Progress M1-5 <b>had</b> <b>launched</b> on 16 January, the Soyuz launch {{would have}} {{occurred}} on 10 February {{if it had been}} required. It was stood down around 22 February, after the decaying altitude of Mir made it too dangerous to send a crew to it.|$|E

Braaathens SAFE was worried that the high debt the company had due to the purchase of new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war. Bjørn G. Braathen stated {{that the company had}} bought the new aircraft {{based on the belief that}} deregulation would occur in 1997, giving the airline time to pay more of the debt. On 2 June 1993, with 76 against 18 votes, parliament voted to deregulate the domestic airline market from 1 April 1994. It was supported by the Labor, Conservative and Progress Party. With this, Norway became the third country in Europe to fully deregulate, after Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the earlier}} {{official}} version of his identification from a U.S. official, identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders. Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S. <b>had</b> <b>launched</b> missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone.|$|E

5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged {{to abandon the}} derelict Yorktown and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, {{but he was still}} unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who <b>had</b> <b>launched</b> at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.|$|E
5|$|Asch was {{notable for}} a chance event.

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare campaign—which Germany <b>had</b> <b>launched</b> {{at the beginning of}} February—had so succeeded that the entire Allied war effort was endangered.

5|$|Gernsback's {{recovery}} from the bankruptcy judgment was remarkably quick. By early June he <b>had</b> <b>launched</b> three new magazines, two of which published science fiction.

During his presentation, Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements. Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} analysis, {{it made no}} difference; Fletcher's {{carriers}} <b>had</b> <b>launched</b> their planes beginning at 07:00 (with Enterprise and Hornet having completed launching by 07:55, but Yorktown not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, {{he could not have}} prevented the launch of the American attack.|$|E
