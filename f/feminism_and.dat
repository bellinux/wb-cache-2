5|$|Horton Hatches the Egg {{has been}} used in discussions {{on a wide variety of}} topics e.g., economics, Christianity, <b>feminism,</b> <b>and</b> adoption. James Kemp, a retired United Methodist pastor, {{compared}} Horton to the early Christians to whom the First Epistle of Peter was addressed. Like those early Christians, Horton faces persecution and ridicule for his actions, but Horton is faithful to his mission and is rewarded, as evidenced by the elephant-bird that hatches at the end of the book.|$|E
5|$|Horton Hatches the Egg was {{published}} to immediate critical acclaim and financial success and has remained {{popular with the}} general public. The book has also been {{used as the basis}} for academic articles on a variety of topics, including economics, Christianity, <b>feminism,</b> <b>and</b> adoption. Horton appeared again in the 1954 Dr. Seuss book Horton Hears a Who! These two books later provided the thrust of the plot for the 2000 Broadway musical Seussical.|$|E

5|$|In the Hindu religion, {{there has}} been partial success in terms of gender {{equality}} reform laws and family law. While {{this is a major}} advancement relative to other religions in India, it is still not a complete triumph in terms of <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> relieving oppression. Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are not exclusively male. Hinduism sheds a positive light on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete their male counterparts. It {{is important to note that}} both the deity of knowledge and the deity of wealth are female.|$|E

Kahaani explores themes of <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> motherhood in male-dominated Indian society. The film also makes several allusions to Satyajit Ray's films such as Charulata (1964) and Aranyer Dinratri (1970).|$|E

5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in working women became one of the few times in history where women were praised for work outside the home. Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E
5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive <b>feminism,</b> <b>and</b> parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E

5|$|Mainstream Christianity has {{typically}} {{rejected the}} ideas of the New Age. Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's fundamentalist wing. In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of evangelical Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups. During that decade, evangelical writers such as Constance Cumbey, Dave Hunt, Gary North, and Douglas Groothuis published books criticising the New Age from their Christian perspective; a number of them have been characterised as propagating conspiracy theories regarding the origin and purpose of the movement. The most successful such publication however was Frank E. Peretti's 1986 novel This Present Darkness, which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> the Bible. Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil rights}} {{movement}} has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and {{civil rights movement}}s, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black <b>feminism</b> <b>and</b> Chicana feminism.|$|E
40|$|Visual Arts, <b>Feminisms</b> <b>and</b> Education in Brazil: The Invisibility of a Discourse Abstract The {{purpose of}} this article is to reflect on the way the {{relationship}} between visual arts <b>and</b> <b>feminisms</b> has been dealt with by the Brazilian academic production related to the art and education fields, as visible in the memoires of important events of the area and in specialized journals. To this effect, the objective was to question the main discourses regarding the relationship between art <b>and</b> <b>feminism.</b> Also, to see the possible impacts from queer studies, the feminist critic to art, and the gender studies of recent years on the theoretical Brazilian production related to the art and education fields. Despite the growth of the topic, it is noticeable that the academic productions related to art and education still approach timidly and with some resistance to the discussions about <b>feminisms</b> <b>and</b> gender studies. The purpose of the analysis started in this article is to help in the understanding of the paths covered, as well as the challenges to be faced regarding the discussion, aiming at new study perspectives. ...|$|R
