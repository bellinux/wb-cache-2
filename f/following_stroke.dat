The report was critical of the Federal Aviation Administration's re-certification process, stating:The Federal Aviation Administration's internal guidance for medical certification of pilots <b>following</b> <b>stroke</b> is inadequate because it is conflicting and unclear, does not specifically address the risk of recurrence associated with such an event, and does not specifically recommend a neuropsychological evaluation (formal cognitive testing) to evaluate potential subtle cognitive impairment.|$|E
