40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} gene expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains to identify mechanistic processes, {{but have been}} limited {{by the size of}} the datasets studied. Here we have implemented a novel meta-analysis approach to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in published datasets comprising 450 late onset AD (LOAD) brains and 212 controls. We found 3124 DEGs, many of which were highly correlated with Braak stage and cerebral atrophy. Pathway Analysis revealed the most perturbed pathways to be (a) nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages (NOROS), (b) NFkB and (c) mitochondrial dysfunction. NOROS was also up-regulated, and mitochondrial dysfunction down-regulated, in healthy ageing subjects. Upstream regulator analysis predicted the TLR 4 ligands, STAT 3 and NFKBIA, for activated pathways and RICTOR for mitochondrial genes. Protein-protein interaction network analysis emphasised the role of NFKB; identified a key interaction of CLU with complement; and linked TYROBP, TREM 2 and DOK 3 to modulation of LPS signalling through TLR 4 and to phosphatidylinositol metabolism. We suggest that NEUROD 6, ZCCHC 17, PPEF 1 and MANBAL are potentially implicated in LOAD, with predicted links to calcium signalling and protein mannosylation. Our study demonstrates a highly <b>injurious</b> <b>combination</b> of TLR 4 -mediated NFKB signalling, NOROS inflammatory pathway activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in LOAD...|$|E
40|$|Background: Increasingly {{the health}} impacts of {{physical}} inactivity are being distinguished {{from those of}} sedentary behavior. Nevertheless, deleterious health prognoses occur when these behaviors combine, making it a Public Health priority to establish the numbers and salient identifying factors {{of people who live}} with this <b>injurious</b> <b>combination.</b> Methods: Using an observational between-subjects design, a nonprobability sample of 22, 836 participants provided data on total daily activity. A 2 -step hierarchical cluster analysis identified the optimal number of clusters and the subset of distinguishing variables. Univariate analyses assessed significant cluster differences. Results: High levels of sitting clustered with low physical activity. The Ambulatory & Active cluster (n = 6254) sat for 2. 5 to 5 h·d− 1 and were highly active. They were significantly younger, included a greater proportion of males and reported low Indices of Multiple Deprivation compared with other clusters. Conversely, the Sedentary & Low Active cluster (n = 6286) achieved ≤ 60 MET·min·wk− 1 of physical activity and sat for ≥ 8 h·d− 1. They were the oldest cluster, housed the largest proportion of females and reported moderate Indices of Multiple Deprivation. Conclusions: Public Health systems may benefit from developing policy and interventions that do more to limit sedentary behavior and encourage light intensity activity in its place...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{salinity}} on corn plants (Zea mays L.) {{are influenced by}} the concentration of nutrient orthophosphate. Salinity (− 2 bars each of NaCl and CaCl 2) was more <b>injurious</b> in <b>combination</b> with a high concentration of orthophosphate (2 mm) (that gave optimum yields in the absence of salinity) than it was with a lower concentration (0. 1 mm). With 2 mm orthophosphate, salinity seemed to damage the plant mechanisms that normally regulate the internal concentration of orthophosphate resulting in excessive accumulation and P toxicity. On the other hand, with 0. 1 mm orthophosphate, salinity decreased orthophosphate concentration in mature leaves. This effect was paralleled by decreases in the concentration of adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate and in the energy charge of the adenylate system, indicating an orthophosphate deficit. Even so, plants survived salinity better under these conditions than in the presence of 2 mm orthophosphate. The data indicated that salinity affected the phosphorylated state of the adenine nucleotides only indirectly through its effect on the concentration of orthophosphate in the cells...|$|R
