5|$|Jansch {{was brought}} up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>residential</b> area of Edinburgh known as West Pilton, where he {{attended}} Pennywell Primary School and Ainslie Park Secondary School. As a teenager, he acquired a guitar and started visiting a local folk club ("The Howff") run by Roy Guest.

He also met and shared a flat with Robin Williamson, who remained a friend when Jansch later moved to London.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began at}} P. C. Sreeram's house in Alwarpet. Although {{the film was}} {{primarily}} set indoors in Delhi, Ratnam and Sreeram wanted the indoor scenes to look as lively as those shot outdoors. Since the cast was relatively small, Ratnam did not want it to resemble a play and used backlighting for the interior scenes. Thotta Tharani found a house <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>residential</b> area of Kilpauk in Madras (now Chennai) which admitted {{a great deal of}} sunlight, making it similar to houses in Delhi. Mouna Ragam was Ratnam's first film to make extensive use of staccato dialogue; this became his trademark style in later films. To reduce production costs, food for the film's crew was cooked at Venkateswaran's home.|$|E

5|$|NY144 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US9W {{in the town}} of New Baltimore, just north of US9W's junction with County Route51 (CR51). The route heads northeastward through New Baltimore as a two-lane rural roadway, crossing CSX Transportation's West Shore Line before intersecting with a service road that connects to the New Baltimore Travel Plaza on the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far from the junction, NY144 passes by a stretch of homes alongside the Thruway and crosses over the toll road, at which point the road enters a residential but wooded area of the town. This stretch leads to the hamlet of New Baltimore, located on {{the west bank of the}} Hudson River. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>residential</b> center of the community, NY144 intersects with the northern terminus of CR61 (River Road). At this junction, NY144 makes a turn northward, following the riverbank out of the hamlet.|$|E
5|$|Students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>residential</b> {{school system}} {{were faced with}} a {{multitude}} of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline {{that would not have}} been tolerated in any other school system. Corporal punishment was often justified by a belief that it was the only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69%. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.|$|E
