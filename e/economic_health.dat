5|$|In the 1970s {{job losses}} due to {{industrial}} restructuring caused New York City, including Manhattan, {{to suffer from}} economic problems and rising crime rates.

5|$|As was {{the case}} under Justinian's predecessors, the Empire's <b>economic</b> <b>health</b> rested {{primarily}} on agriculture. In addition, long-distance trade flourished, reaching {{as far north as}} Cornwall where tin was exchanged for Roman wheat. Within the Empire, convoys sailing from Alexandria provided Constantinople with wheat and grains. Justinian made the traffic more efficient by building a large granary on the island of Tenedos for storage and further transport to Constantinople. Justinian also tried to find new routes for the eastern trade, which was suffering badly from the wars with the Persians.|$|E
5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus {{almost exclusively to}} women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike many {{of those involved in}} the women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the <b>economic</b> <b>health</b> of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E

5|$|Since 1990 {{the total}} number of hours flown {{annually}} by the GA sector has remained in the range 1.25â€“1.35million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, which accounts for 0.6million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002. The decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the <b>economic</b> <b>health</b> of the GA industry is weakening, though the lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm.|$|E
5|$|The {{turn of the}} 20th century {{brought the}} Progressive Era to Mobile. The {{economic}} structure developed with new industries, generating new jobs and attracting {{a significant increase in}} population. The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920. During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels. During and after World War I, manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's <b>economic</b> <b>health,</b> with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important industries.|$|E
5|$|For twenty years, Americans {{had been}} bitterly divided over the nation's {{monetary}} standard. The gold standard, which the United States had effectively been on since 1873, limited {{the money supply}} but eased trade with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that bimetallism (making both gold and silver legal tender) was necessary for the nation's <b>economic</b> <b>health.</b> The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates, and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party, activists became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E

Using {{the example of}} newborn hearing screening, it is then examined if empirical studies meet the methodical requirements of <b>health</b> <b>economic</b> evaluation. Some deficits are realised: <b>Health</b> <b>economic</b> studies of newborn hearing screening are not randomised, most studies are even not controlled. Therefore, most studies do not present incremental, but only average cost-effectiveness ratios (i. e. cost per case identified). Furthermore, evidence on long-term outcomes of screening and early interventions is insufficient. In conclusion, {{there is a need}} for controlled trials to examine differences in identified cases, but particularly to examine long-term effects...|$|R

40|$|Developed countries' {{publicly}} funded {{health care systems}} all share the similar task of deciding which pharmaceuticals should be reimbursed. DECD countries' pharmaceutical reimbursement systems achieve this task {{through a number of}} institutions some of which use Health Technology Assessment (HTA) including <b>health</b> <b>economic</b> analysis to inform decision-making. The reimbursement decisions influence the health outcomes of patients, produce signals of the demand curve to manufacturers and may have political consequences. The overall aim of this thesis is to examine the use of <b>health</b> <b>economic</b> analysis in DECD countries' reimbursement systems and the contribution of <b>health</b> <b>economic</b> analysis and other factors to decision-making. Chapter 2 provides a literature review of previous quantitative and qualitative studies examining the factors contributing to reimbursement decision-making in DECD countries. The review identified limited evidence for comparisons across DECD countries and outlined the methodological limitations of identifying influence. Chapters 3 and 4 categorise DECD reimbursement systems using a published framework. Application of the framework identified that <b>Health</b> <b>Economic</b> analysis is used by agencies operating in heterogeneous reimbursement systems with respect to the objectives, other institutions, processes, guidelines, interpretation and other factors considered alongside <b>health</b> <b>economic</b> analysis. Chapter 5 uses regression analysis to examine decisions by those agencies that similarly use clinical evidence and <b>health</b> <b>economic</b> analysis, and identifies common factors across four countries. Chapter 6 uses a qualitative methodology to match decisions for an agency using <b>health</b> <b>economic</b> analysis in comparison to one not and found evidence of the influence of <b>health</b> <b>economic</b> analysis alongside other evidence and process factors. Finally, chapter 7 concludes by outlining the differential contribution of <b>health</b> <b>economic</b> analysis depending on how it is used by the systems. The limitations are discussed and recommendations provided for further research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
