5|$|Kneale's {{remaining}} television {{work was}} written for ITV. His first script for ITV was the one-off play Murrain, made by the network's Midlands franchise holders Associated TeleVision (ATV) in 1975. The play, a horror piece based around witchcraft, led the following year to a series called Beasts, a six-part anthology where Kneale created six different character-based tales of horror and the macabre. It featured some well-known actors such as Martin Shaw, Pauline Quirke and Bernard Horsfall, but did not gain a <b>full</b> <b>network</b> run on ITV; different regions transmitted the episodes in different timeslots and some in different sequences.|$|E

They are used frequently in machine learning and many applications such as medical science. This paper studies whether the concept classes induced by a Bayesian network can be embedded into a low-dimensional inner product space. We focus on two-label classification tasks over the Boolean domain. For <b>full</b> Bayesian <b>networks</b> and almost <b>full</b> Bayesian <b>networks</b> with n variables, we show that VC dimension and the minimum dimension of the inner product space induced by them are 2 n- 1. Also, for each Bayesian network N we show that VCdim(N) =Edim(N) = 2 n- 1 + 2 i if the network N′ constructed from N by removing Xn satisfies either (i) N′ is a <b>full</b> Bayesian <b>network</b> with n- 1 variables, i {{is the number of}} parents of Xn, and i<n- 1 or (ii) N′ is an almost <b>full</b> Bayesian <b>network,</b> the set of all parents of Xn PAn={X 1,X 2,Xn 3,…,Xni} and 2 ⩽i<n- 1.

25|$|The station {{signed on}} the air on September 26, 1954 as WINT, {{originally}} broadcasting its signal from a transmitter in Auburn. It was Fort Wayne's second television station to launch but was technically licensed to, and had studios in, Waterloo. The station's original owner, Tri-State Television (not {{to be confused with}} Tri-State Christian Television, owners of WINM channel 12), took advantage of peculiarities in Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules to direct the signal to Fort Wayne. Although the city was big enough to support three <b>full</b> <b>network</b> affiliates, the FCC had originally allocated only a single station, WKJG-TV (now WISE-TV) on UHF channel 33, to the city.

This created a large doughnut in central Texas where {{there could be}} only one VHF license, which became KTBC-TV. Additionally, UHF signals usually do not travel very far over long distances or over rugged terrain. Even though Austin was large enough on paper to support three <b>full</b> <b>network</b> affiliates {{as early as the}} 1950s, the technical limitations made several potential owners skittish about the prospects for UHF in a market that stretched from Mason in the west to La Grange in the east, and also included much of the Hill Country.|$|E
