6000|$|You find one: {{and in a}} moment, what a change! The deep has {{suddenly}} become shallow; the blue white, from the gleam of the white coral at the bottom. But the coral is not all white, only indeed a little of it; for as you look down through the clear water, you find that the coral <b>is</b> <b>starred</b> with innumerable live flowers, blue, crimson, grey, every conceivable hue; and {{that these are the}} coral polypes, each with its ring of arms thrust out of its cell, who are building up their common habitations of lime. If you want to understand, by a rough but correct description, what a coral polype is: all who have been to the sea-side know, or at least have heard of, sea-anemones. [...] Now coral polypes are sea-anemones, which make each a shell of lime, growing with its growth. As for their shapes, the variety of them, the beauty of them, no tongue can describe them. If you want to see them, go to the Coral Rooms of the British or Liverpool Museums, and judge for yourselves. Only remember that you must re-clothe each of those exquisite forms with a coating of live jelly of some delicate hue, and put back into every one of the thousand cells its living flower; and into the beds, or rather banks, of the salt-water flower garden, the gaudiest of shell-less sea-anemones, such as we have on our coasts, rooted in the cracks, and live shells and sea-slugs, as gaudy as they, crawling about, with fifty other forms of fantastic and exuberant life. You must not overlook, too, the fish, especially the parrot-fish, some of them of the gaudiest colours, who spend their lives in browsing on the live coral, with strong clipping and grinding teeth, just as a cow browses the grass, keeping the animal matter, and throwing away the lime {{in the form of an}} impalpable white mud, which fills up the interstices in the coral beds.|$|E

40|$|We {{recently}} discovered {{a large number}} of highly active <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> in the open cluster NGC 3766, making it an excellent location to study the formation mechanism of <b>Be</b> <b>star</b> disks. To explore whether similar disk appearances and/or disappearances are common among the <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> in other open clusters, we present here multiple epochs of H-alpha spectroscopy for 296 stars in eight open clusters. We identify 12 new transient <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> and confirm 17 additional <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> with relatively stable disks. By comparing the H-alpha equivalent widths to the photometric y - H-alpha colors, we present a method to estimate the strength of the H-alpha emission when spectroscopy is not available. For a subset of 128 stars in four open clusters, we also use blue optical spectroscopy and available Stromgren photometry to measure their projected rotational velocities, effective temperatures, and polar surface gravities. We combine our <b>Be</b> <b>star</b> detections from these four clusters to investigate physical differences between the transient <b>Be</b> <b>stars,</b> stable <b>Be</b> <b>stars,</b> and normal B-type stars with no line emission. Both types of <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> faster rotating populations than normal B-type stars, and we find no significant physical differences between the transient and stable <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> in our sample.

40|$|Through the {{modelling}} of near-infrared photometry of star plus disk {{systems with}} the codes BEDISK/BERAY, we successfully describe the WISE photometric characteristics of <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> in five young open clusters, NGC 663, NGC 869, NGC 884, NGC 3766 and NGC 4755, broadly {{studied in the}} literature. WISE photometry allows previously known <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> to <b>be</b> detected and to find new Be candidates which could be confirmed spectroscopically. The location of <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> in the WISE colour-magnitude diagram, separates them in two groups; active (<b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> hosting a developed circumstellar disk) and quiescent objects (<b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> in a diskless phase), and this way, we can explore how often <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> observed in these different stages. The variability observed in most active variable <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> <b>is</b> compatible with a disk dissipation phase. We find that 50 percent of <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> in the studied open clusters are in an active phase. We can interpret this as <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> having a developed circumstellar disk half of the time. The location of <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> with a developed disk in the CMD require mass loss rates in agreement with values recently reported in the literature. For these objects, we expect to have a tight relation between the equivalent width of the Hα line and {{the mass of the}} disk, if the inclination is known. Also, near-infrared photometry of <b>Be</b> <b>stars</b> in stellar clusters has the potential of being useful to test whether there is a preferential viewing angle.
