5000|$|Ten {{days after}} the bombings, the British Army {{launched}} Operation Motorman, in which it re-took IRA-controlled areas in Belfast and Derry. It was the biggest British military operation since the Suez Crisis of 1956. In his memoirs, Whitelaw wrote [...] "The re-establishment of control required a major military operation. Fortunately … the IRA leaders <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>further</b> propaganda assistance. While the planning for Motorman was in progress they unleashed a savage bombing operation in the centre of Belfast".|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas, Juanita, what avails it now? I am sent to San Jose, {{charged with}} {{a letter to the}} Father Superior, who will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>further</b> orders.

6000|$|In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets {{were able}} to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth {{instantly}} availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, [...] "But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>further</b> particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever." ...|$|R
25|$|Pere Maire has {{accordingly}} {{written to}} M. Leduc, my French colleague, who will doubtless {{communicate with the}} Governor-General. The Provicaire is of opinion that the missionaries were attacked by orders of the ex-Dalai Lama, as the nearest Europeans on whom he could avenge his disgrace. He {{is good enough to}} say that he will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> any <b>further</b> information which he may receive.|$|R
60|$|Thus have I {{showed you}} my present light into {{this portion of}} the Holy Scripture. If any can <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>further,</b> I hope I shall not refuse it. But as yet, methinks this should be the genuine sense of this place, and is the very track of John himself. For after he had seen the wall for present safety, the {{foundations}} for continuation, the gates for entrance, and the like, then he comes to tell us of the glory of all, and of the street itself at last; which indeed is the last and end of all the order of God, and to continue till an end be put to it by mortality's being swallowed up of life. As is yet more fully showed you in the next verse of this description.|$|R
6000|$|A {{few days}} later Mr. Butt <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a <b>further</b> report. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "the {{furniture}} is all unpacked and straightened out but I don't like it. There's {{a lot of it}} I don't quite like. I half feel like advising Jones to sell it and get some more. But I don't want to do that till I'm quite certain about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's about poor Mr. Hamilton Fynes," [...] she explained. [...] "I took up {{the evening}} paper only half an hour ago, and read your {{interview}} with the reporter. I simply couldn't help stopping to ask whether you could <b>give</b> <b>me</b> any <b>further</b> particulars about that horrible affair. I didn't dare to come here all alone, so I asked Sir Charles to come along with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ladies and gentlemen, {{you will}} observe that I have, with this gentleman's {{permission}}, broken his watch, burnt his collar, smashed his spectacles, and danced on his hat.

If not, the performance is at an end." ...|$|R
60|$|Further persuasion was plainly useless, {{addressed}} {{to such a}} man as this. Silas <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> no <b>further</b> opportunity of remonstrating with him, even if I had been inclined to do so. He turned about in sulky silence, and, retracing his steps along the path, disappeared round {{the corner of the}} house. The laborers withdrew next, in different directions, to begin the day's work. John Jago and I were alone.|$|R
60|$|The {{family of}} Blonay {{has been in}} {{possession}} of this place for seven hundred years. One branch of it is in Sardinia; but I suppose its head is the occupant of the house, or castle. As the building was historical, and the De Blonays of unquestionable standing, I was curious to examine the edifice, since it might <b>give</b> <b>me</b> some <b>further</b> insight into {{the condition of the}} old Swiss nobility. Accordingly we applied for admission, and obtained it without difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will be able}} now to {{know whether}} your {{confidence}} has been misplaced.

I can only say, Donna Dolores, that I am ready to act either as your witness to {{the identification of the}} real Grace Conroy, or as your legal adviser, or both. When you have decided which, you shall <b>give</b> <b>me</b> your <b>further</b> commands, or dismiss me. Until then, adios!" ...|$|R
60|$|Next Day.--Several {{hours at}} E.'s house, and dinner there. An old {{familiar}} house, (he {{has been in}} it thirty-five years,) with surroundings, furnishment, roominess, and plain elegance and fullness, signifying democratic ease, sufficient opulence, and an admirable old-fashioned simplicity--modern luxury, with its mere sumptuousness and affectation, either touch'd lightly upon or ignored altogether. Dinner the same. Of course {{the best of the}} occasion (Sunday, September 18, '81) was the sight of E. himself. As just said, a healthy color in the cheeks, and good light in the eyes, cheery expression, and just the amount of talking that best suited, namely, a word or short phrase only where needed, and almost always with a smile. Besides Emerson himself, Mrs. E., with their daughter Ellen, the son Edward and his wife, with my friend F. S. and Mrs. S., and others, relatives and intimates. Mrs. Emerson, resuming the subject of the evening before, (I sat next to her,) <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>further</b> and fuller information about Thoreau, who, years ago, during Mr. E.'s absence in Europe, had lived for some time in the family, by invitation.|$|R
5000|$|Again {{according}} to Thompson, Bolivia and Peru protested against the treaty and Chile seemed inclined {{to do the}} same.At {{the same time the}} secret treaty was published in the Semanario, a Paraguayan weekly paper, and had the effect of convincing many people that López was right in making this war upon the Allies, and that Paraguay was compelled to fight for her very existence. [...] His personal reaction:When the secret Treaty was published, it <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a <b>further</b> zest to fight for Paraguay, as I believed, from the terms of the Protocol, that she must either fight or be absorbed.|$|R
60|$|I {{found her}} that evening, by chance, {{in the gallery}} over the courtyard. She was pacing slowly, having fled thither to avoid that hateful throng of courtiers.

I approached, and very earnestly rendered her my thanks for having championed my cause and supported me with the express sign of her approval.|$|R

60|$|At {{the end of}} {{our time}} in Moscow we all felt a desire to see {{something}} of the country, and {{to get in touch with}} the peasants, since they form about 85 per cent, of the population. The Government showed the greatest kindness in meeting our wishes, and it was decided that we should travel down the Volga from Nijni Novgorod to Saratov, stopping at many places, large and small, and talking freely with the inhabitants. I found this part of the time extraordinarily instructive. I learned to know more than I should have thought possible of the life and outlook of peasants, village schoolmasters, small Jew traders, and all kinds of people. Unfortunately, my friend, Clifford Allen, fell ill, and my time was much taken up with him. This had, however, one good result, namely, that I was able to go on with the boat to Astrakhan, as he was too ill to be moved off it. This not only <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>further</b> knowledge of the country, but made me acquainted with Sverdlov, Acting Minister of Transport, who was travelling on the boat to organize the movement of oil from Baku up the Volga, and who was one of the ablest as well as kindest people whom I met in Russia.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the whole {{lighting}} system: would {{you be able to}} <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>further</b> information about the existing EDL transmission poles? Some pictures would help. See attached picture. Please confirm the diameter of the Pole and size of the Pole. The pole is a standard steel EDL pole as per the attached picture. Please revert with the layout for battery, batter box etc. It is up to the contractor to propose optimal battery and controller box placement. Please confirm the angle at which the panel and led light to be fixed. The contractor should know the optimal angle of panel placement which is a typical angle inclination for the Lebanese case. Should we register our company at the UNDP organization earlier, before the delivery of the tender? Registration is not mandatory. Please let us know the VAT and other indirect taxes applicable on the solar lighting systems in Lebanon, as mentioned in the tender documents we need to include the same in our offer to UNDP. A.

40|$|OTalk is an ever-growing {{community}} of practitioners, students and academics/researchers {{who engage in}} weekly chats over the social media platform of Twitter. Discussion topics are of relevance to occupational therapists and occupational scientists (OTalk 2014). Prior to accepting a place on a pre-reg course in occupational therapy, OTalk enabled me to develop awareness of current, relevant topics impacting the profession I wanted to enter. As a student it has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>further</b> opportunities to understand how theory supports practice {{in a wide range}} of clinical settings beyond my own experiences of placement and classroom-based learning. Midway through my first year of studying, I had the opportunity to undertake an internship with OTalk, as a student digital leader as a CPD activity for 16 -month period with the team to develop digital leadership skills (OTalk 2015). The experience gained throughout the intern period allowed for the development of communication skills, publicity and promotion skills and professionalism in the context of appropriate use of social media. It also gave opportunity to develop skills highlighted within HCPC Standards of Proficiency: Occupational Therapist (2013) such as building and maintaining professional relationships as well as working appropriately with others. The poster will outline my personal experience and reflections of doing, being and becoming (Wilcock 1998) a student digital leader intern with the OTalk team. It will explore the development of skills I can carry forward into the occupational therapy profession and also the challenges I faced interning alongside studying towards my pre-reg qualification in occupational therapy. It will also aim to encourage student OTs to continue to make use of social media as part of their learning journey and post-graduation...|$|R
60|$|At length, the {{sun that}} had been hidden shone out and with its coming my temper changed. I remembered that I who might so easily have been dead, was sound, young, and healthy, that I had sword, bow, and armour of the best, also twenty or more of gold pieces, for I had not counted them, in the bag which my mother <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> with Wave-Flame. <b>Further,</b> I hoped that my uncle would befriend me, {{and if he did}} not, there were plenty of captains engaged in the wars who might be glad of a squire, one who could shoot against any man and handle a sword as well as most.|$|R
60|$|The train whereby we were {{to travel}} was {{required}} for other business besides; and I noticed about a hundred Boers embarking with their horses in a dozen large cattle trucks behind the engine. At or about noon we steamed off, moving slowly along the line, and Captain Haldane {{pointed out to me}} the ridge of Elandslaagte, and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> some <b>further</b> account of that successful action and of the great skill with which Hamilton had directed the infantry attack. The two Boers who were guarding us listened with great interest, but the single observation they made was that we had only to fight Germans and Hollanders at Elandslaagte. 'If these had been veldt Boers in front of you----' My companion replied that even then the Gordon Highlanders might have made some progress. Whereat both Boers laughed softly and shook their heads with the air of a wiseacre, saying, 'You will know better when you're as old as me,' a remark I constantly endure from very worthy people.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing can {{exceed the}} {{closeness}} {{with which the}} whole fits again into its germ. That had been <b>given</b> <b>me</b> bodily, as usual, by the spoken word, for I {{was to take the}} image over exactly as I happened to have met it. A friend had repeated to me, with great appreciation, a thing or two said to him by a man of distinction, much his senior, and to which a sense akin to that of Strether's melancholy eloquence might be imputed--said as chance would have, and so easily might, in Paris, and in a charming old garden attached to a house of art, and on a Sunday afternoon of summer, many persons of great interest being present. The observation there listened to and gathered up had contained part of the [...] "note" [...] that I was to recognise on the spot as to my purpose--had contained in fact the greater part; the rest was in the place and the time and the scene they sketched: these constituents clustered and combined to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>further</b> support, to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> what I may call the note absolute. There it stands, accordingly, full in the tideway; driven in, with hard taps, like some strong stake for the noose of a cable, the swirl of the current roundabout it. What amplified the hint to more than the bulk of hints in general was the gift with it of the old Paris garden, for in that token were sealed up values infinitely precious. There was of course the seal to break and each item of the packet to count over and handle and estimate; but somehow, {{in the light of the}} hint, all the elements of a situation of the sort most to my taste were there. I could even remember no occasion on which, so confronted, I had found it of a livelier interest to take stock, in this fashion, of suggested wealth. For I think, verily, that there are degrees of merit in subjects--in spite of the fact that to treat even one of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time, for the feverish and prejudiced hour, at least figure its merit and its dignity as POSSIBLY absolute. What it comes to, doubtless, is that even among the supremely good--since with such alone is it one's theory of one's honour to be concerned--there is an ideal BEAUTY of goodness the invoked action of which is to raise the artistic faith to its maximum. Then truly, I hold, one's theme may be said to shine, and that of [...] "The Ambassadors," [...] I confess, wore this glow for me from beginning to end. Fortunately thus I am able to estimate this as, frankly, quite the best, [...] "all round," [...] of all my productions; any failure of that justification would have made such an extreme of complacency publicly fatuous.|$|R

(Received in London 14th June, 1905.)Pere Maire, the Provicaire of the Roman Catholic Mission here, {{called this}} morning to show me a {{telegram}} which he had just received from a native priest of his Mission at Tali. The telegram, which is in Latin, is dated Tali, the 24th April, and is {{to the effect that}} the lamas of Batang have killed PP. Musset and Soulie, together with, it is believed, 200 converts. The chapel at Atentse has been burnt down, and the lamas hold the road to Tachien-lu. Pere Bourdonnec (another member of the French Tibet Mission) begs that Pere Maire will take action.Pere Maire has accordingly written to M.

Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.' I asked what he meant by that, for he was very serious.
