The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention, including a twelve-day, [...] round-Australia trip by three Avro Ansons, one of which was piloted by Headlam, in November. The following month, Headlam led the three Ansons on a six-day journey back and <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> Central Australia. He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction. On 27January 1939 he was posted to RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, as a flight commander. He served initially with No.2 Squadron, before transferring to No.1 Squadron on 29August. Both units operated Ansons.|$|E

500|$|Edgeworth devoted {{considerable}} {{effort to}} insisting that mathematical proofs were appropriate for all {{schools of thought}} in economics. [...] While {{at the helm of}} The Economic Journal, he published several articles criticizing the mathematical rigor of rival researchers, [...] including Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman, a noted skeptic of mathematical economics. [...] The articles focused on a back and <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> tax incidence and responses by producers. [...] Edgeworth noticed that a monopoly producing a good that had jointness of supply but not jointness of demand (such as first class and economy on an airplane, if the plane flies, both sets of seats fly with it) might actually lower the price seen by the consumer for one of the two commodities if a tax were applied. [...] Common sense and more traditional, numerical analysis seemed to indicate that this was preposterous. [...] Seligman insisted that the results Edgeworth achieved were a quirk of his mathematical formulation. [...] He suggested that the assumption of a continuous demand function and an infinitesimal change in the tax resulted in the paradoxical predictions. [...] Harold Hotelling later showed that Edgeworth was correct and that the same result (a [...] "diminution of price {{as a result of the}} tax") could occur with a discontinuous demand function and large changes in the tax rate.|$|E

2500|$|Bread making {{began with}} the milling of the grain. It was a {{difficult}} and time-consuming task, performed by women. Each household stored its own grain, and {{it is estimated that}} it required at least three hours of daily effort to produce enough flour to make sufficient bread for a family of five. The earliest milling was performed with a pestle and mortar, or a stone quern consisting of a large lower stone that held the grain and a smooth upper stone that was moved back and <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> the grains (...) [...] This often left small pieces of grit in the flour. The use of the millstone became more widespread during the Iron Age, resulting in greater speed and increased production of flour. Smaller versions for household use, the rotary or beehive quern, appeared during the early Persian period.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the afternoon, Confederate {{engineers}} {{scrambled to}} create a new defensive line 500 yards further south {{at the base of the}} Mule Shoe, while fighting at the Bloody Angle continued day and night with neither side achieving an advantage, until around 12:00 AM on May 13, the fighting finally stopped. At 4 A.M., the exhausted Confederate infantrymen were notified that the new line was ready and they withdrew from the original earthworks unit by unit. The combat they had endured for almost 24 hours was characterized by an intensity of firepower never previously seen in Civil War battles, as the entire landscape was flattened, all the foliage destroyed. An example of this can be found in the Smithsonian Museum of American History: a 22-inch stump of an oak tree at the Bloody Angle that was completely severed by rifle fire. There was a frenzy to the carnage on both sides. Fighting back and <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> the same corpse-strewn trenches for hours on end, using single shot muskets, the contending troops were periodically reduced to hand-to-hand combat reminiscent of battles fought during ancient times. Bodies piled up four and five high, and soldiers were forced to pause from time to time and throw corpses over the parapet since they formed an obstacle in the way of the fighting. Dead and wounded men were shot so many times that many of them simply fell apart into unrecognizable heaps of flesh. Surviving participants attempted to describe in letters, diaries, and memoirs the hellish intensity of that day, many noting that it was beyond words. Or, as one put it: [...] "Nothing can describe the confusion, the savage, blood-curdling yells, the murderous faces, the awful curses, and the grisly horror of the melee." [...] Some men claimed to have fired as many as 400 rounds that day. May 12 was the most intensive day of fighting during the battle, with Union casualties of about 9,000, Confederate 8,000; the Confederate loss includes about 3,000 prisoners captured in the Mule Shoe.|$|E
