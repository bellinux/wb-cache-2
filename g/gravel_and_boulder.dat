Seventeen species of fish and squid were observed with clear habitat and time differences. Observations of feeding behavior, disturbance behavior, and both interspecific and intraspecific interactions provided numerous opportunities for potential sound production; however, sounds were recorded only during a single dive. Although high noise levels generated by the ROV and support ship may have masked some sounds, we conclude that fish sound production in the Gulf of Maine during the fall is uncommon. The recorded fish sounds are tentatively attributed to the cusk Brosme brosme. Cusk sounds consisted variously of isolated thumps, widely spaced thump trains, drumrolls, and their combinations. Frequency peaks were observed at 188, 539, and 1195 Hz. Use of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) as a passive acoustic observation platform was problematic due to high ROV self-noise and the ROV’s inability to maintain a fixed position on the bottom without thruster power. Some fishes were clearly also disturbed by ROV noise, indicating a potential ROV sampling bias. Based on our observations, we suggest that new instruments incorporating both optic and passive acoustic technologies are needed to provide better tools for in situ behavioral studies of cusk and other fishes [Current Zoology 56 (1) : 90 – 99 2010]...|$|E

40|$|The Cenozoic {{climate of}} {{southern}} Africa {{has been a}} subject to influences of both global and regional nature. Orbitally controlled cycles, stepwise global coolings, {{the evolution of the}} ocean current system and differential uplift have dominantly influenced the climate history during the last 65 million years. The interplay between these factors has been complex, and the resulting climatic history is known only in a very broad outline for most of the Early Cenozoic. More is understood of Neogene climates because of the better preservation of terrestrial proxy data, but it is only over the last two glacial cycles that sufficient palaeoclimatic data have been assembled to allow a tentative picture of the regional patterns of change to be drawn. Data sets of oxygen isotope records from ocean sediment cores taken off the KwaZulu-Natal coast show that the climate of the southern African subcontinent has oscillated {{in a manner similar to}} that over much of the globe during the Middle and Late Pleistocene. Glacial and interglacial conditions occurred with a quasi-periodicity of about 100, 000 years in response to Milankovitch forcing due to changes in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. The period from 125. 000 - 16. 000 BP was characterized in high latitudes by a series of pronounced rapid warmings, followed by slow variable declines to progressively lower minima, as the deuterium isotopic record from the Antarctic Vostok ice core illustrates. Proxy data sets show that similar variations occurred throughout southern Africa. However, a chronostratigraphic control on marine and continental Cenozoic deposits for the Namib Desert, especially for its northern part, is largely missing. Most data derived from continental deposits distributed across the Namib Desert and adjacent areas. But there is a lack of sedimentological and chronostratigraphical data from deposits of the mouth areas of the ephemeral river systems and from adjacent marine terraces. The Skeleton Coast in NW Namibia hosts a number of superbly exposed Cenozoic sedimentary successions, which provide a unique insight into the Cenozoic stratigraphy along the southwest African coastline. These deposits record the interplay of marine, fluvial and aeolian processes and therefore represent prime research objects to study fluvial response to sea-level and climate change. Along the incised banks of the ephemeral rivers and especially the wave cut seacliffs several fluvially dominated unconformity bounded sequences are exposed. Some of the rivers have built up braided river dominated fans on the coastal plain, e. g. the Koigab River. Pleistocene beach deposits form intermittent strips and ridges trending more or less parallel to the coast representing elevated shorelines. They consist of largely unlithified marine sand, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>boulder</b> beds which attain thickness of up to 10 m. They are distributed along the coast to the north of the river outlets due to the extreme wave and wind action associated with the strong north trending Benguela Current. The elevations of these coastal terraces range from + 2 to + 35 m asl. and are located up to at least 5 km inland and reflecting eustatic highstands during the Late Tertiary to Quaternary. Krapf, C.

40|$|The {{resurgence}} of malaria in highland regions of Africa, Oceania and recently in South America underlines {{the importance of}} the study of the ecology of highland mosquito vectors of malaria. Since the incidence of malaria is limited by the distribution of its vectors, the purpose of this PhD thesis was to examine aspects of the ecology of Anopheles mosquitoes in the Andes of Ecuador, South America. A historical literature and archival data review (Chapter 2) indicated that Anopheles pseudopunctipennis transmitted malaria in highland valleys of Ecuador prior to 1950, although it was eliminated through habitat removal and the use of chemical insecticides. Other anopheline species were previously limited to low-altitude regions, except in a few unconfirmed cases. A thorough larval collection effort (n= 438 attempted collection sites) in all road-accessible parts of Ecuador except for the lowland Amazon basin was undertaken between 2008 - 2010 (Chapter 3). Larvae were identified morphologically and using molecular techniques (mitochondrial COl gene), and distribution maps indicated that all five species collected (Anopheles albimanus, An. pseudopunctipennis, Anopheles punctimacula, Anopheles oswaldoi s. l. and Anopheles eiseni) were more widespread throughout highland regions than previously recorded during the 1940 s, with higher maximum altitudes for all except An. pseudopunctipennis (1541 m, 1930 m, 1906 m, 1233 m and 1873 m, respectively). During larval collections, to characterize species-specific larval habitat, a variety of abiotic and biotic habitat parameters were measured and compared between species-present and species-absent sites using chi-square tests and stepwise binary logistic regression analyses (Chapter 4). An. albimanus was significantly associated with permanent pools with sand substrates and An. pseudopunctipennis with <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>boulder</b> substrates. Both species were significantly associated with floating cyanobacterial mats and warmer temperatures, which may limit their presence in cooler highland regions. Anopheles punctimacula was collected more often than expected from algae-free, shaded pools with higher-than-average calculated dissolved oxygen. Anopheles oswaldoi s. l., the species occurring on the Amazonian side of the Andes, was associated with permanent, anthropogenic habitats such as roadside ditches and ponds. To address the hypothesis that human land use change is responsible for the emergence of multiple highland Anopheles species by creating larval habitat, common land uses in the western Andes were surveyed for standing water and potential larval habitat suitability (Chapter 5). Rivers and road edges provided large amounts of potentially suitable anopheline habitat in the western Andes, while cattle pasture also created potentially suitable habitat in irrigation canals and watering ponds. Other common land uses surveyed (banana farms, sugarcane plantations, mixed tree plantations, and empty lots) were usually established on steep slopes and had very little standing water present. Using distribution and larval habitat data, a GIS-based larval habitat distribution model for the common western species was constructed in ArcGIS v. l 0 (ESRI 2010) using derived data layers from field measurements and other sources (Chapter 6). The additive model predicted 76. 4 - 97. 9 % of the field-observed collection localities of An. albimanus, An. pseudopunctipennis and An. punctimacula, although it could not accurately distinguish between species-absent and speciespresent sites due to its coarse scale. The model predicted distributional expansion and/or shift of one or more anopheline species into the following highland valleys with climate warming: Mira/Chota, Imbabura province, Tumbaco, Pichincha province, Pallatanga and Sibambe, Chimborazo province, and Yungilla, Azuay province. These valleys may serve as targeted sites of future monitoring to prevent highland epidemics of malaria. The human perceptions of malaria and mosquitoes in relation to land management practices were assessed through an interview-based survey (n= 262) in both highlands and lowlands, of male and female land owners and managers of five property types (Chapter 7). Although respondents had a strong understanding of where the disease occurs in their own country and of the basic relationship among standing water, mosquitoes and malaria, about half of respondents in potential risk areas denied the current possibility of malaria infection on their own property. As well, about half of respondents with potential anopheline larval habitat did not report its presence, likely due to a highly specific definition of suitable mosquito habitat. Most respondents who are considered at risk of malaria currently use at least one type of mosquito bite prevention, most commonly bed nets. In conclusion, this interdisciplinary thesis examines the occurrence of Anopheles species in the lowland transition area and highlands in Ecuador, from a historic, geographic, ecological and sociological perspective...|$|E
