5|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, {{replacing}} parts became an increasing problem. Components were failing due to wear and age, but the companies responsible for manufacturing the parts had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> {{during the previous}} twenty years, sometimes immediately after World War II ended. The carrier's engineers often resorted to making replacements from scratch.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, Harvey {{was facing}} serious setbacks. Harvey's son Hal {{had died in}} 1903 and was interred in a {{mausoleum}} in Monte Ne. His other son, Tom, had left in 1908 never to return. The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either. Harvey and his wife, Anna, were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage. Harvey's close friend William Jennings Bryan failed {{to find a place}} for him in the new Woodrow Wilson administration. Harvey's 1913 bid for the Third Congressional District of Arkansas also failed. His Monte Ne was also failing. The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Faced with these severe dilemmas, Harvey had begun reasoning that the end of civilization was at hand. In February 1920, he published Common Sense, in which Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the future {{in the form of a}} pyramid.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the team}} {{believed}} {{that they would be}} unable to use the Wolfenstein name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles, only to discover that the original developer, Muse Software, had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> several years earlier and let the trademark lapse, leaving them the option to use the name Wolfenstein 3D. The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he paid id a US$100,000 advance on the project. Mark Rein, who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail Wolfenstein project to FormGen, which had published id's December 1991 Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter, overcoming the publisher's concerns over Wolfensteins proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels. Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the {{original}} Baldwin diesels {{were beginning to}} suffer reliability problems, which was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Baldwin had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> some 10 years before and could no longer provide spare parts or maintenance. With the new powerplant being constructed at Beesley's Point ready to consume several 90 car coal trains per week the PRSL was in need of more powerful and more reliable locomotives and turned to industry-leader EMD to supply 10 new second generation diesel electric locomotives.|$|E
25|$|Mein Kampf {{has been}} reprinted several times since 1945; in 1970, 1992, 2002 and 2010. In 1992 the Government of Bavaria {{tried to stop}} the {{publication}} of the book, and the case went to the Supreme Court of Sweden which ruled in favour of the publisher, stating that the book is protected by copyright, but that the copyright holder is unidentified (and not the State of Bavaria) and that the original Swedish publisher from 1934 had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> It therefore refused the Government of Bavaria's claim.|$|E
25|$|By late 1962, {{the company}} was again in dire {{financial}} trouble. The Mk3 Grantura had been introduced later than expected, two of the home market distributors had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> (Research Garage and David Buxton Ltd.), the Canadian government had imposed a 10% duty on cars imported from the United Kingdom, and the company discontinued its relationship with Dick Monnich, the US importer, because of his failure {{to pay for his}} orders. Factory workers were all laid off in October 1962, and Henry Moulds and Bernards Williams met with the company's creditors in December. TVR Cars Ltd. moved into receivership and much of its equipment, including body moulds, was moved to secure storage.|$|E

Revolution Studios planned to produce the film and distribute it through a deal with Columbia Pictures, but by 2006, Revolution had <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> In August 2006, Universal Pictures acquired the project {{with the intent to}} finance and distribute the sequel, which was newly scheduled to be released in summer of 2008. Production was scheduled to begin in April 2007 in Etyek, Hungary (near Budapest) and London, England.|$|E
25|$|Lithuania is {{not very}} well known for its beer, {{but it is one}} of the few {{countries}} in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence this process gathered speed, and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.|$|E
25|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the lame duck zoning commission reversed course in late November 1974 and approved the proposed revised zoning {{rules for the}} Georgetown waterfront. The Washington Post reported that the rezoning process would have to begin again under the home-rule zoning commission, and there was little chance that the new commission {{would be able to}} approve anything like the proposed regulations. The existing zoning commission acted, the newspaper suggested, because it would suffer no political retaliation (having <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business),</b> its actions could give the home-rule zoning commission political cover to retain the rules, and because its members believed there had been enough delay and consideration of the rules. Development, the old commission felt, had to proceed now or it never would. The GCA immediately sued to have the new zoning regulations overturned, and the D.C. Superior Court blocked all development in the area while the suit was pending.|$|E
