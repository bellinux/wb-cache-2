5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E

25|$|Following the openers is the No. 3 or one-drop batsman. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{take over}} from the openers and {{typically}} play a careful and prolonged innings, effectively tying up {{one end of the}} batting. This brings in some stability in the batting, as new batsmen find it difficult to settle down and it helps to have a settled batsman at the other end. The best batsman of the team is usually put at number 3 or 4, to protect him from the difficulties of batting against the best bowlers on a fresh pitch and to allow him to play a long innings.|$|E
25|$|While {{the rest}} of the adults in town and a visiting {{television}} crew film a reenactment for America's Most Wanted, a tree falls on the power line causing the power to go out. All of the adults are now stuck in a building until the storm settles. The group hastily resort to cannibalism to survive. The power also goes out back at the hospital, and a plan is enacted to restore it. Dr. Doctor suggests that they split into two teams: team A, consisting of everyone in the room except Kenny, and team B, consisting of Kenny. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reconnect the generator, while team A give advice to Kenny via walkie-talkie.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Satyajit Chavan is {{the head}} doctor at a civil {{hospital}} in Delhi. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but he has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone. His staff of doctors, {{most of whom are}} young interns fresh out of medical school, inquire about his bedside manner. He curtly informs them that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> treat patients and that beds must be allocated to the ones {{who are most likely to}} survive and get better. We discover that government hospitals (especially in large cities like Mumbai) are severely limited in bed space and attract the worst stricken patients in the city. These draconian conditions have shaped Satyajit and his views on treatment.|$|E

25|$|A stoic {{officer who}} had worked for a long time within SSSP. Although {{appearing}} as a human with short hair and glasses, he is in fact an alien in disguise. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> report to SSSP of any events and is usually dwelling around the Alien City for informations from police informant Jack. He has a rather strained relationship with Shinjiro, doubted if the youth is fit enough to become an Ultraman. He also views Ultraman nothing more as an enforcer-like figure that instantly killed his opponents, which is not shared by the boy. Moroboshi later dons his own Ultraman Suit and revealed his alien heritage to Shinjiro when they pursue Seiji Hokuto. His name is in fact based on Dan Moroboshi from Ultra Seven.|$|E

Prior fears that they suspect he is faking illness and want to send him back to war. While away, Rivers meets with some old friends, Ruth and Henry Head, who discuss Sassoon. Rivers suggests that Sassoon has the freedom to disagree with the war. However, Rivers affirms that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make Sassoon return to military duty.

500|$|Peter Capaldi {{was cast}} as the Twelfth Doctor in 2013, and made his first {{appearance}} in the 2013 Christmas special [...] "The Time of the Doctor" [...] (with an uncredited cameo appearance in the anniversary special [...] "The Day of the Doctor"). Capaldi's Doctor addresses this in the episode [...] "The Girl Who Died," [...] when the Doctor finally remembers that he shares a face with a man he was persuaded to save in Pompeii, despite his initial reluctance to alter that timeline. He surmises that he subconsciously chose this face for his current regeneration {{as a reminder that}} <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> save lives. [...] Capaldi also played John Frobisher throughout , the third series in the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood, although no similar connection has been made on-screen to this character.|$|E
500|$|Barton Fink uses several stylistic {{conventions}} {{to accentuate}} the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated {{many times in the}} film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> [...] "plumb the depths" [...] while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe (which he has presumably been polishing) suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements– [...] combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence– [...] create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that [...] "the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling".|$|E
2500|$|According to Ganatra, it was {{interesting}} watching Roshan Seth's and Carol Kane's conflicting acting styles. [...] "Seth comes from the British school of theater acting and believes that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> deliver a consistent performance. Kane comes from the American school, where improvisation rules and a certain performance may not be duplicated. Seth wanted lots of rehearsals; Kane thought too much practice would make her performance stale." [...] Nevertheless, the two actors very much enjoyed working together.|$|E

2500|$|The tyranny is ostensibly {{overseen by}} Big Brother, the Party leader who enjoys an intense cult of personality, but {{who may not}} even exist. The Party [...] "seeks power entirely for its own sake. It is not {{interested}} in the good of others; it is interested solely in power." [...] The protagonist of the novel, Winston Smith, {{is a member of the}} Outer Party, who works for the Ministry of Truth, or Minitrue in Newspeak. The Minitrue is responsible for propaganda and historical revisionism. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> rewrite past newspaper articles, so that the historical record always supports the Party line. The workers are told they are correcting misquotations, when in actuality, they are writing false information as truth. The Minitrue also destroys all documents that have not been edited; in this way, there is no proof that the government is lying. Smith is a diligent and skillful worker, but he secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion against Big Brother. Smith's love interest and heroine of the novel, Julia, is based on Orwell's second wife, Sonia Orwell. Smith's attempts at self-education and rebellion are ultimately quashed when he is arrested by O'Brien of the Ministry of Love (or Miniluv), which is tasked with arresting and torturing dissidents and is forced into the horror chamber Room 101.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of his 31 years as a sports agent, Boras has {{represented}} hundreds of players on all 30 major league teams and has participated in dozens of high-profile negotiations. Boras's specialty is the record-breaking contract, which he says is the most difficult to achieve because it then provides an [...] "umbrella" [...] from which other players can benefit. Boras is well known for identifying sources of leverage for his clients and using them for the clients' advantage. This has included advising draft picks to return to school instead of signing, taking advantage of the right to go to salary arbitration hearings, and advising superstars to wait for free agency instead of taking [...] "hometown discount" [...] contracts. This does not endear him to fans, who regularly side with their favorite teams and not individual players. Boras, however, has said <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> represent his clients' interests, even if it means weathering public criticism. Boras is also known for his innovative strategies in the draft, salary arbitration and free agency, which have benefited his clients enough that Major League Baseball has changed its rules in response to Boras on multiple occasions. This has led to descriptions of Boras ranging from [...] "baseball's most hated man" [...] (from management's perspective) to the man [...] "players can't afford to live without." ...|$|E
2500|$|Holden {{decides to}} meet his old acquaintance, a Columbia student named Carl Luce, for drinks at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel, but alienates him with his {{fixation}} on sex. After Luce leaves, Holden gets drunk, awkwardly flirts with several adults, and calls an icy Sally. Exhausted and out of money, Holden wanders to Central Park to investigate the ducks, breaking Phoebe's record on the way. [...] Nostalgically recalling his experience in elementary school and the unchanging dioramas in the Museum of Natural History that he enjoyed visiting as a child, Holden heads home to see Phoebe. [...] He sneaks into his parents' apartment while they are out, and wakes up Phoebe – the only person with whom {{he seems to be}} able to communicate his true feelings. Although Phoebe is happy to see Holden, she quickly deduces that he has been expelled, and chastises him for his aimlessness and his apparent hatred for everything. When asked if he cares about anything, Holden shares a selfless fantasy he has been thinking about (based on a mishearing of Robert Burns's Comin' Through the Rye): he pictures himself as the sole guardian of thousands of children playing in a huge rye field {{on the edge of a}} cliff. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> catch the children if, in their abandon, they come close to falling off the brink; to be, in effect, the [...] "catcher in the rye". Because of this misinterpretation, Holden believes that to be the [...] "catcher in the rye" [...] means to save children from losing their innocence.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the series}} 9 premiere [...] "The Magician's Apprentice"/"The Witch's Familiar" [...] (2015), the Doctor, along with Clara and Missy, who survived her {{apparent}} disintegration, are {{summoned to the}} planet Skaro by The Doctor's archnemesis Davros (Julian Bleach), {{the creator of the}} evil Dalek race, who is dying. Davros plays on the Doctor's sympathies to trick him into revitalising a dying Dalek empire, siphoning some of the Doctor's regeneration energy to do so. The Doctor also enlivens a mass of dying Daleks consigned to the sewers of Skaro, who begin to tear the city apart, and he makes his escape with Clara, but not before visiting Davros as a young boy on the battlefields of Skaro, and instilling in him a lesson about the virtues of mercy. In [...] "The Girl Who Died," [...] the Doctor finally remembers that he shares a face with a man he was persuaded to save in Pompeii, despite his initial reluctance to alter the timeline. He surmises that he subconsciously chose this face as a reminder that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> save lives. He is inspired to resurrect Viking girl Ashildr (Maisie Williams) with alien technology; he learns in [...] "The Woman Who Lived" [...] that she has become immortal and watches over his past companions. In [...] "Face the Raven", Clara dies while trying to outsmart Ashildr, who stages an elaborate ploy to trap the Doctor, which he learns in [...] "Heaven Sent" [...] was on behalf of the Time Lords. Emerging from the trap on his home planet of Gallifrey, he sends a warning to his people of his return. In [...] "Hell Bent", the Doctor deposes Time Lord President Rassilon (Donald Sumpter) and uses Time Lord technology to save Clara from the moments before her death, and then proceeds to run away with her to the end of time in the hopes of cheating death permanently. He is then persuaded by Ashildr that he and Clara are a dangerous influence on each other, and perhaps together constitute the [...] "Hybrid of two great warrior races" [...] which is prophesied to destroy Gallifrey. The Doctor attempts to wipe Clara's memories of him using a device, but she alters it so that it affects his memories of her instead; she leaves him behind on Earth with his TARDIS to start adventuring again. She departs in her own stolen TARDIS, alongside Ashildr, promising to one day return to Gallifrey and accept her death.|$|E
