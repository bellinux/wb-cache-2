5|$|Paul I Šubić, Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia, became Lord {{of all of}} Bosnia in 1299. Although {{supporting}} the king, Paul <b>I</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> act independently, and ruled over {{a large portion of}} modern-day Croatia and Bosnia. He appointed his brothers as commissars of Dalmatian cities, and gave Split to his brother Mladen I Šubić, and Šibenik, Nin, Trogir and Omiš to his brother George I Šubić. After George I Šubić died in 1302, his brother Mladen I Šubić ruled as a Bosnian Ban over Bosnia from Klis Fortress, until he was killed in a battle during 1304. Then, Šubić gave the Klis Fortress to his son Mladen II Šubić, who ruled over Bosnia like his uncle Mladen I. George II Šubić and his son, Mladen III Šubić, ruled over Klis Fortress until the late 14th century. During summer-long festivities in Klis Fortress, open to the whole population, Mladen III Šubić gave his sister's Jelena Šubić hand in marriage to Vladislaus of Bosnia, from the House of Kotromanić. Jelena Šubić gave birth to the first Bosnian King, Tvrtko I, who later inherited the fortress.|$|E

In 1528 also, Francis used the pretext of the protection of Christians in the Ottoman Empire to again enter into contact with Suleiman, asking {{for the return of}} a mosque to a Christian Church. In his 1528 letter to Francis I Suleiman politely refused, but guaranteed the protection of Christians in his states. He also renewed the privileges of French merchants which had been obtained in 1517 in Egypt.|$|E

She made the choice, and because of it, <b>I</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way."

Unit III, the former Bonebrake Theological Seminary, was decontaminated in 1950 {{and returned to the}} Dayton Board of Education. The original seminary building was subsequently demolished, but several structures remain from the Dayton Project. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 10 May 2006. Unit IV, the former Runnymede Playhouse, was deemed too contaminated, so the building was demolished in February 1950. Even the cobblestones in the driveway were ripped up and taken away, along with [...] of earth from under the house. The excavation was filled in, and the site was returned to the Talbott family, who were paid $138,000 in compensation. The Dayton Warehouse was decontaminated in 1950 and returned to its owners.|$|E

2500|$|The newly reorganized Huguenot colonies {{under the}} Grand Directoire and General von Forcade {{received}} these edicts with tremendous gratitude and reassurance, and found effective {{protection from the}} King against the often violent levies that government officials from time-to-time attempted to impose. Above all, Frederick William <b>I</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> welcome the Huguenots with steadfast kindness. He increased the retirement pensions of the colony's clergy to 15,000 Thalers, founded two new colonies in Stettin (1721) and in Potsdam (1723), and showered them abundantly special privileges. The Grand Directoire under General von Forcade facilitated construction projects such as the Klosterkirche (1726), the Luisenstadtkirche (1727), and the Hospitalkirche in Berlin, {{as well as the}} French reformed churches in Königsberg and [...] Frederick William I emphatically preserved the colony's privileges, even in their disputes with provincial authorities, in particular those concerning the use of the French language, thereby continually attracting newcomers to the colonies, especially in Berlin and other notable cities, acquiring large numbers of competent officials for his administrations.|$|E
2500|$|Morath {{was briefly}} {{married to the}} British {{journalist}} Lionel Birch and relocated to London in 1951. That same year, she began to photograph {{during a visit to}} Venice. [...] "It was instantly clear to me that from now on I would be a photographer", she wrote. [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> photograph I became quite joyous. I knew that I could express the things I wanted to say by giving them form through my eyes." [...] Morath applied for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman, who was then an editor for Picture Post and running the picture-agency Report. When Guttman asked what Morath wanted to photograph, and why, she answered that [...] "after the isolation of Nazism I felt I had found my language in photography." [...] After Morath had spent several months working as Guttman's secretary, she had an opportunity to take photographs. [...] She sold her first photographs - of opening nights, exhibitions, inaugurations, etc. - under the pseudonym [...] "Egni Tharom", her name spelled backwards.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{years before}} Brown's arrival in Springfield, in 1844, the city's African-American abolitionists had founded the Sanford Street Free Church—now known as St. John's Congregational Church—which {{went on to}} become one of the United States most {{prominent}} platforms for abolitionist speeches. From 1846 until he left Springfield in 1850, Brown was a parishioner at the Free Church, where he witnessed abolitionist lectures by the likes of Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. In 1847, after speaking at the Free Church, Douglass spent a night speaking with Brown, after which he wrote, [...] "From this night spent with John Brown in Springfield, Mass. 1847 while <b>I</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> write and speak against slavery, I became all the same less hopeful for its peaceful abolition. My utterances became more and more tinged by the color of this man's strong impressions." [...] During Brown's time in Springfield, he became deeply involved in transforming the city into a major center of abolitionism, and one of the safest and most significant stops on the Underground Railroad.|$|E

2500|$|Davis {{explained}} her viewpoint to a journalist: [...] "I knew that, if <b>I</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> {{appear in}} any more mediocre pictures, I {{would have no}} career left worth fighting for." [...] Davis' counsel presented her complaints—{{that she could be}} suspended without pay for refusing a part, with the period of suspension added to her contract, that she could be called upon to play any part within her abilities regardless of her personal beliefs, that she could be required to support a political party against her beliefs, and that her image and likeness could be displayed in any manner deemed applicable by the studio. Jack Warner testified, and was asked, [...] "Whatever part you choose to call upon her to play, if she thinks she can play it, whether it is distasteful and cheap, she has to play it?" [...] Warner replied, [...] "Yes, she must play it." [...] The case, decided by Branson J. in the English High Court, was reported as Warner Bros. Studios Incorporated v. Nelson in [...] 1KB 209.

2500|$|Later that year, {{there was}} an {{occasion}} when Emperor Taizong held a feast for the high-level officials at Danxiao Hall (丹霄殿), and at the feast, Zhangsun Wuji made the comment, [...] "Wang Gui and Wei Zheng were our enemies before.

[...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Wang and Wei served their master faithfully, and that was why I retained them. [...] I do have a question: Every time that Wei gave me adverse advice and I did not accept it, then he refused to discuss the matter any further. [...] Why?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "I give adverse advise only when I believe that something should not be done. [...] If Your Imperial Majesty did not follow my advice, then if <b>I</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> speak about it, the matter would be settled and would be done. [...] That is why I spoke no further." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "You can first continue planning and then try to advise me again. [...] What harm is there?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "It was written that Emperor Shun warned his officials, 'Do not obey me in my presence and make secret speeches against what I do.' [...] If I know that something is wrong, but I continue to discuss it with Your Imperial Majesty, then I would be obeying you in your presence. [...] That is not how Houji [...] and Ziqi [...] served Emperor Shun."

2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As <b>I</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
