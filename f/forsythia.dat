25|$|As {{dental plaque}} or biofilm accumulates on the teeth near {{and below the}} gums, there is {{a shift in the}} {{composition}} of the biofilm from essentially streptococcus to an actinomyces dominant plaque. Motile bacteria is also seen more frequently. As this happens, inflammation sets in the gingiva. Initially, this takes the form of gingivitis, which represents inflammation confined to the soft tissues above the bone level. Inflammation in the gingiva can remain at the gingivitis level for a long period and will not progress to periodontitis, unless in the presence of local conditions or generalized host susceptibility. When this shift occurs, the immune system's response to plaque accumulation shifts from a predominantly neutrophilic mediated response to lymphocytic and plasma cell-mediated response. Clinically, the gingiva presents swelling, redness and a tendency to bleed. This modifies the environment, leading to changes in the composition of the biofilm itself. As this happens, a predominantly gram-negative environment is established, with periodontal pathogens emerging. These include A. actinomycetemcomitans, the red complex bacteria (P. gingivalis, T. <b>forsythia,</b> T. denticola) {{and to a lesser extent}} the orange complex bacteria (F. nucleatum, P. micros, P. intermedia, P. nigrecens, E. nodatum and S. constellates). Strongest bacterial association to chronic periodontitis is with P. gingivalis. Numerous virulence factors have been identified for this pathogen. This allows P. gingivalis to elude defense mechanism and perpetuate inflammation inside the periodontium. Prolonged inflammation in the periodontium leads to an apical shift in the attachment of the gingiva to the tooth with deepening pockets and bone loss around the teeth. Untreated periodontitis progresses unevenly over time but results in loss of function, tissue destruction, and tooth loss.|$|E

La Grive L5 is one of several fissure filling sites in the area, collectively known as La Grive-Saint-Alban, which have yielded rich fossil faunas. Another site, La Grive M, is the reference locality for the MN zone MN 7/8, about 13 to 11 million years ago.

40|$|The {{current study}} aims to {{investigate}} the effect of chitosan derivatives on the intestinal absorption and bioavailabilities of forsythoside A (FTA) and Chlorogenic acid (CHA), the major active components in Flos Lonicerae- Fructus <b>Forsythiae</b> herb couple. Biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics properties of the two compounds have been characterized in vitro, in situ {{as well as in}} rats. Based on the identified biopharmaceutics characteristics of the two compounds, the effect of chitosan derivatives as an absorption enhancer on the intestinal absorption and pharmacokinetics of FTA and CHA in pure compound form as well as extract form were investigated in vitro, in situ and in vivo. Both FTA and CHA demonstrated very limited intestinal permeabilities, leading to oral bioavailabilities being only 0. 50 % and 0. 13 % in rats, respectively. Results from both in vitro, in situ as well as in vivo studies consistently indicated that Chito-oligosaccharide (COS) at dosage of 25 mg/kg could enhance intestinal permeabilities significantly as well as the in vivo bioavailabilities of both FTA and CHA than CMCs in Flos Lonicerae- Fructus <b>Forsythiae</b> herb couple preparations, and was safe for gastrointestine from morphological observation.

6000|$|In {{considering}} the several cases above given of complete or almost complete self-sterility, we are first struck with their wide distribution throughout the vegetable kingdom. Their number {{is not at}} present large, for they can be discovered only by protecting plants from insects and then fertilising them with pollen from another plant {{of the same species}} and with their own pollen; and the latter must be proved to be in an efficient state by other trials. Unless all this be done, {{it is impossible to know}} whether their self-sterility may not be due to the male or female reproductive organs, or to both, having been affected by changed conditions of life. As in the course of my experiments I have found three new cases, and as Fritz Muller has observed indications of several others, it is probable that they will hereafter be proved to be far from rare. (9/13. Mr. Wilder, the editor of a horticultural journal in the United States quoted in 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1868 page 1286, states that Lilium auratum, Impatiens pallida and fulva, and <b>Forsythia</b> viridissima, cannot be fertilised with their own pollen.) ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} {{remarkable}} {{difference between the}} forms of several heterostyled species, namely in the anthers of the short-styled flowers, which contain the larger pollen-grains, being longer {{than those of the}} long-styled flowers. This is the case with Hottonia palustris in the ratio of 100 to 83. With Limnanthemum Indicum the ratio is as 100 to 70. With the allied Menyanthes the anthers of the short-styled form are a little and with Villarsia conspicuously larger than those of the long-styled. With Pulmonaria angustifolia they vary much in size, but from an average of seven measurements of each kind the ratio is as 100 to 91. In six genera of the Rubiaceae there is a similar difference, either slightly or well marked. Lastly, in the trimorphic Pontederia the ratio is 100 to 88; the anthers from the longest stamens in the short-styled form being compared with those from the shortest stamens in the long-styled form. On the other hand, there is a similar and well-marked difference in the length of the stamens in the two forms of <b>Forsythia</b> suspensa and of Linum flavum; but in these two cases the anthers of the short-styled flowers are shorter than those of the long-styled. The relative size of the anthers was not particularly attended to in the two forms of the other heterostyled plants, but I believe that they are generally equal, as is certainly the case with those of the common primrose and cowslip.|$|E

The observation from the pharmacokinetics displayed that the exposure level in vivo of neochlorogenic acid, 3, 4 -dicaffeoylquinic acid, isoforsythoside and forsythoside A, higher than that in single herbs, was the main factor contributing to the difference by both PCA and HCA, interestingly consistent with the results obtained fro...|$|R
