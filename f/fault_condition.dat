25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to detect a <b>fault</b> <b>condition</b> and, by interrupting continuity, to immediately discontinue electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then has to be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual household appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Inspired by the works of American scientist Joseph Henry and English scientist Michael Faraday, the circuit breaker was invented by an American, Charles Grafton Page.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to compare different neural network based classifiers for the accurate and reliable assessment of the status of specific <b>fault</b> <b>conditions</b> in a system with multiple <b>fault</b> <b>conditions</b> present. The proposed strategy utilizes features extracted from vibrational data and employs selforganising maps (SOMs), radial basis function (RBF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks to model the status of <b>fault</b> <b>conditions,</b> and to discriminate between different <b>fault</b> <b>conditions.</b> Different combinations of vibrational features are evaluated in terms of their ability to support the reliable identification of and discrimination between multiple <b>fault</b> <b>conditions.</b> The results indicate that both SOM and RBF neural classifiers can be trained to reliably identify specific faults in a system with multiple <b>fault</b> <b>conditions</b> present. It is furthermore shown that neural classifiers trained with data reflecting one type of fault mechanism only cannot reliably distinguish between observations with multiple <b>fault</b> <b>conditions</b> present.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} an {{innovative}} approach in detecting <b>fault</b> <b>conditions</b> in a battery in which multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) technique is applied using electrochemical {{model of a}} Li-Ion cell. This physics based model of Li-ion battery (with LiCoO 2 cathode chemistry) with healthy battery parameters was considered as the reference model. Battery <b>fault</b> <b>conditions</b> such as aging, overcharge, and over discharge cause significant variations of parameters from nominal values and {{can be considered as}} separate models.

2500|$|The {{number of}} poles {{represents}} the number of conductors that are interrupted when a <b>fault</b> <b>condition</b> occurs. [...] RCDs used on single-phase AC supplies (two current paths), such as domestic power, are usually one- or two-pole designs, also known as single- and double-pole. A single-pole RCD interrupts only the energized conductor, while a double-pole RCD interrupts both the energized and return conductors. (In a single-pole RCD, the return conductor is usually anticipated to be at ground potential at all times and therefore safe on its own, however see limitations below).|$|E

Depending upon their design, some RCDs disconnect both the energized and return conductors upon a fault, while others only disconnect the energized conductor and rely upon the return conductor being at ground (earth) potential. [...] The former {{are commonly known as}} [...] "double-pole" [...] designs; the latter as [...] "single-pole" [...] designs. [...] If the fault has left the return wire [...] "floating" [...] or not at its expected ground potential for any reason, then a single-pole RCD will leave this conductor still connected to the circuit when it detects the fault.|$|E

This paper presents an optimal torque and speed control strategy for permanent magnet (PM) motors under phase open circuit <b>fault</b> <b>conditions.</b> A per-phase harmonic model of a generic PM machine is utilized to obtain the optimal control signals under <b>faulted</b> <b>conditions.</b> This harmonic model considers the saliency of self inductances and the interaction of harmonic components, which are therefore accounted for the optimization process. Controllability of harmonics is achieved with harmonic injection pulse width modulation (HIPWM). Two versions of optimizations, viz. operation with minimized torque ripple, and a multi-objective optimization which also minimizes copper loss and inverter reactive power transfer, are considered. The speed controller is formulated as a cascaded loop feedback / feedforward system, which facilitates operation even with current sensor <b>fault</b> <b>conditions.</b> The proposed controller is extensively analyzed {{by means of a}} ﬁnite element model (FEM) based dynamic simulation of a ﬁve phase interior permanent magnet machine.
