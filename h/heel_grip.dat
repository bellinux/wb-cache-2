50|$|Hobnailed {{boots were}} {{formerly}} used for mountaineering to grip on sloping rock surfaces. Mountaineering hobnailed boots {{tended to have}} large pointed hobnails on the extreme edges of the soles and <b>heels</b> to <b>grip</b> small roughness on steeply sloping rock and on snow, particularly before crampons were used.|$|R
50|$|The {{magazine}} {{catch is}} {{to the rear of}} the trigger guard and not at the <b>heel</b> of the <b>grip</b> in the typical European fashion of the time. A pistol lanyard is installed in the heel position for pistol retention. There is no magazine safety.|$|R
6000|$|Just at {{this point}} John {{received}} such a fright as entirely took away his powers of moving or breathing, for something laid hold of his <b>heels</b> with deadly <b>grip.</b> He was getting his breath to yell when a familiar voice at his ear said, in a tone somewhere between a whisper and a groan: ...|$|R
25|$|The P7 {{is fed from}} a single-stack box {{magazine}} with a capacity of 8 rounds, which is held inside the firearm's frame with a release located at the <b>heel</b> of the <b>grip.</b> After the last round has been fired, the slide will remain open thanks to a slide catch that can be released by pulling the slide further back or pressing the squeeze cocker.|$|R
50|$|Colt {{changed the}} design of the Woodsman in 1955. The three Models {{remained}} the same, but the markings, grips and sights underwent slight changes. The most significant was relocating the magazine release {{from the rear of the}} trigger guard to the <b>heel</b> of the <b>grip</b> as on the first series. Colt also introduced new models, such as the less expensive Challenger and Huntsman Models equipped with fixed sights. From 1960 walnut stocks with a thumbrest were optional, in place of the standard black plastic stocks.|$|R
50|$|The Beretta 93R is {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} the Beretta 92. It can be selected to fire either a three round burst or single fire. A selector switch enables the operator to alternate between the two firing modes. The pistol is fitted with a vertical foregrip at {{the front end of}} the trigger guard to provide better stability when firing. A folding steel buttstock can be attached at the <b>heel</b> of the <b>grip.</b> The 93R is considered difficult to control when being repeatedly fired in burst mode because of the 1,100-round-per-minute firing rate.|$|R
50|$|Offered between 1902-1928, the Military Model 1902 {{differed}} from the sporting version in that the grip handle was a bit longer and square-shaped so as to house one additional round of ammunition in the magazine. The Military model featured the mechanical slide stop and had a lanyard loop on the <b>heel</b> of the <b>grip,</b> it was also slightly heavier. Military models produced prior to 1908 had rounded hammers, while post-1908 models had spur hammers. Colt presented one of these pistols to then-President Theodore Roosevelt. Overall, approximately 18,068 total units of the Military Model 1902 version were produced.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1006 pistol was introduced, Smith and Wesson issued a recall on the {{one-piece}} plastic grip. It seems when the pistol was dropped on its <b>heel,</b> the plastic <b>grip</b> could break, allowing the hammer spring to fly free. Customers who contacted Smith and Wesson were sent new grips at no charge. Smith and Wesson {{did not ask}} for the bad grips to be sent back and these suspect grips are still showing up at gun shows to this day. The new replacement grip has a center punched mark {{on the bottom of the}} heel, whereas the bad grips did not.|$|R
40|$|Background: Postural balance {{training}} is primarily used by athletes as rehabilitation after previous injuries or for prevention. A {{few studies have}} been made with the aim of investigating whether postural balance training can improve other physical functions in healthy participants. However, there is no consensus regarding effects. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether postural balance training can improve muscle function in healthy adult athletes. Method: Seventeen healthy adult (6 males and 11 females) athletes between the ages of 21 and 50 years performed three postural balance exercises once a day 3 x 30 seconds per exercise on each leg. This intervention was performed daily for six weeks. Their muscle function were assessed with squat jump, <b>heel</b> rise and <b>grip</b> strength (control). Evaluation was done before and after the training period. Results: Jump height, number of repetitions in heel rise and duration in standing on one leg increased with statistical significance. There were no improvements in postural sway and grip strength. Conclusion: The results suggest that a postural balance training period can provide a better local muscle function regarding explosive strength and endurance among adult athletes even if postural sway is not affected...|$|R
5000|$|The CZ 52's {{operating}} controls {{consist of a}} single-action trigger, an external hammer, a magazine catch located at the <b>heel</b> of the <b>grip</b> frame, and a combination de-cock/safety lever located on the left rear side of the receiver aft of the left grip panel. The manual safety blocks movement of the sear, which prevents the hammer from releasing and firing a round. A second safety, {{in the form of}} a spring-loaded firing pin block, prevents the pistol from firing unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear; this feature renders the pistol [...] "drop safe". However, if the firing pin block spring has become worn, the pistol may be rendered unsafe in the event of a muzzle down drop, or in the case of other internals being worn, it may be drop safe only when [...] "cocked and locked", for instance. Care should be taken when handling firearms of uncertain origin, and only a competent gunsmith should be relied upon to verify the safety mechanisms of surplus guns are intact. Because the sear must overcome the additional spring pressure of the firing pin block, an inherent feature of the CZ 52 is its unusually heavy trigger pull, often in the 8-10 pound range. The hammer is of the rebounding type, meaning that it does not contact the firing pin while in its uncocked position, and cannot do so unless the trigger is pulled, another safety feature. It should be noted that using the decocker relies on the integrity of firing pin block; if the firing pin block is worn, an unintentional discharge can result.|$|R
