5|$|Soluble epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> (sEH) is a bifunctional {{enzyme that}} in humans is encoded by the EPHX2 gene. sEH {{is a member}} of the epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> family. This enzyme, found in both the cytosol and peroxisomes, binds to {{specific}} epoxides and converts them to the corresponding diols. A different region of this protein also has lipid-phosphate phosphatase activity. Mutations in the EPHX2 gene have been associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
5|$|The same triad {{has also}} convergently evolved in α/β hydrolases such as some lipases and esterases, however {{orientation}} of the triad members is reversed. Additionally, brain acetyl <b>hydrolase</b> (which has the same fold as a small G-protein) has also {{been found to have}} this triad. The equivalent Serine-Histidine-Glutamate triad is used in acetylcholinesterase.|$|E
5|$|The form of sEH in the {{intracellular}} {{environment is}} a homodimer with two distinct activities {{in two separate}} structural domains of each monomer: the C-terminal epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> activity (soluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10) and the N-terminal phosphatase activity (lipid-phosphate phosphatase: EC 3.1.3.76). sEH converts epoxides, or three membered cyclic ethers, to their corresponding diols through {{the addition of a}} molecule of water. The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent epoxides, and so are more readily excreted by the organism.|$|E
5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some <b>hydrolase</b> and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E
25|$|Lactase (also {{known as}} lactase-phlorizin <b>hydrolase,</b> or LPH), {{a part of}} the β-galactosidase family of enzymes, is a {{glycoside}} <b>hydrolase</b> involved in the hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent galactose and glucose monomers. Lactase is present predominantly along the brush border membrane of the differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. In humans, lactase is encoded by the LCT gene.|$|E

25|$|HxA3 is {{extremely}} unstable and HxB3 is moderately unstable, rapidly decomposing to their tri-hydroxy products, for example, during isolation procedures that use an even mildly acidic methods; {{they are also}} rapidly metabolized enzymatically in cells to these same tri-hydroxy products, termed trioxilins (TrX's) or trihydroxyeicoxatrienoic acids (THETA's); HxA3 is converted to 8,11,12-trihydroxy-5Z,9E,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin A3 or TrXA3) while TxB3 is converted to 10,11,12-trihydroxy-5Z,8Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin B3 or TrXB3). A third trihydroxy acid, 8,9,12-trihydroxy-5Z,10E,14Z eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin C3 or TrXC3), has been detected in rabbit and mouse aorta tissue incubated with arachidonic acid. The metabolism of HxA3 to TrXA3 and HXB3 to TrX is accomplished by soluble epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> in mouse liver; since it is widely distributed in various tissues of various mammalian species, including humans, soluble epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> may be the principal enzyme responsible for metabolizing these and perhaps other hepoxilin compounds. It seems possible, however, that other similarly acting epoxide hydrolases such as microsomal epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> or epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> 2 may prove to hepoxilin <b>hydrolase</b> activity. While the trihydroxy products of hepoxilin synthesis are {{generally considered to be}} inactive and the sEH pathway therefore considered as functioning to limiting the actions of the hepoxilins, some studies found that TrXA3, TrXB3, and TrXC3 were more powerful than HxA3 in relaxing pre-contracted mouse arteries and that TrXC3 was a relatively potent relaxer of rabbit pre-contracted aorta.|$|E
25|$|Valproic {{acid and}} {{valnoctamide}} both inhibit microsomal epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> (MEH), the enzyme {{responsible for the}} breakdown of carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide into inactive metabolites. By inhibiting MEH, valproic acid and valnoctamide cause a build-up of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion.|$|E
25|$|Ricin toxic A chain (RTA) is an N-glycoside <b>hydrolase</b> {{composed}} of 267 amino acids. It has three structural domains with approximately 50% of the polypeptide arranged into alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The three domains form a pronounced cleft {{that is the}} active site of RTA.|$|E
25|$|Unlike anandamide, {{formation}} of 2-AG is calcium-dependent and is {{mediated by the}} activities of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). 2-AG acts as a full agonist at the CB1 receptor. At a concentration of 0.3nM, 2-AG induces a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free calcium in NG108-15 neuroblastoma X glioma cells through a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism. 2-AG is hydrolyzed in vitro by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), fatty acid amide <b>hydrolase</b> (FAAH), and the uncharacterized serine <b>hydrolase</b> enzymes ABHD6 and ABHD12. The exact contribution {{of each of these}} enzymes to the termination of 2-AG signaling in vivo is unknown, though it is estimated that MAGL is responsible for ~85% of this activity in the brain. There have been identified transport proteins for 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide. These include the heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs).|$|E
25|$|The {{tissue samples}} are then {{examined}} {{under a microscope}} to determine whether cancer cells are present, and to evaluate the microscopic features (or Gleason score) of any cancer found. Prostate specific membrane antigen is a transmembrane carboxypeptidase and exhibits folate <b>hydrolase</b> activity. This protein is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues and {{is associated with a}} higher Gleason score.|$|E
25|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome can be induced by overfeeding with sugar or fructose, particularly concomitantly with high-fat diet. The resulting oversupply of omega-6 fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid (AA), {{is an important}} factor in the pathogenesis of {{metabolic syndrome}}. Arachidonic acid (with its precursor - linoleic acid) serve as a substrate to the production of inflammatory mediators known as eicosanoids, whereas the arachidonic acid-containing compound diacylglycerol (DAG) is a precursor to the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) while fatty acid amide <b>hydrolase</b> (FAAH) mediates the metabolism of arachidonic acid into anandamide. Anandamide can also be produced from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine via several pathways. Anandamide and 2-AG can also be hydrolized into arachidonic acid, potentially leading to increased eicosanoid synthesis.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of S. pneumoniae to survive the defenses of the host. In particular, the host’s polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae can also secrete an enzyme (murein <b>hydrolase)</b> that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.|$|E
25|$|RhlA is an α, β <b>hydrolase</b> (analysis by Fugue {{structural}} prediction programme). This fold is {{a common}} structural motif in fatty acid synthetic proteins and RhlA shows homology to transacylases. It has been shown using enzyme assays that the substrate for RhlA is hydroxyacyl-ACP rather than hydroxyacyl-CoA suggesting that it catalyses the formation of HAAs directly from the type II fatty acid synthase pathway (FASII). Furthermore, RhlA preferentially interacts with hydroxyacyl-ACP with an acyl chain length of ten carbon residues. The hydroxyacyl-ACP substrate of RhlA {{is the product of}} FabG, a protein which encodes the NADPH-dependent β-keto-acyl-ACP reductase required for fatty acid synthesis. It {{is a member of the}} FASII cycle along with FabI and FabA, which synthesise the precursors utilised by FabG.|$|E
25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of {{ascorbic acid}} {{starts with the}} formation of UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucuronic acid is formed when UDP-glucose undergoes two oxidations catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD+ as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a UMP and glucuronokinase, with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to D-glucuronic acid. The aldehyde group of this is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme glucuronate reductase and the cofactor NADPH, yielding L-gulonic acid. This is followed by lactone formation with the <b>hydrolase</b> gluconolactonase between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. L-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other Haplorrhini primates) and the cofactor FAD+. This reaction produces 2-oxogulonolactone, which spontaneously undergoes enolization to form ascorbic acid.|$|E
25|$|The {{paradigm}} of toxicological assessment of benzene is shifting towards {{the domain of}} molecular toxicology as it allows understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms in a better way. Glutathione seems {{to play an important}} role by protecting against benzene-induced DNA breaks and it is being identified as a new biomarker for exposure and effect. Benzene causes chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow explaining the higher incidence of leukemia and multiple myeloma caused by chronic exposure. These aberrations can be monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA probes to assess the effects of benzene along with the hematological tests as markers of hematotoxicity. Benzene metabolism involves enzymes coded for by polymorphic genes. Studies have shown that genotype at these loci may influence susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene exposure. Individuals carrying variant of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), microsomal epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> (EPHX) and deletion of the glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) showed a greater frequency of DNA single-stranded breaks.|$|E

500|$|Carnivory {{has evolved}} {{multiple}} times independently in plants in widely separated groups. In three species studied, Cephalotus follicularis, Nepenthes alata and Sarracenia purpurea, {{there has been}} convergence at the molecular level. Carnivorous plants secrete enzymes into the digestive fluid they produce. By studying phosphatase, glycoside <b>hydrolase,</b> glucanase, [...] RNAse and chitinase enzymes {{as well as a}} pathogenesis-related protein and a thaumatin-related protein, [...] the authors found many convergent amino acid substitutions. These changes were not at the enzymes' catalytic sites, but rather on the exposed surfaces of the proteins, where they might interact with other components of the cell or the digestive fluid. The authors also found that homologous genes in the non-carnivorous plant Arabidopsis thaliana tend to have their expression increased when the plant is stressed, leading the authors to suggest that stress-responsive proteins have often been co-opted in the repeated evolution of carnivory.|$|E
2500|$|Cif {{belongs to}} the α/β <b>hydrolase</b> family of proteins. [...] Its {{structure}} was determined by X-ray crystallography and consists of the canonical α/β <b>hydrolase</b> fold with a cap domain, which it uses to constitutively homo-dimerize in solution. [...] The active site is buried {{in the interior of}} the protein at the interface between the α/β <b>hydrolase</b> core and the cap.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{enzymes that}} {{are present in}} the {{intestinal}} lumen may be involved in the hydrolysis of dietary retinyl esters. Cholesterol esterase is secreted into the intestinal lumen from the pancreas and has been shown, in vitro, to display retinyl ester <b>hydrolase</b> activity. In addition, a retinyl ester <b>hydrolase</b> that is intrinsic to the brush-border membrane of the small intestine has been characterized in the rat {{as well as in the}} human. [...] The different hydrolyzing enzymes are activated by different types of bile salts and have distinct substrate specificities. [...] For example, whereas the pancreatic estrase is selective for short-chain retinyl esters, the brush-border membrane enzyme preferentially hydrolyzes retinyl esters containing a long-chain fatty acid such as palmitate or stearate. [...] Retinol enters the absorptive cells of the small intestine, preferentially in the all-trans-retinol form.|$|E
2500|$|Mature human lactase {{consists}} of a single 160-kDa polypeptide chain that localizes to the brush border membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. [...] It is oriented with the N-terminus outside the cell and the C-terminus in the cytosol. LPH contains two catalytic glutamic acid sites. [...] In the human enzyme, the lactase activity has been connected to Glu-1749, while Glu-1273 {{is the site of}} phlorizin <b>hydrolase</b> function.|$|E
2500|$|Valproate {{inhibits}} CYP2C9, glucuronyl transferase, and epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> and {{is highly}} protein bound and hence may interact with {{drugs that are}} substrates {{for any of these}} enzymes or are highly protein bound themselves. It may also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of alcohol. It should not be given in conjunction with other antiepileptics due to the potential for reduced clearance of other antiepileptics (including carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and phenobarbitone) and itself. It may also interact with: ...|$|E
2500|$|The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO or ALOX5) {{converts}} {{arachidonic acid}} into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), {{which may be}} released and rapidly reduced to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) by ubiquitous cellular glutathione-dependent peroxidases. [...] Alternately, ALOX5 uses its LTA synthase activity to act convert 5-HPETE to leukotriene A4 (LTA4). LTA4 is then metabolized either to LTB4 by Leukotriene A4 <b>hydrolase</b> or Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by either LTC4 synthase or microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2 (MGST2). Either of the latter two enzymes act to attach the sulfur of cysteine's thio- (i.e. SH) group in the tripeptide glutamate-cysteine-glycine to carbon 6 of LTA4 thereby forming LTC4. After release from its parent cell, the glutamate and glycine residues of LTC4 are removed step-wise by gamma-glutamyltransferase and a dipeptidase to form sequentially LTD4 and LTE4. The decision to form LTB4 versus LTC4 depends on the relative content of LTA4 <b>hydrolase</b> versus LTC4 synthase (or glutathione S=transferase in cells; Eosinophils, mast cells, and alveolar macrophages possess relatively high levels of LTC4 synthase and accordingly form LTC4 rather than or to a far greater extent than LTB4. 5-LOX may also work in series with cytochrome P450 oxygenases or aspirin-treated COX2 to form Resolvins RvE1, RvE2, and 18S-RvE1 (see Specialized pro-resolving mediators#EPA-derived resolvins).|$|E
2500|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{amino acids}} and breakdown of sugars by yeasts {{has the effect}} of creating other biochemical compounds that can contribute to the flavor and aroma of wine. These compounds can be considered [...] "volatile" [...] like aldehydes, ethyl acetate, ester, fatty acids, fusel oils, hydrogen sulfide, ketones [...] and mercaptans or [...] "non-volatile" [...] like glycerol, acetic acid and succinic acid. Yeast also has the effect during fermentation of releasing glycoside <b>hydrolase</b> which can hydrolyse the flavor precursors of aliphatics (a flavor component that reacts with oak), benzene derivatives, monoterpenes (responsible for floral aromas from grapes like Muscat and Traminer), norisoprenoids (responsible for some of the spice notes in Chardonnay), and phenols.|$|E
2500|$|Cif is an epoxide <b>hydrolase</b> (EH) {{with unique}} {{substrate}} selectivity. [...] Cif {{is the first}} example of an EH serving as a virulence factor. Based on structural comparison, {{it appears that the}} enzyme utilizes a catalytic triad of residues Asp129, Glu153 and His297, with accessory residues His177 and Tyr239 coordinating the epoxide oxygen during ring opening. [...] Cif is also the first example of an EH utilizing a His-Tyr pair to coordinate an epoxide substrate, rather than the canonical Tyr-Tyr pair. In the proposed enzyme mechanism, Asp129 nucleophilically attacks a carbon of the epoxide moiety of a substrate, forming an ester linked enzyme-acyl intermediate. The preference for which carbon is attacked varies depending upon the substrate. In the second step of the reaction, a water molecule is activated by the charge-relay His297-Glu153 pair, and undergoes nucleophilic attack on the Cγ of Asp129. This hydrolyzes the ester group, liberating the hydrolysis product as a vicinal diol.|$|E
2500|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{the tobacco}} smoke procarcinogen benzopyrene involves three distinct steps [...] the introduction of an epoxide group in the 7,8-position, its hydration to a vicinal diol {{and the introduction of}} an epoxide in the 9,10-position. [...] In the first step, a cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) catalysed oxidation produces several products including (+)-benzopyrene-7,8-epoxide. [...] The enzyme epoxide <b>hydrolase,</b> then hydrates the epoxide ring to yield the vicinal diol (...) -benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol, which is then oxidised by cytochrome P450 oxidase again forming the mutagen and carcinogen (+)-benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide. [...] This diol epoxide covalently binds to DNA by a ring-opening to alkylate the nucleobase forming a distorted structure, as shown at right, with intercalation of a pyrene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moiety between the base pairs favouring π-stacking; these distortions have been confirmed by X-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance structure studies. [...] Aflatoxin has a similar mechanism of action, though its binding is through the N7, rather than the N2, position of guanine. [...] Multiple stereochemical outcomes are possible from these transformations. [...] The anti stereoisomer (shown here) and its enantiomer are the ultimate carcinogens from benzopyrene, but the syn isomers are also produced.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{proteins}} listed that interact with CCDC130, including EEF1A1, NINL, TRAF2, ZBTB16, ZNF165, and ZNF24. EEF1A1 is a eukaryotic elongation factor that {{is involved in}} the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes during translation. [...] NINL is a ninein-like protein that is involved in microtubule organization and has calcium ion binding activity. TRAF2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 2, is part of some E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and is involved in ubiquitinating proteins so they can get degraded by the proteasome. ZBTB16, zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 16, is also part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is most likely involved in substrate recognition. There is also an alternate form of CCDC130 where only 803 bases are transcribed instead of 1433 bases, but there is no additional information provided. [...] ZNF165 and ZNF24 are both zinc finger proteins, which bind DNA and other proteins to regulate transcription. Below is a table of the interacting proteins for CCDC130 assembled by GeneCards. The interactions of CCDC130 with NINL, ZNF24, TRAF2, JUP, GATA5 have been verified by a two-hybrid screen according to STRING, so these interactions do occur. JUP is a plaque protein. GATA5 is a transcription factor that helps activate the promoter for lactase-phlorizin <b>hydrolase.</b> Interactions with CDA, DERA, CDC40, NAA25, DGCR14, NAA20, and PRPF19 have not been verified experimentally, but interactions between gene homologs have been documented in other species according to STRING so these interactions could potentially occur. ZBTB16, EEF1A1, and ZNF165 all have been verified by at least one two-hybrid screen according to MINT. NAT9 was described as a known interactant on I2D. In a study done at the University of the District of Columbia to characterize CCDC130, they have found that it is induced through insulin signaling, is targeted by three different kinases (GSK3, CK1, and CK2), and is a mitochondrial protein.5 The study also shows that CCDC130 can potentially be used as a biomarker for certain types of cancer due to its differential expression in cancer cells. The study specifically mentions that CCDC130 is downregulated in some types of colon cancer, which allowed more cancer cells to be untargeted by the apoptosis pathway.|$|E
