25|$|When she {{discovers the}} truth about Zelena's {{feelings}} for Hades' from Regina, Cora suspects that her daughter is being played for a fool by Hades, so she makes a potion from the Lethe that would make Zelena forget about Hades. When Cora finally meets Zelena, this mother-daughter reunion doesn't go smoothly as planned, and even Zelena <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> what they did with {{the water from the}} River Lethe they put the spell on, as she turns down her mother's false apology. This leads to a fight between Regina and Zelena but before this escelates, Cora restores their childhood memories of each other and she regretted the way she raised them, and apologizes to her daughters. Now that the sisters have made peace, Cora decides that it's time for her to move on from her unfinished business. As they see their mother walk toward the bridge, the flames from the River of Fire erupt and wrap around her.

500|$|Aboard the plane, an {{annoying}} extension cord salesman named Warren Beach (Garry Marshall) {{does little to}} assuage Monk's fears. Monk quickly becomes suspicious of Stefan Chabrol after he notices that Barbara no longer needs to stand on her toes to kiss him, has [...] "forgotten" [...] that she ordered the vegetarian meal, knows nothing about air travel despite a frequent-flyer lapel, and claims to have [...] "forgotten how to" [...] speak French when an old family friend, Bernard, meets them on board.

500|$|Simon Eden of Cross Rhythms {{gave the}} album ten {{out of ten}} squares, saying [...] "With 'Lifesong' being officially [...] second release, the {{pressure}} <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> {{see if they can}} deliver. The simple answer is quite probably yes as the band use a refreshing formula that challenges the Church instead of serving up milk and cookies". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave it three out of five stars, opining [...] "Overall, Lifesong is musically an assortment of experimentation and familiarity, as the band continues to offer songs with relatable messages to the church body. Frontman and chief songwriter Mark Hall's strained, shouting-style vocals is [...] still an acquired taste, along with his straightforward and often simplistic lyrics, but Lifesong is a noteworthy second chapter in an already impressive career for this young band". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting [...] " [...] comes from the school of U2-influenced modern-worship music, so its songs predictably build to sweeping choruses and dramatic climaxes. The band's message is more distinctive, calling out the [...] "happy plastic people under shiny plastic steeples" [...] to offer themselves to the lonely, the grieving, the desperate".|$|E

Standing out from its counterparts increasingly with each passing season, the series has been described as eventually becoming the weirdest show in network prime time. It has been characterized as serving up distinguishing blasts of surrealism. As the series progressed, MacFarlane realized that Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> something uniquely appealing; moreover, he realized they <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> something that sharply contrasted from Family Guy, which audiences appreciated.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{returns from}} {{a weekend in}} Paris with Phoebe, his new fiancée, and insists that Liz should get to know Phoebe better. He tells her to take Phoebe and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) on a girls' day out. As their day {{progresses}} Liz senses Phoebe is not who she claims to be. Liz's suspicions are confirmed when she covertly follows Phoebe to a restaurant and spies her holding hands with an older gentleman. This is alarming for two reasons: first, Phoebe is already engaged to Jack, and secondly, she has previously claimed to be afflicted by [...] "Avian Bone Syndrome," [...] a result {{of which is that}} her purportedly brittle bones {{would not be able to}} stand such intense physical contact. Even though Liz tries to remain inconspicuous at the restaurant, Phoebe notices her. Knowing that Liz <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> her deceptions, Phoebe confronts Liz, who is not interested in Phoebe's excuses and tells her that she has a choice: tell Jack about her cheating or Liz will do so herself. Phoebe becomes angry and then shocks Liz when she drops her British accent. Liz tries to tell Jack about her suspicions, but he is immediately offended by her seemingly unfounded and slanderous comments about his fiancée, which puts a heavy strain on their working relationship.|$|E

When Emma learns via text that Zelena, Hook, and the others have disappeared, Regina goes right to Gold’s hotel room and tells him that she may be turning to darkness again. Emma tries to snag the Olympian Crystal as Gold is distracted, but he <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> their scheme {{and is about to}} vanquish them, when Henry enters with the Holy Grail and drains the crystal of magic; Gold, Regina and Emma are now powerless. Gold quips [...] "Storybrooke survived for 28 year without magic, I'm sure it can manage a few more [...] ". He explains Storybrooke was never in danger, just the magic he brought to it; he lied to motivate Emma and Regina into finding Henry.

2500|$|Others, such as N. W. Thomas and Sigmund Freud have {{rejected}} this explanation. Freud explains that [...] "the associated theory of magic merely explains the paths along which magic proceeds; {{it does not}} explain its true essence, namely the misunderstanding which leads it to replace {{the laws of nature}} by psychological ones". Freud emphasizes that what led primitive men to come up with magic is the power of wishes: [...] "His wishes are accompanied by a motor impulse, the will, which is later destined to alter the whole face of the earth in order to satisfy his wishes. This motor impulse is at first employed to give a representation of the satisfying situation {{in such a way that}} it becomes possible to experience the satisfaction by means of what might be described as motor hallucinations. This kind of representation of a satisfied wish is quite comparable to children's play, which succeeds their earlier purely sensory technique of satisfaction. [...] As time goes on, the psychological accent shifts from the motives for the magical act on to the measures by which it is carried out—that <b>is,</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the act itself. [...] It thus comes to appear as though it is the magical act itself which, owing to its similarity with the desired result, alone determines the occurrence of that result." ...|$|E
