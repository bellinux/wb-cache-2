60|$|Then {{it would}} have been ill indeed with King Arthur but for that forest madman. For beholding the fall of the King, Sir Launcelot ran {{straightway}} to him. And he seized the sword of the King and plucked it forth from its sheath. Therewith he leaped at the boar and lashed at it a mighty buffet, and as he did so his foot slipped in the blood of the horse which there lay upon the ground, and he fell flat with the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>blow</b> which he purposed should destroy the boar.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{at those}} blows Sir Tristram waxed so {{exceedingly}} fierce {{that it was}} as though a fire of rage flamed up into his brains and set them into a blaze of rage. So with that he rose up in his stirrups and launched so dreadful a blow upon Sir Gawaine that I believe nothing could have withstood the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>blow.</b> For it clave through the shield of Sir Gawaine and it descended upon the crown of his helmet and it clave away a part of his helmet and a part of the epauliere of his shoulder; and with the force of that dreadful, terrible blow, Sir Gawaine fell down upon the ground and lay there as though he were dead.|$|E

60|$|The {{stranger}} {{seemed to}} grow impatient at these remonstrances. He carelessly lifted his mighty club, and let it fall upon a rock that lay half buried in the earth, near by. With the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> idle <b>blow,</b> the great rock was shattered all to pieces. It cost the stranger no more effort to achieve this feat of a giant's strength than {{for one of the}} young maidens to touch her sister's rosy cheek with a flower.|$|R

[...] "Reginald! O brother, look up!" [...] cried Eustace. [...] "O Gaston, does he live?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was unwilling}} to let Lucy say any more on this subject, for her voice, her countenance, I might almost say her whole figure showed how much it cost her to say even this much of Rupert. I had long known that Lucy did not respect her brother {{as much as she}} could wish; but this was never before betrayed to me in words, nor in any other manner, indeed, that would not have eluded the {{observation}} of one who knew the parties less thoroughly than myself. I could perceive that she felt the awful consequences she foresaw from her brother's conduct gave me a claim on her sincerity, and that she was suffering martyrdom, in order to do all that lay in her own power to lessen the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blow</b> <b>that</b> unworthy relative had inflicted. It would have been ungenerous in me to suffer such a sacrifice to continue a moment longer than was necessary.|$|R
60|$|Terence {{had been}} in the centre of one of the squares but, just as they were {{breaking}} through the French ranks, he had ridden to the rear face; and called upon the men to turn and repulse a body <b>of</b> French cavalry, <b>that</b> was charging down upon them. At this moment a bullet struck his horse in the flank. Maddened with the sudden pain, the animal sprang forward, broke through the ranks of the Portuguese in front of it and, before Terence could recover its command, dashed at full speed among the French cavalry. Before he could strike a blow in defence, Terence was cut down. As he fell the cavalry passed over him but, fortunately, the impetus of his charge had carried him nearly through their ranks before he fell; and the horses of the rear rank leapt over his body, without touching him. It was the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blow</b> <b>that</b> had felled him for, in the hurry of striking, the trooper's sword had partly turned, and it was with the flat rather than the edge that he was struck.|$|R
60|$|This battle-axe was a {{very famous}} weapon. It was one which Richard had caused {{to be made for}} himself before leaving England, and it was the wonder of the army on account of its size and weight. The object of a battle-axe was to break through the steel armor with which the knights and warriors of those days were {{accustomed}} to cover themselves, and which was proof against all ordinary blows. Now Richard was a man of prodigious personal strength, and, when fitting out his expedition in England, he caused an unusually large and heavy battle-axe to be made for himself, by way of showing his men what he could do in swinging a heavy weapon. The head of this axe, or hammer, as perhaps it might more properly have been called, weighed twenty pounds, and most marvelous stories were told <b>of</b> the prodigious <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blow</b> <b>that</b> Richard could strike with it. When it came down on the head of a steel-clad knight on his horse, it broke through every thing, they said, and crushed man and horse both to the ground.|$|R

We find that the natural rate of unemployment has indeed shifted higher—but much less so than has been suggested.
