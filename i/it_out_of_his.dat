5|$|The retiarius was {{routinely}} {{pitted against}} a heavily armed secutor. The net-fighter {{made up for}} his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks {{and waiting for the}} opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net and pull <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the secutor grab hold of it, the retiarius likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the retiariuss final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.|$|E

He offers {{to take them}} into town to get fitted into rubber boots, but they end up spending the money he gave them on drinks. Monty is hurt, though he puts <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mind quickly during a boozy round of poker. Marwood is terrified of what else Monty might try on him and wants to leave immediately. After much argument, Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood keeps trying to evade Monty but he eventually corners him in the guest bedroom. Monty reveals that Withnail, when arranging to borrow the cottage, had told Monty that Marwood was a closeted homosexual and that he himself had rejected Marwood's advances. Marwood claims that Withnail is the closeted one and {{that the two of}} them have been in a committed relationship for years. He claims that Withnail is only rejecting him because Monty is around, and that this is the first night that they haven't slept together in years. Monty, a romantic, accepts this explanation and apologises for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail and insists that he will pay.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before his}} revocation, Hoover {{experienced}} serious engine {{problems in a}} North American T-28 Trojan {{off the coast of}} California. During his return to Torrance, he was able to keep the engine running intermittently by constantly manipulating the throttle, mixture, and propeller levers. The engine seized at the moment of touchdown. Hoover believed his successful management of this difficult emergency should have convinced the FAA that he hadn't lost any ability. Meanwhile, Hoover was granted a pilot's license, and medical certificate by Australia's aviation authorities. Hoover's medical certificate was restored shortly afterward and he returned to the American air show circuit for several years before retiring in 1999. At 77 years old Hoover still felt capable of performing and passed a rigorous FAA physical post retirement, but he was unable to obtain insurance for air shows. Although he had had free insurance for several years as part of air show sponsorship deals, he was forced in 1999 to pay for <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own pocket and could not get coverage under $2 million. His final air show was on November 13, 1999 at Luke Air Force base. His last flight in his famous Shrike Commander was on October 10, 2003 from Lakeland, Florida to the Smithsonian Air and Space museum in Washington D.C. with long time friend Steve Clegg.|$|E
500|$|Hextall {{brought a}} new style of goaltending to the NHL, {{providing}} support to his two defencemen due to his willingness {{to come out of}} the net and play the puck. He was known for his excellent puck-handling ability. In Hextall's time, goaltenders would limit themselves to stopping the puck behind the net, make short push passes, or at most clear the puck out of the zone with [...] "clumsy" [...] backhands. He distinguished himself by using his stick as a defenceman would; for example, he was capable of starting a counterattack, easily lifting the puck or bouncing it off the glass. Hextall's puck-handling ability meant that it was inadvisable to try a dump and chase strategy of sending the puck in a corner, regaining it, and establishing an attack in the offensive zone, because Hextall would invariably get to the puck first and clear <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> zone towards a waiting player in the neutral zone. He was described by former NHL player Peter McNab [...] as the [...] "original outlet pass goalie".|$|E
500|$|Mendes {{encouraged}} some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in {{bed beside}} Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, [...] "I wanted that {{not just because}} it was funny but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth without thinking. [...] is so in control—I wanted him to break through." [...] Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.|$|E

500|$|In late June, {{the three}} Republican Representatives from Wisconsin commented on Thompson's campaign. Though Representative Tom Petri {{identified}} himself as a supporter and hailed Thompson for doing [...] "a lot {{for the country and}} the state and the Republican Party of Wisconsin" [...] he called Thompson [...] "a long shot" [...] and stopped short of endorsing him. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner described Thompson's campaign as [...] "anemic" [...] and Representative Paul Ryan commented that [...] "I think {{a lot of us are}} hoping the best for Tommy and are wishing him well but are just sort of watching the field to see how it materializes." [...] Other Republicans wondered if Thompson was running just to [...] "get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> system." [...] Strategist Mark Graul argued that the former governor [...] "had a profound impact" [...] on party members in Wisconsin, which had created a familiarity complex that caused people to say [...] "'Oh, come on'" [...] after hearing of his run. Despite the qualms, spokesman Steve Grubbs remarked that Thompson wants [...] "for people to give him a chance... he knows he has a lot to prove, and he is working 90 hours a week to prove it." [...] A Strategic vision poll of Iowa voters placed Thompson in fifth place among the candidates, with only 6 percent support. To improve his standing ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, Thompson planned to escalate his Iowa campaign after July 4 in a swing labeled the [...] "Common Sense Solutions Tour". Communications director Rennick Remley remarked that despite low amounts of capital, Thompson would spend [...] "scads of time in Iowa in July." [...] He compared Thompson's strategy to Jimmy Carter's 1976 [...] "retail politics" [...] strategy that led to victory in the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but if we lose our freedom, we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E

2500|$|... 1874 was a busy {{year for}} both Gilbert and Cellier.

(a novel by Annie Edwardes), an adaptation from the French, Committed for Trial, another adaptation from the French called The Blue-Legged Lady; and a play, Sweethearts. He also wrote a Bab-illustrated story called [...] "The Story of a Twelfth Cake" [...] for the Graphic Christmas number.

The series makes no mention of Harry recovering the map from Moody's office, even though he continued to use it in later books; when asked about this discrepancy, Rowling answered that Harry had indeed sneaked into the office and recovered it in the days following the Third Task, and that she had forgotten to include this detail in the book. When asked during an online question session, [...] "What child did Harry give the Marauder's Map to, if any?"

[...] Bowman further wrote that the recording of the What's Going On single was [...] "...the first single to utilize all three as Marvin developed a radical approach to constructing his recordings by layering a series of contrapuntal background vocal lines on different tracks, each one conceived and sung in isolation by Marvin himself." [...] Bowman cites Gaye's multi-tracking of his tenor voice and other vocal styles [...] "summon up what might be termed the ancient art of weaving".|$|E
2500|$|In the {{tradition}} of Lull, Zwemer ‘left behind a mighty highway of print almost a book a year in English for over half a century.’ As part of this great literary undertaking, he settled in Cairo in 1912 {{to work with the}} Nile Mission Press to make it ‘a production point for Christian Literature for Muslims.’ As an outcome of the Edinburgh World Missionary Conference in 1910, he established the quarterly The Moslem World in 1911 because ‘If the Churches of Christendom are to reach the Moslem world with the Gospel, they must know of it and know it.’ He edited it until 1947, paying for much of <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own pocket. He founded the American Christian Literature Society for Moslems (A.C.L.S.M) which raised over {{a quarter of a million}} dollars for the production of evangelical literature.

Johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about [...] from Greenwood. According to one theory, Johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted. In an account by the blues musician Sonny Boy Williamson, Johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance, who gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband. When Johnson took the bottle, Williamson knocked <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand, admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened. Johnson replied, [...] "Don't ever knock a bottle out of my hand." [...] Soon after, he was offered another (poisoned) bottle and accepted it. Johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours. Over the next three days his condition steadily worsened.

2500|$|In {{the opening}} scene, Abraham prays to God, thanking Him for His various blessings, {{most of all}} his {{favourite}} son, Isaac. Next, God reveals to an angel that he will test Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice Isaac. The angel conveys this instruction to Abraham who, though he is distraught, agrees to comply with it. Abraham takes Isaac {{to the place of}} sacrifice, his grief made all the greater by Isaac (not yet knowing he is the [...] "qweke best" [...] intended for sacrifice) being eager to aid his father. When Abraham reveals that he means to kill him, Isaac at first pleads for his life. However, when he learns that it is God's will that he should die, Isaac acquiesces in his death, even urging his father not to tarry over the deed. Abraham binds Isaac so that he will not deflect his father's sword but when he draws that sword and prepares to strike, the angel appears and takes <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand. The angel reveals that God is pleased with Abraham's obedience and that Isaac need not be sacrificed after all. Leaving them with a ram, the angel departs. As they make the offering, God appears above (the medieval custom was to have God act at a higher level than other characters) and promises them that “for thys dede | I schall mvltyplye yowres botheres [...] sede | As thyke as sterres be in the skye”.
