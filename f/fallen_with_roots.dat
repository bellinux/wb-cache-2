40|$|The {{mismatch}} in {{the number}} of degrees of freedom supported by volume holograms and the boundary fields that control them limits the dynamic range of recorded holograms. For holograms controlled by using fractal sampling grids, the maximum dynamic range <b>falls</b> inversely <b>with</b> the minimum number of exposures needed to record the hologram, the rank of the hologram. In adaptive holography, feedback between coupled holograms prevents the dynamic range from decreasing faster than the fundamental limit. If the control problem is overcome, the maximum dynamic range that a hologram can support <b>falls</b> inversely <b>with</b> the square <b>root</b> of the rank. In principle, holograms in which the dynamic range <b>falls</b> inversely <b>with</b> the square <b>root</b> of the rank can be recorded by using cross-spectrally coherent polychromatic pulses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Laboratory {{triaxial}} {{tests of}} the soil reinforced <b>with</b> <b>roots</b> of Manilagrass were carried out {{in order to understand}} the stress-strain relationship. The change of shear strength indexes of the soil reinforced <b>with</b> <b>roots</b> of Manilagrass was investigated with the quantity of grassroots planted in the soil specimens. The results of laboratory triaxial tests show that the strength and capacity for resisting the deformation of soil reinforced <b>with</b> <b>roots</b> are better than those of unreinforced soil. And under the certain number of grassroots layers, the strength and capacity for resisting the deformation of soil reinforced <b>with</b> <b>roots</b> increase firstly and then reduce with the increasing of Manilagrass roots quantity. In other words, there is an optimal quantity of Manilagrass roots affecting the strength and capacity for resisting the deformation of soil reinforced <b>with</b> <b>roots.</b> The research results are important for understanding the mechanism and use of vegetation protection for slope...|$|R
