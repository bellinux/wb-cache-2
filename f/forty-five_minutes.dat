5|$|Shatner's cut ran {{slightly}} over two hours (not including end credits or the opticals), which Paramount thought was too long. Their target runtime was one hour <b>forty-five</b> <b>minutes,</b> which would guarantee twice-nightly theatrical screenings.

5|$|Riley and Nye made {{arrangements}} with James Pond {{to make two}} national tours during 1888 and 1889. The tours were popular and generally sold out, with hundreds having to be turned away. The shows were usually <b>forty-five</b> <b>minutes</b> to an hour long and featured Riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from Nye. The shows were informal {{and the two men}} adjusted their performances based on their audiences reactions. Riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility. Many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows. At a New York City show in March 1888, Augustin Daly was so enthralled by the show he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading Broadway theatre actors.|$|E

Rainilaiarivony sent an interpreter to carry a white flag to the French commander and entreat his clemency. <b>Forty-five</b> <b>minutes</b> later he was joined by Radilifera, the Prime Minister's son, to request the conditions of surrender; these were immediately accepted.

5|$|Once {{the brigade}} arrived, {{many of the}} Germans around the drop zone withdrew or offered no further resistance. The first unit on the ground, 10 Para, {{attacked}} and destroyed the Dutch SS Wachbattalion while Brigadier Hackett personally captured ten Germans shortly after landing. When Hackett arrived at brigade headquarters, he was informed by Lieutenant Colonel Mckenzie of the division's staff about the change in plans, explaining that 11 Para was to be detached from his brigade to support the push into Arnhem. At {{the same time the}} KOSB, until then responsible for defending the northern side of the landing grounds, were attached to 4th Parachute Brigade to replace 11 Para. Meanwhile, the KOSB still had to defend landing-zone 'L', to protect gliders arriving on day three. While Hackett formulated a new plan, Mckenzie returned to divisional headquarters, to be informed on his arrival that 60 German tanks were approaching Arnhem from the north. Transport aircraft passing over occupied channel ports had confirmed German suspicions of a second lift such {{that they were able to}} give their troops at Arnhem <b>forty-five</b> <b>minutes</b> advance notice of the allies' arrival.

40|$|Interactive {{installations}} {{staged in}} unusual settings create compelling experiences that blend explicit and implicit performances. When users {{can participate in}} the performance of an unfolding story, they perform for the others who may be watching. In this paper, we explore interactive installations from a performative perspective to exploit performance in this context. First, we discuss five key themes that inspired the design of our installation: visibility of manipulation and effects; continuous and discrete exhibition; peripheral and central content; curating and discovering interaction; and distributed and central staging. Second, we present Sunken Ripples, an interactive experience that explores these themes by combining a spherical display with an epic IMAX screen. We exhibited Sunken Ripples in two <b>forty-five</b> <b>minute</b> showings as part of a film festival. We discuss the success of the design based on feedback from twenty-three participants who attended the exhibition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Rx for Discovery Reading® is an {{intervention}} {{developed by the}} National Institute for Learning Development to impact the reading abilities of students below grade level in reading. For this study, the areas of phonological processing, decoding, and fluency were investigated using pre- and post-test scores from the KTEA-II, GORT, and DIBELS. The problem studied was whether Rx for Discovery Reading® would raise the mean standard scores in these three areas. Using a small-group format, twenty-nine students {{were involved in the}} intervention for fifty <b>forty-five</b> <b>minute</b> sessions over one school year. Eight NILD educational therapists in a variety of geographical areas implemented the intervention.
