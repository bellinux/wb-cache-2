500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2004, Wood was {{the first}} Assembly Member to be ordered out of the chamber, after {{referring}} to the Queen as [...] "Mrs Windsor" [...] during a debate. Lord Elis-Thomas, a fellow Plaid Cymru AM and the Presiding Officer, asked Wood to withdraw the remark {{on the grounds of}} discourtesy. When Wood refused, she was ordered to leave. She later said: [...] "I don't recognise the Queen ... I don't think I was treated fairly, I don't think it was necessary. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> that because that's her name." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{future husband}} Allan McKeown had {{reservations}} about her launching a music career and tried talking {{her out of}} it. “When I first met Miss Ullman, I was a TV producer, and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> into my office in London and I {{told her that she}} had a big career in comedy, and she said to me, ‘Well actually, I’m doing a record next week,’ and I said, ‘Now listen here Miss Ullman, if I know anything about show business, is that you shouldn’t get involved with singing. Imagine how stupid I felt about four months later, I’m in London driving around and I hear, ‘And now, the Top of the Pops, Tracey Ullman with ‘They Don’t Know About Us.’” ...|$|E

There's no family pride about me, there's no imaginative sentimental humbug about me. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> a spade a spade; and <b>I</b> <b>call</b> the mother of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, without any fear or any favour, what <b>I</b> should <b>call</b> <b>her</b> if she had been the mother of Dick Jones of Wapping.

2500|$|After asking Wood who the [...] "coolest" [...] indie label was, Phair {{called up}} Gerard Cosloy, co-president of Matador Records, in 1992 {{and she asked}} him if he would put out her record. Coincidentally, Cosloy had just read a review of Girly Sound in Chemical Imbalance that very day and told Phair to send him a tape. Phair sent him a tape of six Girly Sound songs. Cosloy recalls: [...] "The songs were amazing. It was a fairly {{primitive}} recording, especially compared to the resulting album. The songs were really smart, really funny, and really harrowing, sometimes all at the same time[...] [...] [...] I liked it a lot and played it for everybody else. We usually don't sign people we haven't met, or heard other records by, or seen as performers. But I had a hunch, and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> back and said O.K." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> {{from where}} I stood--"Annabel Lee!" [...] She {{lifted her head}} and shook back her hair, and gazed at me startled and intent. I went nearer.|$|E

6000|$|He paused--his {{emotions}} for {{the instant}} bereft him of speech. After an interval, he muttered {{to himself in}} a low, moaning voice--'I called her harlot! My pure, innocent child! <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> harlot--I called her harlot!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> don't <b>call</b> <b>her</b> 'mother' just by itself," [...] he {{explained}} to Anne.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her</b> silly. She {{is not very}} wise; but she has no pretensions--absolutely none--so that one is not struck with {{anything}} incongruous." ...|$|R

60|$|On our way upstairs, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> {{attention}} to the sudden disappearance of Mrs. Crupp's pitfalls, and also to the prints of recent footsteps.

6000|$|... "No, she's my mother's cousin really--only <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her</b> Aunty, {{we always}} got on so. She isn't really {{much older than}} me, her name is Wendermott--Ernestine Wendermott. Ernestine's a pretty name, don't you think?" ...|$|R
60|$|Simply {{because it}} seemed a meanness to play the spy on her in her solitude, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> name. But her start of {{surprise}} was mere feigning.

6000|$|As I {{had been}} discoursing about Mary's charms Schneider listened with much {{complacency}} and attention: when I spoke about her fortune, his interest redoubled; and when <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> father an aristocrat, the worthy ex-Jesuit gave a grin of satisfaction, {{which was really}} quite terrible. O fool that I was to trust him so far! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm awfully sorry I {{made fun}} of her doll when Jamie lugged it out; and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> 'baby bunting' when she cried over the dead kitten.

6000|$|... "There you are, you see," [...] said Tom with sombre triumph; [...] "you oughtn't to {{have noticed}} {{a thing like}} that. It oughtn't to matter to you what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> always {{think of her as}} Dolly." ...|$|R
