40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model and}} an approximated solution approach to optimize the <b>inventory</b> <b>service</b> level in a two-stage distribution-inventory system. Service level and related inventory control decisions are tackled simultaneously with network design decisions (i. e., warehouse location and customer assignment).

The solution approach considers a two-step reformulation, in which the first step optimizes the service level and the second step deals with location and remaining inventory decisions. The optimal service level is obtained iteratively by searching a marginal equilibrium between system and unfilled demand costs. For each iteration an inventory-location model with fixed service level is solved, and the service level is updated to reach the equilibrium condition. The algorithm converged in three iterations for a small instance, obtaining the same results as a simple search procedure of the optimal service level...|$|E

This research focuses on the improvement of the depot level maintenance (DLM) since it has considerable influence over the combat readiness of the K- 1 TV.

The model with these logistics elements is simulated for the acquirement of data and the results provide guidance about the interactions of logistics elements. The analysis of the results shows the effective procedures and the significant elements during DLM of the K- 1 TV.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the context}} of service-oriented computing, {{services}} provide the capabilities necessary to support the business, especially its processes. Within the service modeling process, the services that constitute a common and stable basis for all supported processes have to be identified. The consideration of each business process on its own, without guidelines, may yield a <b>service</b> <b>inventory</b> that is not adjusted with all requirements, and for instance contains several services providing the same capability, having an inappropriate granularity, or using different taxonomies. Thus, this paper suggests applying rules on a model capturing relevant business requirements to systematically derive a blueprint as a proposal of necessary services.

The study documented in this paper originated within a large health-care insurance provider seeking optimal strategies relative to target inventories of pending inquiries concerning insurance policy coverage and concomitant staffing levels of policy analysts. Since several clients of this insurance provider were large companies within the automotive industry, the provider dedicated significant staffing segments {{to the service of}} these accounts (hence to the employees of those automotive companies who thereby held insurance coverage). The simulation study worked within this constraint to provide management valuable strategic recommendations. Most specifically, the insurance provider wished to develop a model capable of predicting service levels (average time required to answer specific questions submitted on behalf of two major clients and average inventory level of these questions pending) as a function of number of full-timeequivalent analysts assigned to each of those clients...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{inventory}} management {{is critical to}} retailing and supply chain management success. Surprisingly, there is little published empirical research examining fundamental relationships between retail inventory, customer service and sales. Based on a survey of 101 chain store units, this paper develops and tests hypotheses about retail inventory. Seventy-five percent of the store owners/managers responded to the mail survey. As expected, significant relationships are found between <b>inventory,</b> <b>service</b> and sales. 1 Supply chain management (SCM) is concerned with flows of products and information between supply chain organizations (Handfield and Nichols 1999), {{for the purpose of}} serving consumer demand at a profit. According to Nevill, et al. (1998), SCM works to get stock to {{the right place at the}} right time, at lower cost. The “right place ” is often a retail store, where goods are available for consumer inspection and purchase. Inventory management is at the heart of SCM, since inventory must be available to serve customers. Moreover, the ability to service demand with lower inventory levels improves return on investment (ROI) both above and below the line. Inventory reduction increases return, by reducing the cost of carrying inventory [...] and reduces investment in inventory (Copacin...|$|E
