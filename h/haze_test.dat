40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, the {{influence}} of oxygen precipitates in the bottom part of multicrystalline silicon ingots on the metal diffusion has been studied. According to the well known <b>haze</b> <b>test,</b> an experimental setup for the measurement of diffusion velocity at 700 °C was developed, in which the copper was detected using Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence. Differences in the diffusion velocity and the gettering amount for copper in samples with low-oxygen and high-oxygen were observed. Thus gettering efficiency seems {{to be dependent on}} oxygen content. Metal precipitates detected were found to contain Si, O and Cu. Since these precipitates appear along grain boundaries, it is assumed that grain boundaries act as a diffusion channel. As a consequence, oxygen precipitates located at the grain boundary should be most effective for intrinsic gettering. The results of these studies are encouraging since they imply that an optimized oxygen precipitate concentration in the bottom zone of a multicrystalline silicon ingot can be used as an effective intrinsic diffusion barrier...|$|E

40|$|Bentonite fining {{is used in}} the {{clarification}} of white wines to prevent protein haze. This treatment results in the loss of {{a significant portion of the}} wine itself, as well as aroma compounds important for the quality of white wines. Among other interesting effects on wine quality, yeast cell wall mannoproteins have been shown to stabilize wine against protein haze. A previous work showed that wine yeast strains engineered by deletion of KNR 4 release increased amounts of mannoproteins and produce wines showing attenuated responses in protein <b>haze</b> <b>tests.</b> This paper describes the technological properties of several new recombinant wine yeast strains, deleted for genes involved in cell-wall biogenesis, as well as the regulatory gene KNR 4. Stabilization of wines produced by three of the six recombinant strains analyzed required 20 − 40 % less bentonite than those made with their nonrecombinant counterparts. The availability of multiple targets for genetically improving yeast mannoprotein release, as shown in this work, is relevant not only for genetic engineering of wine yeast but especially for the feasibility of genetically improving this character by classical methods of strain development such as random mutagenesis or sexual hybridization.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The {{influence}} of cultivar and maturity on polyphenolic composition and antioxidant activity was investigated by UV-Visible spectrophotometry and analytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in commercially important blackberry cultivars and selections. The anthocyanin pigments changed tremendously with ripening. Total anthocyanins increased from 74. 7 - 317 mg/ 100 g fw from underripe to over ripe for 'Marion', and from 69. 9 - 164 mg/ 100 g fw for 'Evergreen'. Total phenolics {{did not show}} marked change with maturity with values slightly decreasing from underripe to ripe. Antioxidant activities, while increasing with ripening, did not show the noticeable change that total anthocyanins exhibited. The total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents varied greatly among 11 cultivars. Total anthocyanins ranged from 131 - 256 mg/ 100 g fw (mean = 198), total phenolics from 682 - 1056 mg GAE/ 100 g fw (mean = 900), ORAC from 37. 6 - 75. 5 μmolTE/g fw (mean = 50. 2), and FRAP ranged from 63. 5 - 91. 5 μmolTE/g fw (mean = 77. 5). Four blackberry cultivars {{were found to be}} higher in total anthocyanins and total phenolics than 'Marion' and 'Evergreen', the predominant commercial cultivars in the Pacific Northwest. The results from these studies confirmed that blackberries are a good source of natural antioxidants and colorant, and demonstrated the potential for obtaining new cultivars with high pigment/phenolic content through classical plant breeding. The investigation on the incidence of haze and sediment formation revealed that the sediment in the commercial reconstituted 'Evergreen' blackberry (CRE) juice was composed of ellagic acid, protein, and unidentified compounds. The qualitative tannin and protein-tannin <b>haze</b> <b>test</b> indicated that the sediment was predominantly tannin or protein-tannin complexes. Nitrogen determination showed the sediment to be 6. 69 ± 2. 21...|$|E

40|$|Beer haze is {{primarily}} formed through complexation of protein and polyphenolic beer ingredients. The problem of reducing susceptibility of beer haze formation {{can be done}} either by lowering protein and/or polyphenol levels, or by minimizing the molecular size of protein/polyphenols. In experimental part of this work the shelf life of unstabilized beer is being compared with beer stabilized with various standard products, such as PVPP and silica gel. Furthermore, the trials {{have been made to}} prove the functionality of a new product consisting of carrageenan and cross-linked PVPP. The method used to determine shelf life was <b>haze</b> forcing <b>test</b> (0 / 60 °C). Extract, alcohol, bitterness, foam, haze, color and pH were also monitored. The test results showed expectedly that combined treatment of beer ensures the highest level of product stability.

40|$|We present new {{calculations}} of transit spectra of super-Earths {{that allow for}} atmospheres with arbitrary proportions of common molecular species and <b>haze.</b> We <b>test</b> this method with generic spectra, reproducing the expected systematics and absorption features, then apply it to the nearby super-Earth GJ 1214 b, which has produced conflicting observational data, leaving the questions of a hydrogen-rich versus hydrogen-poor atmosphere and the water content of the atmosphere ambiguous. We present representative transit spectra {{for a range of}} classes of atmosphere models for GJ 1214 b. Our analysis supports a hydrogen-rich atmosphere with a cloud or haze layer, although a hydrogen-poor model with less than 10 % water is not ruled out. Several classes of models are ruled out, however, including hydrogen-rich atmospheres with no haze, hydrogen-rich atmospheres with a haze of about 0. 01 -micron tholin particles, and hydrogen-poor atmospheres with major sources of absorption other than water. We propose an observational test to distinguish hydrogen-rich from hydrogen-poor atmospheres. Finally, we provide a library of theoretical transit spectra for super-Earths with a broad range of parameters to facilitate future comparison with anticipated data.

40|$|In bright beers, the {{formation}} of permanent haze is a serious quality problem that places limitations on the storage life of the product. From silica gel, used for the colloidal stabilization of beer, a silica eluent (SE) protein fraction was isolated and an antibody raised against this fraction. Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) immunoblot analysis using the SE antiserum detected a range of protein bands in barley, malt, beer, and haze. Interestingly, a polymorphism was observed in some barley varieties that contained an 12, 000 -molecular-weight band (SE +ve), while in other varieties, this band was absent (SE –ve). Pilot brewing trials found that beer brewed from SE –ve varieties formed less haze in <b>haze</b> force <b>testing</b> trials (5 days at 55 °C/ 1 day at 0 °C) than did beer produced from SE +ve varieties. The interaction between the presence/absence of the SE protein and controlled-atmosphere brewing by brewing under nitrogen or air was also investigated. Surprisingly, {{the application of a}} nitrogen-rich atmosphere produced beer that was less stable compared with that produced when brewing under a normal atmosphere. Filtration trials showed that the colloidal stability of beer could be influenced by the filtration process. The removal of the SE protein and other proteins during filtration from beer brewed with an SE +ve malt variety, along with a reduction in the level of total protein as measured by Bradford, resulted in improved colloidal stability. Combined, these investigations are discussed in terms of brewers’ options for extending the colloidal stability of their beer and optimizing the colloidal stabilization treatments...|$|R
40|$|The WMAP haze is {{an excess}} in {{microwave}} emission {{coming from the}} center of the Milky Way galaxy. In the case of synchrotron emission models of the <b>haze,</b> we present <b>tests</b> for the source of radiating high-energy electrons/positrons. We explore several models in the case of a pulsar population or dark matter annihilation as the source. These morphological signatures of these models are small behind the WMAP Galactic mask, but are testable and constrain the source models. We show that detailed measurements of the morphology may distinguish between the pulsar and dark matter interpretations as well as differentiate among different pulsar models and dark matter profile models individually. Specifically, we find that a zero central density Galactic pulsar population model is in tension with the observed WMAP haze. The Planck Observatory's greater sensitivity and expected smaller Galactic mask should potentially provide a robust signature of the WMAP haze as either a pulsar population or the dark matter.

40|$|Unlike {{majority}} of sorts of alcoholic drinks beer is considered significantly un-stable. This thesis examines the factors influencing {{the stability of}} beer, especially phys-ical-chemical, primarily content of polyphenols and potential of components of beer to form haze. Twenty eight samples from differently large breweries were processed (Černá Hora, Poutník Pelhřimov, Pegas, Richard and minibrewery of Mendel University in Brno). The total content of polyphenols was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method (spectrophotometrically at 750 nm) and subsequently expressed {{in the content of}} ferulic acid, which served as a standard for purposes of this study. The average con-tent of polyphenols was in Černá Hora Sklepní 338, 5 mg. l- 1, in light lager beer Poutník 370 mg. l- 1, in light lager beer Pegas 694, 5 mg. l- 1, in light lager beer Richard 726, 3 mg. l- 1, in wheat beer from Mendel University in Brno 562 mg. l- 1 and in Rauch from Mendel University in Brno 817 mg. l- 1. Turbidity of beer for consumption and potential of beer components to form <b>haze</b> using EBC <b>test</b> was also assessed.

40|$|Single image dehazing is an {{important}} low-level vision task with many applications. Early researches have investigated different kinds of visual priors to address this problem. However, they may fail when their assumptions are not valid on specific images. Recent deep networks also achieve relatively good performance in this task. But unfortunately, due to the disappreciation of rich physical rules in hazes, large amounts of data are required for their training. More importantly, they may still fail when there exist completely different <b>haze</b> distributions in <b>testing</b> images. By considering the collaborations of these two perspectives, this paper designs a novel residual architecture to aggregate both prior (i. e., domain knowledge) and data (i. e., haze distribution) information to propagate transmissions for scene radiance estimation. We further present a variational energy based perspective to investigate the intrinsic propagation behavior of our aggregated deep model. In this way, we actually {{bridge the gap between}} prior driven models and data driven networks and leverage advantages but avoid limitations of previous dehazing approaches. A lightweight learning framework is proposed to train our propagation network. Finally, by introducing a taskaware image decomposition formulation with flexible optimization scheme, we extend the proposed model for more challenging vision tasks, such as underwater image enhancement and single image rain removal. Experiments on both synthetic and realworld images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework...|$|R
40|$|Aims. We present numerically calculated, disk-integrated, spectropolarimetric {{signals of}} starlight that is {{reflected}} by vertically and horizontally inhomogeneous gaseous exoplanets. We include various spatial {{features that are}} present on Solar System’s gaseous planets: belts and zones, cyclonic spots, and polar <b>hazes,</b> to <b>test</b> whether such features leave traces in the disk-integrated fux and polarization signals. Methods. Broadband flux and polarization signals of starlight that is reflected by gaseous exoplanets are calculated using an efficient, adding-doubling radiative transfer code, that fully includes single and multiple scattering and polarization. The planetary model atmospheres are vertically inhomogeneous and can be horizontally inhomogeneous, and contain gas molecules and/or cloud and/or aerosol particles. Results. The broadband flux and polarization signals are sensitive to cloud top pressures, although {{in the presence of}} local pressure differences, such as in belts and clouds, the flux and polarization phase functions have similar shapes as those of horizontally homogeneous planets. Fitting flux phase functions of a planet with belts and zones using a horizontally homogeneous planet could theoretically yield cloud top pressures that differ by a few hundred mbar from those derived from fitting polarization phase functions. In practice, however, observational errors and uncertainties in cloud properties would make such a fit unreliable. A cyclonic spot like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, covering a few percent of the disk, located in equatorial regions, and rotating {{in and out of the}} observer’s view yields a temporal variation of a few percent in the broadband flux and a few percent in the degree of polarization. Polar hazes leave strong traces in the polarization of reflected starlight in spatially resolved observations, especially seen at phase angles near 90 °. Integrated across the planetary disk, polar hazes that cover only part of the planetary disk, change the broadband degree of polarization of the reflected light by a few percent. Such hazes have only small effects on locally reflected broadband fluxes and negligible effects on disk-integrated broadband fluxes. Conclusions. Deriving the presence of belts and zones in the atmospheres of gaseous exoplanets from broadband flux and polarization observations will be extremely difficult. Cyclonic spots could leave temporal changes in the broadband flux and polarization signals of a few percent. Polar hazes that cover a fraction of the planetary disk, and that are composed of small, Rayleigh scattering particles, change the broadband degree of polarization by at most a few percent.
