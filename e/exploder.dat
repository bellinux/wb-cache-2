5|$|T2E1 Mine <b>Exploder</b> – This mine {{exploding}} equipment, {{which was}} meant to be used with the boom on the M32, was essentially the T2 mine <b>exploder,</b> but scaled up for use by the U.S. Marines. It was impractical, and the project was abandoned in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|Christie {{urged the}} Navy Department to {{allocate}} a target ship for extensive field {{tests of the}} torpedo and <b>exploder.</b> The Chief of Naval Operations authorized {{the use of the}} obsolete destroyer , but placed so many restrictions on its use, Newport was forced to decline the offer. As a result, neither the Mark 6 <b>exploder</b> nor the Mark 14 torpedo ever underwent a live test, and their shortcomings would not become apparent until the outbreak of hostilities. It would be twenty months before the problems were corrected, over Christie's objections.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1943, Lockwood had {{received}} enough reports from submarine officers to convince him the Mark 6 was significantly flawed. On 24 June 1943, he formally ordered all submarines operating out of Pearl Harbor to deactivate the magnetic influence feature. However, Christie was still committed to the <b>exploder,</b> and ordered Fremantle boats to continue using the influence feature. Submarines operating between the two commands were required to either enable or disable it, depending on which command area they were in. This difference of opinion strained {{relations between the two}} admirals.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Linking Open Data {{community}} project is promoting {{the creation of}} interlinked RDF datasets with links between data items identified using dereferenceable URIs. This promising direction for publishing data on the web brings forward a number of issues. A key challenge is to understand the data, the schema, and the interlinks that are actually used both within and across linked datasets. Understanding actual RDF usage is critical in the increasingly common situations where terms from many different vocabularies are mixed (potentially with no consistent RDFS or OWL schema). In this {{paper we propose a}} novel mechanism to describe RDF usage by combining neighborhood defining queries with bisimilar contractions to produce bisimulation contractions of neighbourhoods (or BCNs). We present algorithms for computing BCNs and describe a tool, <b>ExpLOD,</b> that supports constructing and visualizing BCNs. <b>ExpLOD</b> can also generate SPARQL queries based on the BCNs. We use <b>ExpLOD</b> to describe RDF usage within several of the collections from the Linked Open Data cloud. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present <b>ExpLOD,</b> a {{framework}} which exploits {{the information available}} in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud to generate a natural language explanation of the suggestions produced by a recommendation algorithm. The methodology is based on building a graph in which the items liked by a user {{are connected to the}} items recommended through the properties available in the LOD cloud. Next, given this graph, we implemented some techniques to rank those properties and we used the most relevant ones to feed a module for generating explanations in natural language. In the experimental evaluation we performed a user study with 308 subjects aiming to investigate to what extent our explanation framework can lead to more transparent, trustful and engaging recommendations. The preliminary results provided us with encouraging findings, since our algorithm performed better than both a non-personalized explanation baseline and a popularity-based one...|$|R
5|$|The M32 was {{considered}} inadequate for {{its role as}} an armored recovery vehicle, especially during the Korean War, because of the narrow tracks which gave the vehicle insufficient flotation to wade through water and the horsepower of the engine was insufficient to pull large tanks, such as the M26 Pershing. Some M32B1s were also shipped to Britain under Lend-Lease, where they were designated the ARV Mark III by the British Army. The Ordnance Department attempted to replace the M32 with the T12 Armored Recovery Vehicle in 1944 in M26 Pershing companies, but the T12 became too expensive, and so was never put on the production line. The M32 was also planned to have mine-exploding equipment, such as the T1E1 Earthworm and the T2E1 Mine <b>Exploder.</b> However, only the T1E1 had any service with the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|After Christie's {{return from}} his second combat patrol, Admiral Chester Nimitz {{recommended}} he and Lockwood meet in Brisbane and discuss joint submarine operations. During the visit, Lockwood and Christie discussed technical issues, {{as well as}} the establishment of advanced bases in Mios Woendi and Saipan. However, the meeting also resulted in some kind of personal rift between the two men. They had already clashed over the Mark 6 <b>exploder</b> and the Mark 14 torpedo, and some of Lockwood's staff believed Christie's ride in Harder was a risky and unnecessary stunt. After meeting with Lockwood, Christie met with MacArthur and related the events of Dealey's fifth war patrol to the general. MacArthur then decided to award Dealey a Distinguished Service Cross, and Christie the Silver Star. Additionally at this meeting, Christie found out his earlier recommendation for an army decoration to Griffith had apparently been blocked by Kinkaid. Despite Kinkaid's order regarding army decorations, MacArthur insisted on granting medals to the two men. Although Christie did not request the decorations, he was put on the spot and felt compelled to report the entire affair to Kinkaid. In the end, the general awarded the medals, displeasing Kinkaid.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{as soon as}} the war began, {{submarine}} captains indicated {{there were}} problems with the Mark 14 torpedo and the influence feature of the Mark 6 <b>exploder.</b> Torpedoes would fail to explode, or explode prematurely. Despite these reports, Christie was not fully aware {{of the impact of the}} situation, because his S-boats used the older Mark 10 torpedo, with a contact-only pistol. Christie acknowledged Mark 14s were running deeper than set, but attributed the failures to poor maintenance and errors on the part of the captain and crew. He was convinced the Mark 6 was satisfactory, and ordered all fleet boats to continue to use it. In November 1942, Christie was ordered to return to Newport as Inspector of Ordnance at the Torpedo Station. Newport had become a bottleneck for torpedo manufacture, and the Bureau of Ordnance wanted to advance development of the Mark 18 electric torpedo. Christie resisted leaving his command at Brisbane, but was considered of more use to resolve the torpedo issue. He was replaced by Captain James Fife. For his service at Brisbane, Christie was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E
5000|$|The alarm {{inside the}} Imperial base then sounds off, saying: [...] "This base will <b>explod</b> in 60 seconds." [...] Ladd manages {{to escape the}} base when he realizes that Super Joe is still inside, and he runs back in to rescue him. The Federation's {{commander}} then orders the full evacuation of the base, but then, as the base explodes, a chopper appears with Ladd holding on to Super Joe while hooked on the chopper with his bionic arm. Ladd then informs the commander that he has Joe {{and that they are}} returning to the Federation base. The game's ending then shows Federation troops around Ladd and Super Joe as they celebrate their victory. Super Joe then says how the Federation has a new hero in Ladd Spencer while saying how different he feels from the praise given by his comrades. Then, after showing the ending credits, the game forwards to August 2, 2010, which an old Super Joe recalls the entire story and hope that it will live on.|$|R
500|$|Reviews {{interpreted}} these visions as Ben's {{challenge to}} find and defeat Brother Justin; Ben has to ultimately stop {{the creation of the}} atomic bomb as [...] "the world's march towards doomsday." [...] The Season 1 prologue already suggested this interpretation, mentioning [...] "a false sun <b>explod</b> over Trinity," [...] at which point [...] "man forever traded away wonder for reason." [...] The Trinity test near Alamogordo, New Mexico was humankind's first test of a nuclear weapon in 1945, and Daniel Knauf would have finished Carnivàles six-year run with the explosion of an atomic bomb as the beginning of the [...] "Age of Reason". Still, Knauf's story is [...] "not about the deployment of the bomb, it's more about the invention of the bomb," [...] with the focus [...] "around Alamogordo and the Trinity test site rather than Hiroshima and Nagasaki." [...] Much research was put into the visual effects of the explosion. Stock footage of the first beats of nuclear explosions and a self-created explosion of 300gallons of gasoline were used for reference. The ground effects and blowing dust were created with combinations of volumetric computer graphics smoke, and the fireball of the nuclear explosion was built from Hubble images of the Sun. Knauf left the interpretation of the kiss vision open to both the characters and the audience.|$|R
25|$|The Mark 6 <b>exploder</b> was a United States Navy torpedo <b>exploder</b> {{developed}} in the 1920s. It was the standard <b>exploder</b> of the Navy's Mark 14 torpedo.|$|E
25|$|Just before World War I, the Bureau of Ordnance (commonly called BuOrd) started {{developing}} an inertial <b>exploder.</b> The {{result was the}} Mark 3 <b>exploder.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Mark 6's contact <b>exploder</b> {{mechanism}} {{descended from}} the Mark 3 contact <b>exploder.</b> Both exploders had the unusual feature that the firing pin's travel was perpendicular to the torpedo's travel, so the firing pin {{would be subject to}} side loading when the torpedo struck its target. The Mark 3 <b>exploder</b> was designed when torpedo speeds were much slower (the Mark 10 torpedo's speed was 30 knots), but even then the Mark 3 prototypes had problems with the firing pin binding during the high deceleration when the torpedo collided with the target. The solution was to use a stronger firing spring to overcome the binding. The Mark 14 torpedo had a much higher speed (46 knots), so it would see significantly higher deceleration, but BuOrd apparently just assumed the contact <b>exploder</b> would work at the higher speed. There were no live-fire tests of the Mark 14 torpedo, so there were no-live fire tests of its contact <b>exploder.</b> If BuOrd had tried some live-fire tests of the contact <b>exploder</b> during peacetime, it probably would have experienced some duds and rediscovered the binding problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} <b>exploder</b> often caused premature firing.|$|E
25|$|The contact <b>exploder</b> often {{failed to}} fire the warhead.|$|E
25|$|The skippers, however, {{continued}} to report {{problems with the}} Mark 14. Suspicion about the magnetic influence <b>exploder</b> grew.|$|E
25|$|Both {{premature}} explosion types could {{result from the}} magnetic influence <b>exploder.</b> If a torpedo was still turning to get on course or had not stabilized its depth when the warhead armed, the <b>exploder</b> could see a magnetic field change and detonate. As the warhead approached the target, it could sense a change due to the ship's effect on the earth's magnetic field. That's a desired effect if the torpedo is set to run under the ship, but not a desirable effect when the torpedo is set to hit {{the side of the}} ship.|$|E
25|$|Responsibility {{lies with}} the BuOrd, which {{specified}} an unrealistically rigid magnetic <b>exploder</b> sensitivity setting and oversaw the feeble testing program. Its pitiful budget did not permit live fire tests against real targets; instead, any torpedo that ran under the target was presumed to be a hit due to the magnetic influence <b>exploder,</b> which was never actually tested. Therefore, additional responsibility must also be assigned to the United States Congress, which cut critical funding to the Navy during the interwar years, and to NTS, which inadequately performed the very few tests made. BuOrd failed to assign a second naval facility for testing, and failed to give Newport adequate direction.|$|E
25|$|The Mark 14 {{was central}} to the torpedo scandal of the U.S. Pacific Fleet Submarine Force during World War II. Inadequate {{production}} planning led to severe shortages of the weapon. The frugal, Depression-era, peacetime testing of both the torpedo and its <b>exploder</b> was woefully inadequate and had not uncovered many serious design problems. Torpedoes were so expensive that the Navy was unwilling to perform tests that would destroy a torpedo. Furthermore, the design defects tended to mask each other. Much of the blame commonly attached to the Mark14 correctly belongs to the Mark6 <b>exploder.</b> These defects, {{in the course of}} fully twenty months of war, were exposed, as torpedo after torpedo either missed by running directly under the target, prematurely exploded, or struck targets with textbook right angle hits (sometimes with an audible clang) and failed to explode.|$|E
25|$|Against orders, some submariners {{disabled}} {{the magnetic}} influence {{feature of the}} Mark6 <b>exploder,</b> suspecting it was faulty. An increase in hits was reported. Shortly after replacing Wilkes in Fremantle, Rear Admiral Charles Lockwood ordered a historic net test at Frenchman Bay on 20June 1942. Eight hundred Mark 14s had already been fired in combat.|$|E
25|$|At Pearl Harbor, despite {{nearly all}} his skippers' suspicions about the torpedoes, Rear Admiral Thomas Withers, Jr. refused to {{deactivate}} the torpedo's Mark6 <b>exploder,</b> arguing torpedo shortages stemming from inadequate production at NTS made it impossible. As a result, his men {{did it on}} their own, doctoring their patrol reports and overstating the size of ships to justify using more torpedoes.|$|E
25|$|The {{bomb was}} {{fitted with a}} single {{transverse}} fuze pocket. The bomb was usually filled {{with a mixture of}} 40% amatol and 60% TNT, but when used as an anti-shipping bomb it was filled with Trialen 105, a mixture of 15% RDX, 70% TNT and 15% aluminium powder. A central <b>exploder</b> tube of high grade TNT was put down the centre of the explosive to ensure high order detonation.|$|E
25|$|Early torpedoes used contact exploders. A typical <b>exploder</b> had {{a firing}} pin that stuck {{out from the}} warhead and was {{restrained}} by a transverse shear pin. The torpedo would hit the target with enough energy to break the shear pin and allow the firing pin to strike a percussion cap that ultimately detonated the warhead. An arming impeller was an additional safety device: the firing pin could not move until the torpedo had travelled a preset distance.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of {{that fact}} came in 1939, when Newport {{reported}} to the Bureau that the <b>exploder</b> was giving unexplained prematures. Admiral Furlong arranged for a physicist to visit the station and investigate the failures. For approximately a week, the scientist and his assistants worked with the device. Four sources of prematures were uncovered. Even more significant, the investigator reported to the Bureau that the responsible engineers at Newport were not employing proper tests on the Mark 6. Corrective steps were ordered by the Chief, but subsequent events proved that the remedial action, like the original tests, was inadequate.|$|E
25|$|Early {{reports of}} torpedo action {{included}} some dud hits, heard as a dull clang. In a few instances, Mark14s would strike a Japanese ship and lodge in its hull without exploding. The contact pistol {{appeared to be}} malfunctioning, though the conclusion was anything but clear until running depth and magnetic <b>exploder</b> problems were solved. The experience of Dan Daspit (in Tinosa) was {{exactly the sort of}} live-fire trial BuOrd had been prevented from doing in peacetime. It was now clear to all at Pearl Harbor the contact pistol was also defective. Ironically, a direct hit on the target at a 90 degree angle, as recommended in training, would usually fail to detonate; the contact pistol functioned reliably only when the torpedo impacted the target at an oblique angle.|$|E
500|$|T1E1 Mine <b>Exploder</b> [...] "Earthworm" [...] – This mine {{exploding}} equipment, {{which was}} meant to be used with the boom on the M32, was essentially the T1 mine <b>exploder</b> with slightly different trailing discs. Developed and produced in 1943. It saw limited use in the war.|$|E
500|$|In 1922, as Christie was {{completing}} his graduate studies, the Bureau of Ordnance initiated project G-53, a highly secret program {{to develop a}} magnetic influence <b>exploder</b> for torpedoes. In the summer of 1926, Christie became intimately involved in the project, and was substantially involved in the technical development of the weapon system. By 1926, the <b>exploder</b> was far enough advanced to permit its first test. On 8 May, the obsolete submarine [...] {{was used as a}} target, and destroyed with an influence torpedo. Despite this early success, the influence <b>exploder,</b> which would become the Mark 6, needed significant refinement.|$|E

500|$|A 1915 {{graduate}} of the United States Naval Academy, Christie served {{on a variety of}} warships beginning with the battleship [...] in 1915. He was trained in torpedo design and implementation and {{became one of the first}} members of the Submarine School at New London. In 1923 Christie graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in torpedoes. During the 1920s, he was involved with [...] project G-53, a highly secret program to develop a magnetic influence <b>exploder</b> for torpedoes. The result of this was the development of the Mark 6 <b>exploder</b> and the Mark 14 torpedo. Christie also developed a design for an oxygen torpedo, designated project G-49 or [...] "Navol".|$|E
500|$|After the United States entered World War II, Christie {{was posted}} to Brisbane and {{commanded}} submarine operations during the Solomon Islands campaign. He {{then returned to}} the U.S. as Inspector of Ordnance at the Newport Torpedo Station. In January 1943, Christie returned to Australia as commander of submarine operations in Fremantle. Despite growing evidence of problems with the Mark 6 <b>exploder</b> and the Mark 14 torpedo, he remained convinced of their effectiveness. During 1944, he accompanied war patrols on the submarines [...] and [...] In November 1944, Christie was relieved of command of submarine operations at Fremantle by Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid and returned to the United States, where he commanded the Puget Sound Navy Yard. He retired from the Navy in August 1949 with the rank of vice admiral.|$|E
500|$|On 31 March 1942, de la Ferté {{advised the}} Anti-submarine Committee using both [...] and [...] DCs was not satisfactory. It was more {{efficient}} {{to release a}} large stick of [...] DCs as the required lethal stick was four times the bombing error in range. The [...] Mark VIII was not cleared for heights above [...] or speeds of , and de la Ferté hoped for a DC filled with Torpex that could be dropped at [...] from [...] The Director of Operational Research Office {{came up with a}} [...] DC that could be dropped from , but the Army and Navy received priority. By 5 June 1943, the new type was in service, and developments continued in <b>exploder</b> technology from August 1943 to December 1944. It was found it could be released at any height between , at any speed, with spacings greater than [...] However, it came too late to effect A/S operations, and the [...] DC remained the standard type. The [...] Mark IX DC with Torpex filling dropped in sticks of four to eight, anywhere from [...] "point-blank altitude" [...] and within [...] of the target, proved decisive. Despite the [...] solid-head rockets, the [...] ASB, and the 40mm cannon, none, in the opinion of Slessor, compared with the Mark XI depth charge.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{of these}} flaws had the unfortunate {{property}} of masking or explaining other flaws. [...] Skippers would fire torpedoes and expect the magnetic influence <b>exploder</b> to sink the target ship. When the torpedoes did not explode, {{they started to}} believe the magnetic influence <b>exploder</b> did not work. [...] Against orders, some submariners disabled the magnetic influence feature of the Mark6 <b>exploder,</b> suspecting it was faulty, and went for contact <b>exploder</b> hits; such efforts would confuse the issues. Looking back in 1953, the BuOrd speculated, [...] "Many shots planned for impact {{against the side of}} a ship missed because of deep running, yet damaged the enemy due to the magnetic influence feature of the Mark 6." [...] When later tests discovered the torpedoes ran deeper than set, the submarine command then believed that the torpedoes ran so deeply that the magnetic influence <b>exploder</b> could not sense the target ship; the failure to explode had been due entirely to the depth setting and that nothing was wrong with the magnetic influence <b>exploder.</b> [...] When the depth issue was fixed, the magnetic influence exploder's premature detonation made it seem like the <b>exploder</b> was working but little damage would be done to the target ship. It was only after the magnetic influence feature was deactivated that problems with the contact <b>exploder</b> would be discernable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second type}} of {{premature}} explosion masked contact <b>exploder</b> failures. [...] Skippers firing the torpedo for a contact <b>exploder</b> hit {{on the side of}} the target would see an explosion and believe the contact <b>exploder</b> worked, but the explosions were triggered not by the contact feature, but rather by the magnetic influence feature at a distance far enough from the hull to cause little or no damage.|$|E
2500|$|Rear Admiral Christie, who {{had been}} {{involved}} {{in the development of the}} magnetic influence <b>exploder,</b> was now commander of the Australian-based submarines in the South West Pacific Area and not in Nimitz' chain of command. [...] Christie insisted his area's submarines continue to use the magnetic <b>exploder.</b> At the end of 1943, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid replaced Admiral Arthur S. Carpender as Commander Allied Naval Forces South West Pacific Area (Christie's boss) and ordered Christie to deactivate the magnetic influence <b>exploder.</b>|$|E
