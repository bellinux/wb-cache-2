5|$|In 1986, {{a larger}} 100cc HA05E engine model was {{introduced}} especially for Asian markets. The newer 100cc model was developed exclusively for Southeast Asian market, especially in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, where underbones were very popular, with new {{features such as}} a telescopic front suspension to replace the older leading link suspension, and a four-speed transmission to replace the older three-speed transmission used in older Cub variants. The 100cc model was initially known as the Honda <b>Dream</b> in Thailand and Honda EX5 in Malaysia, before being standardised as the Honda EX5 <b>Dream</b> in 2003. In addition, Honda Japan began importing the made-in-Thailand <b>Dream</b> as the Super Cub C100EX in 1988. The Japanese C100EX was later being facelifted in 1993, while the Southeast Asian EX5 <b>Dream</b> retains the 1986 design until the present day, with only minor cosmetic changes. In 2011, the carbureted EX5 <b>Dream</b> was phased out in Thailand and being replaced with the fuel-injected Honda <b>Dream</b> 110i, with the powertrain being derived from the fuel-injected Honda Wave 110i.|$|E
5|$|Kirby's <b>Dream</b> Land {{has since}} spawned dozens of sequels across {{more than a}} half-dozen video game consoles. The first direct sequel Kirby's Adventure, {{released}} on the Nintendo Entertainment System, introduced the ability to steal powers from enemies, an ability which would become {{a staple of the}} series following it. The series has featured several spin-offs, in differing genres including a racing game Kirby Air Ride, pinball game Kirby's Pinball Land, and even an Action-Golf hybrid game Kirby's <b>Dream</b> Course. Kirby's <b>Dream</b> Land would receive a Game Boy sequel in 1995 Kirby's <b>Dream</b> Land 2, which incorporated the copy mechanic from Kirby's Adventure.|$|E

For example, the knowledge gained in this area could have implications in the treatment of certain types of mental illnesses.It can help people learn about the meaning of your <b>dreams</b> and explain as to why we have nightmares.|$|R

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of <b>Dream</b> Drop Distance is {{the inclusion of the}} <b>Dream</b> Eaters. Whilst they generally serve as the main enemies of the game, up to three good <b>Dream</b> Eaters, known as Spirits, can be recruited per character to assist them in battle. Spirits can be created by combining <b>Dream</b> Fragments together with an item or spell, either via experimenting with combinations or using recipes found throughout the game. Characters can also link with Spirits to perform unique attacks. Along the way, the player can care for these Spirits by petting them, feeding them items, or playing mini-games with them, which can unlock new abilities for the Spirits.|$|E

[...] During the summer 2010 publicity about the dream-themed film Inception, Barrett was interviewed by media including ABC, NBC Today, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and USA Today, pointing out that {{some aspects of the}} film, like lucid <b>dreaming,</b> control of one’s own <b>dreams,</b> and dreams-within-dreams were highly realistic while the control of others’ <b>dreams,</b> time slowing in <b>dreams,</b> and absolute impossibility of <b>dreaming</b> that you die were all fictional premises {{in the service of the}} thriller plot.|$|R
50|$|Some {{psychologists have}} {{explained}} the apparent prevalence of precognitive <b>dreams</b> {{in terms of}} memory biases, namely a selective memory for accurate predictions and distorted memory so that <b>dreams</b> are retrospectively fitted onto subsequent events. In one experiment, {{subjects were asked to}} write down their <b>dreams</b> in a diary. This prevented the selective memory effect, and the <b>dreams</b> no longer seemed accurate about the future. Another experiment gave subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive <b>dreams.</b> This diary described events from the person's life, as well as some predictive <b>dreams</b> and some non-predictive <b>dreams.</b> When subjects were asked to recall the <b>dreams</b> they had read, they remembered more of the successful predictions than unsuccessful ones.|$|R

50|$|Hobson {{asserts that}} the {{existence}} of lucid <b>dreaming</b> means that the human brain can simultaneously occupy two states: waking and <b>dreaming.</b> The <b>dreaming</b> portion has experiences and therefore has primary consciousness, while the waking self recognizes the <b>dreaming</b> and can be seen as having a sort of secondary consciousness in the sense that there is an awareness of mental state. Studies have been able to show that lucid <b>dreaming</b> is associated with EEG power and coherence profiles that are significantly different from both non-lucid <b>dreaming</b> and waking. Lucid <b>dreaming</b> situates itself between those two states. Lucid <b>dreaming</b> is characterized by more 40 Hz power than non-lucid <b>dreaming,</b> especially in frontal regions. Since it is 40 Hz power that has been correlated with waking consciousness in previous studies, it can be suggested that enough 40 Hz power has been added to the non-lucid <b>dreaming</b> brain to support the increase in subjective awareness that permits lucidity but not enough to cause full awakening.|$|R
