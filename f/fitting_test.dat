40|$|Correct {{identification}} and tracking of stable raypaths {{are critical for}} shallow-water acoustic tomog-raphy. According, separating raypaths using high resolution methods is presented to improve resolution ability based on the prior knowledge {{of the number of}} raypaths. It is clear that the precise knowledge of the number of raypaths largely determines the separation performance. Therefore, a noise-whitening exponential <b>fitting</b> <b>test</b> (NWEFT) using short-length samples is proposed in this paper to automatically detect the number of raypaths in a shallow-water waveguide. Two information theoretic criteria are introduced as comparative methods. Their performances are tested with simulation data and real data obtained at small scale. The experimental results show that the noise-whitening exponential <b>fitting</b> <b>test</b> can provide satisfactory detection compared to the two classic information theoretic criteria — the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the minimum description length (MDL). Referring to the performance of AIC and MDL, MDL is asymptotically consistent while AIC overestimates even if analyzed asymptotically...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the modified exponential <b>fitting</b> <b>test</b> for automatically identifying malicious activities in honeypot data based on {{state of the}} art model order selection schemes. Model order selection (MOS) schemes are frequently applied in several signal processing applications, such as RADAR, SONAR, communications, channel modeling, medical imaging, and parameters estimation of dominant multipath components from MIMO channel measurements. "In this paper, we apply MOS schemes for the identification of malicious activity in honeypots. " The proposed blind automatic techniques are efficient and need neither previous training nor knowledge of attack signatures for detecting malicious activities. In order to achieve such results an innovative approach is considered which models network traffic data as signals and noise allowing the application of signal processing methods. The model order selection schemes are adapted to process network data, showing that the Modified Exponential <b>Fitting</b> <b>Test</b> achieves the best performance and reliability in detecting attacks. The efficiency and accuracy of the theoretical results are tested on real data collected at a honeypot system located at the network border of a large banking institution in Latin America. I...|$|E

40|$|Rolling bearing is an {{important}} part in mechanical system and faults occur frequently with vibration noise. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a tool for nonlinear and non-stationary signals analysis. However, the major drawbacks of EMD is mode mixing problem, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) provides a new tool for signal analysis, and it is an improved technique of EMD. In order to alleviate the mode mixing problem and choose useful IMFs, a method called EEMD and distributing <b>fitting</b> <b>testing</b> is proposed in this paper, and it is used in rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Firstly, using it for rolling bearing fault diagnosis, the fault signal is decomposed by EEMD. Then applying distributing <b>fitting</b> <b>testing</b> to choose components with truly physical meaning and the de-noised signal can be obtained. Finally, utilizing envelope spectrum to distinguish different faults. The results demonstrate the proposed method can sift useful IMFs and diagnose faults effectively, such as inner race fault, outer race fault.

40|$|Abstract The {{correlation}} coefficient {{is commonly used}} to evaluate the de-gree of linear association between two variables. However, it can be shown that a {{correlation coefficient}} very close to one might also be ob-tained for a clear curved relation-ship. Other statistical tests, like the Lack-of-fit and Mandel’s <b>fitting</b> <b>test</b> thus appear more suitable for the validation of the linear calibration model. A number of cadmium cali-bration curves from atomic absorp-tion spectroscopy were assessed for their linearity. All the investigated calibration curves were characterized by a high correlation coefficient (r> 0. 997) and low quality coeffi-cient (QC < 5 %), but the straight-line model was systematically rejected at the 95 % confidence level on the ba-sis of the Lack-of-fit and Mandel’s <b>fitting</b> <b>test.</b> Furthermore, significant-ly different results were achieved be-tween a linear regression model (LRM) and a quadratic regression (QRM) model in forecasting values for mid-scale calibration standards. The results obtained with the QRM did not differ significantly from the theoretically expected value, while those obtained with the LRM were systematically biased. It was con-cluded that a straight-line model with a high correlation coefficient, but with a lack-of-fit, yields signifi-cantly less accurate results than its curvilinear alternative...|$|E
