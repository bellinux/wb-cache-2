25|$|At 11:30 pm on {{the night}} of 27–28 January 1919, guards awoke Nicholas Mikhailovich, his brother George and his cousin Dimitri in their cells at Shpalernaya prison, telling them they were to be moved and had to pack their belongings. They {{initially}} assumed {{that they were going to}} be transported to Moscow. Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich even thought that they might be set free, but his brother assumed that they were heading to another place to be shot. They had an ominous hint of what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them when at the time of departure they were told to leave their luggage.|$|E

500|$|Originally to {{be called}} The Ends of the Earth, each episode would have ended with the planet Earth meeting its demise in a {{different}} way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed a character who knew what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> Earth before the other characters. He made this character an alien and, remembering an idea he supposedly had had while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria in 1971, decided that this character would be a [...] "roving reporter" [...] for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a pan-galactic encyclopedia and travel guide. Recollections by his friends at the time indicate that Adams first spoke {{of the idea of}} [...] "hitchhiking around the galaxy" [...] while on holiday in Greece in 1973.|$|E

500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} how {{behind the times}} Pawnee is, Tom said residents are now only starting to become interested in the rock band Nirvana. Tom said, [...] "I don't {{have the heart to}} tell them what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> Kurt Cobain in 1994", a reference to the suicide of the band's lead singer. Before Tom eats a hot pepper at the dinner party, he sings, [...] "This is how you eat it" [...] to the tune of the 1995 Montell Jordan song [...] "This Is How We Do It". Leslie said she was saving an old newspaper because it had the [...] "first rumblings of Iran-Contra", a reference to the scandal in which U.S. figures facilitated the sale of arms to Iran. Tom visits Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, to learn more about India when quizzed by Justin.|$|E
500|$|In The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway {{contrasts}} Paris with Pamplona, and {{the frenzy}} of the fiesta with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside. [...] Spain was Hemingway's favorite European country; he considered it a healthy place, and the only country [...] "that hasn't been shot to pieces." [...] He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing, It isn't just brutal like they always told us. It's a great tragedy—and {{the most beautiful thing}} I've ever seen and takes more guts and skill and guts again than anything possibly could. It's just like having a ringside seat at the war with nothing <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> you. He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—called afición—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisian bohemians. To be accepted as an [...] aficionado was rare for a non-Spaniard; Jake goes through a difficult process to gain acceptance by the [...] "fellowship of afición." ...|$|E

500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> me. I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E
500|$|SS-Obersturmführer Irmfried Eberl was {{appointed}} the camp's first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was a psychiatrist from Bernburg Euthanasia Centre {{and the only}} physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II. According to some, his poor organisational skills caused the operation of Treblinka to turn disastrous; others {{point out that the}} number of transports that were coming in reflected the Nazi high command's wildly unrealistic expectations of Treblinka's ability to [...] "process" [...] these prisoners. The early gassing machinery frequently broke down due to overuse, forcing the SS to shoot Jews assembled for suffocation. The workers did not have enough time to bury them, and the mass graves were overflowing. According to the testimony of his colleague Unterscharführer Hans Hingst, Eberl's ego and thirst for power exceeded his ability: [...] "So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people could no longer be handled." [...] On incoming Holocaust trains to Treblinka, many of the Jews locked inside correctly guessed what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them. The odour of decaying corpses could be smelled up to [...] away.|$|E
500|$|The 1957 Ingmar Bergman film Seventh Seal {{portrays the}} journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) {{returning}} disillusioned from the crusades ("what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> {{those of us who}} want to believe, but aren't able to?") across a plague-ridden landscape, undertaking a game of chess with the personification of Death until he can perform one meaningful altruistic act of conscience (overturning the chess board to distract Death long enough for a family of jugglers to escape in their wagon). The 1942 Casablanca centers on the development of conscience in the cynical American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) in the face of oppression by the Nazis and the example of the resistance leader Victor Laszlo.The David Lean and Robert Bolt screenplay for Doctor Zhivago (an adaptation of Boris Pasternak's novel) focuses strongly on the conscience of a doctor-poet {{in the midst of the}} Russian Revolution (in the end [...] "the walls of his heart were like paper").The 1982 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner focuses on the struggles of conscience between and within a bounty hunter (Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford)) and a renegade replicant android (Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)) in a future society which refuses to accept that forms of artificial intelligence can have aspects of being such as conscience.|$|E

50|$|While adults {{might find}} such stories tedious (we can easily put {{together}} what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen),</b> children tend <b>to</b> adore repetitious stories, since they {{can more easily}} remember and repeat the lines. This allows interaction and builds a strong framework for the plot progression.|$|R

500|$|Visual {{effects were}} done by Rocket Science VFX and Mr. X Inc. Paul Jones {{served as the}} special effects creator, who {{previously}} designed the Nemesis character in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The production team planned to use extras to portray 300 zombies at once, but time restraints prevented that. Around 150 zombies were eventually used and Mr. X Inc's visual effects supervisor, Dennis Berardi, added more in post-production. For Alice's clones they shot motion control photography for multiple passes of Jovovich. For the wide shots they took digital photo doubles. Visual effects production manager Eric Robertson described {{the look of the}} film, [...] "interesting contrasts, pure whites, which is a staggering look. It's so clean and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of Silent Hill. So we've got the extremes, but it's definitely a unique look for this incarnation and it's been fun to see those looks." [...] A burned cityscape with ash and smoke in the sky was created to depict a postapocalyptic Los Angeles, in which most of the film is set. Bolt described this approach as, [...] "In a world that has gone to hell in a handbasket, there's no control and no fire service, so clearly, what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> LA is it's going to get burned." ...|$|E

2500|$|King {{received}} frequent {{death threats}} {{due to his}} prominence in the Civil Rights Movement. He had confronted {{the risk of death}} and made that recognition part of his philosophy.
