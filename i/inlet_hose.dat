50|$|Booster {{pumps are}} usually piston or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, {{single-stage}} booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed {{to withstand the}} operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the <b>inlet</b> <b>hose,</b> through the inlet valve into {{the space between the}} cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalised, taking valve opening pressures into account.|$|E
40|$|NASA’s {{future plans}} for {{long-term}} spaceflight {{will require a}} constant food and water supply. Consequently, a system must be developed to recover water {{in order to make}} long-term spaceflight feasible. Prior to collection, urine is pretreated in order to prevent clogging of the small diameter collection tubes by biofilm formation and solids precipitation. The current method of pretreatment is a string of tablets placed in the <b>inlet</b> <b>hose</b> of the collection system. The urine dissolves the chemical tablets comprised of sulfuric acid and oxone before being transported to the wastewater collection area through small diameter tubes. These tubes can easily become clogged if the urine begins to precipitate or biofilms form. The current pretreatment chemicals, Sulfuric Acid and Oxone, are toxic and would prevent the recovery of water from urine for reuse aboard the spacecraft. As par to of the Space Engineering Institute (SEI), the Urine pretreatment team’s objective is to address the urine pretreatment toxicity issue. SEI supports interdisciplinary multi-level applied research projects for undergraduate engineering students to promote retention and better prepare students for their engineering careers. The objective of this research is to identify a nontoxic urine pretreatment agent that prevents solids precipitation and bacterial growth. T...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is being}} developed for sampling water for signs of microbial life in an ocean hydrothermal vent {{at a depth of}} as much as 6. 5 km. Heretofore, evidence of microbial life in deep-sea hydrothermal vents has been elusive and difficult to validate. Because of the extreme conditions in these environments (high pressures and temperatures often in excess of 300 C), deep-sea hydrothermal- vent samplers must be robust. Because of the presumed low density of biomass of these environments, samplers must be capable of collecting water samples of significant volume. It is also essential to prevent contamination of samples by microbes entrained from surrounding waters. Prior {{to the development of the}} present apparatus, no sampling device was capable of satisfying these requirements. The apparatus (see figure) includes an intake equipped with a temperature probe, plus several other temperature probes located away from the intake. The readings from the temperature probes are utilized in conjunction with readings from flowmeters to determine the position of the intake relative to the hydrothermal plume and, thereby, to position the intake to sample directly from the plume. Because it is necessary to collect large samples of water in order to obtain sufficient microbial biomass but it is not practical to retain all the water from the samples, four filter arrays are used to concentrate the microbial biomass (which is assumed to consist of particles larger than 0. 2 m) into smaller volumes. The apparatus can collect multiple samples per dive and is designed to process a total volume of 10 L of vent fluid, of which most passes through the filters, leaving a total possibly-microbe-containing sample volume of 200 mL remaining in filters. A rigid titanium nose at the intake is used for cooling the sample water before it enters a flexible <b>inlet</b> <b>hose</b> connected to a pump. As the water passes through the titanium nose, it must be cooled to a temperature that is above a mineral-precipitation temperature of 100 C but below the upper working temperature (230 C) of switching valves and tubes in the apparatus. The sample water then passes into a manifold tube, from whence the switching valves can direct the water through either a bypass tube or any one of the filter arrays, without contamination from a previous sample. Each filter array consists of series of filters having pore sizes decreasing in the direction of flow: 90 -, 60 -, 15 -, and 7 -micron prefilters and a large-surface-area 0. 2 -micron collection filter. All the filter taps are located between the intake and the bypass tube so that each time the bypass tube is used, the entire manifold tube is flushed as well...|$|E

50|$|By 1960, the VKK-3 was {{replaced}} by the vastly different VKK-4. Also used in high performance aircraft such as the Su-9 and MiG-21, it had several distinct differences to its predecessor. The front zipper {{was replaced}} by a zipper on each shoulder for entry of the suit, with more extensive lacing replacing the former suit's front zipper. While still incorporating the VKK-3's 'H' hose setup, the VKK-4 had two <b>hose</b> <b>inlets</b> instead of the single <b>hose</b> <b>inlet.</b>|$|R
50|$|A larger radiator, {{heater core}} <b>inlets</b> and <b>hoses</b> were new, for {{improved}} coolant flow and heater performance. Door lock cylinders and ignition lock switches were also revised for greater theft protection.

50|$|Nozzles are {{attached}} to the pump via flexible hoses, allowing them to be placed into the vehicle's filling <b>inlet.</b> The <b>hoses</b> are robust to survive heavy wear and tear, including exposure to weather and being driven over, and are often attached using heavy spring or coil arrangements to provide additional strength. A breakaway valve is also fitted to the hose to allow the nozzle and hose to break off and fuel flow to be stopped in the case a vehicle drives off with the nozzle still in the filler, although this is largely prevented today by the point-of-sale systems not allowing payment for fuel until the nozzle is returned to its petrol pump holder.|$|R

40|$|This senior project report {{lays out}} the {{production}} of drip hydraulics software composed in Microsoft Excel and backed by coding in Visual Basic for Applications. The program performs 2 main functions useful {{in the design of}} irrigation systems. The first is based on performing single hose computations under three different circumstances. It can solve for the average emitter flow rate given the <b>hose</b> <b>inlet</b> pressure, the inlet pressure given the average emitter flow rate, and can model hose pressures and flow rates while flushing. The second function is to place a manifold in the hydraulically optimum location on a slope. One advantage of this software over its former DOS version is the designer has access to all of the data used in the calculations including the entire Bernoulli tables that model flows and pressures at every emitter in the field. As this could also be a point of weakness, great effort was put into making the software simple to follow and displaying pertinent information in intuitive locations...|$|R
5000|$|The main use of {{the unit}} is to flatten out {{deformed}} press belts whilst simultaneously stress-relieving the belt material. The small size and low weight makes the unit flexible to use and easy to bring into and operate in field situations. All of the equipment needed (excluding the carriage frame and the air compressor) can be packed into a box with dimensions of about: 350mm L * 350mm W * 320mm. Total weight including blaster, valve, air hose and miscellaneous components is around 25kg and the blasting machine itself weights only 9kg. One pair of universal channel (38mm * 76mm [...] ) must be provided on site - the length usually being 500mm longer than the belt width. The channels are welded together so that the blaster can easily run through the frame {{across the face of}} the belt. The total installation time, including the manufacture of the carriage frame, is limited to just a few hours after which the peening process can begin. On the <b>inlet</b> air <b>hose</b> an electric shut-off valve is mounted to protect the belt from over-blasting should the belt suddenly stop during the blasting operation. To be effective the valve solenoid must be connected / interlocked to the press machine's power supply (240 V). For best blasting results an air supply of 4200 litre per min is required at a pressure of 6 bar. A flexible air hose is supplied with the unit which is to be connected between the blasting unit and the local air supply. All local supply pipes should have a minimum bore diameter of 1". The recommended shot blasting medium is tungsten shot (beads) with diameter ranging from 0.2-0.4 mm having a hardness exceeding 40 HRC. The machine operates by drawing a quantity of tungsten shot {{from the bottom of the}} scroll case into the high velocity nozzles. The shot is blasted onto the surface of the belt and most of the shot bounces back into the scroll case. The air is vented through the filter socks and any shot carried with the air is filtered out and drops back into the scroll case.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the relationship between mitochondrial transport and neuronal function, it is critical to observe mitochondrial behavior in live cultured neurons for extended durations 1 - 3. This is now possible through the use of vital dyes and fluorescent proteins with which cytoskeletal components, organelles, and other structures in living cells can be labeled and then visualized via dynamic fluorescence microscopy. For example, in embryonic chicken sympathetic neurons, mitochondrial movement was characterized using the vital dye rhodamine 123 4. In another study, mitochondria were visualized in rat forebrain neurons by transfection of mitochondrially targeted eYFP 5. However, imaging of primary neurons over minutes, hours, or even days presents a number of issues. Foremost among these are: 1) maintenance of culture conditions such as temperature, humidity, and pH during long imaging sessions; 2) a strong, stable fluorescent signal to assure both the quality of acquired images and accurate measurement of signal intensity during image analysis; and 3) limiting exposure times during image acquisition to minimize photobleaching and avoid phototoxicity. Here, we describe a protocol that permits the observation, visualization, and analysis of mitochondrial movement in cultured hippocampal neurons with high temporal resolution and under optimal life support conditions. We have constructed an affordable stage-top incubator that provides good temperature regulation and atmospheric gas flow, and also limits the degree of media evaporation, assuring stable pH and osmolarity. This incubator is connected, via <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>hoses,</b> to a standard tissue culture incubator, which provides constant humidity level...|$|R
40|$|The second {{generation}} long-reach manipulator - the dual-gripper Phase 3 Remote Tool Delivery (RTD) {{system has been}} developed to retrieve radioactive waste from underground storage tanks with internal structural members. The RTD is equipped with two grippers, one {{at each end of}} the system, to grasp the structural member. A vertical translation mechanism is also added to the system that enables the vertical motion inside the tank. This special feature provides greater dexterity and flexibility. Two operating open-chain configurations are considered and modeled. The first configuration is that gripper 1 grasps the structural member and gripper 2 is free to perform a designated task. The other configuration is that gripper 2 grasps the structural member and gripper 1 is free to move. The kinematics, dynamics and simulation of the system are emphasized. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the flexible laminated hose used to convey radioactive waste materials was investigated to learn about its structural behavior. The hose is considered relatively fixed at one end (the outlet) and subjected to different loading conditions at the inlet. Liquid (mixture of water and sludge) with high viscosity is sucked through the hose using a vacuum pressure. The software package employed for FEA is ANSYS 5. 2. A total of 200 cases, with different X, Y and Z loading conditions at the <b>inlet,</b> for the <b>hose</b> under the consideration with or without vacuum pressure have been analyzed. Numerical results and the ANSYS graphic outputs provided for each case include the deformation, stress distribution and strain distribution throughout the hose...|$|R
