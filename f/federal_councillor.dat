5|$|As an Alderman, Morton {{joined the}} new Liberal Party of Australia, {{becoming}} {{a member of}} the Balmoral local branch and a <b>federal</b> <b>councillor.</b> Morton soon joined the NSW Branch under party Leader Vernon Treatt and stood for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Mosman at the state election on 3 May 1947. At the election he succeeded in defeating the conservative Independent member, The Reverend Donald Macdonald, with 55.56% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April 1969, the Working Committee for Nuclear Issues (AAA) was created. It met 27 {{times between}} 26 September 1969 and 25 October 1988. However, the {{committee}} {{had only a}} preparatory role. As the Cold War started coming to an end, the AAA became less relevant. On 1 November 1988, <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillor</b> Arnold Koller signed the dissolution order, and the AAA ceased to exist on 31 December of that year, thus ending the 43-year Swiss nuclear weapons program.|$|E

5|$|Both {{models were}} plagued from the onset by inefficient engines, but {{were capable of}} the short-distance {{takeoffs}} required by the Swiss (330meters for the P–16, 232meters for the N-20). After wind tunnel and engine tests, but before the N–20 could make its maiden flight, <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillor</b> Karl Kobelt cancelled the N-20project in 1953, leading to much resentment of the government by Emmen engineers when the FFA project was continued. Eventually, neither of the aircraft came into production, although {{the wings of the}} P-16 were later used {{in the development of the}} successful Learjet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, a group working within the Military Department, which {{approved}} of nuclear tests in Switzerland, presented a secret plan for the attainment of nuclear weapons to the Federal Council. In {{the first phase of}} the plan, 50 bombs from 60–100 kt would be procured. In phase two, another 200 bombs would be procured. To clarify definitively whether nuclear tests should be carried out in Switzerland, the military chief of staff Jacob Annasohn requested of <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillor</b> Paul Chaudet, head of the Military Department, to obtain authorization for the total budget of 20 million Swiss francs from the Federal Council.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{financial}} oversight and the apparent {{ease with which}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillor</b> Paul Chaudet and Chief of the General Staff Jakob Annasohn chose the Mirage (at the time, the world's fastest jet fighter) led, {{for the first time}} in Swiss history, to the formation of a parliamentary fact-finding commission. As a result, parliamentary oversight on military procurements was improved and the military was given the organizational and professional structures to avoid such budget overruns. One Air Force officer had to retire, and Annasohn himself retired voluntarily in the end of 1964, followed by Chaudet who stepped down in 1966.|$|E

50|$|In Switzerland, {{the head}} of the state is the Swiss Federal Council (not only its president). For this reason, the seven <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillors</b> (and their spouses) are invited to the state dinners {{organised}} in Bern during state visits.|$|R
50|$|During his tenure, Achille Casanova {{worked with}} 26 {{different}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillors</b> (out of 108 ever {{elected by the}} time of his resignation), participated in over 1180 Federal Council sessions, and officiated under three different Chancellors. While he was a candidate for the office twice himself, the Swiss Federal Assembly elected other candidates every time.|$|R
50|$|The Swiss Federal Council {{is elected}} by the 246 members of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland by secret ballot.Regular {{elections}} take place every four years, in the first session following the Swiss federal elections. Additionally, an election is held to replace <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillors</b> who have announced their retirement or who have died in office.|$|R
25|$|When <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillor</b> Adolf Deucher died in 1912, Calonder {{was one of}} the {{candidates}} for the vacant seat in the Swiss Federal Council. On July 17, 1912, he lost the election to Edmund Schulthess in the first vote, partially due to Schulthess's strong support by Catholic Conservatives, farmers' organizations, and the industrial lobby. Disappointed by the result, Grison politicians and media called for a boycott of the Swiss National Day (August 1) in 1912.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{resignation}} of <b>federal</b> <b>councillor</b> Samuel Schmid on 12 November 2008, Blocher {{decided to run for}} the office again. The People's Party nominated him together with Ueli Maurer. In view of the 2007 election results, Blocher's chances to be re-elected were thought to be very slim. Not surprisingly, he had no chance of being re-elected and had to make room for his party colleague Ueli Maurer, who won the election in the end.|$|E
25|$|In 1917 Switzerland's {{neutrality}} {{came into}} question when the Grimm–Hoffmann Affair erupted. Robert Grimm, a Swiss socialist politician, travelled to Russia as an activist {{to negotiate a}} separate peace between Russia and Germany, in order {{to end the war}} on the Eastern Front in the interests of socialism and pacifism. Misrepresenting himself as a diplomat and an actual representative of the Swiss government, he made progress but had to admit to fraud and return home when the Allies found out about the proposed peace deal. Neutrality was restored by the resignation of Arthur Hoffmann, the Swiss <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillor</b> who had supported Grimm but had not consulted his colleagues on the initiative.|$|E
50|$|During 2004, Blocher's unconventionally unaccommodating stance {{towards his}} fellow <b>federal</b> <b>councillors</b> {{was the cause}} for speculations {{about the future of}} the Swiss {{concordance}} system. He was attacked by his colleague Pascal Couchepin in an interview with the NZZ newspaper in the Sunday edition of 3 October. This was unprecedented in Switzerland; members of the Federal Council traditionally do not publicly criticise each other.|$|R
50|$|Born in Ilanz, Graubünden, Casanova {{worked as}} a lawyer in the {{practice}} of the former President of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, Giusep Nay, as well as a Red Cross delegate in South Africa, Angola, Nicaragua and El Salvador.

5000|$|The {{number of}} {{departments}} and <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillors</b> has been constitutionally fixed at seven since 1848. The {{number of the}} departments' subordinate entities, which are constituted by statute - generally as [...] "federal offices" [...] after the 1910s - has grown substantially {{in step with the}} expanding role of the state in the 20th century, even though some have been merged or abolished.|$|R
25|$|As European tension {{grew in the}} 1930s, the Swiss {{began to}} rethink their {{political}} and military situation. The Social Democratic party abandoned their revolutionary and anti-military stances, and soon the country began to rearm for war. BGB <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillor</b> Rudolf Minger, predicting war would come in 1939, led the rebuilding of the Swiss Army. Starting in 1936, he secured a larger defence budget and started a war bond system. The army was restructured into smaller, better equipped divisions and boot camp for conscripts was extended to 3 months of instruction. In 1937 a war economy cell was established. Households were encouraged to keep a two-month supply of food and basic necessities. In 1938 Foreign Minister Giuseppe Motta withdrew Switzerland from the League of Nations, returning the country to its traditional form of neutrality.|$|E
500|$|On 15 August 1945, Hans Frick, {{a colonel}} in the Swiss military, {{sent a letter to}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillor</b> Karl Kobelt {{requesting}} that Switzerland study the possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons in order to defend Switzerland. The Federal Council authorized the creation of a commission to do such in November 1945. Efforts [...] "were well under way" [...] in 1945.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} the Federal Council are elected for a {{term of four years}} by both {{chambers}} of the federal parliament sitting together as the Federal Assembly. Each Councillor is elected individually by secret ballot by an absolute majority of votes. A person elected to the Council by the Federal Assembly is considered [...] a <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillor</b> even if he or she declines the election. Accordingly, the five persons who did so and never assumed office are listed in a separate table below. For the same reason, the principal table only records the date of election, and not the date on which the Councillors assumed their office.|$|E

50|$|Switzerland is a {{democratic}} federal republic. The federal legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Federal Assembly, the National Council and the Council of States.

50|$|The Swiss Federal Council (Schweizerischer Bundesrat, Conseil fédéral suisse, Consiglio federale svizzero, Cussegl federal svizzer) is the seven-member {{executive}} council which constitutes {{the government as}} well as the head of state of Switzerland. Each of the seven <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillors</b> heads a department of the Swiss federal government. The members of the Federal Council are elected for a term of four years by both chambers of the federal parliament sitting together as the <b>Federal</b> Assembly. Each <b>Councillor</b> is elected individually by secret ballot by an absolute majority of votes. Since 1848, the seven Councillors have never been replaced simultaneously, thus guaranteeing a continuity of the government.|$|R
50|$|The President of the Swiss Confederation {{is elected}} {{every year for}} a one-year term by the Federal Assembly among the seven <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillors</b> who collectively form {{together}} the Head of State. Primus inter pares, the President has no powers {{over and above the}} other six Councillors and continues to head his or her department. Traditionally the duty rotates among the members in order of seniority and the previous year's Vice President becomes President.|$|R
50|$|Once elected for a four-year-term, <b>Federal</b> <b>Councillors</b> {{can neither}} be voted {{out of office}} by a motion of no {{confidence}} nor can they be impeached. Reelection is possible for an indefinite number of terms, and it has historically been extremely rare for Parliament not to reelect a sitting Councillor and this has only happened four times. In practice, therefore, Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.|$|R
