40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{particular}} cultural diversity issues experienced by Gen Y from overseas, studying in Australian universities. The authors interviewed 8 postgraduate international students from Gen Y group on their study experience and examined the existing support mechanism provided by universities in Australia. This research also compared GenY’s specific needs and the general supply of study support provided by universities. The research found there is imbalance between needs and supply. Gen Y either is unaware of such old fashioned support, or reluctant to access the services in the way prescribed by the university. Gen Y felt the support provided is unattractive or unappealing for them to access; the delivery method of such support does not match what Gen Y preferred. The authors recommend: More up to <b>date</b> <b>platform</b> for communication between the University staff and Gen Ys; More consultation with Gen Y and draw their input {{in the process of}} design and delivering of such support; University is to upgrade facilities to accommodate the needs of Gen Y and to be perceived as COOL for Gen Y communication styles...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} the necessity for software platform owners to govern their platform ecosystem {{in order to create}} durable opportunities for themselves and the app developers that surround the platform. To <b>date,</b> <b>platform</b> ecosystems have been widely analyzed from the perspective of platform owners, however, how and to what extent app developers collaborate with their peers needs to be investigated further. In this article, we study the interfirm relationships among app developers in commercial platform ecosystems and explore the causes of variation in the network structure of these ecosystems. By means of a comparative study of four commercial platform ecosystems of Google (Google Apps and Google Chrome) and Microsoft (Microsoft Office 365 and Internet Explorer), we illustrate substantial variation in the extent to which app developers initiated interfirm relationships. Further, we analyze how the degree of enforced entry barriers to the app store, the use of a partnership model, and the domain of the software platform that underpins the ecosystem affect the properties of these commercial platform ecosystems. We present subsequent explanations as a set of propositions that can be tested in future empirical researc...|$|E
40|$|Through {{this thesis}} I aim {{to bring forth}} how IT (information technology) {{could be used in}} {{different}} ways to create a better collaboration between students and companies. My intentions are to explore and observe what the demands are from both parties and find out, if it is the lack of an up to <b>date</b> <b>platform</b> that causes discrepancy in establishing relationships. Due to the limited time accorded for this research, I will focus on evaluating the platform, LinkedStudent and elaborate a design suggestion in attempt to enable a better collaboration. The research question is “How would it be possible to create a close relationship in between students and companies with the help of IT?” This paper endeavors to shed light on issues like usability, user experience and web 2. 0 both theoretically and empirically. With the amount of knowledge I have gathered during my study years I opt for a deductive approach of the problem, which on the course of the research through induction will be proven. The core assumption being that an innovative and warm environment can be created on a platform by interacting on the Web through organized communities with dynamic capabilities. A platform can be the optimal solution to establish relationships based on common interest. ...|$|E

3000|$|Operators of two-sided {{markets can}} use {{information}} regarding asymmetric network effects {{such as these}} to acquire, manage, and monetize their user base more effectively. For the online <b>dating</b> <b>platform</b> in our study, we calculated the revenue-optimal user split and found that a female proportion of the user base of 36.2  % yielded 17.2  % more revenue than a 50 / 50 split for the same total number of users. Our model is transferrable not only to other online <b>dating</b> <b>platforms,</b> but {{to all kinds of}} two-sided markets with network effects. Platform intermediaries can use the results from this optimization problem to develop more efficient user acquisition and monetization strategies.|$|R

30|$|This study’s {{objectives}} were to empirically assess {{the influence of}} CNEs and SNEs on revenue in a two-sided online network and to derive the revenue-optimal split between the two user groups, men and women.

30|$|Our {{empirical}} {{study examines}} a leading European online <b>dating</b> <b>platform.</b> Although online <b>dating</b> {{is one of}} the example industries in the literature on two-sided markets and seems theoretically very promising for identifying network effects (Armstrong 2006; Caillaud and Jullien 2003; Ellison and Ellison 2005; Rochet and Tirole 2003, 2006), this paper is the first to examine this industry empirically. In our case, the two user groups are heterosexual men and women. The platform enables them to search for each other, to communicate and to initiate real-life dates.|$|R
30|$|Our {{research}} aims {{to determine}} the direction and {{the magnitude of the}} different kinds of network effects on the platform and their impact on revenue, both in aggregate and of each user group individually. In addition to this empirical validation of existing theory, we propose an approach {{to determine the}} revenue-optimal ratio of men to women on the platform in light of the various existing network effects. We show that the online <b>dating</b> <b>platform</b> in question can significantly increase its revenue with the proper balance of male and female users.|$|R
30|$|Our study investigates users’ {{spending}} {{behavior on}} an online <b>dating</b> <b>platform.</b> Despite progress in gender equality, findings {{from more than}} 60  years ago (Kinsey et al. 1948) still seem to apply. Asymmetric societal norms still exist in people’s mate searching behavior that prevent women from making the first move (Bapna et al. 2012; Fisman et al. 2006; Piskorski 2012). This aspect certainly accounts {{for the results of}} our study, where we could see men are more likely willing to pay for online dating services assuming a sufficient installed user base of women than vice versa.|$|R

The two, Skout's chief {{executive}} officer and chief technology officer respectively, relaunched the network in 2009 as a dating and people discovery application and website after recognizing over 80% of the site's users were {{using it as a}} <b>dating</b> <b>platform.</b> SKOUT launched its iOS application in February 2009 at the 2009 DEMO conference. At the time, SKOUT was available for users on non-iOS mobile internet devices through its website. Skout's Android app launched in August 2010.|$|R
30|$|The {{main purpose}} of using an online <b>dating</b> <b>platform</b> is to look for, find, and contact {{potential}} partners of the opposite gender. Hence, users of one user group (e.g., men) care especially {{about the number of}} users on the other side (in this case: women) (Armstrong 2006; McIntyre and Subramaniam 2009; Tucker and Zhang 2010). Two-sided markets yield effects in which users in one group choose a good that affects another group’s choice of a different good (Parker and Van Alstyne 2005). For example, a woman joining the <b>dating</b> <b>platform</b> may motivate men to contact her. Thus, the utility of the platform to a paying male (female) user increases when he (she) can communicate with more women (men) (Yoo et al. 2002), which means that paying users on both market sides enjoy positive network effects from the installed user base on the opposite market side. This network effect can reflect the increased probability of finding a satisfactory match among the other side’s users (Bakos and Katsamakas 2008). Keeping the number of men constant, more women offer men a wider variety of matches (Ellison and Ellison 2005; Gehrig 1998), a greater chance of finding a unique fitting match (Caillaud and Jullien 2003), and reduce the competition between men for a specific woman (Dai and Kauffman 2006; Wang and Seidmann 1995; Yoo et al. 2002).|$|R
30|$|Our study applies {{empirical}} scrutiny to {{the network}} effects of a leading European online <b>dating</b> <b>platform.</b> While one might expect equal gender representation on such a platform to yield the best user experience and the highest revenue per user, our analysis shows that the platform requires only 36.2  % of its user base to be female to maximize revenue, primarily because women exert stronger positive cross-side network effects on men than vice versa; this optimum results in 17.2  % higher sales than a 50 / 50 split. Intermediaries of two-sided markets can use our model to improve user acquisition strategies.|$|R
