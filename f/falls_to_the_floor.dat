Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) attempts to convince the curmudgeonly Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would be boring. Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because the cases are usually simplistic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic.|$|E
5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was {{intended}} by Etty {{to illustrate the}} virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart {{as he prepares to}} kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she draws her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, <b>falls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.|$|E

500|$|One of the film's most {{excessively}} violent scenes {{features the}} death of Neal's ex-wife, Jane (played by Veronica Lario). This scene was one which suffered the most from cuts when the film was first released in Italy. The original scene featured Jane's arm being cut off at the elbow; blood sprays from the wound onto white walls until the character <b>falls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> After a back-and-forth between Argento and Italian censors (at the time a panel of judges), the scene was first trimmed from showing an [...] "immense" [...] spray to a small one, then a smaller one still. The scene was cut to almost nothing in the 1990s, when Lario married future Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. According to Alan Jones, Berlusconi [...] "did not want the public seeing [...] so explicitly murdered, {{even if it was}} in a film by his country's premier horror expert". For a few years, it was impossible to see the film in Italy legally, as prints were withdrawn altogether. A later DVD release did become available, with the scene restored.|$|E

Jorg finds a family photo in the man's pocket. Maxwell returns alone, and Jorg suggests they use the emergency stop button; Les prepares to smash the glass. Hugo stops him, confessing he is ticketless, Maxwell says he has an interview with the WHO in the morning, and Les, to Kath's annoyance, confesses that {{he does not want to}} risk missing the wedding. Maxwell explains the situation to Jorg, Les and Kath argue, and Shona refuses to let Hugo back into her bunk. Maxwell gives Jorg some tablets for his constipation, after which Shona offers a eulogy. The body is placed into 9B, and Hugo climbs into the same bunk. The passengers settle, but Kath lies sleepless.|$|E
500|$|Furious that Humbert tricked her, the Queen {{decides that}} first Snow White shall die {{by her own}} hand and at any cost. She goes down the dungeon to her secret room where she {{practices}} her dark magic, complete with a pet raven that [...] "knows all her secrets," [...] and in desperation uses her spellbook and cauldron to mix a potion that transforms her into a hag. Her beauty is shrouded in ugliness and age, though presumably reversible. She then conjures a poison apple, which will cause [...] "the Sleeping Death", and proceeds to leave the castle via a moat boat. She is sure {{that no one would}} know or perform the counter-curse to her spell, and believes the Dwarfs would bury her rival alive, thinking her dead. The Queen comes to the cottage, followed by two vicious vultures, and finds Snow White baking a pie for Grumpy the dwarf. Somehow Snow White's animal friends realize that the old hag is the Queen. After an unsuccessful attempt to warn Snow White by attacking the Queen, they go to warn the Dwarfs of the Queen's arrival. The Queen tricks the princess into letting her inside the cottage and eating the bewitched apple, telling her that it is a magic wishing apple.

500|$|The Initiative's {{goals are}} {{gradually}} made clearer. A recurring character {{since the second}} season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them. Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, {{spending more time with}} Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and there are questions about their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during [...] "The I in Team". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project, Adam who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm—the one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is [...] "Mommy", which he says as Dr. Walsh <b>falls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> dead.|$|E
500|$|There {{is rapidly}} growing {{interest}} in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as [...] "open-ended, {{in the sense that}} subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated {{as if they were the}} same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger). Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that [...] "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent". However, [...] "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response." [...] For example, [...] "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and <b>falls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person." ...|$|E
500|$|... "His Last Vow" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim, with Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek {{saying that}} the episode was [...] "as good a finale as Sherlock's ever had", with a very strong plot. Mark Jefferies of The Mirror called the episode [...] "easily the best yet in this run", with a [...] "fascinating" [...] plot. He also praised Mikkelsen as [...] "brilliant". Josh Wilding, also writing for The Mirror, said the episode [...] "was {{in many ways the}} best episode of Sherlock yet" [...] and called it [...] "simply one of the greatest TV shows of all-time", giving it 5/5. Caroline Frost of the Huffington Post called it a [...] "fitting finale to the series, with writers and actors all saving their best for last", despite the third series' [...] "patchy" [...] performances. Serana Davies of The Telegraph called the episode [...] "the best of the lot" [...] and gave 4 out of 5 stars, calling Moffat [...] "the superior Sherlock writer". Although her review was mainly positive, she questioned whether the programme had become [...] "a little vain, rather a show-off". Lucy Mangan of The Guardian said the episode was [...] "perfect", and a [...] "ceaseless flow of wit, invention and intelligence", a sentiment echoed by Ellen Jones of The Independent, who stated that it contained [...] "intelligence, humour and obscure fanboy references galore" [...] which [...] "delivered the goods". She went on to state that it is [...] "enough detail in this episode to justifying watching it again and again, once weekly, until series four". Chris Harvey of The Telegraph praised the [...] "beautifully done" [...] conclusion of the episode featuring Moriarty, saying it was [...] "very playful, very neat. And very unexpected". Sandipan Deb, writing in Indian newspaper Mint, was positive about the episode, calling it [...] "the best" [...] episode in the series, and praised its [...] "stunning twists and turns, its thrilling upending of what we have known about the characters for a lifetime, an emotional depth not seen before, and its clever throwaway references to the Canon". Deb also praised the [...] "uber-cool cinematic technique", singling out the moment when Sherlock has been shot and <b>falls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> as an [...] "extraordinary leap of the imagination and cinematic bravura". However, it was stated that the writers were [...] "influenced by the zoned-out Holmes films directed by Guy Ritchie".|$|E
