5|$|The {{mourning}} dove occupies {{a wide variety}} of open and semi-open habitats, such as urban areas, farms, prairie, grassland, and lightly wooded areas. It avoids swamps and thick forest. The species has adapted well to areas altered by humans. They commonly nest in trees in cities or near <b>farmsteads.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the {{historical}} account provided by Xenophon, he is murdered as an acting general of a military expedition {{on its way to}} Rhodes, on a stopover in Aspendus on the Eurymedon River during the night by angry inhabitants of that area, for his soldiers' recent transgressions of excess against local farmers and their <b>farmsteads.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Farmstead</b> cheeses {{are most}} often made on family farms in small batches and is often sold at local farmers' markets. While Europe has long {{had a very strong}} {{tradition}} of <b>farmstead</b> cheese-making, {{it is only in the}} last decades of the 20th century that <b>farmstead</b> cheese-making began to return to prominence in North America. In the United States, the top states for <b>farmstead</b> cheesmaking include Vermont, California, and Wisconsin, although <b>farmstead</b> cheese is growing rapidly in other states, like Georgia, as well. North Carolina is another state that has recently gained accolades for its <b>farmstead</b> cheeses, even creating the WNC Cheese Trail.|$|R
5|$|During the Roman era {{there was}} a {{settlement}} named Abona at the present Sea Mills; this was important enough to feature in the 3rd-century Antonine Itinerary which documents towns and distances in the Roman empire, and was connected to Bath by a road. Archaeological excavations at Abona have found a street pattern, shops, cemeteries and wharves, indicating that the town served as a port. Another settlement at what is now Inns Court, Filwood, had possibly developed from earlier Iron Age <b>farmsteads.</b> There were also isolated villas and small settlements throughout the area, notably Kings Weston Roman Villa and another at Brislington.|$|E
5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was {{originally}} known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, <b>farmsteads,</b> moorland, and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.|$|E
5|$|Rivington is {{situated}} on the moorland fringe between the high unenclosed moorland of the West Pennine Moors and the fields below. The landscape is characterised by marginal pastures with isolated <b>farmsteads,</b> reservoirs and disused mines and quarries scattered across the hillsides. There is an extensive network of footpaths providing public access. The reservoir valleys are dominated by expanses of water and the Victorian gothic architecture of the dams and embankments surrounded by woodland.|$|E

5|$|The Swann Lane, Hulme Hall Road, and Hill Top Avenue {{conservation}} area contains 16th and 17th century timber-framed buildings, Victorian villas, churches, and some former <b>farmsteads.</b> There are two Grade II listed buildings in this area: Hulme Hall, a timber-framed manor house which dates {{from either the}} 16th or 17th century, and 1 Higham Street, formerly Hill Cottage, which is of a similar period and style to Hulme Hall. The Church Inn public house, which dates from either the late 18th or early 19th century, is situated {{on the edge of}} this area.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} {{mountain}} sheep on the Lakeland fells, notably Swaledales and Rough-Fells, but the hardy Herdwick is the sheep {{most likely to}} be seen in and around the Duddon valley, the Coniston fells, the Buttermere fells and, through Borrowdale or Wasdale, up to the highest land in England, the Scafells. More than the old drystone walls that quarter the fells, the packhorse bridges or the whitewashed <b>farmsteads,</b> the little grey Herdwick sheep typify the Lakeland.|$|E
5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended <b>farmsteads,</b> indicating a migration of the population.|$|E

5|$|During the High Middle Ages, Crompton was a {{collection}} of scattered woods, <b>farmsteads,</b> moorland, swamp and a single corn mill, occupied by a small and close community of families. The area was thinly populated and consisted of several dispersed hamlets, including Whitfield, High Crompton, Cowlishaw, Birshaw and Bovebeale (above Beal). These hamlets were situated above the water-logged valley bottoms and below the exposed high moors. Owing to complicated local arrangements of land tenure, inheritance, and absentee landlords, the local lordship was weak, and Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. This slowly facilitated comparative freedoms and independence for the early people of Crompton, which encouraged the influx of families from the neighbouring parish of Rochdale, including the Buckleys, Cleggs, Greaves and Milnes.|$|E
5|$|Scotland has an {{extensive}} coastline and vast areas of difficult terrain and poor agricultural land. In this period, more land became marginal due to climate change, resulting in relatively light human settlement, {{particularly in the}} interior and Highlands. Northern Britain lacked urban centres and settlements were based on <b>farmsteads</b> and around fortified positions such as brochs, with mixed-farming primarily based on self-sufficiency. In this period, changes in settlement and colonisation meant that the Pictish and Brythonic languages began to be subsumed by Gaelic, English, and, {{at the end of}} the period, by Old Norse. Life expectancy was relatively low, leading to a young population, with a ruling aristocracy, freemen, and relatively large numbers of slaves. Kingship was multi-layered, with different kings surrounded by their war bands that made up the most important elements of armed forces, and who engaged in both low-level raiding and occasional longer-range, major campaigns.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of unlimited water on <b>farmsteads</b> {{became an issue}} when the Government of Saskatchewan at length permitted the subdivision of farmsteads: when this became viable, numerous luxurious <b>farmsteads</b> became attractive venues for townspeople to set up summer homes on former Qu'Appelle district <b>farmsteads</b> with the former farms consolidated as large-scale commercial operations having no relationship whatever with their former <b>farmsteads.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Farmstead</b> cheese, less {{commonly}} known as farmhouse cheese, is produced from the milk collected on the same farm where the cheese is produced. Unlike artisan cheese, which may also include milk purchased and transported from off-farm sources, <b>farmstead</b> cheese makers only use milk from animals they raise. According to the American Cheese Society, [...] "milk used {{in the production of}} <b>farmstead</b> cheeses may not be obtained from any outside source". As a result, the cheeses produced often have unique flavors owing to the farm's local terroir. [...] Most <b>farmstead</b> cheese is produced from cow, goat or sheep milk, although some <b>farmstead</b> cheeses are produced from water buffalo milk (mainly Buffalo mozzarella).|$|R

25|$|After these deportations, {{the pace}} of {{collectivization}} increased as a flood of farmers rushed into kolkhozes. Within two weeks 1740 new kolkhozes were established {{and by the end}} of 1950, just 4.5% of Latvian <b>farmsteads</b> remained outside the collectivized units; about 226,900 <b>farmsteads</b> belonged to collectives, of which there were now around 14,700. Rural life changed as farmers' daily movements were dictated to by plans, decisions and quotas formulated elsewhere and delivered through an intermediate non-farming hierarchy. The new kolkhozes, especially smaller ones, were ill-equipped and poor - at first farmers were paid once a year in kind and then in cash, but salaries were very small and at times farmers went unpaid or even ended up owing money to the kholhoz. Farmers still had small pieces of land (not larger than 0.5 ha) around their houses where they grew food for themselves. Along with collectivization, the government tried to uproot the custom of living in individual <b>farmsteads</b> by resettling people in villages. However this process failed due to lack of money since the Soviets planned to move houses as well.|$|E
