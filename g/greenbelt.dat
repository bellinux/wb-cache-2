40|$|Trees are {{believed}} to improve air quality, thus providing an important ecosystem service for urban inhabitants. However, empirical evidence on the beneficial effects of urban vegetation on air quality {{at the local level}} and in boreal climatic regions is scarce. We studied the influence of greenbelt-type forest patches on NO 2 levels (i) in front of, (ii) inside and (iii) behind <b>greenbelts</b> next to major roads in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland, during summer and winter using passive collectors. Concentrations of NO 2 were significantly higher in front of <b>greenbelts</b> compared to road sides without <b>greenbelts.</b> The more trees there were inside <b>greenbelts</b> the higher the NO 2 level in front of <b>greenbelts,</b> likely due to the formation of a recirculation zone of air flow in front of <b>greenbelts.</b> Similarly, NO 2 levels were higher inside <b>greenbelts</b> than in open areas without them, likely due to reduced air flow inside <b>greenbelts.</b> NO 2 levels behind <b>greenbelts</b> were similar to those detected at the same distance from the road but without <b>greenbelts.</b> Our results suggest that, regardless of season, roadside <b>greenbelts</b> of mostly broadleaf trees do not reduce NO 2 levels in near-road environments, but can result in higher NO 2 levels in front of and inside <b>greenbelts...</b>|$|R
30|$|Soil AP is {{significantly}} higher in road <b>greenbelts.</b> We found parts of road <b>greenbelts</b> being irrigated by a mixture of reclaimed water from various urban sewages rich in phosphorous. The highest AP content (274.03  mg/kg) was detected near the steel production factory, the Shougang Construction Group. However, soil Pb and SOC in road <b>greenbelts</b> are relatively low, {{which is consistent with}} previous findings (Zhao et al. [2013]). This is because most of the road <b>greenbelts</b> in Beijing were newly built and filled with garden soils and have only experienced a short-time accumulation of soil organic matters and pollutants.|$|R

The headquarters of the U.S. Park Police, which patrol this portion of the parkway, is located off this exit along MD193. MD193 provides access to College Park, which is home to the College Park Airport, a 1909 airport where the Wright Brothers taught the U.S. Army how to fly an airplane, and the University of Maryland, College Park, a public educational institution established in 1862. At the northern edge of the town, the route has employee-only access to the Goddard Space Flight Center, the first NASA space flight center opened in 1958 that contributed majorly to many space missions; from here, the route then enters the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the largest agricultural research center in the world owned by the United States Department of Agriculture. The parkway's only interchange within the center is at Powder Mill Road, south of Capitol College.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and <b>Greenbelt.</b> In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|With {{the funds}} released, {{construction}} on the Green Line proceeded quickly. In November 1986, WMATA awarded a $36.2 million contract to Mergentime Corp. to build the Navy Yard Station. A month later, WMATA awarded a $19.5 million contract to excavate a tunnel from the Navy Yard Station to the tunnels being built under the Anacostia River. On March 23, 1986, {{the second of the}} two 2,450-foot (747.25 metre), concrete-lined tunnels under the Anacostia River was completed. With the tunnels finished and other contracts awarded, WMATA announced yet another revised timeline for opening the Green Line in April 1987. The transit agency estimated that the Mount Vernon Square, Shaw, and U Street stations would open in late 1990, the Mount Vernon Square to Anacostia link in late 1991, and the Fort Totten to <b>Greenbelt</b> link by 1994. In January 1988, WMATA awarded a $179.1 million contract to build the Green Line from Fort Totten to <b>Greenbelt,</b> and a $6.9 million contract to complete the Waterfront station. In December 1988, WMATA reaffirmed that the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations would open in late 1991.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted {{was hired}} to survey the Bronx and map out streets based on the local geography. Olmsted noted {{the natural beauty of}} the Van Cortlandt estate, {{comparing}} it to Central Park which he designed, and recommended the city purchase the property. The land was part of a proposed <b>greenbelt</b> across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a grid system similar to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within the bounds of the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, an {{overpass}} {{being built}} at MD198 over the B–W Parkway {{just east of}} Laurel collapsed during rush hour, injuring fourteen motorists and construction workers. The incident was blamed on faulty scaffolding used to support the uncompleted span. On July 9, 2005, a sinkhole opened beneath the parkway at a construction site, leading to the complete closure of the northbound roadway. The sinkhole was filled with concrete {{to shore up the}} roadbed and prevent further collapse; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers attempted to expedite repairs, but the route remained closed until the next day. On August 24, 2007, both directions of the parkway were closed when chunks of concrete fell from the overpass at MD193 (<b>Greenbelt</b> Road) onto the northbound lanes.|$|E

It was the last line in the original Metrorail plan to be constructed, and is one of three north–south lines through the city of Washington.
