Additionally it was {{claimed that the}} extended hours were not profitable due increased costs associated with operating the locations at times with lower customer traffic and subsequent lower sales. Franchises and the NFA noted the franchise agreement only required locations to be open until 11:00pm and did not contain riders that allowed the corporate parent to amend the agreement. In response to the changes, three Miami-area franchise filed a suit in July 2008 with the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court of Florida in Miami to stop the change and force the company to make it optional instead of required.

40|$|Citizens {{of foreign}} {{countries}} are increasingly using international treaties to assert claims against Federal and state governments. As a result, U. S. courts {{are being asked}} to determine whether treaties provide litigants with individually <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights.</b> Although courts have no consistent approach to determining whether a treaty gives rise to individually <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights,</b> they often apply the textualist methodology derived from statutory interpretation. However, instead of using textual theories of statutory interpretation, I argue that courts should use intentionalist theories developed from contract interpretation in determining individually <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights</b> under treaties. Two positive arguments and one negative argument support my approach. First, the question of whether a non-party can enforce a treaty is structurally similar {{to the question of whether}} a non-party can enforce a contract, but structurally different from the issue of whether there is a private cause of action under a statute. Second, Supreme Court jurisprudence supports the view that treaties are contracts even though they have the effect of statutes. As such, it is appropriate to apply theories of contract interpretation to understanding treaties. Third, arguments used to justify using textualism for purposes of interpreting statutes are not relevant to interpreting treaties. I suggest that courts use a modified version of the 2 ̆ 2 intent-to-benefit 2 ̆ 2 test derived from contract law in determining whether a treaty is enforceable by a non-party. Under the modified 2 ̆ 2 intent-to-benefit 2 ̆ 2 test, a non-party will have individually <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights</b> and remedies under the treaty if the treaty identifies a class of individuals who are intended beneficiaries of the treaty and if such non-party is within that class of individuals. Applying this test suggests that courts should privilege the drafting history over the ratification history of a treaty in interpreting it. I apply the modified 2 ̆ 2 intent-to-benefit 2 ̆ 2 test to a case study-the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The Supreme Court recently decided in Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations does not provide individuals with any remedies, but refused to decide whether the treaty provides individuals with rights. Since that decision, two Federal Courts of Appeals have come to differing conclusions on the question of whether that treaty creates individually <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights.</b> Under the modified 2 ̆ 2 intent-to-benefit, 2 ̆ 2 the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations would be found to give rise to individually <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|R

Instead of using theories of statutory interpretation, I argue that courts should apply a modified version of the “intent-to-benefit” test derived from contract law in determining whether a treaty is enforceable by a non-party. Three general grounds support my agreement. First, the structural similarities between contracts and treaties (and the correlative differences between statutes and treaties) justify applying the principles derived from contract interpretation to treaty interpretation. Second, Supreme Court jurisprudence supports the view that treaties have the effect of statutes, but are actually contracts. As such, it is appropriate to apply theories of contract interpretation to understanding treaties. Third, arguments used to justify using textualism for purposes of interpreting statutes are not relevant to interpreting treaties.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how Norwegian companies protect foreign investments against political and regulatory risk. It does so {{by looking at}} how the Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries (Norfund) protects its investments in Africa; particularly in coun-tries where Norway has no bilateral or multilateral investment treaties (BITs). According to the Norfund Act, Norfund’s purpose is to provide equity capital and other risk capital in or-der to assist in developing sustainable businesses and industry in developing countries. His-torically, when investors from developed countries such as Norway invest in developing countries in Africa, {{one of the main}} challenges is how to protect their investments against potential changes in local regulations and politics that might affect the value of their in-vestments. Investors have relied on, inter alia, investment agreements between their home government and the host country for guarantee of <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights</b> {{in the event of a}} poten-tial expropriation of their property. In the case of Norfund, Norway has not signed many BITs or investment agreements with the African countries where Norfund invests. To under-stand what a lack of a guaranteed <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights</b> mean for Norfund, I examine three pre-viously concluded investment disputes; Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania; Parkerings - Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania; and Biloune and Marine Drive Complex Ltd v. Ghana Investments Centre and the Government of Ghana. I relate these cases to similar situations in which Norfund can find themselves in the course of their op-erations in Africa. This thesis concludes that: Norfund as a long-term investor in Africa may not need the protections of <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights</b> guaranteed by BITs and investment promotion acts be-cause Norfund has a different mandate than a private investor, which is to help those African countries build their industries. As such, Norfund does not need guarantees of <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights</b> before making long-term investments. The current investments protection regime does not fall into its interest. Norfund does not need to protect its investments because it does not have a profit motive...|$|R

40|$|The rise of privately <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights</b> in {{national}} courts based on substantive international law is an undeniable global phenomenon. Private rights are one {{response to the}} necessity of legal institutions to cope with globalisation. Moreover, the existence of privately <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights</b> is one more {{piece of evidence that}} the state-centred international system has undergone fundamental and irreversible change in the last 50 years. Privately <b>enforceable</b> <b>rights</b> and corresponding private duties based in substantive international law and enforceable in domestic courts are also evidence that monist theories of international law are empirically more correct than dualist theories. Finally, privately <b>enforceable</b> human <b>rights</b> undermine the claims of realism to primacy in international relations theory. Realism posits that international relations are fundamentally based on power politics and are zero sum. The rise of trading blocs, privatisation, and individual human rights all demonstrate the des-integration of the state due to globalisation and localisation and tend to invalidate the realists. For all these reasons, the issue of private law rights under international law is a timely topic. Our examination centres on one aspect of this complex of problems: the availability and limits of private law remedies to human rights violations – largely, torts. This thesis presents a comparative inquiry into those rights and duties based on international law recognized {{in national}} legal orders. Happily, and perhaps surprisingly, tort law can contribute to the defense of human rights. But that possibility is qualified by numerous serious limitations: procedurally, litigants usually invoke universal jurisdiction in cases of human rights violations heard in first world courts. Jurisdiction to adjudicate is usually accepted without problem. But precisely because certain violations of human rights are of universal concern there are numerous jurisdictional limitations on substantive rights while very real are not insurmountable. That is the principal contradiction of international tort law: the theoretical availability of universal rights, contradicted by the practical unavailability of relief, theoretically due to jurisdictional limitations, practically due to judgement proof defendants. The practical and procedural limitations are not however so great as to extinguish or obviate all human rights claims in private law...|$|R
