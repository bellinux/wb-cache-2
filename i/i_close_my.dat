500|$|Present {{throughout}} the songs background {{is the use}} of violins and a choir, as well as guitar, string instruments, congas and a cajon. [...] However it does make subtle use of synths and electronic sounds. Musically and lyrically, it is influenced by Contemporary Christian music, and has a gospel feel, while including standard pop and R. The song opens with Bieber singing, [...] "And I pray" [...] over a keyboard, while the song's chorus repeats one simple refrain, [...] "I close my eyes and I can see a better day/ <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes and pray." [...] In the lyrics, Bieber [...] "recognizes the pain and suffering in the world" [...] and then offers [...] "a passive solution" [...] through lines such as [...] "Children are crying / soldiers are dying / Some people don't have a home," [...] before compromising, [...] "I know there's sunshine beyond that rain / good times beyond that pain." [...] Vocally, Bieber's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles.|$|E

2500|$|Around age eleven, Mary Albert {{moved to}} a one-room house on Perdido Street with Louis, her {{daughter}} Lucy, and her common-law husband, Tom Lee. They lived next door to Mary Albert's brother Ike and his two sons. After {{dropping out of the}} Fisk School in 1912, Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. He also started to get into trouble. Cornet player Bunk Johnson said he taught Armstrong (then 11) to play by ear at Dago Tony's Tonk in New Orleans, although in his later years Armstrong gave the credit to Oliver. Armstrong hardly looked back at his youth as the worst of times but drew inspiration from it instead: [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes blowing that trumpet of mine—I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans... It has given me something to live for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chesney's second major-label album Me and You was {{released}} in 1996. Its lead-off single, [...] "Back In My Arms Again", peaked just outside the Top 40 on the country charts, but the title track (which Chesney recorded on his previous album) and the single [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Close</b> <b>My</b> Eyes" [...] (which was previously recorded by Keith Palmer on his 1991 debut album and then by Larry Stewart on his 1993 debut album Down the Road) both peaked at No.2 on the Billboard country charts. Me and You was Chesney's first gold-certified album. A cover of Mac McAnally's 1990 single [...] "Back Where I Come From" [...] was also included on this album. Though Chesney's version was never released as a single, {{it has become a}} song regularly played during his concerts. In recognition of his successful year, Chesney was honored with the 1997 Academy of Country Music's New Male Vocalist of the Year award.|$|E
60|$|During the {{interval}} which thus elapsed, certain events happened {{which may be}} briefly mentioned here before <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> narrative.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not fall}} off <b>my</b> chair, but <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes. The vision which the lovely lady's words had conjured up dazzled me.|$|R
6000|$|Thus <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> musings. [...] "Good-night" [...] left my lips in sound; I {{heard the}} words spoken, and then I heard an echo--quite close.|$|R
6000|$|... 161. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> last {{lecture at}} the {{question}} respecting Nicholas's masonry. His mouldings may be careless, {{but do you think}} his joints will be? ...|$|R
60|$|Should <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes {{it might}} be to open them again to the feel of those mighty jaws at my throat. To say the least, I was uncomfortable.|$|E
6000|$|I almost tremble at his nod - This next in train--who {{looks at}} me As I were slave, and he were god [...] Wielding an iron rod. <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes; yet still is he In front there, looking mastery.|$|E
6000|$|O Agnes, O my soul, so may thy face be by me when <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> life indeed; so may I, when realities are melting from me, {{like the}} shadows which I now dismiss, still find thee near me, {{pointing}} upward! ...|$|E
6000|$|She spoke, and <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes [...] To shut {{hallucinations}} out. [...] I echoed {{with surprise}} [...] Hearing my mere lips shout [...] The answer they did devise.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see nothing}} now," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>closing</b> <b>my</b> own eyes, [...] "unless {{it be the}} face of a sprite {{laughing}} at me from the bottom of a deep well." ...|$|R
60|$|Morning {{had evidently}} not come, so <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes {{and went to}} sleep again. I did not know it, but I had slept the clock around and it was night again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have written}} thus far, my dear sir, with little {{hesitation}} or embarrassment. But there is unfortunately a serious {{side to this}} business {{as well as a}} ridiculous side; and I must unwillingly come to it before <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> letter.|$|E
60|$|And now, as <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> task, subduing {{my desire}} to linger yet, these faces fade away. But one face, shining on me like a Heavenly light by which I see all other objects, is above them and beyond them all. And that remains.|$|E
60|$|Hitherto I {{have read}} to you with only {{supplemental}} comment. But {{in the next following}} passage, with which <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> series of extracts, sentence after sentence occurs, at which as I read, I must raise my hand, to mark it for following deprecation, or denial.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, and <b>I</b> {{must have}} slept again: when next I opened them a burly figure {{stood in the}} deep bay of the {{latticed}} window, looking out through the leaded panes.|$|R
60|$|But the {{photographer}} {{had ceased to}} listen. He came over and took my {{head in his hands}} and twisted it sideways. I thought he meant to kiss me, and <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> {{eyes and}} ears, not {{offering}} to lend him a hand, {{secure in the}} knowledge that he could climb back unaided into the unstable craft without the slightest risk of upsetting it.|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> {{eyes and}} hark {{back to the}} {{flooding}} light of {{the valley of the}} Elk, then I can do these things; I can't if I don't. I have to forget all my other pictures. This is nearer my impression than anything else I've done." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{sometimes}} fence for half-an-hour at the day's end, {{and when}} <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes upon the pillow I see a foil playing before me, the button to my face. We meet {{always in the}} deep of the mind, whatever our work, wherever our reverie carries us, that other Will.|$|E
60|$|Oakhurst. You {{know him}} not. He seems to need no rest (sadly). Night after night, {{long after the}} {{servants}} are abed, and the house is still, I hear that step slowly pacing the corridor. It is the last sound as <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> eyes, the first challenge of the morning.|$|E
60|$|In {{one corner}} of the cabin was a {{platform}} of poles, covered with straw. I threw the sleeping-bag on this, and was soon stretched out. Misgivings as to my strength worried me before <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes. Once on my back, I felt I could not rise; my chest was sore; my cough deep and rasping. It seemed <b>I</b> had scarcely <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes when Jones's impatient voice recalled me from sweet oblivion.|$|R
6000|$|... 31. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> last lecture {{with the}} statement, on which I desired {{to give you}} time for reflection, that Christian {{architecture}} was, in its chief energy, the adornment of tombs,--having the passionate function of doing honour to the dead.|$|R
60|$|At {{the time}} <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> last letter <b>I</b> {{had no idea}} that my next {{communication}} would be dated Senafe. Colonel Merewether’s unaccountable refusal to allow my fellow-correspondent and myself to accompany him upon his expedition had rendered our further stay here useless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word more," [...] {{interrupted}} the chair; [...] "here <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> lips {{for the next}} hundred years. At {{the end of that}} period, if I shall have discovered any new precepts of happiness better than what Heaven has already taught you, they shall assuredly be given to the world." ...|$|E
60|$|The 33d {{went forward}} three days ago, and Sir Robert Napier himself starts for Antalo on the 17th instant. If the 4th {{regiment}} arrive in time they will accompany him. <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> letter rather hastily, as I have just heard {{there is a}} mail expected to go {{three days before the}} regular packet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I may add, before <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> letter, {{that the}} poor old father will not be left in cheerless {{solitude}} at the lake house. He will pass {{the remainder of his}} days under my roof, with my good wife to take care of him, and my children to remind him of the brighter side of life." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps I {{remained}} awake {{while one}} might have counted twenty; but I am confident {{it was no longer}} than that, and then <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, not to open them again until conscious of a heavy blow on the soles of my feet.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> lids, {{and kept}} them close, [...] And the balls like pulses beat; [...] For {{the sky and}} the sea, and the sea and the sky [...] Lay like a load on my weary eye, [...] And the dead were at my feet.|$|R
60|$|My longing {{was beyond}} the power of opposition; <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, {{stretched}} out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myself drawn with the suddenness of thought through the trackless immensity of space. There was an instant of extreme cold and utter darkness.|$|R
