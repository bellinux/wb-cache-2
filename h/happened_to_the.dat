5|$|I {{was told}} by my {{publishers}} that Cher heard my version and she doesn't like my new lyrics. She thinks it's too overtly sexual. But the original writers were happy {{for me to do}} that—Cher didn't actually write it so she didn't get approval about what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> song. Now apparently she's heard what I've done and she doesn't like it.|$|E

Geologists {{do not know what}} <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eroded sediment that must have overlain the complex, but they do know that regional uplift was responsible; the area was originally below the surface of a shallow sea.|$|E

5|$|The acute rice {{shortage}} prevailing in {{the state}} became an election issue with the DMK promising to supply three padis (approx. 4.5kg) of rice for 1 Rupee in its election manifesto. The DMK capitalised on the rice shortage as well as widespread discontent with the Bhaktavatsalam administration. Slogans like Kamarajar Annachi kadalaiparuppu vilai ennachu (Elder Brother (Annachi is a title historically been {{used to refer to}} a person of Kamaraj's caste) Kamaraj, what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> price of chana dal?), Bhaktavatsalam annachi arisi vilai ennachu (lit.

5|$|All {{three players}} were {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, a teammate with the Cubs {{as well as a}} coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield in baseball history. Bill James, in his 1994 book, Whatever <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was {{not a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Cosby was {{a three-time}} {{winner of the}} Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, but Tom Selleck was the {{incumbent}} winner and Cosby had had three failed series since his success with I Spy. Cosby's sitcom was slotted against Selleck's Magnum, P.I., which had dominated the time slot for years. The show placed first in the Nielsen Media Research ratings for the week with a 21.6 million person viewership. This placed it ahead of runner-up 60 Minutes, which had an audience of 20.7 million.

5|$|In 1963, after The Bell Jar was published, Plath {{began working}} on another {{literary}} work titled Double Exposure. It was never published and disappeared around 1970. Theories about what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unfinished manuscript are repeatedly {{brought up in the}} book Sylvia Plath's Fiction: A Critical Study by Luke Ferretter. Ferretter also claims that the rare books department at Smith College in Massachusetts has a secret copy of the work under seal. Ferretter believes that the draft of Double Exposure may have been destroyed, stolen, or even lost. He presumes in his book that the draft may lie unfound in a university archive.|$|E
5|$|In Goodland, Florida, {{during a}} fierce hurricane, Sara Shipley and her son, Evan, desperately try to flip {{the washing machine}} but fail to do so as tentacles ensnare them. After {{receiving}} a call, FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive {{at the home of}} retired FBI agent Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), the first to look into the X-Files. He tells them about the Shipley family and how Sara Shipley called him in a panic after her husband was attacked by something in the bathroom with tentacles. Scully is dubious about this but believes that something has indeed <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shipley family during this hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Wyatt gave Sadie signed legal {{papers and}} filing fees to {{a claim for}} an oil lease in Kern County, California. She gambled away the filing fees and lied to Wyatt about what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lease, which later {{turned out to be}} valuable. Distrustful of her ability to manage her finances, Wyatt made an {{arrangement}} with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. Wyatt put oil leases he owned in Henrietta's name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Sadie after his death. Henrietta's three children voided the agreement after their mother's death and did not pass on the royalties to her.|$|E

5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E
5|$|Schuyler and {{original}} Degrassi series head writer Yan Moore began {{developing a new}} television drama in 1999. As the months progressed, they {{began to think about}} what had <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> characters of Degrassi High to develop a school-reunion theme. However, they decided that a series would not work effectively if based around adults instead of children. Moore realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school, and development for the series took a new direction by focusing on Emma and her school experiences.|$|E
