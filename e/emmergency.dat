40|$|Background Adult females {{recently}} diagnosed HIV positive fall pregnant {{soon after}} diagnosis in John Taolo Gaetsewe Health District. They usually claim ignorant of or say they forgot {{to take their}} pills and that lead to their getting pregnant. Considering the health implication of pregnancy on the general health outlook of HIV positive females and risk of mother to child transmission of HIV, that motivated this study. Aim and Objectives To study the contraceptive knowledge, attitude and practices amongst adult HIV positive females in John Taolo Gaetsewe Health District. The objectives are; 1. 	To evaluate contraceptive knowledge, perceptions and practices amongst patients presenting for contraception 2. 	To find out the reasons for use and non use of contraceptives by patients 3. 	To determine choices of contraceptive methods, use of <b>emmergency</b> contraception and barrier contraception such as condoms. Methods Study design: A cross sectional descriptive study focused on determining the contraceptive knowldge, attitude and practices of adult HIV positive females {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49 were selected for the study. Approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee University of Stellenbosch with reference number N 11 / 04 / 123, and the Northern Cape Department of Health. The study was carried out between June 2011 and July 2011. The questionnaire was designed based on a publication cited on contraceptive practices of women in Northern Tshwane. Setting: The study was conducted in the ARV clinics of the Kuruman and Tshwaragano districts hospitals and the four community health centres in the John Taolo Gaetsewe Health District. This district is a predominantly rural district. Results: Data was provided by 224 participants who fullfiled the inclusion criteria. The knowledge about condom ranked highest(100 %) followed by injectibles(94 %), oral contraceptive pills(87 %), female sterilization(66 %) and <b>emmergency</b> contraception(51 %). IUCD is the method that is least known(3 %). Nurses are the major source of information about contraceptives(89 %) while the educator give the least information to participants on contraceptives(40 %). 100 % of participants had access to oral contraceptive pills and injectibles at their local clinics while the method that was least accessible are IUCD(2 %) and hormonal implants(0 %). There was a 100 % positive perception of injectibles, 74 % to female sterilization 67 % for morning after pill and 61 % to oral contarecptive pills while male sterilization had a positive perception of 12 % and IUCD (8 %). Availability of contraceptives influenced choice of contraceptives as participants used available methods at the clinic which were condoms, injectibles, oral contraceptives and female sterilization. Partners of participants and tradition also influenced use while non use was mainly because participant wanted to fall pregnant(22 %), side effects(6 %) and tuberculosis(1 %). Conclusion This study revealed that participants had very good knowledge and positive perception about the readily available contraceptive methods at the local clinics. This was true as 100 % were well informed about condoms, 94 % about injectibles and 87 % about oral contracetive pills. At clinics in John Taolo Gaetsewe health District the three methods of contraceptive mentioned above were what you find readily available. 51 % of partcipants were also well informed about <b>emmergency</b> contraception this showed the level of awareness in this area on <b>emmergency</b> contraception despite their low level of education. The study revealed that partners of participants and traditional healer had impact on contraceptive use, while getting pregnant topped the list on reasons why contraceptive was discontinued. Parents, teachers and the media should get more involved in the enlightenment campaign about contraceptive as it will help protect women from unplanned pregnancies...|$|E
40|$|Ice rinks {{have become}} {{important}} sport facilities in towns and cities. They are mostly situated in densely populated centres. The ice is made and kept by refrigeration plant {{placed in the}} stadium engine room. Refrigerating medium is mostly ammonia which is toxic, irrritating and harmful to the environment. Considering this fact, eventual breakdown of the refrigerating system poses a risk {{for people in the}} surroundings. The work is particularly aimed at preparing an instruction manual for integrated <b>emmergency</b> system and state authorities to upgrade their theoretical and practical knowledge and {{to be used as a}} supportive material when dealing with refrigerating system breakdown and consequent ammonia release. A technique used in the Bachelor´s work was a model breakdown demonstration of the ice rink in Jindřichův Hradec. Then all the data obtained were evaluated by the TerEx programme and finally relevant steps and measures were suggested. The findings revealed the fact that the attention is mostly paid to response recommendations in the breakdown centre while the surroundings are not involved sufficiently. The manual application together with upgrading material equipment may significantly reduce the negative effect of the breakdown on the ice rink surroundings and, especially, on civilians...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} use of biological weapons {{has become a}} reality. In {{the face of the}} character and the organizational transformation of the phenomenon of terrorism and the incidents related to terrorist attacks today, the interest of specialists, politicians, general public and of course also mass media in the threat of bioterrorism and the posibility of misuse of mass destruction weapons is getting stronger. A biological attack means an intentional use of vital microorganisms or their toxic products to cause a disease and death in people, animals and plants. This is a very broad issue, that is why this work is focused especially on a short summary of main aspects of the problem, with emphasis on readiness of the integrated rescue system for extraordinary incident, eventually on a crisis situation, that could come {{as a consequence of the}} use of biological weapons. The methods of a biological attack and its main characteristics. The general public must be better informed about the possibilities of ultraterrorist attacks and must be prepared for the possible reaction in case of these attacks. Growing awareness would probably significantly contribute to the elimination of losses in the case of use of these biological weapons by terrorists. It is necessary to focus on the citizens´ preparation regarding existing threats of terrorist attacks, inform them how to identify symptoms of attacks with weapons of mass destruction and how to adequately protect ourselves against them. A rank of proceedings exists for the protection of citizens, such as sufficient amount of protective masks, means for decontamination, a complete programme for mass vaccination, a broader and deeper planning of processes for extraordinary situations, as well as information about <b>emmergency</b> escape shelters etc. ...|$|E
40|$|This is {{an opinion}} {{originally}} published as an email {{message on the}} Spanish speaking and Iberic American reaching mailing list “BIBLIO-INFO-SOCIEDAD” (Libraries, Information and Society) in its message number 94, commenting about the contraceptive method {{of the next day}} pill on the international press and their implications for LIS. Generally when I express my opinions on email messages I make first my comments of the news and the end I include full text the actual commented news including the webpage link where I took it, but the message it is not an article or research paper properly, and besides like this is how it was actually re-published in Cuba and Mexico, so it keeps the same form but just bear in mind this caveat. In Mexico the federal government has just issued a new standard where authorizes the public use of the new contraceptive method of the <b>emmergency</b> pill or pill of the next day (see the news below), in the cases of women victims of violations, rape, or in case they put their life in risk due to a malformed but non-violent driven pregnancy. Immediately the Catholic Church hyerarchies reacted against such a federal government regulation calling it genocidal. Thus, what Library and Information Science has to do in all of this? To begin with, Library and Information Science is a science, whereas all religions are not sciences. This is a polemical issue, like political and religious issues, because it challenges librarians to bend down their ideological conceptions (religious, political or any) in order to honour a correct, objective, and concrete application of science; the science of libraries, Library and Information Science or whichever name be called. It challenges, above all the librarians of selection and acquisition departments and to the top management where those ones belong. In the case of libraries from medical schools it is probable that the situation be sorted out (provided it is a secular and non-religious one), but not in the case to give access to all the general public where the vast majorities do no thave access to university libraries, or even in the case where their libraries are exclusive for university community, even if these were funded by the public purse. It is under these conditions that the public libraries have in their hands a great challenge: to inform society of all the new scientific discoveries, such as this medical one for a better control of the sexual health and enjoyment of life, but guided with the highest ethical responsibility and with secular, skeptical, critical and scientific thinking...|$|E
