25|$|As just suggested, the {{phenomena}} that c-command {{is intended to}} address may be more plausibly examined in terms of linear order and a hierarchy of syntactic functions. Concerning the latter, some theories of syntax take a hierarchy of syntactic functions to be primitive. This is true of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), and dependency grammars (DGs). The hierarchy of syntactic functions that these frameworks posit is usually something like the following: SUBJECT > FIRST OBJECT > SECOND OBJECT > OBLIQUE OBJECT. Numerous mechanisms of syntax are then addressed <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|While the {{recycled}} nutrients may support some phytoplankton growth, {{it ultimately}} feeds back to increased C. amurensis populations. The recent invasion success of Limnoithona tetraspina may be understood <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon. It feeds on ciliates and microflagellates which {{are too small}} to be grazed by the clam, thereby avoiding competition. Additionally, L. tetraspina appears impervious to predation by the clam or (almost) anything else. The rise of the microbial food web and the invasion of L. tetraspina capitalize are the result of an untapped alternative path for energy flow in the food web, facilitated by C. amurensis. Subsequent patterns of invasion may reflect a similar pattern.|$|E

25|$|Once a {{paradigm}} shift has taken place, the textbooks are rewritten. Often {{the history of science}} too is rewritten, being presented as an inevitable process leading up to the current, established framework of thought. There is a prevalent belief that all hitherto-unexplained phenomena will in due course be accounted for <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> established framework. Kuhn states that scientists spend most (if not all) of their careers in a process of puzzle-solving. Their puzzle-solving is pursued with great tenacity, because the previous successes of the established paradigm tend to generate great confidence that the approach being taken guarantees that a solution to the puzzle exists, even though it may be very hard to find. Kuhn calls this process normal science.|$|E
25|$|A {{functional}} model must thus achieve two aims {{in order}} to be of use. It must furnish a throughput description mechanics capable of completely defining the first and last throughput states, and perhaps some of the intervening states. It must also offer some means by which any input, correctly described <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> mechanics, can be used to generate an output which is an equally correct description of the output which the actual system would have given for the input concerned. It may also be noted that there are two other things which a functional model may do, but which are not necessary to all functional models. Thus such a system may, but need not, describe the system throughputs other than at the input and output, and it may also contain a description of the operation which each element carries out on the throughput, but once again this is not.|$|E
25|$|Rosemary Basson {{proposed}} an alternative model of sexual response. She {{argues that the}} linear model is good at explaining men's sexual response but it poorly explains women's sexual responses; thus, she puts forth a circular model. She states that closeness or attachment to a partner increases the effectiveness of sexual stimulation. This leads to enhanced sexual arousal, which may ultimately result in orgasm. Consequently, this positive sexual arousal continues the sexual desire that women feel, and this desire increases intimacy with the partner. Other researchers have attempted to evaluate women's sexual functioning <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new model but have found contradictory results. In one study conducted by Giles and McCabe, {{they found that the}} linear model of sexual response was a good predictor of women's sexual functioning (and dysfunction), while the circular model was a poor predictor. Once they modified the pathways of the model, the circular model then became a good predictor of sexual functioning. In another study looking at Malaysian women, researchers found that the circular model was actually a good predictor of women's sexual desire and arousal. More research {{needs to be done in}} this area to show whether the circular model more accurately describes women's sexual response.|$|E

500|$|As in his {{psychological}} theory, Hobbes's physical conatus is an infinitesimal unit of motion. It is {{the beginning}} of motion: an inclination in a specified direction. The concept of impetus, as used by Hobbes, is defined <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> physical conatus. It is [...] "a measure of the conatus exercised by a moving body over the course of time". Resistance is caused by a contrary conatus; force is this motion plus [...] "the magnitude of the body". Hobbes also uses the word conatus to refer to the [...] "restorative forces" [...] which may cause springs, for example, to contract or expand. Hobbes claims there is some force inherent in these objects that inclines them to return to their previous state. Today, science attributes this phenomenon to material elasticity.|$|E
