40|$|Scholars {{and activists}} are concerned, {{sometimes}} simultaneously, with mitigation of {{anthropogenic climate change}} and the environmental effects of globalization. Many analysts argue that a solution to both problems is localization; increasing the costs of transportation should increase the cost of long-distance transportation, making local and regional exchange economically relatively more efficient. The argument here, however, is that dealing with climate change will {{have the effect of}} reinforcing patterns of economic globalization, at the expense of patterns of economic nationalization and continentalization. Transportation by sea has historically been, and continues to be, more fuel-efficient than transportation by land. Limiting anthropogenic carbon emissions in transportation therefore favors sea transport over land transport. Historically, patterns of trade favored <b>global</b> <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> routes over trade within land-based regions. The model to look in understanding the effect of action on climate change on global trade pattens, therefore, is not the future proposed by the localists, it is at historical patterns.

40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} {{potential}} strategies for Korean shipbuilders for sustainable growth by understanding {{the characteristics of}} the shipbuilding industry and the current market situation. Before the financial meltdown in 2008, in the five preceding years, the healthy global economy and the rapid growth of the Chinese economy led to 35 % compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in shipbuilding orders. Korean shipbuilders ' sales and profits increased dramatically and they invested aggressively to meet the global demand. However, because of the financial crisis, the shipbuilding orders in 2009 decreased by 92 % compared to 2007. Accordingly, the decrease in new orders will become a serious risk for Korean shipbuilders to manage because it will cause loss of economies of scale and cash deficit, at the same time. Historically, {{it is true that the}} profits of Korean shipbuilders generally mirrored the volume of <b>global</b> <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade,</b> which is ultimately driven by global GDP growth. However, even though the world growth rate, as predicted by OECD, turns positive in 2010, the drastic shrinkage in the shipbuilding demand may not easily recover because of oversupply of flee...|$|E

In particular, container shipping service is considered a key enabler of international trade and global economic development. To strengthen the role of shipping in supporting <b>global</b> <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade,</b> it is highly desirable to identify the determinants that influence the total capacity of the shipping industry, explain how the related business activities (e. g., demand for shipping service, vessel price, fleet size, etc.) are linked to the demand for container shipping service, and empirically verify the findings. This study builds on the demand chain management paradigm to analyze the service capacity of the container shipping industry. We establish a path-analytic model to explain how shipping demand affects such shipping-related variables as vessel price and to evaluate their effects on the service capacity of the industry. The empirically-tested model provides managers and researchers with insights on how to enhance the coordination and integration of a series of shipping-related variables from shipping demand to capacity management in the container shipping service industry.

40|$|Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as {{marine fuel}} {{currently}} {{appears to be}} an attractive, potential and technically feasible option for new building vessels to comply with air pollution regulations. Consequently, the implementation of LNG on board vessels has been conducted together with the development of LNG-fuelled engines, LNG fuel tanks, gas supply systems and LNG infrastructure. LNG-fuelled vessels are equipped principally with lean-burn gas engines or dual-fuel (DF) engines, vacuum insulated C-type tanks and compact fuel gas supply systems. Over the next decade, the number of LNG-fuelled vessels is forecasted to increase fast, even tough, certain LNG-fuelled vessel segments will experience a bigger expansion. Furthermore, potential for LNG-fuelled vessels depends on several features and car/passenger ferries seem to be the LNG-fuelled vessel segment with a higher potential. To date, air pollution regulations significantly reduce nitrous oxides (NOX) emissions and almost eliminate sulphur oxides (SOX) and particulate matter (PM) emissions, although, carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions are reduced only 20 - 30 %. Owing to the foreseen rise of <b>global</b> <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade,</b> CO 2 emissions are expected to grow even more emphasising the necessity to adopt highly restrictive measures.

40|$|As the Straits {{is one of}} {{the busiest}} straits in the world and of great {{significance}} for <b>global</b> <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade,</b> piracy and armed robbery in the Straits have a devastating impact on the world economy. While customary international law, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982 Convention) and other international and regional instruments have established principles and guidelines governing piracy, they are argued to be inadequate and insufficient to deal with contemporary piracy. Since the legal status of the Straits, determined in the early chapter, is that of ‘straits used for international navigation’, which comes under part III of the 1982 Convention, it is the primary responsibility of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore (the littoral States) to ensure the continuous safety and security of ships transiting the Straits. In {{view of the fact that}} the issue of piracy in the Straits gained global attention, the efforts to suppress piracy are discussed at each level, namely international, regional and national levels. A general discussion on the historical development of the International Law of the Sea and the definitional and jurisdictional issues of piracy is also undertaken. Then, the thesis examines regional responses to the problem of piracy. Since an individual state is an important nucleus in international law, the Malaysian policy and legal framework are highlighted at the end of the thesis to determine the extent of the efforts undertaken by Malaysia especially the MMEA, and to examine whether the existing Malaysian law is adequate to suppress and prosecute piracy and armed robbery against ships.

30|$|However, {{the reasons}} for the lack of any {{significant}} association between <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> and national economy for developed economies could be: (1) the growth rates of GDP per capita compared to <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> of the developed countries is lower than that of developing countries in general, and (2) developed countries are service-based economies and the role of <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> is often one-way (imports), while developing countries tend to be more industry-based and trade plays a two-way role (both imports and exports). Meanwhile, attempts to stimulate economic growth by major developed economies – such as Brexit by the United Kingdom, and the United States President Donald Trump’s approach towards bringing back major industrial production facilities to the USA – could, if followed by other developed nations, change the current association between <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> and economy in the future.|$|R

40|$|Ports {{are very}} {{important}} for the national economy as well as social well-being since they are mostly involved with the import and export of goods. Moreover, world business increasingly focuses on activities which can add value to end customers. As a result, recent market activities become more aggressive in terms of port competition. For this reason, this study attempted to ascertain the port competitiveness of Laem Chabang Port (LCP), Thailand. At first, factors that are considered to be the most relevant to port competitiveness, are identified by means of reviewing the literatures, namely port location, services, hinterland connection, telecommunication and port charges. In addition, the current situation of maritime trade is analysed in different regions, which is Asia, Southeast Asia and Thailand. Moreover, the background of LCP is described, including its performance in the past decade. This study aims to provide in-depth information on current practices and perceptions of the port, therefore, these factors are further carried out in an empirical section. In order to do so, interviews are conducted in this study. The sample group of this study are shippers, carriers, freight forwarders, which use LCP for import and export, Port Authority of Thailand, and local government organisation. Based on each port competitiveness factor, LCP is carefully evaluated in order to indentify its competitive advantages. Moreover, LCP is critically compared to its main competitor, Singapore Port, the world top container port. Finally, a SWOT analysis is implemented so as to identify its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. By doing so, it helps LCP to manage development plans in the future in order to enhance its competitive advantages and become even more successful port in the <b>global</b> <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade.</b> Faculty of Social Science and Business / Plymouth Business School...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} 20 years world seaborne trade {{increased}} by almost 40 %. Liner shipping grew the fastest. Containerised cargo {{was clearly the}} most dynamic sector of <b>global</b> <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade.</b> Containerisation has thus been a major and increasingly important element of not only maritime activity, but also of world trade and of entire global industrial structure. The growing significance of containerisation {{is a reflection of}} the changes that have occurred in the international organisation of manufacturing and production. Container lines have moved through several organisational phases in the search for profitability. Most of the advances in containership design have been associated with the upsizing of vessels, both to accommodate trade growth and to offer economies of scale in a highly competitive market. Information technology is now seen as the great battleground of the next decade among not just carriers, but also forwarders, logistics based integrators and, potentially, pure technology companies who may use their systems expertise to enter the industry at the expense of traditional players. Container handling in ports is another area where technical advance is noticeable. Increasingly larger tonnage, especially of vessels deployed in the container market, will have significant implications for ports. Massive investments and substantial productivity improvements are generally required to enable ports to meet the stringent service requirements of their customers efficiently. The speed of container handling and consequent vessel turnaround time is a crucial issue in terms of competition. The worldwide trend towards greater private sector involvement in ports has become apparent. While wholesale privatisation has occurred in a few cases, what is more common is the introduction of private finance, operation and management in place of state funds and administration. The advent of the so-called ‘global stevedore’ in the 1980 s has had a fundamental effect on port facility financing and management. The international stevedoring industry is made-up of participants with a commercial remit. The bottom line with port facility acquisitions or new terminal developments is that developers of all categories look for annual pre-tax returns in excess of 20 % of turnover. While the acquisition and development of port facilities is a global business, it is one that is highly influenced by key individuals within the international stevedores. Competition among international stevedores and between these parties and ocean carriers for port concessions has never been stronger.

30|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{justified}} investment into transport facilities as a stimulator of economic growth of a country or region, most of the economic impact studies concerning <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> have focused on a particular seaport or a region and {{a clear picture of}} how <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> benefits the world economies remains elusive. In the context of the Port of Liverpool, Kinsey (1981) argued that the impact of ports on the local economy was declining, with a decreased number of jobs directly dependent on the port at that time. British ports were no longer major employers and the industrial inter-related complexities no longer existed, further reducing the impact of ports on the local economy (Gripaios and Gripaios, 1995). Two relatively recent studies, one in the context of South Korea (Jung, 2011) and another in the context of China (Deng et al., 2013), have also argued that ports are having declining effects on economy. In particular, Jung (2011) identified that from 1990 to 2008, South Korea experienced 87.5 % decrease in the direct port employment creation effect per billion Korean won. Despite no significant impact of <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> on economic growth, Deng et al. (2013) revealed significant positive association between regional economy and value added activity at Chinese ports. The reasons for such association could be that Deng et al. (2013) included total volume of imports and exports in the value-added activity construct, which is actually part of the port demand (i.e. <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade)</b> construct.|$|R
30|$|Further, the {{extension}} to multi-group analysis reveals important findings, especially for developing economies. <b>Seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> partially mediates {{the impact of}} port infrastructure quality and logistics performance on economic growth in developing countries. Portugal-Perez and Wilson (2012) found {{that the impact of}} transport efficiency (a component of logistics performance) on export performance decreases as the economy becomes richer. Similarly, the present study found that logistics performance has a higher impact on <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> in developing economies than developed ones. For developing economies, we also found that quality of port infrastructure positively affects logistics performance; better logistics performance yields higher <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade,</b> and higher <b>seaborne</b> <b>trade</b> yields economic growth. Therefore, policy makers in developing countries should consider investing in quality improvement of port infrastructure and logistics performance, compared to larger investments in the building of new physical infrastructures (Portugal-Perez and Wilson, 2012). Policy makers in developed countries should also consider maintaining high-quality port infrastructure, as this has a positive effect on logistics performance and national economy. Korinek and Sourdin (2011) stated that “as developed nations shift from traditional manufacturing and agriculture and are increasingly engaging in international vertical specialisation, the need for efficient logistics services becomes ever more important” (p. 2). As of 1990, although smaller countries of the OECD database had a higher share of vertical specialisation than the overall OECD share; the overall share increased by about 30 % between 1970 and 1990 (Hummels et al., 2001).|$|R
