To address this issue a very innovative design called External Sensing Energy Efficient technique is proposed in this literature.

40|$|Abstract: The rise in {{prevalence}} of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is suggestive {{of a new}} etiology. Diagnostic substitution alone is unlikely {{to account for the}} increase, while genetic association with detoxification gene alleles points to an environmental contribution. Subtle structural anomalies in the ASD brain are widespread but limbic damage seems important for the development of behaviors diagnostic of ASD. The limbic brain is especially susceptible to environmental challenge: <b>internal</b> <b>sensing,</b> physiological feedback and neuroinflammatory processes may underlie this sensitivity to insult. Primary damage leading to ASD in later life is likely to take place in utero and/or in the immediate postnatal period. Despite evidence of heavy metal involvement, a causal connection may not yet be concluded because subjects exposed to metals tend to be exposed to other environmental agents. Because maternal minerals and lipids are supplied to the unborn child, historic toxic exposure of the mother may be pivotal.

Key to pAg-mediated activation of Vγ 9 Vδ 2 T cells is the butyrophilin 3 A 1 (BTN 3 A 1) protein that contains an intracellular B 30. 2 domain critical to pAg reactivity. Here, we have demonstrated through structural, biophysical, and functional approaches that the intracellular B 30. 2 domain of BTN 3 A 1 directly binds pAg through a positively charged surface pocket. Charge reversal of pocket residues abrogates binding and Vγ 9 Vδ 2 T cell activation.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a soft hand capable of robustly grasping and identifying objects based on internal state measurements {{along with a}} combined system which autonomously performs grasps. A highly compliant soft hand allows for intrinsic robustness to grasping uncertainties; the addition of <b>internal</b> <b>sensing</b> allows {{the configuration of the}} hand and object to be detected. The hand can be configured in different ways using finger unit modules. The finger module includes resistive force sensors on the fingertips for contact detection and resistive bend sensors for measuring the curvature profile of the finger. The curvature sensors can be used to estimate the contact geometry and thus to distinguish between a set of grasped objects. With one data point from each finger, the object grasped by the hand can be identified. A clustering algorithm to find the correspondence for each grasped object is presented for both enveloping grasps and pinch grasps. This hand is incorporated into a full system with vision and motion planning on the Baxter robot to autonomously perform grasps of objects placed on a table. This hand is a first step towards proprioceptive soft grasping. by Bianca Homberg. Thesis: M.

40|$|Mobile sensing and mapping {{applications}} {{are becoming more}} prevalent because sensing hardware is becoming more portable and more affordable. However, most of the hardware uses small numbers of fixed sensors that report and share multiple sets of environmental data which raises privacy concerns. Instead, these systems can be decentralized and managed by individuals in their public and private spaces. This paper describes a robust system called MobGeoSens which enables individuals to monitor their local environment (e. g. pollution and temperature) and their private spaces (e. g. activities and health) by using mobile phones in their day to day life. The MobGeoSen {{is a combination of}} software components that facilitates the phone's <b>internal</b> <b>sensing</b> devices (e. g. microphone and camera) and external wireless sensors (e. g. data loggers and GPS receivers) for data collection. It also adds a new dimension of spatial localization to the data collection process and provides the user with both textual and spatial cartographic displays. While collecting the data, individuals can interactively add annotations and photos which are automatically added and integrated in the visualization file/log. This makes it easy to visualize the data, photos and annotations on a spatial and temporal visualization tool. In addition, the paper will present ways in which mobile phones can be used as noise sensors using an on-device microphone.

A fundamental issue within this context {{is that most of}} the chemical sensors depend on interactions between the targeted species and the surfaces functionalized with receptors that bind the target species selectively, and that these binding events are coupled with transduction processes that begin to change when they are exposed to the messy world of real samples. With the advent of fundamental breakthroughs at the intersection of materials science, micro/nano-technology, and signal processing, hybrid chemo-sensory systems have incorporated tunable, optimizable operating parameters, through which changes in the response characteristics can be modeled and compensated as the environmental conditions or application needs change. The objective of this article, in this context, is to bring together the key advances at the device, data processing, and system levels that enable chemo-sensory systems to adapt in response to their environments.

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE THESISSensing and Shaping from Within: Exploring the Integration of Somatic Concepts {{into the}} Teaching and Learning of BalletByAlana Rae IsiguenMaster of Fine Arts in DanceUniversity of California, Irvine, 2015 Professor Loretta Livingston, Chair	This thesis {{research}} study examines how somatic thought can {{aid in the}} approach to, and execution of, classical ballet, specifically within American dance programs in higher education at the undergraduate level. This research also aims to further {{the discussion of the}} value of using somatics in training dance professionals. It adds to an existing body of knowledge of more helpful and healthy pedagogical ways in shaping dancers by treating the individual body and striving for wellness. A brief overview of three long standing somatic practices, The Alexander Technique, Laban Movement Analysis/Bartenieff Fundamentals, and Ideokinesis, provides background on foundations and principles: teaching awareness of self, placing attention on mind-body connectivity, and promoting efficiency in motion, breath, and body alignment. Also, a closer look at two examples of long-standing, high achieving BFA dance conservatory programs, The Juilliard School and The Boston Conservatory, demonstrate the utility of somatics in dance curricula. Lastly, this thesis research describes the workshop I undertook with undergraduate dance students at the University of California, Irvine exploring the application of somatic concepts to classical ballet. The pedagogical model was based on four somatic principles: breath, kinesthesia (<b>internal</b> <b>sensing),</b> connectivity, and initiation and intention, drawn from Dance and Somatics: Mind-Body Principles of Teaching and Performance, by Julie Brodie and Elin Lobel.

The method then provides navigation guidance from any place to any other in the explored environment. On one hand, a localization algorithm determines the location of the user in the graph. On the other hand, a rotation guidance algorithm provides a directional cue towards the next graph node in the user's body frame. Our method makes little assumption about the environment except that it contains descriptive visual features. It requires no intrinsic or extrinsic camera calibration, and relies instead on a method that learns the correlation between user rotation and feature correspondence across cameras. We validate our approach using several ground truth datasets. In addition, we show that our approach is capable of guiding a robot equipped with a local obstacle avoidance capability through real, cluttered environments.

40|$|The work {{deals with}} {{measurement}} techniques of water conducting {{system in the}} trees. Water conducting system (including xylem and phloem) indicates its importance for related physiological processes. There are still problems how to measure its functioning (which variables and how), especially in the open field (e. g., forests and orchards) {{in order to get}} maximum information about it. Simple band dendrometers measuring seasonal dynamics of stem growth have been already applied for many years, being gradually replaced by their more sophisticated electronic versions most recently. The sap flow is a suitable variable, because it links roots and crowns and provide information about transporting the largest amount of mass in plants, which can be decisive for their behavior. Following pioneering work in the last century (Huber, 1932), many types of sap flow measurement methods based on a variety of principles (e. g., thermodynamic, electric, magneto-hydrodynamic, nuclear magnetic resonance, etc.) have been described. Only a few of these, particularly those based on thermodynamics, have been widely used in field-grown trees. E. g., heat pulse velocity system developed by Green (1998) and Cohen et al. (1981). Heat ratio method also works with pulses, but interpreted the data in more sophisticated way (Burgess, 2001). Widely used is a simple heat-dissipation method (Granier, 1985). Direct electric heating and <b>internal</b> <b>sensing</b> of temperature was applied in the trunk heat balance method (Čermák et al., 1973, 1976, 1982, 2004; Kučera et al., 1977; Tatarinov et al., 2005). The heat field deformation method is based on measurement of the deformation of the heat field around a needle-like linear heater (Nadezhdina et al., 1998, 2002, 2006; Čermák et al., 2004). Another important variable is water potential, which could be measured in the past only periodically on selected pieces of plant material using pressure (Scholander) bomb, but most recently also continuous measurements became possible due to application of psychrometric method (Dixon and Tyree, 1985). There exist also other physical variables carrying important information, which can be measured using different principles. This includes e. g., acoustic methods, which can detect quantitative variation of pulses occurring during cavitation events, associated with interruptions of water columns in vessels. This must not necessarily be a single source of acoustic emissions. In this study we are focused on a general description of acoustic events measurable {{in a wide range of}} their spectrum. The first aim was to detect such signals and the second to learn them and gradually analyze in order to better understand the associated processes causing their occurrence and their relations to plant life...|$|E
