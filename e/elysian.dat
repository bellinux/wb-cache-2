5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The <b>Elysian</b> fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E
5|$|To {{connect the}} {{proposed}} parkway with downtown Los Angeles, that city improved and extended North Figueroa Street as a four-lane {{road to the}} Los Angeles River, allowing drivers to bypass the congested North Broadway Bridge on the existing but underutilized Riverside Drive Bridge. A {{large part of the}} project lay within <b>Elysian</b> Park, and four Art Deco tunnels were built through the hills. The first three, between Solano Avenue and the river, opened in late 1931, and the fourth opened in mid-1936, completing the extension of Figueroa Street to Riverside Drive. As with the contemporary Ramona Boulevard east from downtown, grade separations were mostly built only where terrain dictated. For Figueroa Street, this meant that all crossings except College Street (built several years after the extension was completed), where a hill was cut through, were at grade. The Figueroa Street Viaduct, connecting the Riverside Drive intersection with North Figueroa Street (then Dayton Avenue) across the Los Angeles River, opened in mid-1937. Closer to downtown, an interchange was built at Temple Street in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Jagger {{has also}} had an {{intermittent}} acting career, most well-known {{for his role in}} Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's Performance (1968), and as Australian bushranger Ned Kelly (1970). He composed an improvised soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film Invocation of My Demon Brother on the Moog synthesiser in 1969. Jagger auditioned for the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the 1975 film adaptation of The Rocky Horror Show, a role that was eventually played by Tim Curry the original performer from its run on London's West End. The same year he was approached by director Alejandro Jodorowsky {{to play the role of}} Feyd-Rautha in Jodorowsky's proposed adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, but the movie never made it to the screen. Jagger appeared as himself in the Rutles' film All You Need Is Cash in 1978 and was cast as Wilbur, a main character in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, in the late 1970s. However, the illness of main actor Jason Robards (later replaced by Klaus Kinski), and a delay in the film's notoriously difficult production, resulted in him being unable to continue due to schedule conflicts with a band tour; some footage of Jagger's work is shown in the documentaries Burden of Dreams and My Best Fiend. In 1983 he starred in Faerie Tale Theatre's The Nightingale as the emperor. Jagger developed a reputation for playing the heavy later in his acting career in films including Freejack (1992), Bent (1997), and The Man From <b>Elysian</b> Fields (2002).|$|E
5|$|The six-lane Arroyo Seco Parkway (part of State Route 110) {{begins at}} the Four Level Interchange, a {{symmetrical}} stack interchange {{on the north side}} of downtown Los Angeles that connects the Pasadena (SR 110 north), Harbor (SR 110 south), Hollywood (US 101 north), and Santa Ana (US 101 south) Freeways. The first interchange is with the north end of Figueroa Street at Alpine Street, and the freeway then meets the north end of Hill Street at a complicated junction that provides access to Dodger Stadium. Beyond Hill Street, SR 110 temporarily widens to four northbound and five southbound lanes as it enters the hilly <b>Elysian</b> Park, where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges. One interchange, with Solano Avenue and Amador Street, is located between the first and second tunnels. Just beyond the last tunnel is a northbound left exit and corresponding southbound right entrance for Riverside Drive and the northbound Golden State Freeway (I-5). Immediately after those ramps, the Arroyo Seco Parkway crosses a pair of three-lane bridges over the Los Angeles River just northwest of its confluence with the Arroyo Seco, one rail line on each bank, and Avenue 19 and San Fernando Road on the north bank. A single onramp from San Fernando Road joins SR 110 northbound as it passes under I-5, and a northbound left exit and southbound right entrance connect to the north segment of Figueroa Street. Here the original 1940 freeway, mostly built along the west bank of the Arroyo Seco, begins as the southbound lanes curve from their 1943 alignment over the Los Angeles River into the original alignment next to the northbound lanes.|$|E
25|$|The department's {{training}} division has three facilities throughout the city, including <b>Elysian</b> Park, Ahmanson Recruit Training Center (Westchester), and the Edward Davis Training Center (Granada Hills).|$|E
25|$|Original {{plans for}} the French Quarter Rail Expansion called for the line to extend to Press Street, {{and to have a}} branch {{extending}} from St. Claude via <b>Elysian</b> Fields Avenue to connect with the Riverfront line at the foot of <b>Elysian</b> Fields and Esplanade Avenues, but those extensions have not been funded. A future extension is projected down St. Claude Avenue past Press Street to Poland Avenue, next to the Industrial Canal. This would require crossing the Norfolk Southern Railroad at Press Street, which the railroad opposes on safety grounds.|$|E
25|$|The buyers {{were two}} Chicago-based entities, <b>Elysian</b> Worldwide LLC and Lodging Capital Partners LLC (LCP), headed by David Pisor, {{owner of the}} <b>Elysian,</b> Chicago. They hired RockResorts, a {{subsidiary}} of Vail Resorts, owner of the Vail Ski Resort, Aspen's principal competitor in that area, to manage the Jerome. To finance the purchase they took out a mortgage with Morgan Stanley. The note later became the property of Lehman Brothers. When that firm went bankrupt in 2008 {{as a result of}} that year's financial crisis, a new entity, Jerome Property LLC, emerged as the holder of the debt.|$|E
25|$|Anson Jones Elementary School {{served a}} portion of Downtown until its closing in Summer 2006. Anson Jones opened in 1892 as the <b>Elysian</b> Street School; its first campus was {{destroyed}} in a fire, and that was replaced in 1893 with a three-story building at 914 <b>Elysian</b> {{in what is now}} Downtown. It was named after Anson Jones in 1902. In the 1950s many students resided in Clayton Homes and the students were majority Hispanic and Latino. In 1962 it had 609 students. Anson Jones moved to a new campus in the Second Ward in 1966, and its original campus in Downtown was demolished.|$|E
25|$|Is to {{the east}} of the <b>Elysian</b> Fields, also known as The Eastern Garden. This area of the gardens was {{developed}} in the 1730s & 1740s, an open area surrounded by some of the larger buildings.|$|E
25|$|The Arroyo Seco then {{proceeds}} {{through the}} Los Angeles neighborhoods of Highland Park, Hermon, Montecito Heights, and Cypress Park. It {{ends at the}} confluence with the Los Angeles River near <b>Elysian</b> Park, north of Dodger Stadium and Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|In Classical Greek Mythology, {{the section}} of Hades known as the Fields of Asphodel were a realm much {{resembling}} Limbo, to which {{the vast majority of}} people who were held to have deserved neither the <b>Elysian</b> Fields (Heaven) nor Tartarus (Hell) were consigned for eternity.|$|E
25|$|The Doric Arch {{of stone}} erected in 1768 for {{the visit of}} Princess Amelia, {{probably}} {{to the design of}} Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford, is a simple arch flanked by fluted Doric pilasters, with an elaborate entablature with triglyphs and carved metopes supporting a tall attic. This leads to the <b>Elysian</b> fields.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{accounts}} of Roman mythology describe the soul as immortal and judged at death before a tribunal in the underworld, {{with those who}} had done good {{being sent to the}} <b>Elysian</b> Fields and those who had done ill sent to Tartarus. It is unclear how ancient such beliefs were, as they seem influenced by Greek mythology and mystery cults.|$|E
25|$|Dialogues of the Dead was {{a series}} of critiques about eighteenth century society. In Dialogue 26, Montagu uses Hercules to engage in a {{discussion}} of virtue. In Dialogue 27, a character, Mrs. Mopish, cannot go the <b>Elysian</b> Fields because she is endlessly distracted by worldly influences. In Dialogue 28, a bookseller explains to Plutarch the difficulties of publishing in modern society.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the great}} epics of European {{literature}} include episodes that occur in Hell. In the Roman poet Virgil's Latin epic, the Aeneid, Aeneas descends into Dis (the underworld) to visit his father's spirit. The underworld is only vaguely described, with one unexplored path leading to the punishments of Tartarus, while the other leads through Erebus and the <b>Elysian</b> Fields.|$|E
25|$|Creighton was {{considered}} a prominent member of the cricket community, playing both amateur and professional. He performed for the American Cricket Club in both 1861and 1862, often playing against the all-England team, whether at the <b>Elysian</b> Fields or elsewhere. Though the English teams would dominate these matches, Creighton fared well. In an 1859match of 11Englishmen against 16Americans, he clean bowled five wickets out of six successive balls.|$|E
25|$|Andy Manson is {{a custom}} guitar maker (luthier). For almost five decades Manson has been hand {{crafting}} guitars, mandolins and multi-necked instruments. Over the years Manson {{has achieved a}} reputation as one of England's finest luthiers and one of the world's finest makers of flat-top acoustic guitars, and his influence can be seen in many other makers' work including Hugh's and Brook Guitars and other small makers such as , <b>Elysian</b> Acoustics and Gary Nava.|$|E
25|$|Jerome Property soon {{filed for}} {{foreclosure}} against the two owners, citing nonpayment of the $36 million balance remaining. LCP and <b>Elysian</b> at first contested the filing, {{saying that they}} had not defaulted, but later a sale was approved. LCP-Elysian conveyed the trust deed, with which it had originally collateralized the loan, to Jerome Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of its creditor, in exchange for the forgiveness of the remaining debt in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In 1731 William Kent was {{appointed}} to work with Bridgeman, whose last designs are dated 1735 after which Kent took over as the garden designer. Kent had already created the glorious garden at Rousham House, and he and Gibbs built temples, bridges, and other garden structures. Kent's masterpiece at Stowe is the <b>Elysian</b> Fields with its Temple of Ancient Virtue that looks across to his Temple of British Worthies. Kent's architectural work was in the newly fashionable Palladian style.|$|E
25|$|The Rampart–St. Claude Streetcar Line {{opened on}} January 28, 2013 as the Loyola-UPT Line running along Loyola Avenue from New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal to Canal Street, then {{continuing}} along Canal Street to the river, {{and on weekends}} on the Riverfront line tracks to French Market. The French Quarter Rail Expansion extended the line from the Loyola Avenue/Canal Street intersection along Rampart Street and St. Claude Avenue to <b>Elysian</b> Fields Avenue. It no longer runs along Canal Street to the river, or on weekends on the Riverfront line tracks to French Market.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese House {{is known}} to date from 1738 making it the first known {{building}} in England built in the Chinese style. It is made of wood and painted on canvas inside and out by Francesco Sleter. Originally it was on stilts in a pond near the <b>Elysian</b> Fields. In 1750 it was moved from Stowe and was purchased by the National Trust in 1996 and returned and placed in its present position. The Chinoiserie Garden Pavilion at Hamilton Gardens in New Zealand {{is based on the}} Chinese House.|$|E
25|$|Many of the city's {{buildings}} {{are in the}} Georgian style, although {{there are a number}} of examples of modern landmark structures, such as County Hall tower, which was, at one time the tallest building in Ireland until being superseded by another Cork City building: The <b>Elysian.</b> Outside the County Hall is the landmark sculpture of two men, known locally as 'Cha and Miah'. Across the river from County Hall is Ireland's longest building; built in Victorian times, Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital has now been renovated and converted into a residential housing complex called Atkins Hall, after its architect William Atkins.|$|E
25|$|She {{was renamed}} Grand Victoria after Pelorus placed her under the {{management}} of <b>Elysian</b> Cruise Lines. She was chartered by them to Metropolis Tur {{until the end of}} 2006. In 2007 she was chartered to Blue Monarch Shipping Inc and renamed Blue Monarch. Under their ownership she carried out 3, 4 and 7 night cruises to Greek islands. Blue Monarch Shipping attempted to purchase her in 2008, but could not come up with the $8 million required. Her charter continued until she ended service in early 2009, when it was realized that she did not meet SOLAS 2010 standards.|$|E
25|$|On July 10, 1969, a {{group of}} boys riding their Schwinn Sting-Ray {{bicycles}} in Palms Park in West Los Angeles wanted to race. A park attendant, Ronald Mackler, a teenager with motorcycle motocross (MX) experience, helped them organize. Palms Park became to BMX as <b>Elysian</b> Fields is to American baseball, for at that moment Bicycle Motocross racing was born. By 1973, entrance fees of US$4.50 (which included a US$1.00 insurance fee for the year) for a 10-week season of Thursday-night racing was charged, and the top three racers in the season were given trophies. Then a new season of 10 weeks would start the following Thursday.|$|E
25|$|Ranney, who adored the rural, marshy {{lands that}} typified {{the area in}} the 19th century, also enjoyed fishing. Among the fellow artists and {{residents}} he befriended were Hoboken founding father Colonel John Stevens III, who organized the first ferry system between New York and Hoboken. As Ranney was an avid cricket player, {{he was one of the}} founders of New York Cricket Club, and one of its top scorers. The club met at the <b>Elysian</b> Fields in Hoboken. He also played Hoboken's Fox Hill, which today is Columbus Park, and the high school field between 9th and 11th streets on Grand Street. Ranney played cricket until 1854.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1950s, Brooklyn Dodgers team {{president}} Walter O'Malley {{had tried to}} build a domed stadium in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, {{but was unable to}} reach an agreement with city officials for the land acquisition, and eventually reached a deal with the city of Los Angeles. The land for Dodger Stadium was purchased from local owners and inhabitants in the early 1950s by the city of Los Angeles using eminent domain with funds from the Federal Housing Act of 1949. The city had planned to develop the <b>Elysian</b> Park Heights public housing project, which included two dozen 13-story buildings and more than 160 two-story townhouses, in addition to newly rebuilt playgrounds and schools, and a college.|$|E
25|$|As {{a private}} citizen for the time being, Frank attends a meeting of {{powerful}} men at a secret society known as <b>Elysian</b> Fields, {{in an effort to}} secure their influence for votes in the upcoming special election. Meanwhile, Conway has a mental breakdown on his private plane due to feeling that the election was stolen from him. Eventually, this and other leaks from his campaign are slowly dripped to the media in a manner that seems unconnected to the Underwoods. Seeing that his candidate is losing, Conway's campaign manager, Mark Usher, switches sides to the Underwoods. The Underwood ticket wins both Ohio and Tennessee, and Frank is sworn in as president and Claire as vice president.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} American {{designed}} art deco church at Turner's Cross in 1927, Irish architecture followed the international trend towards modern and sleek building styles since the 20th century. Recent developments include the regeneration of Ballymun and an urban extension of Dublin at Adamstown. Since {{the establishment of}} the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in 1997, the Dublin Docklands area underwent large-scale redevelopment, which included the construction of the Convention Centre Dublin and Grand Canal Theatre. Completed in 2008, the <b>Elysian</b> tower in Cork is the tallest storeyed building in the Republic of Ireland (the Obel Tower in Belfast, Northern Ireland being the tallest in Ireland), at a height of , surpassing Cork County Hall. The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland regulates the practice of architecture in the state.|$|E
25|$|Much later, on {{the ruined}} world of Adeki, the Seventh Doctor {{found one of}} several Gwanzulums, beings who used their shapeshifting powers to pass {{themselves}} off {{as some of the}} Doctor's past companions, including Katarina. Before he realized the ruse, the false Katarina tried to have him take her off the planet. Later, Ace comes across the ghost of Katarina {{in the form of an}} eternally frozen girl of ice, in the Doctor's guilty mind. In Katarina's afterlife, she finds herself without a coin and unable to cross the River Styx. However, due to the intervention of the Doctor (or her idea of him), she found her way not only to Asphodel where all souls who had done neither good nor evil would go, but to the <b>Elysian</b> Fields, the abode of the blessed.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Greek {{religion}} {{a number}} {{of men and women}} were made physically immortal as they were resurrected from the dead. Asclepius was killed by Zeus, only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. Achilles, after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis and resurrected, brought to an immortal existence in either Leuce, <b>Elysian</b> plains or the Islands of the Blessed. Memnon, who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. Alcmene, Castor, Heracles, and Melicertes, were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to Herodotus's Histories, the seventh century BC sage Aristeas of Proconnesus was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.|$|E

500|$|A passage by Moschus, {{describes}} fragrant narcissi. [...] Homer [...] in his Odyssey {{described the}} underworld as having <b>Elysian</b> meadows carpeted with flowers, {{thought to be}} narcissus, as described by Theophrastus. A similar account is provided by Lucian describing the flowers in the underworld. The myth of the youth Narcissus is also taken up by Pausanias. He believed that the myth of Persephone long antedated that of Narcissus, and hence discounts the idea the flower was named after the youth.|$|E
500|$|Another of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "Tribal Gathering", was, for many years, assumed to {{have been inspired by}} the , a counter-culture happening held in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park on January 12, 1967. However, in recent years, Crosby has revealed that the song was actually inspired by another hippie gathering held at <b>Elysian</b> Park near Los Angeles on March 26, 1967. Played in a jazzy, 5/4 time signature, the song's vocal arrangement was greatly influenced by the music of the Four Freshmen, a vocal group that Crosby had admired as a youngster.|$|E

The name Beaconsfield, a town near Hughenden, also was given to a minor character in Vivian Grey. Disraeli made various statements about his elevation, writing to Selina, Lady Bradford on 8 August 1876, [...] "I am quite tired of that place [...] " [...] but when asked by a friend how he liked the Lords, replied, [...] "I am dead; dead but in the <b>Elysian</b> fields." ...|$|E
500|$|Adams hit left-handed; he {{said that}} his batted balls {{occasionally}} went into a river by the <b>Elysian</b> Fields, the ground in Hoboken, New Jersey, where the Knickerbockers practiced and played. Adams had a long on-field career with the Knickerbockers; he remained a player with the team until 1859. He did not limit his play to shortstop; he fielded at every position except pitcher. Little is known about the relative performance of early baseball players, and the game was largely recreational, as opposed to competitive. Thorn speculates that Adams may have been [...] "the best player of the 1840s", citing his lengthy playing career as evidence.|$|E
