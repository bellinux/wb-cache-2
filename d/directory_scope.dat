40|$|This report {{includes}} both a directory of instructional materials {{to support the}} senior high school history program and a section discussing how the guide was constructed. Included in this latter section are references to relative literature, discussion of need for the <b>directory,</b> <b>scope</b> of the directory and procedures followed in its construction. [...] The directory itself is presented in an appendix. The first section is a general introduction to the directory explaining general limitations and applications and giving general recommendations as the locale for the included materials. The purpose of the directory is to enable educators in Newfoundland at the senior high level to choose instructional materials which will support the history curriculum. All materials included I the directory have been recommended by reviews, selection aids, or teachers. [...] The directory is intended solely {{as a guide to}} instructional materials which can support the teaching of the senior high history program. [...] It will be necessary to up-date the directory annually to ensure maximum effectiveness. A revision which would include materials presently excluded would increase the utility of the list. A directory of historical fiction to supplement senior high history would also serve a useful function in the history curriculum...|$|E
