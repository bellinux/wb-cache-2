When farm production falls short of the processing capacity of the cooperative, in fact, there occurs an increase in the average <b>fixed</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> and, ceteris paribus, a reduction in the price paid to the members. However, cooperatives for the processing, storage and marketing of agricultural products may also perform an active role in mitigating the members’ production risk. By means of the area yield insurance contract, cooperatives are able to mitigate the systemic component of their members’ production risk, thereby increasing efficiency. The aim {{of this paper is to}} set out the model of the area yield insurance contract and to explain the possible contribution of the processing, storage and marketing cooperative to removing information asymmetry. Cooperatives usually comprise a great deal of information about the members’ production: quantities produced, crop areas and varieties cultivated, production quality, price levels. This valuable stock of information relative to the productions of the members over the years can be managed by the cooperative without significant transaction costs in order to remedy certain weaknesses in the area crop insurance contract. When processing, storage and marketing cooperatives form a territorial system, the area yield insurance contract can be enhanced with a two-stage specification so as to benefit from both the information possessed by the cooperatives and from the organizational role of the consortium...|$|R

A good solution would be the use of a high conductive carrier, able to redistribute the heat of reaction along the catalyst bed.

40|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> draw a sharp {{distinction}} between endogenous growth based on {{horizontal and vertical}} innovation: {{a larger number of}} product lines puts pressure on an economy’s resources; greater productivity of existing product lines does not. Consequently, the only plausible engine of endogenous growth is vertical innovation whereby progress along the quality or cost ladder does not require the replication of fixed costs. Is, then, product variety expansion irrelevant? No. The two dimensions of technology are complementary in that using one and the other produces a more comprehensive theory of economic growth. The vertical dimension allows endogenous growth unconstrained by endowments, the horizontal provides the mechanism that translates changes in aggregate variables into changes in product-level variables, which ultimately drive incentives to push the technological frontier in the vertical dimension. We show that the potential for exponential growth due to an externality that makes entry costs fall linearly with the number of products, combined with the limited carrying capacity of the system due to <b>fixed</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs,</b> yields logistic dynamics for the number of products.

40|$|As {{the energy}} demand is {{increasing}} constantly, sustainable energy resources {{are needed to}} meet this demand and enable economic stability. In order to attain this goal, researchers continue to develop new technologies and methods {{in the field of}} sustainable energy. Over the last decade, the U. S has witnessed substantial growth in shale gas production. Consequently, shale gas has become a competitive feedstock for usage as energy and production of chemicals and petrochemicals. A valuable product which may be obtained from shale gas is dimethyl ether (DME). Dimethyl ether can be used in many areas such as power generation, transportation fuel, and domestic heating and cooking. Dimethyl ether is currently produced from natural gas, coal and biomass through synthesis gas as an intermediate. Recently, the attention to DME has increased because of its potential in addressing energy security and environmental problems. DME is produced conventionally through two steps (indirect process) which are methanol synthesis and dehydration of the methanol to DME. Another way to produce DME is the direct synthesis of DME from syngas. In order to use DME as a fuel alternative, it must be produced at low cost in large quantities. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a process synthesis, simulation, and integration of a shale gas-to-DME plant by direct and indirect methods. Techno-economic analysis is carried out to assess the profitability of the base-case processes under current market conditions. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to evaluate the process profitability under variable market conditions. Finally, the both methods are compared in terms of the <b>fixed</b> capital <b>cost,</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost,</b> return on investment, and CO_(2) and water impact. Indirect and direct process simulation of commercial DME plant was carried out by Aspen Plus. The shale gas feedstock was taken from one of the wells in Barnett shale play. The DME production capacities of the base cases for the direct and indirect processes were set to 3, 250 tonnes per day. The direct and indirect process flowsheets were synthesized using five and seven main processing steps, respectively. Pinch analysis was used to conduct heat integration of the process. As a result of study, it was found that the direct method has advantage over the indirect method in terms of the <b>fixed</b> capital <b>cost,</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost,</b> return on investment, and CO_(2) impact. The capital investment of the direct production method is 25 % less than the indirect method. The direct method is more economically attractive than the indirect method. When a sensitivity analysis is considered, the prices of methanol and shale gas are the most important factors impacting the <b>operating</b> <b>cost.</b> The contribution of energy integration on the ROI of the direct method is approximately 2. 25 %. The ROI of the indirect method is improved by 1. 83 % after energy integration. In contrast to the other criteria, the indirect way has significant advantage over the direct way by producing almost 1760 ton/d water. The direct method produces less CO_(2) emission than the indirect method because it uses dry reforming to convert CO_(2) to syngas...|$|R
