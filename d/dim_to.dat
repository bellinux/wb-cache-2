5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light years) away from Earth. It has an {{apparent}} magnitude (V) of 8.22, making the star too <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> see from Earth {{with the naked}} eye. The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived with the naked eye, which has an apparent magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest. The star's actual brightness is measured with an absolute magnitude of 4.12, {{similar to that of}} the Sun.|$|E
5|$|A curved line {{of stars}} {{comprising}} Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Beta, Nu and Gamma Phoenicis {{was seen as}} a boat by the ancient Arabs. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and designated 27 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Omega in 1756. Of these, he labelled two stars close together Lambda, and assigned Omicron, Psi and Omega to three stars, which subsequent astronomers such as Benjamin Gould felt were too <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> warrant their letters. A different star was subsequently labelled Psi Phoenicis, while the other two designations fell out of use.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E

50|$|The {{spectral}} output peaks at 510 nanometres, {{giving the}} light a greenish hue. The {{correlated color temperature}} is about 6,000 kelvins with a CRI of 79. The lamp can be <b>dimmed</b> <b>to</b> 15% without affecting the light quality.|$|R
25|$|In 1959, Joel S. Spira, {{who would}} found the Lutron Electronics Company in 1961, invented a dimmer {{based on a}} diode and a tapped autotransformer, saving energy and {{allowing}} the <b>dimmer</b> <b>to</b> be installed in a standard electrical wallbox.|$|R
5|$|It is safe {{to observe}} the total phase of a solar eclipse {{directly}} only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality. During this period, the Sun is too <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, and possibly even a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and {{on the opposite side}} of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R {{as close as possible}} to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face of the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> accurately measure.|$|E
5|$|Using {{a program}} called Blendanal, similar to the Blender {{technique}} used to verify the planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light curve and radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a bright star and a binary star in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star whose secondary companion is too <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated that the planet HAT-P-33b did indeed exist.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{technique}} called <b>dimming</b> <b>to</b> improve the energy efficiency of cellular networks {{by reducing the}} capacity, services, and energy consumption of cells without turning off the cells. We define three basic methods <b>to</b> <b>dim</b> the network: coverage, frequency, and service dimming. We construct a multi-time period optimization problem <b>to</b> implement frequency <b>dimming</b> and extend it to implement both frequency and service dimming together.

5|$|At the Carnegie Institution, Rubin {{began work}} {{related to her}} {{controversial}} thesis regarding galaxy clusters with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford's image-tube spectrograph. This instrument allowed Rubin to amplify starlight seen through the telescope so they could view astronomical objects that were previously too <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> see. The Rubin–Ford effect, an apparent anisotropy in {{the expansion of the}} Universe on the scale of 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its brightness and proximity to Earth. First appearing in journals in 1976, the idea of peculiar motion on this scale in the universe was a highly controversial proposition, dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid. The effect is now known as large scale streaming. The pair also briefly studied quasars, which had been discovered in 1963 and were a popular topic of research.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod {{is longer}} than the typical Potter tale with 16 colour {{illustrations}} {{and a series of}} 42 black and white drawings, one illustration per page. The illustrations depict the wider landscape of Near Sawrey: Bull Banks, Oatmeal Crag, and Esthwaite Water. The interior of Mr. Tod's house provided the opportunity to present details of the interiors of village homes. In the frontispiece, Mr. Tod stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of muntin and plank construction (interlocking thick and thin vertical panels) covered with a sage-green limewash. A tea caddy, a silver salt, and blue and white willow china decorate his kitchen. The beehive-shaped brick oven was drawn from the one at the Sun Inn in Hawkshead and serves as a place for Brock to hide the bunnies. Emphatic frames in the black and white illustrations give the impression of woodcuts. Potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back the distance. Potter made the kitchen <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> eliminate some detail of the battle between Tod and Brock.|$|E
5|$|Zeta Persei is the third-brightest {{star in the}} {{constellation}} at magnitude 2.86. Around 750 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white supergiant 26–27 times the radius of the Sun and 47,000 times its luminosity. It is the brightest star (as seen from Earth) of a moving group of bright blue-white giant and supergiant stars, the Perseus OB2 Association or Zeta Persei Association. Zeta is a triple star system, with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, {{that may or may}} not be gravitationally bound to the other two. X Persei is a double system in this association; one component is a hot, bright star and the other is a neutron star. With an apparent magnitude of 6.72, it is too <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> be seen with the naked eye even in perfectly dark conditions. The system is an X-ray source and the primary star appears to be undergoing substantial mass loss. Once thought to be a member of the Perseus OB2 Association, Omicron Persei is a multiple star system with a combined visual magnitude of 3.85. It is composed of two blue-white starsa giant of spectral class B1.5 and main sequence star of B3which orbit each other every 4.5 days and are distorted into ovoids due to their small separation. The system has a third star about which little is known. At an estimated distance of 1475 light-years from Earth, the system is now thought to lie too far from the center of the Zeta Persei group to belong to it.|$|E
50|$|A {{stage pin}} {{connector}} (SPC), or grounded stage pin (GSP), is a connector used {{primarily in the}} theatre industry for stage lighting applications in the United States.

25|$|Neptune is too <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> {{be visible}} to the naked eye: its {{apparent}} magnitude is never brighter than 7.7. Therefore, the first observations of Neptune were only possible after the invention of the telescope. There is evidence that Neptune was seen and recorded by Galileo Galilei in 1613, Jérôme Lalande in 1795 and John Herschel in 1830, but none is known to have recognized it as a planet at the time. These pre-discovery observations were important in accurately determining the orbit of Neptune. Neptune would appear prominently even in early telescopes so other pre-discovery observation records are likely.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally theatre {{and stage}} {{lighting}} {{has been of}} the [...] "generic" [...] type.

30|$|This {{scenario}} {{assumes that}} the lights can be <b>dimmed</b> <b>to</b> any PPF between 0 and 200 μmoles m−[*] 2  s−[*] 1, {{and the relationship between}} energy use and PPF is linear between 0 and 600 W. At its peak, adaptive lighting consumes the same energy as non-adaptive lighting. We use these parameters for the simulation.|$|R
25|$|Most {{theatrical}} lamps are tungsten-halogen (or quartz-halogen), {{an improvement}} {{on the original}} incandescent design that used halogen gas instead of an inert gas. Fluorescent lights are rarely used other than as work lights (see below). Although they are far more efficient, they cannot be dimmed (run at less than full power) without using specialized dimmers, cannot <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> very low levels, do not produce light from a single point or easily concentrated area, and have a warm-up period during which they emit no light or do so intermittently. High-intensity discharge lamps (or HID lamps) are now common where a very bright light output is required, for example in large follow spots, HMI (hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide) floods, and modern automated fixtures. Because these types of lamps cannot be electrically dimmed, dimming is done by mechanical dousers or shutters that physically block portions of the lamp to decrease output. Some specially-designed fittings now use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a light source. LEDs are ideal where an intense but unfocused light source is required, such as for lighting a cyclorama.|$|E
500|$|The {{exterior}} of the building was also radically changed. The celebrated key visual feature of the building, its exterior vertical white marble ribbing, was completely removed after it {{was found to be}} bowed from age and weather. Although this fundamentally changed the nature of Durrell's building, there was almost no public outcry. It was replaced by an energy-efficient, all-glass facade. Perhaps the most significant renovation feature was the structure's use of a chilled beam HVAC system, which uses chilled or heated water circulated in strategically placed columns in the interior space to cool and warm the building. To test the efficiency of the chilled beam technology, the system was installed in the penthouse of the building and tested for a full year. The architect agreed to use the system after the test outperformed specifications. The installation represented the first large-scale use of the chilled beam technology in the United States. Other energy-saving enhancements included motion and daylight detectors to turn lights off when not needed, and special exterior windows which automatically <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> prevent daytime heating. The building's ventilation system was also upgraded. The renovation left the structure with [...] of interior space. The final cost of the renovation was pegged at $250 million.|$|E
500|$|Sedna has {{the longest}} orbital period of any known {{object in the}} Solar System of {{comparable}} size or larger, calculated at around 11,400 years.

When Sedna was discovered it was 89.6AU from the Sun approaching perihelion, and was the most distant object in the Solar System observed. Eris was later detected by the same survey near aphelion at 97AU. The orbits of some long-period comets extend farther than that of Sedna; they are too <b>dim</b> <b>to</b> be discovered except when approaching perihelion in the inner Solar System. Even as Sedna nears its perihelion in mid 2076, the Sun would appear merely as an extremely bright star-like pinpoint in its sky, 100 times brighter than a full moon on Earth (for comparison, the Sun appears from Earth to be roughly 400,000 times brighter than the full Moon), and {{too far away to}} be visible as a disc to the naked eye.|$|E
