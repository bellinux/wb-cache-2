On October 18, the nearby Fort Chambly <b>fell,</b> <b>and</b> on October 30, an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted.

40|$|Major {{suppliers}} of teak wood for {{the raw material}} of furniture industry in Indonesia are Perum Perhutani, community forests, and private forests.   Community teak forest management produce roundwood or squarewood, in which squarewood is produced on the felling site {{by the use of}} chainsaw after <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> bucking activities. Utilization of teak wood from community forest has been practiced for decades, however information on the extent of utilization and the quantity of wood waste have not been published to a greater extent. The present research was intended to determine and analyze the extent of utilization and teak wood waste produced from <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> bucking, and on-site squarewood production of community forests.   Quantification of wood waste from <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> bucking was based on the whole tree method, while that of squarewood production was based on the percentage of yield. It was found that the quantity of teak <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> bucking wood waste in community forest was reaching 28 % of felled wood volume that consisted of branch and twig (46. 15 %), upper trunk (30. 77 %), short cut off (15. 38 %), and stumps (7. 69 %). The largest part of the wood waste of teak <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> bucking satisfied the requirement as raw material of wood working industry according to Indonesian National Standard. On-site production of squarewood increased the quantity of wood waste in the forests (in the form of slabs and sawdust). Keywords: wood waste, felling, bucking, squarewood, community fores...|$|R

5|$|In May 1969, {{discontent with}} Krieger's {{economic}} policies led to riots {{in the cities}} of Corrientes, Rosario and Córdoba. Krieger was removed, but the Onganía administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy. By 1970, the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints, leading to a wage-price spiral. As the economy started to languish and import substitution industrialization ran out of steam, urban migration slowed. Per capita income <b>fell,</b> <b>and</b> with it the standard of living.

At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey.

This number possibly also includes Byzantine troops placed under Cutzinas' command as well. During the campaign, Cutzinas and the other Berber leaders were crucial in suppressing a near-mutiny of the Byzantine troops due to Antalas' scorched earth strategy. The Berbers' steadfast support enabled Troglita to overcome the crisis and lead his army against the forces of Carcasan and Antalas. Cutzinas fought in the ensuing Battle of the Fields of Cato, which was a decisive Byzantine victory: Carcasan <b>fell,</b> <b>and</b> the Berber revolt was crushed as Antalas and the surviving leaders submitted to Troglita.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of rationalized thinning technology in beech coppice stands was studied. Three basic methods of thinning: schematic, selection and combined method were analyzed. In {{the framework of}} each of the above thinning methods, different thinning varieties were designed, differing by the degree of crosscutting, width of gathering lines and their distance. The applied method of <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> crosscutting is the whole tree method or log method, and the form of work organization (1 M+ 1 R). The <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> crosscutting are characterized by two key work operations: directed <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> manual collection of the felled wood material. Manual collection is made significantly easier by the correct selection of tree felling direction which in turn affects significantly the rationalization of the entire thinning process...|$|R
