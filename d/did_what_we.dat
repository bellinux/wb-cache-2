500|$|Despite his defeat, American Pharoah {{was moved}} up to Grade I class for the Del Mar Futurity over seven furlongs on September 3. He was ridden by Victor Espinoza {{for the first time}} and started as the 3.2–1 second {{favorite}} behind Best Pal Stakes winner Skyway, with Calculator and Iron Fist also in the field. American Pharoah took the lead from the start and went clear in the straight to win by four and three quarter lengths from Calculator, with a gap of more than eight lengths back to Iron Fist in third. Commenting on the colt's improvement, Baffert said, [...] "We took the blinkers off, put cotton in his ears and schooled him a lot. He trained well, we decided he was ready and we put him in there. Today, he behaved himself and showed what he could do. He <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> thought he'd do the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} songs that was {{recorded}} for the album was [...] "Fantasy". While Carey began developing new ideas for Daydream, {{she thought of the}} song [...] "Genius of Love" [...] by Tom Tom Club. She had always been a fan of the song, and presented Dave Hall with the idea of sampling the song's hook. Hall incorporated a groove that he felt complimented Carey's voice, while she composed some of the other beats and wrote the lyrics. Carey recorded a remix to the song as well, featuring hip-hop verses from O.D.B of the Wu-Tang Clan, as well as production from Puffy. She spoke highly of the remix, complimenting Puffy and O.D.B, [...] "He's so known in the street, and he's one of the best people out there...we kind of <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> both do and having O.D.B took it to another level. He was my ultimate choice, so I was really happy with the way it turned out." [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] was a song that Carey wrote with the R group Boyz II Men. After Carey's friend and past collaborator David Cole died, she began writing and developing a song that would pay homage to him and all the friends and family her fans had lost along life's journey. Carey had the chorus and concept composed, and after meeting with Boyz II Men, they realized they too had a similar idea in development. Together, using Carey's chorus and idea, as well as the melody they had produced, they wrote and composed the song. It was produced by Afanasieff, who built on the song's melody and added various grooves and beats.|$|E

[...] In the same statement, he called for a new form of international partnership with Haiti and other Caribbean nations and praised Venezuela, Brazil, and Cuba, for already accepting this partnership.|$|E
2500|$|During Brown's tenure, the {{magazine}} was honored with 4 George Polk Awards, 5 Overseas Press Club Awards, and 10 National Magazine Awards, including a 1995 award for General Excellence, the first in {{the magazine}}'s history. Newsstand sales rose 145 percent The New Yorkers circulation increased to 807,935 for the second half of 1997, up from 658,916 during the corresponding period in 1992. Critics maintained it was hemorrhaging money, but Newhouse remained supportive, viewing the magazine under Brown as a start-up (which routinely lose money): [...] "It was practically a new magazine. She added topicality, photography, color. She <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would have done if we invented the New Yorker from scratch. To do all that was costly. We knew it would be." [...] Under Brown, its economic fortunes improved every year: in 1995 losses were about $17 million, in 1996 $14 million, and in 1997 $11 million.|$|E
2500|$|In The Saturday Review, Max Beerbohm wrote, [...] "Lyrics {{written by}} gentlemen {{who have had}} no {{experience}} in the difficult art of writing words for music, and sung in a theatre which one associates with Mr. W. S. Gilbert, {{are not likely to}} charm the most amenable audience." [...] He said of Carr and Pinero, [...] "I am sure that the indisputable dulness of their Beauty Stone comes, mainly, from their pseudo-archaic manner." [...] Pinero commented, many years later: [...] "I doubt whether any of us had much faith in The Beauty Stone, as likely to attract the Savoy public in large numbers, but we – Sullivan, Carr and I – <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do; and, though it doesn't pay the butcher's bill, there lies the artist's reward." [...] Sullivan disagreed, hoping [...] "that one day The Beauty Stone may be revived, with about half the libretto ruthlessly cut away".|$|E

2500|$|In August 2014, {{when talking}} about the series in {{comparison}} to the 2003 film, Ted Sarandos said, [...] "The series will not be afraid to go darker than the film <b>did.</b> <b>What</b> <b>we</b> love about this particular set of heroes is that they're a little more down to Earth. Costume wise and also in that these are gritty crime stories, more in the streets than in the clouds." [...] Elaborating on this, DeKnight said, [...] "It is a little grittier and edgier than Marvel has gone before, but we're not looking to push it to extreme graphic violence, gratuitous nudity or anything like that. The story does not require that and I think [...] would suffer if you pushed it that far." [...] Marvel Television head and executive producer Loeb later stated that, [...] "There aren't going to be people flying through the sky; there are no magic hammers. We've always approached this as a crime drama first, superhero show second." [...] DeKnight took inspiration from The French Connection, Dog Day Afternoon, and Taxi Driver, and stated that [...] "we would rather lean toward The Wire than what's considered a classic superhero television show." ...|$|E
2500|$|Being {{the record}} a more {{developed}} and mature set of songs, [...] "Subject to Change" [...] also {{proved to be}} The Faith's swan song, as the group disbanded {{by the summer of}} 1983. Drummer Ivor Hanson announced he would soon leave for college. Finding a replacement was not an option. According to guitarist Mike Hampton, the rest of the band was having trouble getting along. [...] "It was a good time to stop, but I suppose it’s a shame that we flamed out before getting a solid tour set up and executed, but it’s also a wonder and a success that we <b>did</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did." [...] Alec declared that it was getting more difficult to be productive and creative together, although the end was also a beginning. After The Faith broke up, guitarist Eddie Janney formed Rites of Spring with Guy Picciotto; while Hampton, Bald, and Hanson went on to join Embrace with Ian MacKaye on vocals. When Embrace broke up in early 1986, Chris Bald rejoined Alec MacKaye in Ignition (with Alec on vocals;) meanwhile, Janney reunited with Michael Hampton for One Last Wish following Rites of Spring's breakup (later reformed as Happy Go Licky.) Finally, Hampton and Hanson reunited in Manifesto in 1991, while Alec MacKaye sang with The Warmers during the mid-'90s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on whether we can have reason to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are unable to do. I take as my starting point two papers recently published in Philosophical Studies, by Bart Streumer and Ulrike Heuer, which defend the two dominant opposing positions on this issue. Briefly, whereas Streumer argues that we cannot have reason to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are unable to do, Heuer argues {{that we can have}} reason to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are unable to do when we can get closer to success but cannot have reason to try to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are unable to do when we cannot get closer to success. In this paper, I reject both positions as they are presented, on the grounds that neither can accommodate an important category of reasons, which are the reasons to realise and to try to realise dimensions of value that lie at the boundary of what is realisable, specifically, genuinely valuable ideals. I defend a third view that we can have reason to do and to try to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are unable to do even when we cannot, in Heuer's sense, get closer to success. Moreover, I argue that we can have reason to realise and to try to realise genuinely valuable ideals for their own sake and not simply for the sake of achieving mundane, realisable ends...|$|R
