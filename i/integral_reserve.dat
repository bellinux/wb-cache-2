40|$|AbstractThe {{brown meagre}} Sciaena umbra, an iconic {{demersal}} fish species in Mediterranean coastal habitats, is {{particularly vulnerable to}} fishing pressure and presents a worrying population decline. Fish numbers and sizes were surveyed by visual census at Scandola (Corsica) in and outside reserve zones subject to increasing levels of protection, including unprotected zones (UP) where all fishing activities are permitted, buffer zones (BZ) subject to partial protection and a totally protected no-take <b>integral</b> <b>reserve</b> zone (IR). The numerical abundance, individual size and biomass of the brown meagre were found to increase with levels of reserve protection. The abundance of the larger size classes and the numbers of fish per shoal were significantly lower in unprotected zones. A comparison with similar censuses performed in 1983 showed a significant increase of S. umbra abundance in IR, but no difference in UP. That increasing levels of protection resulted in increased abundance and biomass of the brown meagre suggested a prominent role of fishing, particularly spearfishing, activities in the persistence of its low abundance in the unprotected zones. As a consequence, protective action for the brown meagre (including a ban on both spearfishing and recreational hook-and-line fishing) has been introduced in France since January 2014...|$|E

40|$|Fish assemblages inhabiting shallow rocky reefs at six Italian marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) were investigated to assess broad-scale patterns in assemblage structure, species richness and composition, and {{to evaluate the}} presence of a latitudinal gradient in the distribution pattern of a thermophilic fish, the ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo. Fish abundance was estimated by visual censuses carried out within the <b>integral</b> <b>reserve</b> zones, within the 1 [...] 7 m depth range and during four sampling periods. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in the assemblage structure among MPAs, although patterns of variation changed considerably {{from time to time and}} they were not consistent with latitudinal or longitudinal gradient. Fish assemblages of Miramare (northern Adriatic) and those of the other MPAs clearly separated into two groups. Multivariate differences among MPAs mainly relied upon some relatively common species (e. g. Diplodus puntazzo and Muraena helena). Substantial contribution to these differences was also accounted for by T. pavo. Significant differences among MPAs were detected also in species richness and total density of fish, although the effect of MPA on species richness varied significantly from time to time. Both species richness and total density of fish at Miramare were always higher compared to the other MPAs, likely in relation to peculiar habitat characteristics. Density of T. pavo declined significantly from south to north, thus confirming the thermophily of this species. Present data point out the importance of monitoring marine fish diversity through long-term surveys across a wide spatial scale, in order to detect the early effects of water warming and to develop future plans of management and conservation...|$|E
40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} light environment {{within a}} tree crown due both to self-shading and to shading by neighboring trees determines leaf trait variations. However, {{the range of}} variation is species-specific reflecting the optimization of whole plant resource investment strategy. Most studies of plant response to light have been aimed at underlining ecological implications of the tolerance to the extreme (i. e. tolerance to sun and shade) but noticeably less effort has been invested in exploration of trends in the plastic response to light. The main objective {{of this research was}} to analyze leaf morphological and physiological trait variations among the species growing in the Natural <b>Integral</b> <b>Reserve</b> “Siro Negri” (Italy) in term of phenotypic plasticity sensu Valladares (2000). The considered forest which in the past largely covered the fluvial valleys along the Ticino river remained untouched for over two decades. The vertical light profile of the forest showed a significant decrease of the photosynthetic photon flux density from the upper tree crown (PPFD > 1500 µmol m- 2 s- 1) to the lower tree crown (PPFD < 600 µmol m- 2 s- 1). All the species had thicker sun leaves compared to shade ones (i. e. 73 % higher leaf mass area, LMA, mean value). Leaf thickness {{could be used as a}} measure of energy investment per unit of leaf area in full sun conditions, while the larger and thinner shade leaves were more advantageous for light capture under low light. Sun leaves allocated more nitrogen than shade ones as attested by the photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (more than 100 % higher in sun than in shade leaves) reflecting an increase in carboxylating enzymes (RUBISCO) and proteins, responsible for photosynthetic electron transport in full sun and justifying the significantly higher photosynthetic rates. The ratio respiration /photosynthesis was higher in shade than in sun leaves. The plasticity index (ranging from 0. 34 to 0. 55) shows significant differences in the response of the considered species to light variations underlining the larger plasticity of Q. robur which might be advantageous in conditions of environmental change...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{are aimed at}} managing and protecting marine environments. Their design, however, often disregards both a thorough knowledge {{of the distribution of}} habitats and assemblages and the use of proper experimental evaluations of the efficacy of MPAs by comparing protected vs. unprotected zones. About 200 MPAs have been recently instituted in the Mediterranean area, but the evidence of their efficacy is scant. The MPA of Torre Guaceto (Southern Adriatic Sea, Italy) is one of the rare cases of effective protection enforcement. The reserve was instituted more than 10 years ago, a period currently considered as sufficient to show responses by organisms to protection. The MPA is divided into a C zone, the general reserve, where many activities are permitted, a B zone, the partial reserve where restrictions increase and two A zones, the <b>integral</b> <b>reserve</b> where access is prohibited. The goals of the paper were to map the distribution of benthic assemblages to assess if they were properly represented in the differently protected zones, and to test the efficacy of protection by quantifying possible differences between the assemblages in two control areas and in the two A zones, where human impact is completely excluded. The analysis of habitat and assemblage distribution within the MPA showed that the zones with total protection do not include most valuable environmental types. Most of the considered variables (i. e. cover of substratum, number of taxa, and average abundance of the most common taxa) were not significantly different {{in and out of the}} A zones, at each time of sampling. Results, however, suggested a possible effect of protection in modifying patterns of abundance of sponges under Cystoseira canopy (more abundant in the fully protected zone). In the subtidal habitat, differences were found in the structure of the whole assemblage and in the abundance of encrusting coralline red algae (more abundant outside the fully protected area). Notwithstanding the correct general methodology employed in the study, a lack of statistical power could have a role in preventing the detection of ecologically relevant effects of protection. In some instances, data pooling allowed a discrimination between cases where there was clearly no effect of protection and cases where there might be. On this basis, the optimization of this experimental design should be considered in further studies. In any case, if the goals of MPAs have not been clearly stated, efficacy of protection might prove very difficult to test even with the use of sound experimental designs...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBeech <b>integral</b> {{biological}} <b>reserves</b> of the Fontainebleau forest (France) display varied {{site conditions}} due to geomorphological heterogeneity and to interactions between biological {{components of the}} ecosystem. Taking examples in shifts observed in plant communities following gap opening, the authors show that, as Oldeman viewed it, tree-fall gaps {{seem to be the}} driving force in sylvigenesis as well as a source of spatial biodiversity. Studies carried out on macromorphological features of humus profiles and on the behaviour of soil invertebrate communities (Lumbricidae and Nematoda) pointed out two key aspects of forest functioning. First, the renewal of the forest ecosystem is linked to the dynamics of humus forms and of soil animal functional groups, featuring the regeneration of trees. Second, tree-fall gaps are places where the forest ecosystem is destabilized and thereafter may renew itself or on the contrary may evolve towards another ecosystem, showing either a co-adaptation between the sylvigenetic and the edaphic cycle, or a discordance between these two cycles. These two aspects (co-adaptation and discordance), important {{from the point of view}} of fundamental ecology and forest management, suggest a need for further field research...|$|R
5000|$|The main gun of the T-72 has a {{mean error}} of 1 m {{at a range}} of 1800 m. Its maximum firing {{distance}} is 9100 m, due to limited positive elevation. The limit of aimed fire is 4000 m (with the gun-launched anti-tank guided missile, which is rarely used outside the former USSR). The T-72's main gun is fitted with an <b>integral</b> pressure <b>reserve</b> drum, which assists in rapid smoke evacuation from the bore after firing. The 125 millimeter gun barrel is certified strong enough to ram the tank through forty centimeters of iron-reinforced brick wall, though doing so will negatively affect the gun's accuracy when subsequently fired. Rumours in NATO armies of the late Cold War claimed that the tremendous recoil of the huge 125 mm gun could damage the fully mechanical transmission of the T-72. The tank commander reputedly had to order firing by repeating his command, when the T-72 is on the move: [...] "Fire! Fire!" [...] The first shout supposedly allowed the driver to disengage the clutch to prevent wrecking the transmission when the gunner fired the cannon on the second order. In reality, this still-common tactic substantively improves the tank's firing accuracy and {{has nothing to do}} with recoil or mechanical damage to anything. This might have to do with the lower quality (compared to Western tanks) of the T-72's stabilizers.|$|R
40|$|The wildcat {{is one of}} {{the most}} elusive {{mammalian}} carnivores in Italy. It is a species protected by the EC (Habitat Directive) and the efforts for its conservation are strictly related to a sound knowledge of its population parameters and genetic status. The different biological, genetic, taxonomic, phylogeographic and legal issues related to this species should all be considered in order to get to correct conclusions about its conservation status and the actions that should be applied. In this context I carried out my PhD thesis which has been developed through the collaboration between the Science Department of Roma Tre University, the Foreste Casentinesi National Park and the conservation genetics laboratory of ISPRA in Ozzano dell’ Emilia. This work took into account three main objectives : 1. Evaluate a standardized integrated protocol for non-invasive monitoring applying a methodology that integrating the different non-invasive techniques allowed us to improve the collection of diversified data (genetic, ecological, ethological, photographic, etc. [...] ) exploiting the least possible sampling effort. In this work we developed a protocol in which the sampling campaign was stratified simultaneously into three different layers: the camera-trapping layer, the scat-surveying and the hair-traps sprayed with valerian tincture (Valeriana officinalis). Using this method we were able to associate the genetic datum to the photographic one, identifying wildcats individuals, detecting hybridization traces, assessing the invasiveness of domestic cats and studying the reactions to the attractor. Alongside it was possible also to take advantage of the versatility of the camera-trapping in order to observe some aspects of the wildcat behaviour and the relationships with some potential competitors. This protocol has been chosen by the Biodiversity Department of the State Forestry Corps operating in the Foreste Casentinesi National Park as a tool for investigating the European wildcat in the <b>integral</b> Natural <b>Reserve</b> of Sasso Fratino. 2. Study more efficient genetic markers for assessing admixture and introgression between wildcat and domestic cat. In the second section, taking advantage of a fruitful collaboration with a ISPRA researcher, we performed a wide genetic investigation of novel loci to establish a set of diagnostic tools suitable for accurately detect levels of introgressive hybridization between European wildcats and domestic cats. 150 samples (including putative European wildcats, captive and putative hybrids and domestic cats) from 15 different European countries and previously analysed at 31 microsatellites loci were analysed with an Illumina Infinium iSelect 63 K Cat DNA Array from which SNPs were selected the 151 most informative. Results from Bayesian model-based computations of simulated and empiric genotypes showed that the entire set of 151 markers provided successful estimates of admixture, correctly assigning all parental, F 1 -F 2 hybrids and first and second generation backcrosses. A direct comparison between most informative SNPs and STRs proved the outperforming power of SNPs on admixture detection and inferring admixed ancestries. To increase the temporal depth of such analysis and check for a possible hidden introgression were also analysed a total of 1269 bp of mtDNA (a coding portion of ND 5 containing 7 putative diagnostic mutation and the Region of Control) and two markers on the Y chromosome (SMCY STR- 7 and a SNP on the SRY gene). These markers allowed us to draw a phylogenetic history of the samples from which emerged two possible different transmission events that led to a mitochondrial haplotypes sharing between the wild and domestic population opening the way for further studies to better understand the phenomenon. Results were organized in a manuscript that is currently under preparation: 3. Clarify the phylogeographic history of the species in Europe. The second work mentioned above has shown how different haplotypes characterized by typical domestic polymorphisms appeared with good frequency in the wild population. So in this last one part we provided the preliminary results of a phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis sequencing 669 bp of the subunit 5 of NADH dehydrogenase of 717 samples of European wildcats, domestic cats and putative hybrids collected from 14 different locations in Europe previously analysed using 31 microsatellite loci. In this work, we have deepened the phylogeography of wildcat in Europe and shed light on the causes that led to the cytonuclear discordance on several individuals. Further analyses are underway for the definition of effective sample size and migration rates between the groups identified In conclusion, this work aimed to propose a multidisciplinary approach to deal with the problems of conservation of the wildcat defining the most efficient and standardized tools possible that could mediate a reasonable operational effort with a high quantity and quality of data...|$|R
