50|$|Like catarrhines, <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> (a {{family of}} platyrrhines) show routine {{trichromatism}} {{that has been}} traced to an evolutionarily recent gene duplication. <b>Howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{are one of the}} most specialized leaf-eaters of the New World monkeys; fruits are not a major part of their diets, and the type of leaves they prefer to consume (young, nutritive, and digestible) are detectable only by a red-green signal.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the social relationships among adult females in two multimale-multifemale groups of black <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> Alouatta pigra during a 14 -month study in Palenque National Park, Mexico. Based on over 900 focal hours and over 5400 scan samples recording neighboring group members, {{we found that}} females very rarely engaged in agonistic interactions and no dominance hierarchy could be discerned. Relationships among resident females were primarily affiliative, but females of one study group spent {{a higher proportion of}} time in close proximity and engaged in affiliative interactions with one another at higher rates than females in the other study group. The strength of female relationships increased with the birth of an infant. Although no females immigrated during the study period, the temporary association of three extragroup females with our study groups implies that the social system of black <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> is more dynamic than previously suggested. These findings suggest that female black <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> behave more similarly to female red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> A. seniculus than to female mantled <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> A. palliata [Current Zoology 57 (1) : 1 – 7, 2011]...|$|R

40|$|There are {{two major}} {{theories}} that attempt to explain hand preference in non-human primates-the `task complexity' theory and the `postural origins' theory. In the present study, we proposed a third hypothesis to explain the evolutionary origin of hand preference in non-human primates, stating {{that it could have}} evolved owing to structural and functional adaptations to feeding, which we refer to as the `niche structure' hypothesis. We attempted to explore this hypothesis by comparing hand preference across species that differ in the feeding ecology and niche structure: red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys,</b> Alouatta seniculus and yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus xanthosternos. The red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> used the mouth to obtain food more frequently than the yellow-breasted capuchin <b>monkeys.</b> The red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> almost never reached for food presented {{on the opposite side of}} a wire mesh or inside a portable container, whereas the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys reached for food presented in all four spatial arrangements (scattered, on the opposite side of a wire mesh, inside a suspended container, and inside a portable container). In contrast to the red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> that almost never acquired bipedal and clinging posture, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys acquired all five body postures (sitting, bipedal, tripedal, clinging, and hanging). Although there was no difference between the proportion of the red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> and the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys that preferentially used one hand, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys exhibited an overall weaker hand preference than the red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Differences in hand preference diminished with the increasing complexity of the reaching-for-food tasks, i. e., the relatively more complex tasks were perceived as equally complex by both the red <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> and the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys. These findings suggest that species-specific differences in feeding ecology and niche structure can influence the perception of the complexity of the task and, consequently, hand preference...|$|R
50|$|<b>Howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{generally}} move quadrupedally on {{the tops}} of branches, usually grasping a branch with at least two hands or one hand and the tail at all times. Their strong prehensile tails are able to support their entire body weight. Fully grown adult <b>howler</b> <b>monkeys</b> do not often rely on their tails for full body support, whereas juveniles do so more frequently.|$|R
25|$|The 16th-century Quiché-Maya hero {{myth of the}} Popol Vuh stages the {{brothers}} Hun-Batz and Hun-Choven as flautists and singers, while describing them as patrons of the other arts as well; the Hero Twins transform them into monkeys by playing the flute and the drum and by singing a certain tune. The musical Elder Brethren correspond to the <b>Howler</b> <b>Monkey</b> Gods of the Classic period. In the Classic and Late-Preclassic Periods, the Tonsured Maize God - another deity of the arts - is intimately connected to a small, portable turtle drum; the deity of the day Ik (Wind) is sometimes shown shaking rattles.|$|E
25|$|Along {{the middle}} and lower reaches, the forest is secondary, betraying the {{heritage}} of banana farms and slash-and-burn practises used historically in this area. Today much of this area is protected as the Payne's Creek National Park. Here, relatively dense jungle canopy has returned, resulting in a closed canopy of approximately 15 to 20 metres in height. Yellow bay cedar and other significant sized broadleaf species abound, along with numerous tropical vines and thorny undergrowth flora. A machete is essential for exploration even where there is an established trail. Black <b>howler</b> <b>monkey</b> troops are plentiful, each troop maintaining a home range of 40,000 to 70,000 square metres in this forest.|$|E
25|$|Tropical Discovery {{was opened}} in 1993. The {{building}} explores several tropical environments and displays mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians and insects from these areas. The trip {{begins with a}} view into a South American river with different species of freshwater stingray then continues to a cave where guests are immersed within the community of several bat species including the vampire bat. A snake exhibit hidden inside a Mayan temple features several venomous species including the king cobra and eyelash viper. Other South American animals here include capybara, black <b>howler</b> <b>monkey,</b> arapaima, piranha and poison dart frog. Further on, visitors are immersed in a coral reef with epaulette sharks, clownfish, yellow tang, lionfish and garden eels. Around the corner, a gallery of North American snakes is located across from alligator snapping turtle and other North American reptiles and fish in a large pool.

25|$|Animal persons (usually {{mammals and}} birds, but {{including}} insects) appear {{to enjoy a}} relative autonomy which is lacking {{in the case of}} the animal 'co-essences'. Perhaps representing the transformed human beings of a former creation, they play varying social roles. In the Popol Vuh, for example, grandfather 'Great White Peccary' and grandmother 'Great White Coati' act as healers, whereas the owl messengers of the lords of the underworld wear military titles. Turning to the 'ceramic codex', one finds that animal persons are often clothed and acting like persons at court. The <b>howler</b> <b>monkey,</b> for example, is commonly depicted in the social role of a writer and sculptor, and functions as a divine patron of these arts. Other mammals function as musicians. In the Dresden Codex, certain animals (dog, jaguar, vulture, owl, parrot, frog), most of them clothed as human beings, are seated in between deities, and seem thus to be treated on a par with the latter, while other animals, again acting as human beings, fulfill important ritual roles. In the New Year rites, for example, an opossum traveller introduces the patron of the incoming year. Similarly, in the Paris Codex, a turkey person alternates with deities in offering the head of the lightning deity (god K) to the new king. Animal persons are repeatedly shown interacting with Goddess I.|$|E
25|$|Apart from writing, the {{fundamental}} priestly sciences were arithmetics and calendrics. Within the social {{group of the}} priests at court, it had by Classical times become customary to deify the numbers {{as well as the}} basic day-unit, and – particularly in the south-eastern kingdoms of Copan and Quirigua – to conceive the mechanism of time as a sort of relay or estafette in which the 'burden' of the time-units was passed on from one divine numerical 'bearer' to the next one. The numbers were personified not by distinctive numerical deities, but by some of the principal general deities, who were thus seen to be responsible for the ongoing 'march of time'. The day-units (k'in) were often depicted as the patrons of the priestly scribes and diviners (ah k'in) themselves, that is, as <b>Howler</b> <b>Monkey</b> Gods, who seem to have been conceived as creator deities in their own right. In the Postclassic period, the time-unit of the katun was imagined as a divine king, as the 20 named days still are among the traditional 'day-keepers' of the Guatemalan Highlands. On a more abstract level, the world was assumed to be governed by certain fundamental numbers, first of all the numbers 13 and 20 that, multiplied, defined both the mantic day count and, on a vast scale, the amount of time elapsed before the first day (5 Imix 9 Kumk'u) of the Long Count.|$|E
