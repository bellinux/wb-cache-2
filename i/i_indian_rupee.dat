25|$|For {{almost a}} century since the Great Recoinage of 1816 until the {{outbreak}} of World War <b>I,</b> the <b>Indian</b> <b>rupee</b> sustained parity with the US dollar while pegged to the pound sterling that was exchanged at 4 12a 10ps (or 50 old pence per rupee). Effectively, the rupee bought 1s 4d (or ₹15 per sterling) during 1899–1914. The gold silver ratio expanded during 1870–1910. Unlike India, her colonial master Britain was on gold standard. To meet the Home Charges (i.e., expenditure in England) the colonial government had to remit {{a larger number of}} rupees and this necessitated increased taxation, unrest and nationalism.|$|R
