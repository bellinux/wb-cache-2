40|$|Achieving an {{adequate}} {{income in the}} old age to maintain the standard level of living after retirement has been a challenge to pension schemes for a long time. In fact, approaching this goal {{has led to a}} global pension crisis considering all the economic and demographic changes and the conflicting interests of employers and employees over time. This research aims to deriving different deterministic and stochastic <b>dynamic</b> <b>pension</b> funding models for defined benefit schemes within the mathematical framework of optimal control theory and dynamic programming. The practical implementation of these dynamic models into one of the largest Egyptian defined, benefit occupational pension schemes - as a case study - is a tool to examine how they act in the reality, and provide the management of the pension fund with a dynamic plan instead of the static ones that have been used in such a volatile market. Taking into consideration the optimal contribution rate of the mutual interests of both the employer and the employees by including a mixed middle term in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pension</b> funding models. This represents both the contribution rate risk and the solvency risk and could provide a solution for one of the pension schemes problems...|$|E

Parallel to the transition to the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pension</b> system based on gross earnings during the late 1950 s, corporate retirement plans experienced an expansion, that is to say, following the 1957 Pension Reform, private benefits were not yet replaced by public benefits.

50|$|A <b>dynamic</b> microsimulation <b>pension</b> {{model is}} a type of a pension model {{projecting}} a pension system by means of a microsimulation and generating the complete history of each individual in a data set. The results of such model offer both the aggregate (e.g. total replacement ratio, implicit debt) and individual indicators (e.g. individual cash-flows) of the pension system. Thanks to complexity of results, there is a possibility to investigate the distribution of pensions, poverty of pensioners, impact of the changes of the pension formula, for more examples see e.g. (Deloitte, 2011). Detailed individual set of (administrative) data should serve as a model input.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} microsimulation models for taxation, pensions, {{and other types}} of {{economic}} and financial activity.

40|$|Abstract. The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to analyze {{solutions}} to a fully nonlinear parabolic equation arising from the problem of optimal portfolio construction. We show how the problem of optimal stock to bond proportion in the management of pension fund portfolio can be formulated in terms of the solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. We analyze the solution from qualitative as well as quantitative point of view. We construct useful bounds of solution yielding estimates for the optimal value of the stock to bond proportion in the portfolio. Furthermore we construct asymptotic expansions of a solution in terms of a small model parameter. Finally, we perform sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution with respect to various model parameters and compare analytical results of this paper with the corresponding known results arising from time-discrete dynamic stochastic optimization model.

40|$|We {{consider}} a continuous time <b>dynamic</b> <b>pension</b> funding model in a defined benefit plan of an employment system. The benefits liabilities are random, {{given by a}} geometric Brownian process. Three different situations are studied regarding the investment decisions taken by the sponsoring employer: in the first, the fund is invested at a constant, risk-free rate of interest; in the second, the promoter invests in a portfolio with n risky assets and a risk-free security; finally, it is supposed {{that the rate of}} return is stochastic. Modelling the preferences of the manager such that the main objective is to minimize both the contribution rate risk and the solvency risk, we study cases where the optimal behavior leads to a spread method of funding.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the optimal {{management}} of an aggregated <b>dynamic</b> <b>pension</b> fund is studied. To cover the promised liabilities to {{workers at the}} age of retirement, the plan sponsor continuously manages time-varying funds. He or she can choose the rate of contribution to the fund, the investment in a given number of risky assets, and a security with constant rate of return. The problem of maximizing the probability that the fund assets achieve some prescribed goal before some undesirable lower value, or ruin point, is first considered. Secondly, the problem of minimizing (resp. maximizing) the expected discounted cost of reaching a ruin point (resp. beating a desired objective) is solved. Finally, maximization of utility function when the fund can suddenly terminate is analyzed. The main finding is that optimal investment policies are of constant proportionality type.

The ability of young agents to compensate their financial losses by saving more during their career provides the strongest argument in favour of younger people investing more aggressively in the stock market.

40|$|In this Working {{paper we}} {{summarized}} research activities undertaken during {{further development of}} the pension model. Substantial part of time was devoted to {{the completion of the}} pension module. With constructed matrix of the conditions for old-age retirement for both genders separately, the module enables simulation of the continuation of the reform of the existing pension system, which will be fully implemented by 2024. An additional sub-module was added that allows simulation of the system of notional accounts. The next very important step in developing the model was the integration of all developed modules into a single system that allows the use of dynamics. In parallel, developed graphic interface in practice links the modules into a microsimulation pension model as well as links the two models - pension model and model of generational accounts. At the same time, it allows independent work with each module separately, as well as the work with the basic data stored in a data warehouse. Developed simulation platform enables elimination of restrictions on the applicability of the static micro-simulation model and generational accounts model arising from a static approach and the cohort level. It is in fact the result of the necessity to adequately adapt both tools to be able to provide a quality assessment of the proposed changes of the pension system.

40|$|Many {{developing}} countries, {{especially in}} Latin America and Eastern Europe, have unfunded pay-as-you-go public pension systems that face growing financial pressures. These emanate from a weak link between contributions and benefits, from widespread evasion, and from an aging population. Chile successfully reformed its public pension system in 1981 when it introduced a government mandated and regulated, but privately managed system. Based on individual capitalization accounts operated by specialized financial institutions, known as, Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFPs), {{the system has}} provided a considerable scope for competition and efficiency within a well-regulated environment. The authors analyze the rationale of the Chilean pension system and examine in detail the rules and provisions regarding coverage, contribution rates, pension benefits, and investment regulations. They also provide a detailed assessment of the structure and performance of the system, its impact on financial sector development, {{and the role of}} regulation and supervision. The Chilean experience shows that there is a positive <b>dynamic</b> interaction between <b>pension</b> funds and securities markets so long as a strong regulatory and supervisory mechanism is in place. It has also shown that it is feasible to finance the costs of transition from an unfunded to a funded system.

40|$|The Finnish {{pension system}} {{consists}} of earnings-related pensions (almost 90 % {{of the total}} pension expenditure) and the national pension. The earnings-related pension system will undergo a major reform in 2017. The main objective of the reform is to ease the burden on public finances by extending working lives. The earliest eligibility age for old-age pension will gradually rise from the current 63 years to 65 years by the 1962 birth cohort. After that, the earliest eligibility age will {{be linked to the}} growth in life expectancy. The age-specific accrual rates will be unified after a transition period. The early retirement schemes will also be reformed. The level of the disability benefits will improve. The forthcoming reform has been analysed using the ELSI microsimulation model of the Finnish Centre for Pensions. The model is based on administrative register data and it covers both the earnings-related and the national pension system of Finland. ELSI is a model with dynamic ageing without behavioural adjustments. The behavioural changes resulting from the reform have been taken into account explicitly: the age-gender-specific behaviour is obtained from our macro model using a micro-macro link. The differences in transition probabilities between educational groups are extrapolated from the register data. <b>dynamic</b> microsimulation, Finnish <b>pension</b> system, pension reform, working live...|$|R
40|$|Should governments {{implement}} {{policies that}} affect fertility decisions on efficiency grounds? What {{is the correct}} notion of efficiency to use? To address these issues, this paper develops {{an extension of the}} notion of Pareto efficiency, referred to as "Millian efficiency", to evaluate symmetric allocations in an overlapping generations setting with endogenous fertility. This extension is based on preferences of those agents who are actually alive, and exclusively allows for welfare comparisons of symmetric allocations. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions to determine whether an allocation is Millian efficient or not, and we show that the sufficient conditions for dynamic efficiency offered by Cass (1972) and Balasko and Shell (1980) cannot be directly applied when fertility decisions are endogenous. Second, we characterize Millian efficient allocations as the equilibria of a decentralized price mechanism, and we present a sufficient condition for dynamic efficiency that uses the sequence of prices associated to such decentralized equilibria. Finally, we analyse how intergenerational policies should be designed to restore efficiency and achieve net welfare gains in two different settings in which markets yield inefficient allocations: dynamic inefficiencies and financial market incompleteness regarding human capital. In the former, a pay-as-you-go social security system eliminates <b>dynamic</b> inefficiencies, provided <b>pensions</b> are explicitly linked with fertility decisions. In the latter, a specific link between social security and public education becomes a necessary condition for Millian efficiency. Copyright © 2009 The Review of Economic Studies Limited. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to develop prognosis-analytical models of {{dynamics}} of distribution of non-state pension provision (NPP), taking into account the synergetic impact of combined effect of agents of NPP system and mass media on pension socium parts. On the basis of epidemic SIR-model the NPP distribution process is modeled as a mass avalanche-type process of changing in population retirement behavior. In this paper pension society (the working-age population over 15) has been divided into three groups: persons who are prone to self-provision of old age through the of NPP financial institutions, or potential members of NPP, actual members of NPP and persons who are not receptive to the idea of NPP. The dynamic evaluation of the mentioned above groups can be implemented under the condition that people’s views concerning NPP have been shaped by different sources of information, physical agents and mass media. Synergy, reflected in probable growth due to application within the NPP system under the influence of those information sources, is considered with the help of indicators of the degree of distrust to NPP institutions. The value of media impact has been conducted by introducing the coefficient of outreach of social informational advertising referring NPP and the indicators of the level of distrust to the media. In this paper on the basis of theory of differential and difference equations the author has developed <b>dynamic</b> model of <b>pension</b> socium groups in continuous and discrete forms. Based on the model of NPP distribution dynamics in the discrete form a number of scenarios of NPP development in Ukraine for the period until 2021 has been simulated. In this paper we got the numerical results, indicating that due regard for synergy effect provides an adequate description of private pensions distribution dynamics: a higher rate of growth of NPP members, reduction in number of unreceptive persons at the initial stage of development, and in the future – the rate reduction due to rejection of information of "late middle" agents...|$|R
40|$|The {{non-financial}} defined contribution or notional model combines pay-as-you-go (PAYG) financing with {{a pension}} formula {{that depends on}} the amount contributed and the return on it which is determined by the notional rate. The account is called notional because no pot of pension fund money exists as the system is PAYG financed. When the individual reaches the retirement age the accumulated capital is converted into an annuity that takes into account the life expectancy of the individual, the indexation of pensions and the technical interest rate, as in classical Financial Defined Contribution Systems (FDC). However, NDC systems cannot provide automatic financial equilibrium, as compared to the FDC systems, which are in equilibrium by construction. The aim of this paper is twofold: to show to what extent the liquidity and solvency indicators of NDC systems are affected by fluctuations in the economic, financial and demographic conditions; and to explore the issue of introducing an optimal automatic balancing mechanism into the notional model to re-establish the financial equilibrium. We present a 4 overlapping generations model with dynamic evolution of the main parameters affecting the pension equilibrium. New entrants and salary trajectories are stochastic processes. Under this framework we study the liquidity and solvency ratios. The liquidity ratio compares the income from contributions with the expenditure on pensions (cash-flow point of view). The solvency ratio compares the current liabilities of the system with the Contribution Asset, a measure that is used in Sweden in order to calculate the PAYG assets. We show that, in the steady state, the pension system is both balanced and solvent. However, under a <b>dynamic</b> framework the <b>pension</b> system is not balanced or solvent in general. With this in mind, automatic balance mechanisms (ABM) are introduced, through a correction of the notional rate, in order to re-establish the liquidity and/or solvency of the system. The notional rate of the system, which affects both pensioners and contributors, is altered by some time-dependent variable which is derived in order to attain a particular liquidity or solvency level. The goodness of the ABM is assessed by means of the variance of the new notional rate, as participants in a public pension system would prefer a less volatile return on their accumulated fund or less variation in the indexation of pensions. The study of the variance uses Monte Carlo simulation. The main conclusion is that the sum of the variance of the notional rate affected by the ABM based on the solvency ratio is lower than the sum of the variance of the notional rate affected by the ABM based on the liquidity ratio in all different scenarios...|$|R
