40|$|In 1822, New York {{became the}} first common-law state to authorize the {{formation}} of <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships,</b> and over the ensuing decades, many other states followed.

We find that the <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> form was adopted by a surprising number of firms, and that <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> had more capital, failed at lower rates, and {{were less likely to be}} formed on the basis of kinship ties, compared to ordinary partnerships. The latter differences were not simply due to selection: even though the merchants who invested in <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> were a wealthy and successful elite, their own ordinary partnerships were quite different from their <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships.</b> The results suggest that the <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> facilitated investments outside kinship networks, and into the hands of talented young merchants. ...|$|R

40|$|In April of 2013, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware {{introduced}} legislation {{that seeks to}} level the playing field between renewable and non-renewable energy companies. Titled the “Master <b>Limited</b> <b>Partnerships</b> Parity Act” (MLPPA), the legislation would amend the federal tax code to allow renewable energy companies to form master <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> and thereby gain valuable financing and tax advantages. This legislation would clear the way for the formation of master <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> investing in renewable energy, which would have significant impact on clean energy production in the United States. This article discusses the Master <b>Limited</b> <b>Partnerships</b> Parity Act and explores the advantages and disadvantages of master <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> as a business organization for renewable energy companies and ultimately argues for the passing of this valuable legislation.
