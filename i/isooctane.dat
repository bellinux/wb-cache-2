Alkylation with butane produces <b>isooctane,</b> another fuel additive. Isobutylene is also used in the production of methacrolein. Polymerization of isobutylene produces butyl rubber (polyisobutylene). Antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) are produced by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of phenols using isobutylene.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} for a fuel to have a Research Octane Number (RON) more than 100, because iso-octane {{is not the most}} knock-resistant substance available.

Typical [...] "octane booster" [...] gasoline additives include MTBE, ETBE, <b>isooctane</b> and toluene.

50|$|Because of {{the double}} bonds, these 4-carbon alkenes can act as {{monomers}} {{in the formation of}} polymers, as well as having other uses as petrochemical intermediates. They are used in the production of synthetic rubber. But-1-ene is a linear or normal alpha-olefin and isobutylene is a branched alpha-olefin. In a rather low percentage, but-1-ene is used as one of the comonomers, along with other alpha-olefins, in the production of high-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene. Butyl rubber is made by cationic polymerisation of isobutylene with about 2 - 7% isoprene. Isobutylene is also used for the production of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and <b>isooctane,</b> both of which improve the combustion of gasoline.|$|E
50|$|A common {{historical}} {{example of}} azeotropic distillation is {{its use in}} dehydrating ethanol and water mixtures.

Several entrainers can be used for this specific process: benzene, pentane, cyclohexane, hexane, heptane, <b>isooctane,</b> acetone, and diethyl ether are all options as the mixture. Of these benzene and cyclohexane have been used the most extensively. However, because benzene has been discovered to be a carcinogenic compound, its use has declined. While this method was the standard for dehydrating ethanol in the past, it has lost favor due to the high capital and energy costs associated with it.Another favorable method and less toxic than using benzene to break the azeotrope of the ethanol-water system is to use toluene instead.|$|E
50|$|Potentiometric {{titration}} is {{a useful}} tool for estimating the amounts of isohumulones in hops bitter substances, which are a large component of beer. Isohumulones are seen to combine with metals in stoichiometric proportions. This allows solutions of isohumulones, generally created by extracting isohumulones from hops using <b>isooctane</b> or petroleum and a liquid-liquid extraction, can be titrated with solutions of metal salts using changes in conductivity to determine an end point. The solutions of isohumulones can then be titrated against a metal salt such as nickel acetate or lead acetate. Readings of potential difference over time then give a titration curve in which potential will increase very slowly at first and then very rapidly. The rapid change in difference corresponds to all of the isohumulones reacting, signifying the end point of the reaction.|$|E
