President Reagan later included Hillsborough, Wakulla, and Dixie counties, bringing {{the total number of}} Florida counties eligible for <b>federal</b> <b>aid</b> to seven. The deadline for residents of all seven counties to apply for either state or federal assistance was set for November 12. Several major corporations—including Texaco, Exxon, and J.C.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In the 2008 - 2009 school year, about 2, 000 for-profit schools received almost $ 24 billion in grants and loans provided to students under <b>federal</b> student <b>aid</b> programs. In the early 1990 s, Congress was concerned that some for-profit schools receiving <b>federal</b> student <b>aid</b> were recruiting students who were not ready for higher education. Many of these students left school with no new job skills and few employment prospects in their fields of study and many defaulted on their federal student loans. In response, Congress enacted the 85 / 15 rule in 1992, which required for-profit schools to obtain at least 15 percent of their revenues from sources other than <b>federal</b> student <b>aid.</b> Proponents of the rule believed that for-profit schools offering a quality education {{should be able to}} earn a minimum percentage of their revenue from sources other than <b>federal</b> student <b>aid.</b> In 1998, Congress amended this law to create the 90 / 10 rule, which reduced to 10 percent the proportion of revenues schools must obtain from sources other than <b>federal</b> student <b>aid.</b> These revenues can include cash payments from students, private student loans, state educational grants, and federal education assistance payments for veterans. For-profit schools are required to report in their annual financial statements the percentage of their total revenues obtained from <b>federal</b> student <b>aid</b> funds. This calculation is called a school's " 90 / 10 rate" and it is verified each year by an independent auditor. Schools that do not comply with the 90 / 10 rule risk losing their eligibility to participate in <b>federal</b> student <b>aid</b> programs. As required by the Higher Education Opportunity Act, we are providing information on for-profit schools' compliance with the 90 / 10 rule. Specifically, this report addresses the following questions: 1. What percentage of for-profit schools is in compliance with the 90 / 10 rule and to what extent do schools derive their revenues from <b>federal</b> student <b>aid</b> funds? 2. What school characteristics are associated with higher average 90 / 10 rates? 3. What school characteristics are associated with an increased likelihood of having a very high 90 / 10 rate?...|$|R

5|$|Entering the 85th United States Congress, McGovern {{became a}} member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. As a representative, McGovern was {{attentive}} to his district. He became a staunch supporter of higher commodity prices, farm price supports, grain storage programs, and beef import controls, believing that such stored commodities programs guarded against drought and similar emergencies. He favored rural development, <b>federal</b> <b>aid</b> to small business and to education, and medical coverage for the aged under Social Security. In 1957, he traveled and studied conditions in the Middle East under a fellowship from the American Christian Palestine Committee. McGovern first allied with the Kennedy family by supporting a House version of Senator John F. Kennedy's eventually unsuccessful labor reform bill.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} fiscal years 1941 and 1942, {{the federal government}} partially funded the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools.

Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the west) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.
