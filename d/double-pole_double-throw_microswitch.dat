40|$|A {{wideband}} circular polarization-reconfigurable (CPR) {{slot antenna}} with compact size for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) applications is presented. The antenna {{consists of a}} rectangular-loop slot, a microstrip feed line, a Wilkinson power divider, a 90 °-phase shifter, a <b>double-pole</b> <b>double-throw</b> (DPDT) switch, and two L-shaped feeding stubs. For size reduction, four T-shaped stubs are symmetrically placed inside the rectangular-loop slot. Wideband operation of the 90 °-phase shifter is constructed using a microstrip line and a lumped-element composite right/left-handed transmission-line (LE-CRLH TL). The input signal is split into two signals with equal amplitude and 90 °-phase difference by the Wilkinson power divider and the 90 °-phase shifter, and then fed to the corresponding L-shaped feeding stubs. The DC control voltages to the DPDT switch determine if the antenna generates a right-handed or left-handed CP signal. Simulated {{results show that the}} proposed antenna has a bandwidth of 1. 14 - 1. 65 GHz for 3 -dB gain variation. © 2016 European Association of Antennas and Propagation.

40|$|The {{apparatus}} {{would include}} a solar photovoltaic panel mounted {{on the roof and}} a panellike assembly mounted in a window opening. The window-mounted assembly {{would include a}} stack of thermoelectric devices sandwiched between two heat sinks. A fan would circulate interior air over one heat sink. Another fan would circulate exterior air over the other heat sink. The fans and the thermoelectric devices would be powered by the solar photovoltaic panel. By means of a <b>double-pole,</b> <b>double-throw</b> switch, the panel voltage fed to the thermoelectric stack would be set to the desired polarity: For cooling operation, the chosen polarity would be one in which the thermoelectric devices transport heat from the inside heat sink to the outside one; for heating operation, the opposite polarity would be chosen. Because thermoelectric devices are more efficient in heating than in cooling, this apparatus would be more effective as a heater than as a cooler. However, if the apparatus were to include means to circulate air between the outside and the inside without opening the windows, then its effectiveness as a cooler in a hot, sunny location would be increased...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} design of a novel pivot for a seesaw, RF MEMS, <b>double-pole</b> <b>double-throw</b> (DPDT) switch, which has been {{developed}} to operate within mobile communication systems and devices. The pivot employs a unique ‘S’ structure at the nano scale, in the form of a, which helps to keep von-Mises stresses below 21 MPa. The pivot requires less pulling force than similar designs due to its flexibility which allows the beam and contacts a greater space of separation while the switch is off. This in turn results in improved contact isolation of greater than − 77 dB at 5 GHz. The RF MEMS switch is an improvement over the previously published paper (Al-Amin et al. in International symposium on microelectronics, vol 2013, no 1, pp 000831 – 000835, 2013. doi: 10. 1109 /ECS. 2014. 6892558), since the pulling force of the electrostatic plates can be generated with a voltage which is greatly reduced from 14 to 8 V using the same electrostatic plate area size. The switch is a progression from SPST and DPDT seesaw switching since it provides improved flexibility over the previously described devices. With the redesign of the pivot the switch attains a greater ‘air-gap’ between the contacts when open-circuited which therefore allows for improved isolation during the off-state...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic biology has {{significantly}} advanced {{the design of}} synthetic control devices, gene circuits and networks that can reprogram mammalian cells in a trigger-inducible manner. Prokaryotic helix-turn-helix motifs have become the standard resource to design synthetic mammalian transcription factors that tune chimeric promoters in a small molecule-responsive manner. We have identified a family of Actinomycetes transcriptional repressor proteins showing a tandem TetR-family signature and have used a synthetic biology-inspired approach to reveal the potential control dynamics of these bi-partite regulators. Daisy-chain assembly of well-characterized prokaryotic repressor proteins such as TetR, ScbR, TtgR or VanR and fusion to either the Herpes simplex transactivation domain VP 16 or the Krueppel-associated box domain (KRAB) of the human kox- 1 gene resulted in synthetic bi- and even tri-partite mammalian transcription factors that could reversibly program their individual chimeric or hybrid promoters for trigger-adjustable transgene expression using tetracycline (TET), γ-butyrolactones, phloretin and vanillic acid. Detailed characterization of the bi-partite ScbR-TetR-VP 16 (ST-TA) transcription factor revealed independent control of TET- and γ-butyrolactone-responsive promoters at high and <b>double-pole</b> <b>double-throw</b> (DPDT) relay switch qualities at low intracellular concentrations. Similar to electromagnetically operated mechanical DPDT relay switches that control two electric circuits by a fully isolated low-power signal, TET programs ST-TA to progressively switch from TetR-specific promoter-driven expression of transgene one to ScbR-specific promoter-driven transcription of transgene two while ST-TA flips back to exclusive transgene 1 expression {{in the absence of}} the trigger antibiotic. We suggest that natural repressors and activators with tandem TetR-family signatures may also provide independent as well as DPDT-mediated control of two sets of transgenes in bacteria, and that their synthetic transcription-factor analogs may enable the design of compact therapeutic gene circuits for gene and cell-based therapie...|$|R
40|$|The past half-century {{witnessed}} {{an evolution}} of {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR). Boosted by digital signal processing (DSP), a variety of SAR imaging algorithms have been developed, in which the wavenumber domain algorithm is mature for airborne SAR and independent of signal waveforms. Apart from the algorithm development, {{there is a growing}} interest in how to acquire the raw data of targets’ echoes before the DSP for SAR imaging in a cost-effective way. For the data acquisition, various studies over the past 15 years have shed light on utilizing the signal generated from the ubiquitous broadband wireless technology – orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). However, the purpose of this thesis is to enable commercial OFDM-based wireless systems to work as an airborne SAR sensor. The unlicensed devices of Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) are the first option, owing to their accessibility, similarity and economy. This dissertation first demonstrates the feasibility of applying WiMAX to SAR by discussing their similar features. Despite the similarities they share, the compatibility of the two technologies is undermined by a series of problems resulted from WiMAX transceiver mechanisms and industrial rules for radiated power. In order to directly apply commercial WiMAX base station transceivers in unlicensed band to airborne SAR application, we propose a radio-frequency (RF) front design together with a signal processing means. To be specific, a <b>double-pole,</b> <b>double-throw</b> (DPDT) switch is inserted between an antenna and two WiMAX transceivers for generating pulsed signal. By simulations, the transmitted power of the SAR sensor is lower than 0 dBm, while its imaging range can be over 10 km for targets with relatively large radar cross section (RCS), such as a ship. Its range resolution is 9. 6 m whereas its cross-range resolution is finer than 1 m. Equipped with the multi-mode, this SAR sensor is further enhanced to satisfy the requirements of diversified SAR applications. For example, the width of the scan-mode SAR’s range swath is 2. 1 km, over five times the width of other modes. Vital developed Matlab code is given in Appendix D, and its correctness is shown by comparing with the image of chirped SAR. To summarize, the significance of this dissertation is to propose, for the first time, a design of directly leveraging commercial OFDM-based systems for airborne SAR imaging. Compared with existing designs of airborne SAR, it is a promising low-cost solution...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the designs of}} a multi-band slot antenna, a frequency-reconfigurable (FR) monopole antenna, a frequency-reconfigurable multiple-input-multiple-output (FR MIMO) antenna, a polarization-reconfigurable (PR) monopole antenna, a new metasurface (MS) and a circular-polarization-reconfigurable metasurface (CPR MS) monopole antenna. The multi-band slot antenna consists of a rectangular slot, a T-shaped feeding patch, an inverted T-shaped stub and two E-shaped stubs and has a compact area. The rectangular slot and the inverted T-shaped stub together generate the 1 st band. The two E-shaped stubs operating as monopole radiators generate the 2 nd band. By using a double-folded stub in the T-shaped feeding patch, two resonant frequencies, i. e., 3 rd and 4 th bands, can be generated and tuned independently. With this method, the slot antenna can have four operating bands and a size smaller than the previous works. The effect of the feeding cable used in measurement and of the cover used in wireless devices is also investigated. In the FR planar monopole antenna, the radiator consists of two sections, section I and II, which are connected together using a PIN-diode. Section I alone generates a high-frequency band, while section II, when electrically connected together with section I using the PIN-diode, generates a low-frequency band. The radiator of the antenna is meandered for compact size. Continuous tuning of the two operating bands is accomplished by placing a varactor on section I of the radiator, leading to a wide tuning range of 2. 39 - 3. 0 GHz. With {{the use of this}} technique, a FR monopole antenna and a FR MIMO monopole antenna with wide-continuous tuning are designed. In the FR MIMO monopole antenna, a reconfigurable defected ground structure (DGS) employing two PIN diodes is designed to switch isolation across the whole tuning band. A simple and novel biasing circuit using only three direct current (DC) wires is designed to bias the diodes. The PR monopole antenna consists of two meandered radiators placed perpendicular to each other, a feeding network using the Wilkinson power divider, two switchable 900 -phase shifters with PIN-diode switches for control, and a DGS. The antenna is more compact and has a wider axial-ratio bandwidth than those of the previous PR antennas. A phase shifter and a <b>double-pole</b> <b>double-throw</b> (DPDT) switch are used to reduce the complexity of the biasing circuit, and a metallic reflector is placed {{at the back of the}} antenna to increase the boresight gain. The dual-cap mushroom-like metasurface (MS) is a new design, with each unit cell having a simple patch with a centered via on one side of the substrate and a meandered slot on the other side. The meandered slot introduces inductive effect to lower down the operating frequency and increase the operating bandwidth. The dual-cap mushroom-like MS is used in the design of a compact CPR MS monopole antenna to enhance the boresight gain and bandwidth. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
