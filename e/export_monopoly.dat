40|$|The Israeli citrus export {{sector was}} liberalized in 1991 {{with the aim}} to {{increase}} citrus growers income and to improve overall efficiency of the international citrus marketing channel. However, the former government <b>export</b> <b>monopolys</b> activities were mainly taken over by four large companies accounting for over 90 % of total Israeli citrus market exports. In addition, citrus exporters maintained the monopolys consignment system, substantially limiting transparency on how the grower price is determined. This lead the government {{to intervene in the}} newly liberalized market by implementing a minimum price agreement in the 1994 / 95 season to protect citrus growers against exporters abuse of market power. In this paper we analyze whether market power was exerted by exporting companies over citrus growers in the form of asymmetric price transmission. Our study is unique in that it investigates vertical price transmission across international borders, i. e. in the context of Israeli grapefruit exports to France. We explicitly account for possible changes in exporters pricing behaviour in the post-liberalization period. We apply an error correction model (ECM) to disaggregated firm-level Israeli grower price and French import price data. An ECM is estimated individually for each of the major exporting companies within a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) framework. We find asymmetric price transmission in the first years after liberalisation, but symmetry {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s. Our results indicate that growers losses due to asymmetry amounted to as much as 2. 5 % of their total revenues. Our results suggest that liberalization improved the efficiency of the Israeli citrus international marketing channel, but that this took time and was probably accelerated by government intervention.

40|$|As the {{difficulties}} Gazprom has faced {{in recent years}} on the European market have multiplied 1, so more and more symptoms have appeared which may suggest that the company’s dominant position is deteriorating. The decision made by the Russian government in June 2011 to double the tax Gazprom has to pay on the extraction of gas, which was later approved by parliament, {{was the first time}} in many years when the company’s fiscal privileges were withdrawn. The process of Gazprom’s assets being taken over by private companies and business partners from within Vladimir Putin’s closest circle is underway. More and more frequently attempts are being made to challenge the company’s monopoly in areas of key importance for the functioning of the entire gas sector, such as Gazprom’s exclusive right to dispose of the Russian gas transportation system and its <b>exports</b> <b>monopoly.</b> Competition from independent gas producers on the domestic market is growing, and Gazprom is gradually being pushed out of some of that market’s most profitable segments (industrial clients). The emerging tendencies in the Russian gas sector derive from a number of factors – from the situation on the European gas market, through difficulties hampering the development of the sector in Russia itself, to the private interests of the current ruling class and its business partners. The plans for a structural reform of the monopoly (including isolating gas transportation system from Gazprom), presented since 2000 by the Ministry for Economic Development and since 2003 by the Russian Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP), suggest a direction for the changes necessary to stimulate the sector’s development and improve the efficiency of Gazprom itself. However, the monopolist’s current business model gives the government full control over this strategic enterprise, which is a core of Putin’s concept for developing Russia as a global energy power. Despite Putin’s recent statement that he “does not rule out privatising Gazprom in the future” (made at a meeting with political scientists in Moscow on 6 February this year), any structural reform of Gazprom (and consequently, a weakening of the state’s control over it) seems unlikely in the foreseeable future. Still, the developments on the domestic market – growing pressure from other gas companies (oil corporations and independent producers) and changes on the European market 2 – may result in the weakening of Gazprom’s monopoly privileges and a gradual deterioration of its special status within Russia...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects on}} {{the implementation of the}} Telecommunications Act of 1996 ("Act") on US telecommunications markets and is based on my forthcoming book with the same title. The Act is a milestone in the history of telecommunications in the United States. Coming 12 years after the breakup of AT&T, the Act attempts to move all telecommunications markets toward competition. The Act envisions competition in all telecommunications markets, both in the markets for the various elements that comprise the telecommunications network, {{as well as for the}} final services the network creates. Building on the experience of the long distance market, which was transformed from a monopoly to an effectively competitive market over the last 12 years, the Act attempts to promote competition in the hitherto monopolized local exchange markets. The Act recognizes the telecommunications network as a network of interconnected networks. Telecommunications providers are required to interconnect with entrants at any feasible point the entrant wishes. Most importantly, the Act requires that incumbent local exchange carriers ("ILECs") (i) lease parts of their network (unbundled network elements) to competitors "at cost"; (ii) provide at a wholesale discount to competitors any service the ILEC provides; and (iii) charge reciprocal rates in termination of calls to their network and to networks of local competitors. Moreover, the Act requires that ILECs that came out of the Bell System meet a number of requirements, including a public interest test, before they may enter into the long distance market. Thus, the Act provides some safeguards against the <b>export</b> of ILEC <b>monopoly</b> power to other parts of the network. Numerous legal challenges to the Act and its implementation have been raised by the ILECs resulting in very slow implementation of the Act, and, in many cases, in no substantial implementation of the provisions of the Act. Thus, more than two years after the passage of the Act, there is very little entry and competition in local exchange markets. In response to the apparent failure of the implementation Act, there has been a wave of mergers in the US telecommunications industry. telecommunications, regulation, competition...|$|R
40|$|After {{evaluating}} the Uruguay Round's impact on agriculture and border {{protection in the}} next decade, the author concludes that while there was significant reform of the rules - particularly the conversion of nontariff barriers into tariffs and the reduction and binding of all tariffs - in practice, trade will probably be liberalized less than expected. The objective of the Round was to reverse protectionism and remove trade distortions. This may not be achieved in practice, at least not until further reductions are carried out in future rounds of negotiations. The major exception to this conclusion is in high-income Asian countries, where protection for major commodities will be significantly reduced. The tariffication and binding of all tariffs on agricultural products represents a significant step forward. Liberalization is implicit because countries are prohhibited from arbitrarily raising tariffs to new higher levels. But many of the newly established tariffs are so high in many countries as to effectively prohibit trade. Patterns of liberalization vary considerably by commodity and by country. Generally, the extent of liberalization was diminished by binding tariffs to the base period of 1986 - 88, when border protection was at a high point. In most OECD countries, this was worsened by"dirty tariffication:"the new base tariffs offered even greater protection than the nontariff barriers they replaced. Even after the commitments to tariff reductions in the Round, the ad valorem measure of the final binding tariffs will remain {{higher than the average}} rate of protection in 1982 - 93. A number of developing countries in East Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East chose to lock in prior liberalization efforts on some products. But for most commodities, there will be little actual liberalization, since most developing countries chose to bind their tariffs at a maximum level. Even when countries reduced already-bound rates, bound tariffs remained significantly higher than current applied rates, giving countries the flexibility to raise tariffs later. The high level of bound tariffs may allow countries to apply variable tariffs below the bound level, thus failing to stabilize tariffs and improve market access. Moreover, the Round did not touch many of the worst distortions in developing countries, such as import subsidies, <b>export</b> taxes, state-trading <b>monopolies,</b> and domestic policies that implicitly tax agriculture.

40|$|The {{government}} must explicitly consider how to value {{the welfare of}} different groups in the society when making interventions in order to correct externalities. The welfare effects of government policies create political tensions, which are especially clearly seen {{in the formation of}} forest policy. This is because forests are used for timber production, but they are also valuable for other purposes, such as recreation. These different uses are often in conflict, and the trade-off manifests itself in political struggles over the formation of forest policy. In order to address the effects of lobbying on the forest policy, I consider a specific policy issue, namely the conservation of biological diversity in the forests. It is an issue on which forest industry, forest owners and forest activists have very different views concerning the role and responsibility of the government. In my Thesis, I concentrate on two main questions on interest group influence in the context of forest policy, namely to what direction groups affected by the policy seek to push the policy, and what welfare implications successful lobbying has. I analyze the government forest policy in the common agency framework, where an environmental lobby and an industrial lobby simultaneously attempt to influence the decision of the government by offering monetary contributions. To this aim I use the menu auction theory, which I extend to account for the possibility that lobbying is socially costly and that the lobbies are not equally successful in influencing the government. I consider government decision-making in two situations: exported forest product and domestic consumption. The forest industry is represented by a monopoly, and therefore, the conservation affects the price of consumption when the forest product is not exported. The case where the forest industry exports its product thus serves as a useful point of reference when analysing the more diversified case of domestic consumption. Compared to domestic consumption, the government will always choose higher conservation level when the <b>monopoly</b> <b>exports</b> its product and the foreign consumers bear the cost of conservation. Due to non-competitive production sector, it is also possible to analyze how the market power of the industry, determined by the elasticity of demand, influences the government's decision on conservation. The analysis explains why the government's forest policy only partly reflects the normative prescriptions. It also makes explicit that the lobbies indeed have an incentive to cast resources into costly lobbying. In the particular case when the <b>monopoly</b> product is <b>exported</b> and the two lobbies are equally efficient in influencing the government, the political equilibrium coincides with the social optimum. In general, however, lobbying distorts conservation from the socially optimal. Endast sammandrag.
