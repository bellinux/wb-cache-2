25|$|Perón's generals finally <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> Eva's meddling {{and demand}} that Perón force her to leave politics. However, Perón objects and says {{that if it was}} not for her, they would never have {{achieved}} as much as they have ("She Is a Diamond"). But he also concedes she {{will not be able to}} keep working for long as she will soon succumb to her cancer. Even so, Eva is determined to run for vice-president, and Perón fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists she can continue, despite her failing health ("Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet").|$|E

"Although it is {{easy for}} some to <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> the {{repetitive}} lovesick theme B seems to gravitate towards, the music in this song nothing short of epic, as is Beyonce's vocal performance. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming in to the loop during the refrain as B sings, 'Let's start over / Let's give love their wings / Let's start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "My Happiness" [...] {{peaked at}} number 23 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, {{making it the}} first Powderfinger song to appear on a Billboard chart. According to Susan Groves of WHRL, part of the song's success came about because very few people knew of Powderfinger, but were drawn towards [...] "My Happiness" [...] because it was [...] "melodic, [...] pretty"—a change from what she {{described}} as [...] "middle of the road rock" [...] popular in the United States. Meanwhile, Australians were [...] "starting to <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> My Happiness"—Cameron Adams argued in The Hobart Mercury that {{this was one of}} the reasons Powderfinger decided to focus on the offshore market.|$|E

500|$|With Internationalist, Powderfinger {{first set}} their sights overseas, {{appearing}} at numerous music festivals in the U.S., including South by Southwest in Texas. While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in Los Angeles and New York City. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult {{due to the}} lack of any homegrown fan support. [...] He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as he had hoped. Coghill, however, described the showcases, and the performances in Austin, as [...] "worthwhile" [...] and [...] "fun". After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of Canada. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian-based band, as [...] "people [...] are going to <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> you pretty quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, so that you can sustain yourself financially." ...|$|E
500|$|The move to {{the sixth}} series also meant Gaiman had to include Rory, who had ceased {{to exist in the}} {{original}} slot in the fifth series. With Rory included, Gaiman had to [...] "reshape" [...] much of {{the second half of the}} episode, featuring Amy being on the run in the TARDIS. In the original draft where Amy was the only companion, Gaiman added a [...] "heartbreaking monologue" [...] by the character, further stating [...] "you get to see what it's like to be the companion from the companion's point of view, and she got to talk about essentially in that version how sad it is, in some ways. One day something will happen to her, she'll get married, she'll get eaten by monsters, she'll die, she'll <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> <b>of</b> this, but he'll go on forever." [...] At a certain point, Gaiman became tired of rewriting drafts and asked Steven Moffat for help. Moffat wrote in what Gaiman called [...] "several of [...] best lines" [...] and rapidly rewrote several scenes when budget problems harmed filming locations.|$|E
