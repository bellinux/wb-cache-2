Normalized contrast processing in flash thermography is useful in quantitative analysis of flash thermography data including flaw characterization and comparison of experimental results with simulation. Computation of normalized temperature contrast involves use of flash thermography data acquisition set-up with high reflectivity foil and high emissivity tape such that the <b>foil,</b> <b>tape</b> and test object are imaged simultaneously. Methods of assessing other quantitative parameters such as emissivity of object, afterglow heat flux, reflection temperature change and surface temperature during flash thermography are also provided.

40|$|Duct leakage is a {{major source}} of energy loss in {{residential}} buildings. Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums, or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections, a method of sealing the duct system is required. Typical sealing methods include tapes or mastics applied around the joints in the system. Field examinations of duct systems have shown that taped seals tend to fail over extended periods of time. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has been testing sealant durability for several years using accelerated test methods and found that typical duct tape (i. e., cloth-backed tapes with natural rubber adhesives) fails more rapidly than other duct sealants. This report summarizes the results of duct sealant durability testing over two years for four UL 181 B-FX listed duct tapes (two cloth tapes, a <b>foil</b> <b>tape</b> and an Oriented Polypropylene (OPP) tape). One of the cloth tapes was specifically developed in collaboration with a tape manufacturer to perform better in our durability testing. The tests involved the aging of common ''core-to-collar joints'' of flexible duct to sheet metal collars. Periodic air leakage tests and visual inspection were used to document changes in sealant performance. After two years of testing, the flex-to-collar connections showed little change in air leakage, but substantial visual degradation from some products. A surprising experimental result was failure of most of the clamps used to mechanically fasten the connections. This indicates that the durability of clamps also need to be addressed ensure longevity of the duct connection. An accelerated test method developed during this study has been used as the basis for an ASTM standard (E 2342 - 03) ...|$|E
40|$|This note {{provides}} suggestions for effectively dealing with slots, holes and ducts in a shielded room. Most RF companies have a shielded room (or “screen room”) for testing of sensitive circuits and equipment. In theory, the room {{takes advantage of}} Gauss ’ Law to keep out interfering noise and signals. However, power, ventilation and other utilities must be available, as well as signal lines connected to equipment located outside the room. Those penetrations of the shielded space must not allow unwanted energy into (or out of) of the room. Panel Seams An overlooked “gap ” in the shielding is the area where segments of the wall, floor and ceiling shielding material meet. Those seams must be made RF-tight. The best method is welding or soldering. Compression joints with bolts or clamps are also common. In some cases, adequate performance may be achieved by simple overlapping of the shielding materials and taping with wide metal <b>foil</b> <b>tape.</b> Doors Doors are the most critical part of all shielded room installations. They are large and are used regularly. Obtaining good contact around the edges is critical, as is reliable construction that will maintain performance over time and heavy usage.

Typical duct tape (i. e. fabric backed tapes with natural rubber adhesives) was found to fail more rapidly than all other duct sealants. This report summarizes the results of duct sealant durability testing of five UL 181 B-FX listed duct tapes (three cloth tapes, a <b>foil</b> <b>tape</b> and an Oriented Polypropylene (OPP) tape). One of the cloth tapes was specifically developed in collaboration with a tape manufacturer to perform better in our durability testing. The first test involved the aging of common ''core-to-collar joints'' of flexible duct to sheet metal collars, and sheet metal ''collar-to-plenum joints'' pressurized with 200 F (93 C) air. The second test consisted of baking duct tape specimens in a constant 212 F (100 C) oven following the UL 181 B-FX ''Temperature Test'' requirements. Additional tests were also performed on only two tapes using sheet metal collar-to-plenum joints. Since an unsealed flexible duct joint can have a variable leakage depending on the positioning of the flexible duct core, the durability of the flexible duct joints could not be based on the 10 % of unsealed leakage criteria. Nevertheless, the leakage of the sealed specimens prior to testing could be considered as a basis for a failure criteria. Visual inspection was also documented throughout the tests. The flexible duct core-to-collar joints were inspected monthly, while the sheet metal collar-to-plenum joints were inspected weekly. The baking test specimens were visually inspected weekly, and the durability was judged by the observed deterioration in terms of brittleness, cracking, flaking and blistering (the terminology used in the UL 181 B-FX test procedure) ...|$|E

Robustness, flexibility and compactness are required as wearable antenna. In this project, textile antennas using denim materials which has and = 0. 085 are chosen to fulfil {{the requirements of the}} antenna. The antenna model is designed using Microwave Studio CST software. Several antenna prototypes are fabricated and evaluated with different conducting elements (Shieldit fabric and copper <b>foil</b> <b>tape).</b> For the multiband antenna, a triple band fractal Koch dipole antenna was designed to operate at 0. 9 GHz, 2. 45 GHz and 5. 8 GHz. The fractal Koch antenna is reduced to about 15 % of length size of the straight dipole antenna. Both antenna performances with different conducting elements were observed in terms of return loss, bandwidth, radiation pattern and gain. Three types of analysis are evaluated on fractal Koch multiband antenna which measures performance with bending, human body and wet conditions. The performances of the antennas are conducted based on resonant frequency and bandwidth. From the analysis, it is found that the bending of copper fractal antenna on human body drastically shifted the resonant frequency from 0. 90, 2. 45 and 5. 16 GHz to 0. 49, 1. 16 and 3. 03 GHz. The suitable antenna placement on human body has been discovered at the chest with resonant frequencies of 0. 80, 2. 56 and 5. 16 GHz and the backside with resonant frequencies of 0. 88, 2. 48 and 5. 8 GHz. The fractal Koch multiband antenna maintains performance with less 3 % of water absorption in the antenna under wet conditions. The performance of copper tape was shown to be more profound than Shieldit antenna in terms of return loss, radiation pattern and gain due to the minimization of the electrical loss of material. However, Shieldit antenna is more flexible and robust than the copper antenn...|$|E
