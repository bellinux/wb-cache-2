25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the oral qualities of traditional story telling are also evident in this short story. The narrator <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> about his journey, and his anguish during his delirious night. This narration is full of voices, for example as don Chepe and Niña Tina respond to Cuero de Oro's exhortation. Asturias even ends the tale with the final sentence: and the conversation ended. The textual interplay between Cuero de Oro and don Chepe and Niña Tina can also be interpreted as representative {{of a child who}} is searching for the roots of his identity, questioning those who have access to this knowledge of another (mythical) time and space.|$|E

According to Doinel Tronaru, the book chapter on which the film was based was itself controversial, and {{seen by many as}} [...] "indigestible". Tronaru writes: [...] "the film was made during the bloody Yugoslav conflict, but Pintilie <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> [...] not to tune out believing we are somehow better, that, if need be, we could be just as bloodthirsty as our shunned neighbors." ...|$|E

2500|$|The precise {{formulation}} of the idea is made difficult {{by the fact that}} physicists do not yet know how many independent physical constants there are. The current standard model of particle physics has 25 freely adjustable parameters with an additional parameter, the cosmological constant, for gravitation. However, because the standard model is not mathematically self-consistent under certain conditions (e.g., at very high energies, at which both quantum mechanics and general relativity are relevant), physicists believe that it is underlaid by some other theory, such as a grand unified theory, string theory, or loop quantum gravity. In some candidate theories, the actual number of independent physical constants may be as small as one. For example, the cosmological constant may be a fundamental constant, but attempts have also been made to calculate it from other constants, and according to the author of one such calculation, [...] "the small value of the cosmological constant <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> that a remarkably precise and totally unexpected relation exists among all the parameters of the Standard Model of particle physics, the bare cosmological constant and unknown physics." ...|$|E
