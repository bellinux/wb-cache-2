Similar to {{the challenges}} for wet etch and clean POU UPW applications, <b>for</b> <b>lithography</b> UPW rinse, the flow through the filter is intermittent, though at a low flow and pressure, so the physical robustness is not as critical. Another POU UPW application <b>for</b> <b>lithography</b> is the immersion water used at the lens/wafer interface for 193 nm immersion lithography patterning. The UPW forms a puddle between the lens and the wafer, improving NA, and the UPW must be extremely pure. POU filtration is used on the UPW {{just prior to the}} stepper scanner.|$|R
