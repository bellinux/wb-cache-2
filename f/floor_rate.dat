5000|$|Higher <b>rating</b> <b>floors</b> {{exist for}} {{experienced}} {{players who have}} achieved significant ratings. Such higher <b>rating</b> <b>floors</b> exist, starting at ratings of 1200 in 100 point increments up to 2100 (1200, 1300, 1400, ..., 2100). A player's <b>rating</b> <b>floor</b> is calculated by taking their peak established rating, subtracting 200 points, and then rounding down to the nearest <b>rating</b> <b>floor.</b> For example, a player who has reached a peak rating of 1464 would have a <b>rating</b> <b>floor</b> of 1464 − 200 = 1264, which would be rounded down to 1200. Under this scheme, only Class C players and above are capable of having a higher <b>rating</b> <b>floor</b> than their absolute player rating. All other players would have a floor of at most 150.|$|R
50|$|In {{every level}} the player can boost points for score by {{destroying}} all enemies, collecting all points and keeping all Informants alive, {{which increases the}} three respective statuses. Total Points is affected by both the enemies destroyed and the treasure collected. The all Informants alive bonus can only be obtained if all informants survive after the first two bonuses are obtained. <b>Floor</b> <b>rating</b> {{is affected by the}} other three statuses.

The achievement of this title is unique in that no other recognized USCF title will result in a new floor. For players with ratings below 2000, winning a cash prize of $2,000 or more raises that player's <b>rating</b> <b>floor</b> to the closest 100-point level that would have disqualified the player for participation in the tournament. For example, if a player won $4,000 in a 1750 and under tournament, the player would now have a <b>rating</b> <b>floor</b> of 1800.|$|R
5000|$|... 42% of all {{wage earners}} in India receive wages below the {{national}} minimum wage <b>floor</b> <b>rate.</b> The data used for these statistics includes half of casual labourers and 1/4th of those salaried. Female workers and those in rural areas {{are more likely to}} be paid below a minimum wage. Those who are illiterate or have no mid-level education are most likely to be paid below a minimum wage. For Salaried workers, if they are employed in agriculture, it is more likely that they are paid higher than the minimum wage. Whereas casual workers in construction and unionised workers in production and manufacturing are likely to receive wages at the minimum wage rate. In sum, the implementation and enforcement of minimum wages is dismal and marginalised groups and communities suffer the most. The government has announced that many amendments are underway to improve enforcement such as penal action against violations and mandatory revision of minimum wages every 5 years.|$|E
5000|$|Tungiasis is {{strictly}} caused by chigoe fleas (the term transmission {{does not apply}} because Tunga penetrans is itself responsible for the disease.) The preponderance of tungiasis lesions on the toes may be because chigoe flea is a poor jumper, attaining only a high of 20 cm. But the reality is more complex; for example, the jumping ability cannot explain why hands are the second-most affected body part. Lesions on the hands are better explained by playing {{in the sand and}} noting that hands are often used to remove sand {{from other parts of the}} body. The occurrence of tungiasis lesions on the toes, between them, and on the soles can be easily explained because most of the victims are poor, walk barefoot, and live in places where the sand (home to chigoe fleas) constitutes the <b>floor.</b> <b>Rate</b> of incidence therefore is greatly increased in poor communities and populations because of the lack of adequate housing.

40|$|In 1965 the French {{authorities}} {{introduced the}} first of a series of reforms to the structure and operations of the French banking system, one of which was the abolition of the official minimum loan rate on discounts and advances. The elimination of the <b>floor</b> <b>rate</b> on bank loans has been widely acclaimed as a major move towards greater competition in French banking. The present paper evaluates the probable market impact of this reform. To this end, both the market structure and market behaviour of French short-term business loan markets are examined. The author first analyses the market structure of loan markets in France both before and after two recent major reforms of the banking structure. Market behavior under the minimum loan rate is then examined and the relation of minimum loan rates to actual loan rates, to competitive loan rates, and tot he rates that probably would have prevailed if there had been no official loan rate controls is shown.

Tur-P+I is a combined technique of channelling TUR-P and transurethral incision of the bladder neck and the prostate. After receiving modest TUR of the adenoma, the bladder neck and anatomical capsule of the prostate was incised by electroresectoscope at 6 o'clock position from the bladder neck toward to verumontanum. Before operation, the maximum <b>floor</b> <b>rate,</b> average flow rate, and residual urine volume were measured, which were respectively 9. 9 +/- 5. 6 ml/s (M+SEM), 4. 4 +/- 2. 3 ml/s, and 130 +/- 80 ml in TUR-p+I group, and 11. 6 +/- 2. 9 ml/s, 4. 3 +/- 1. 8 ml/s, and 60 +/- 60 ml (p < 0. 01) in TUR-P group. The operation time and resected tissue weights were similar in both groups; 68 +/- 16 min and 11 +/- 5. 2 g in TUR-P+I group, and 72 +/- 25 min and 11 +/- 6. 5 g in TUR-P group. The post-operative maximum flow rate, average flow rate and residual urine volume were respectively improved to 19. 0 +/- 5. 7 ml/s, 9. 3 +/- 3. 7 ml/s, and 20 +/- 20 ml in TUR-P+I group, and 14. 6 +/- 6. 1 ml/s (p = 0. 057), 6. 6 +/- 2. 6 ml/s (p < 0. 05), and 30 +/- 30 ml (not significant) in the TUR-P group.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four essays on pricing fixed income derivatives and risk management. The first essay presents pricing and duration formulas for floating rate bonds and interest rate swaps with embedded options. It combines Briys et al. 2 ̆ 7 s approximation with the extended Vasicek term structure model to value caps and floors. Using this approach, it computes the durations of caps, floors, collars, floating rate bonds with collars and interest rate swaps with collars, and provides comparative statics analyses of these durations {{with respect to the}} underlying variables such as the cap rate, the <b>floor</b> <b>rate,</b> the interest rate volatility, and the level of interest rates. ^ The second essay explores a class of polynomial Taylor series expansions for approximating the bond return function, and examines its implication for managing interest rate risk. The generalized duration vector models derived from alternative Taylor series expansion extend Fong and Fabozzi 2 ̆ 7 s M-square model and Nawalkha and Chambers 2 ̆ 7 M-vector model, and the empirical tests show that immunization results can be improved for models g(t) = tα with α less than 1 when higher order generalized duration vectors are used. ^ The third essay develops a methodology to build recombining trees for pricing American options on bonds under deterministic volatility HJM models. Without imposing the HJM drift restriction, our approach uses the Nelson-Ramaswamy transformation to generate recombining forward rate trees. We show that the option prices obtained from our recombining trees satisfy Merton 2 ̆ 7 s bond option PDE when step size approaches zero. Numerical simulations provide evidence that this approach is efficient in pricing both European and American contingent claims. ^ The fourth essay obtains computationally efficient trees for pricing European options under two types of proportional volatility HJM models. We construct a numeraire economy in which European options are priced using a maturity-specific equivalent martingale measure. We then show that for the two types of proportional volatility models, European option prices are independent of the forward rate drift under this maturity-specific equivalent martingale measure. Our method is particularly beneficial when used to price long-dated caps, floors and collars because these instruments involve a large number of long-dated puts and calls. ...|$|E

50|$|Around 110-85 Ma, {{there was}} {{worldwide}} oscillatory increases in ocean <b>floor</b> spreading <b>rates.</b> The {{increase in the}} amount of basalt being injected into the ocean caused a displacement of water from the ocean basins, which resulted in sea level rise, flooding the coasts of the Texas margin and other bordering continents around the world. The major sea level rise that took place due to an occurrence of an oscillation is known as the Cenomanian transgression, which is the most well known and last major transgression in the Cretaceous. The dispersal of extra magma warmed the water in the ocean, and was a conducive environment for calcareous-shelled organisms, which eventually died and sunk {{to the bottom of the}} ocean floor creating thick deposits of limestone. In addition to the displacement of water, an increase in injected magma raised CO₂ levels to around 2-6 times the current level. The increase in CO₂ levels along with the extra production of crust caused global temperatures to rise, which would also play an integral role in the future development of different Cretaceous formations. When the sea <b>floor</b> spreading <b>rates</b> slowed around ≈85 Ma, so did the amount of basaltic material being thrown into the ocean which caused the initial water displacement. As seen around the DFW Metroplex, the Cretaceous rocks deposited during this time were directly influenced by increased sea <b>floor</b> spreading <b>rates.</b>|$|R
