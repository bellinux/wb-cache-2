40|$|The {{nature and}} extent of the {{automation}} of the statutory work of the <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> <b>offices</b> in the region are outlined. In contrast to the parallel automation of both patent and trademark work in many countries, trade mark applications provide a very high proportion of the total applications to the offices in this region and automated processing of these applications is accordingly more advanced than for patent, utility model etc applications. The resulting databases which are or can be made available to the public are similarly restricted. The development of information services, towards a goal of Intellectual Property Digital Libraries (IPDLs), is very dependent on both local and WIPO funding, and will also be influenced by the expanding possibilities on the Internet. The author ends by examining some of the factors influencing the decisions about charging for some information services (e. g. to help fund further development and provision of such services), rather than provide them entirely as free assistance to the public. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{extensive}} IPC reform {{project of}} the last few years has led to many major changes. In this article the author concentrates on three vital aspects of the implementation of the reformed International Patent Classification (IPC) [...] the Master Classification Database (MCD), the CONcept of OPerationS (CONOPS), and the HARMONY {{project of the}} Trilateral Offices. The MCD is based on the EPO's DOCDB system. The CONOPS document describes the classification and reclassification process of the reformed IPC in sufficient detail to enable all <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> <b>offices</b> to implement and use the reformed classification system. It covers topics such as patent families, back files, newly published documents, and revision of the advanced level. The HARMONY project represents a further stage in the development of harmonised classification between the USPTO, EPO and JPO.
