40|$|Experimental {{testing of}} brittle rocks {{has shown that}} both brittle and <b>ductile</b> <b>behaviours</b> can be observed, {{depending}} {{on the level of}} confinement applied to the specimen. In particular, brittle rocks fail in a brittle mode as long as the confining stress falls below the Mogi line (Mogi 1966). Spalling of rocks is associated with brittle failure and is known to occur under low confinement, i. e. in the vicinity of excavation walls (Stacey 1981; Martin et al. 1999; Cai and Kaiser 2013). Indeed, at low confinement, large tension cracks may develop parallel to the excavation boundary when the stress exceeds the crack initiation threshold, which may lead to rapidly propagating instabilities and formation of thin slabs. Such slabs can represent a significant hazard to the workforce in confined mining excavations. Increasing the level of confinement modifies the nature and propagation mechanism of the cracks that develop upon loading: at high confinement, short shear cracks develop a [...] ...|$|R

Basic mechanical behaviours of cement-based materials and influences of saturation degree on such behaviours are first recalled.

An elastoplastic damage model is then proposed for the description of mechanical responses, {{taking into account the}} transition from brittle to <b>ductile</b> <b>behaviours</b> with the increase of confining pressure. The model is further extended to unsaturated conditions: a specific damage driving force and generalized effective stress concept for plastic flow are proposed. The procedure of determination of model's parameters is presented. The proposed model is applied to a standard mortar subjected to desiccation process. The main features of mechanical behaviours as well as the influence of saturation degree are correctly described by the proposed model. In particular, the kinetics of desiccation and related damage evolution are well reproduced.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{conducted}} several flexural {{tests of}} RC (reinforced concrete) columns retrofitted by SMA (shape memory alloy) wires. The RC columns with lap spliced reinforcements {{at the base}} show less <b>ductile</b> <b>behaviour</b> than those with continuous reinforcements. SMA wire jackets can increase the ductility of the RC columns with lap spliced reinforcements and thus this study used the two kinds of SMA wires to retrofit such RC columns; {{the first one is}} NiTi SMA wire that remains in martensite at room temperature and the other is NiTiNb SMA wire that is austenite at room temperature. Both the SMA wires show shape memory effect and provide active confinement for concrete. The SMA wires were prestrained to 7 % strain and released. At the state, some residual strain remained and can be recovered by heating. The prestrained SMA wires were wrapped around the plastic hinge region of the RC columns and then the temperature of the wires raised by heating. Then, the SMA wires induced an active confinement on the RC columns. Each wire was measured for recovery and residual stress to obtain the information of active confinement. This active confinement and the resistance of the SMA wires increased the <b>ductile</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the RC columns in lateral direction. The parameters in this study are the kinds of SMA and the pitch of the wires.

The analysis follows the well-established framework developed at Imperial College London for the appraisal of robustness of multi-storey buildings. For this scope a simplified nonlinear model of a typical precast concrete façade-system is developed. Particular attention is given to the connection system between structural frame and panel, recognised as the driving component of the nonlinear behaviour of the façade-system. Only connections involved in the gravity load path are evaluated (bearing connections). Together with standard connection, a newly proposed system (Slotted Bearing Connection) is designed to achieve a more <b>ductile</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the panel-connection system. A parametric study involving the dimensions of panel-connection components is developed to search for an optimal configuration of the bearing connection.

40|$|It {{is known}} that better {{understanding}} of events at the tool-workpiece interface will lead to better definition of the boundary conditions for the process models. The deformation of the oxide scale {{on the surface of}} steel being hot worked contributes to the interface complexity. This scale has a complicated microstructure, and can deform or fracture. In hot rolling, the deformation of the scale begins before the steel makes contact with the roll, under the influence of a tensile stress as the roll draws the metal into the roll gap. Tension tests under controlled conditions have been used to simulate this initial deformation and have revealed <b>ductile</b> and brittle <b>behaviour,</b> according to the operating conditions. This behaviour is also very sensitive to small changes in the chemical composition of the underlying steel. This is illustrated for two low-carbon steels.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis was to {{investigate}} confinement and ductility of lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) in compression. The main characteristics of LWAC in general are brittleness and uncontrolled crack propagation. Because of this, structural applications of LWAC is reduced compared to structural applications of NDC. To test confinement of LWAC, seven over-reinforced beams were loaded in four point bending. To achieve confinement of the tested beams, shear reinforcement was introduced. The geometry of the beams was 210 x 550 x 4500 mm (width x height x length). The test setup was designed to produce a constant moment zone of 1 m between the loading points. All the seven beams were designed to fail in compression between the two loading points. To compare results, the geometry of the beams was equal to the geometry used in a previous experimental study. The main test parameters that have been varied in this experimental study were stirrup spacing, amount of compressive reinforcement and size of concrete cover. Stalite with fraction 1 / 2 " was used as aggregate for the whole test programme. All beams and small specimens were casted from the same batch of concrete. The compressive strength and oven-dry density of the concrete {{used in this study}} was 65 MPa and 1834 kg/m^ 3 respectively. Four of the tested beams showed <b>ductile</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The beam without stirrups in the testing zone (between the loading points) did not show any <b>ductile</b> <b>behaviour.</b> All the beams were in the range 88 - 99 % of the calculated capacity. The beams with smaller stirrup spacing in the testing zone, showed more <b>ductile</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The beams with the largest concrete cover showed the largest capacity drop after the maximum load was reached. The test results indicated that reduced stirrup spacing gave an increase of ductility, with an exception of results from one beam. An increase of concrete cover decreased the confined area, generally leading to a reduction of ductility. The beam with a larger amount of compressive reinforcement showed an increase of ductility and capacity. Based on the experimental results of this study, it is possible to increase the ductility of LWAC structures and bring the application level of LWAC closer to the application level of NDC...|$|E

40|$|Most {{models in}} the {{literature}} {{that are used to}} understand and predict ductile failure, ductility or fracture toughness implicitly consider that the plastic response of the material is homogeneous {{at the level of the}} microstructure. However, in a number of situations, plasticity is intrinsically localized, because the microstructure is spatially heterogeneous, or because the loading leads to strain localization on the microscale, such as in fatigue loading, or because the dynamics of plastic flow are unstable, such as in Portevin-Le Chatelier instabilities. This paper presents, from analysing various examples, the influence of these strain localization phenomena on the <b>ductile</b> fracture <b>behaviour</b> of metallic alloys. Examples to illustrate these effects will be chosen from, firstly, internal necking between cavities growing to ductile fracture, secondly, damage mechanisms from fatigue persistent slip bands, thirdly, the effect of Portevin-Le Chatelier bands on toughness and, fourthly, damage mechanisms in alloys with precipitate-free zones at grain boundaries...|$|R

A characterization of necessary safety margins for the ductile failure of these steels is therefore required.
