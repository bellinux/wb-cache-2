Bellerophon {{had been in the}} dockyard for repairs, so the new crew was less than perfect in carrying out their duties. Fisher told them I intend to give you hell for three months, and if you have not come up to my standard in that time you'll have hell for another three months. Midshipman (later Admiral) A. H. Gordon Moore reported, Fisher was a very exacting master and I had at times long and arduous duties, long hours at the <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> <b>telegraphs</b> in cold fog, etc., and the least inattention was punished. It was, I think, his way of proving us, for he always rewarded us in some way when an extra hard bit of work was over.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Machinists have an {{increased}} risk of lung cancer and bladder cancer, and this may be caused by exposure to carcinogenic compounds such as asbestos and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the <b>engine</b> <b>room.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the exposure of <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> personnel to PAHs, with 1 -hydroxypyrene in urine as a biomarker. METHODS: Urine samples from <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> personnel (n = 51) on 10 ships arriving in different harbours were collected, as well as urine samples from a similar number of unexposed controls (n = 47) on the same ships. Urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene was quantitatively measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The exposure to PAHs was estimated by a questionnaire answered by the <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> personnel. On two ships, air monitoring of PAHs in the <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> was performed at sea. Both personal monitoring and area monitoring were performed. The compounds were analysed by gas chromatography of two types (with a flame ionisation detector and with a mass spectrometer). RESULTS: Significantly more 1 -hydroxypyrene was found in urine of personnel who had been working in the <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> for the past 24 hours, than in that of the unexposed seamen. The highest concentrations of 1 -hydroxypyrene were found among <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> personnel who had experienced oil contamination of the skin during their work in the <b>engine</b> <b>room.</b> Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed a significant relation between the concentrations of 1 -hydroxypyrene, smoking, and estimated exposure to PAHs. No PAHs were detected in the air samples. CONCLUSION: <b>Engine</b> <b>room</b> personnel who experience skin exposure to oil and oil products are exposed to PAHs during their work. This indicates that dermal uptake of PAHs is the major route of exposure...|$|R
