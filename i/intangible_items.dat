Enshrined in §3, the work-product doctrine protects tangible (and some <b>intangible)</b> <b>items</b> created in anticipation of the litigation (e.g., a memorandum from an attorney outlining his strategy in the case).

[...] Because the plaintiffs had access to the works in their idea form, by holding the notebooks Chang and Taflove did not interfere the plaintiffs' ability to use, control, access or publish their research and thus their actions do not constitute a claim for conversion under Illinois state law.|$|E
50|$|Sign {{language}} {{therapy has}} been identified {{as one of the top}} five most common treatments for auditory verbal agnosia. This type of therapy is most useful because, unlike other treatment methods, it does not rely on fixing the damaged areas of the brain. This is particularly important with AVA cases because it has been so hard to identify the causes of the agnosia in the first place, much less treat those areas directly. Sign language therapy, then, allows the person to cope and work around the disability, much in the same way it helps deaf people. In the beginning of therapy, most will work on identifying key objects and establishing an initial core vocabulary of signs. After this, the patient graduates to expand the vocabulary to <b>intangible</b> <b>items</b> or items that are not in view or present. Later, the patient learns single signs and then sentences consisting of two or more signs. In different cases, the sentences are first written down and then the patient is asked to sign them and speak them simultaneously. Because different AVA patients vary in the level of speech or comprehension they have, sign language therapy learning order and techniques are very specific to the individual's needs.|$|E

40|$|In {{some of the}} {{continental}} European countries (e. g. France), there is a necessity to make {{a clear distinction between}} the legal issue of commerce fund (fonds de commerce, in French language), and the related accounting concept represented by goodwill. Fonds de commerce represents a set of movable and immovable goods with a common destination, therefore having a unique legal status. Goodwill is an <b>intangible</b> asset <b>item</b> that is placed within the Balance Sheet. It holds together all the fonds de commerce elements which finally form a subset containing the following: (i) intangible assets; (ii) not evaluated, nor separately recorded; (iii) purchased, but not internally created; (iv) which compete for the maintenance and further development of the company’s activity potential. The goodwill issue appears very often within the consolidated accounts. A commercial relationship between the parent of a group and one of its subsidiaries may appear either through {{the creation of a new}} enterprise (initiated by the group leader), or by acquisition of already existent business. In this second case, we are talking about a business combination. The acquired goodwill is mentioned in the Balance Sheet, amongst non-current <b>intangible</b> asset <b>items.</b> The internally generated goodwill is not recognised within the Balance Sheet. Goodwill may be stated as the difference between the acquisition cost and the percentage belonging to the buyer within the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable acquired. In the advanced accounting systems, goodwill is no longer amortized. His useful life is undefined, but not unlimited. The fact that is no longer amortized determines an annual depreciation test. Such a depreciation test is meant to evaluate the goodwill on the basis of present cash flows...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} value {{relevance}} of intangible non-current assets (NCA) {{is important in}} the financial reporting literature due to the ever increasing interest in the components of <b>intangible</b> assets <b>items</b> including goodwill and intellectual capital. This study examines the value relevance of reported intangible NCA among firms listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia throughout a 12 -year period from 1990 until 2001. During this time period, Malaysia went through three different economic and accounting environmental conditions. Early 1990 s saw an excellent economic condition but with less stringent accounting regulatory period. However, 1997 and 1998 were the financial crisis period. In 1997, the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board (MASB) was established by the Malaysia government. From 1999 until 2001, Malaysia went through a recovery economic period plus a more stringent accounting regulatory framework. Based on the value relevance model, we find evidence that intangible NCA continuously show a negative association with firms’ share market price throughout the three different economic periods and accounting environments among our sample firms. However, as expected the association was not significant before the establishment of MASB compared to after. Our finding is consistent with extant studies on the issue of value relevance of intangible NCA during poor economic condition. However, our finding is not consistent with prior studies concerning value relevance of intangible assets during stable economic condition. Nevertheless, our finding is consistent with the on-going argument and theory of capitalized intangible assets more likely to reflect uncertain expected future cash flows, hence value relevance is perceived by investors to be biased...|$|R

Those same people are often less inclined to steal the same physical item from a shop. This raises the question, why do people have fewer reservations with stealing <b>intangible</b> <b>items</b> compared to tangible? Using questionnaires and fMRI we provide evidence across three studies as to the differences between tangible and intangible theft. In a questionnaire (Study 1), participants revealed that across different conditions they were more willing to steal intangible compared to tangible goods.

40|$|The {{development}} {{and application of}} performance measurement systems for a purchasing function within a professional service company possesses a great challenge for both practitioners and academics. Despite the increasing popularity of this topic, the systems that are currently developed are rarely adequate to be applicable at the business-unit level. Furthermore, the existing productivity measures are predominantly designed to measure performance in industries where the inputs and outputs are both tangible and standardized <b>items.</b> <b>Intangible</b> and non-quantifiable factors of production cannot be reliably measured by manufacturing performance methodologies. Consequently, purchasing professionals seek tools to accurately track purchasing performances and connect it to given business strategies and objectives. This paper aims to develop a design of the performance measurement system that can be applicable onto the optimize-sourcing department of the selected firm of this study. The first section of the paper outlines key performance measurement concepts and establishes a theoretical framework that supports the following research. Subsequent questionnaires and interviews that were conducted with vital stakeholders reveal the flaws of the current performance measurement system. Conclusions derived from the interviews and questionnaires support the findings of extensive literature reviews.

40|$|For {{the last}} two decades, authors (e. g. Ohlson, 1995; Lev, 2000, 2001) have {{regularly}} pointed out the enforcement of limitations by traditional accounting frameworks on financial reporting informativeness. Consistent with this claim, it has been then argued that accounting finds one of its major limits in not allowing for direct recognition of synergy occurring amongst the firm <b>intangible</b> and tangible <b>items</b> (Casta, 1994; Casta & Lesage, 2001). Although the firm synergy phenomenon has been widely documented in the recent accounting literature (see for instance, Hand & Lev, 2004; Lev, 2001) research hitherto has failed to provide a clear approach to assess directly and account for such a henceforth fundamental corporate factor. The objective {{of this paper is}} to raise and examine, but not address exhaustively, the specific issues induced by modelling the synergy occurring amongst the firm assets whilst pointing out the limits of traditional accounting valuation tools. Since financial accounting valuation methods are mostly based on the mathematical property of additivity, and consequently may occult the perspective of regarding the firm as an organized set of assets, we propose an alternative valuation approach based on non-additive measures issued from the Choquet's (1953) and Sugeno's (1997) framework. More precisely, we show how this integration technique with respect to a non-additive measure can be used to cope with either positive or negative synergy in a firm value-building process and then discuss its potential future implications for financial reporting.

40|$|Container {{lines have}} been the main {{transport}} mode linking most markets engaged in global trade. To cater for the growing customer demands, container lines have adopted various approaches such as forming strategic co-operations to achieve rapid growth and providing efficient services through the integration of resources. The spectrum of strategic co-operations among container lines varies from loose-knitted slot charters, liner conferences, shipping alliances, joint services and consortia, through to mergers and acquisitions (M&As). However, these forms of strategic co-operations {{have not always been}} able to achieve the intended synergetic growth resulting from the integration of resources. The Resource Based View (RBV) suggests that integrating intangible resources, which are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable (VRIN), can make a significant contribution to the performance of post strategic co-operations. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the contribution of intangible resources to the post strategic co-operation success of container lines. Therefore, the thesis focuses on the following primary research question (PRQ) : PRQ: Does the integration of intangible resources contribute to the post strategic co-operation success of container lines? To further examine PRQ two subsidiary research questions (SRQ 1 and SRQ 2) are explored. SRQ 1 : Which intangible resources provide the greatest contribution to the market success of container lines? SRQ 2 : Do container lines adopt processes to ensure the successful integration of intangible resources when strategic co-operations are being developed? The design used for this study is a two stage methodology enabling both quantative and qualitative research approaches. The two stage approach helps to identify firstly the senior managers‟ view of the importance of intangible resources and secondly how intangible resources are integrated during strategic co-operations among container lines. The sample consists of 84 senior managers (with a response rate of 51 per cent and thus 47 usable questionnaires) attached to regional offices of leading global container lines and their agents in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. The first stage was conducted via an exploratory mail survey with the objective of investigating senior managers‟ understanding of intangible resources, importantly, the findings of stage one enabled more probing questions to be developed and identified suitable respondents for the second stage of the research. Due to the need for more qualitative responses, stage two was conducted as in-person interviews, with a greater, focus on (i) the extent that intangible resources were being integrated, (ii) the processes adopted to integrate intangible resources, and (iii) the organisation and economic performance of container lines during post-strategic co-operation. The in-depth in-person interviews achieved 100 per cent response rate with participation of 36 senior managers. The findings of stage one, which addressed SRQ 1, revealed that respondents attach a higher importance to <b>intangible</b> resource <b>items</b> such as the reputation of the company, and organisational processes and capabilities. These intangible resources provide major benefits to container lines such as attracting customers and enabling internal functions of container lines including the closely related functions of marketing the services of the container lines. During the stage two in-person interviews, differences were found in how intangible resources were integrated among Limited integrated strategic co-operations (LISCs) (shipping alliances, joint services and consortia) and acquisitions. In LISCs, due to their loosely integrated structure and antitrust laws, sailing schedules have become the only closely integrated intangible resource. Other intangible resources such as organisational processes, capabilities and organisational culture are kept away from the strategic co-operations to gain competitive edge for the individual container lines. The integration of sailing schedules in LISCs has helped the container lines to increase the frequency of services, enter into new trade routes by reducing cost. In acquisitions, apart from sailing schedules intangible resources such as the capabilities and organisational processes of the acquirer container line are adopted by the new entity. The container lines adopted different processes such as organising staff meetings, mixed project teams, joint training sessions, and appointing task teams to integrate these intangible resources in acquisitions. However, colonising of the acquired container line with intangible resources of the acquirer container line and neglecting the important intangible resources of the acquired line has hindered the integration of acquired container line staff to the new entity. Hence, high staff turnover among senior managers was evident in all the acquisitions during the post-acquisition period. This top management turnover, especially in the marketing functions has adversely affected the intended synergetic growth of market share of these acquisitions. Thus, the two stage study helped address both PRQ and SRQ 2 by revealing that intangible resources are important to the market success of container lines, and container lines are advised to identify these intangible resources and adopt processes to integrate them when strategic co-operations are being formed...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Intangible {{cultural}} heritage (ICH) {{is a relatively}} recent addition to the corpus of international heritage law. Traditional conservation theory, which {{is the foundation of}} heritage law, has long delineated heritage only through physical manifestations such as monuments, sites and objects. Intangible heritage does not fit into these categories. To accommodate the introduction of living, non-material forms of heritage, the notion of {{cultural heritage}}, as defined in legal instruments, is undergoing a phase of re-conceptualisation. This thesis explores the shifts and divergence that have taken place within the heritage discourse to accommodate the notion of ICH. It explores the transformation of cultural heritage from its focus on tangible manifestations to a broader understanding of heritage in both tangible and intangible forms and the links between them. The conceptual development of intangible heritage reflects an intellectual shift stemming from discourse in international forums and a general criticism that monuments do not embody all forms of cultural heritage. This thesis also examines the delineation of intangible cultural heritage within heritage law and the broader discourse. It proposes to broaden the concept of ICH, as currently conceived, as a set of characteristics which constitute the concept. This thesis further explores how legislation relating to the heritage has been drafted and how safeguarding mechanisms have been developed. The development of intangible heritage theory and ICH law is shown to have been driven substantially by the work of UNESCO. This work has culminated in the adoption of the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003) (ICH Convention) and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005). In addition to these binding normative instruments, intangible heritage law finds its source in soft law instruments—i. e. legal instruments that do not provide legally-binding obligations. Soft law instruments are fundamental for the role that they play in the development of legal precepts which often develop to become customary law or jus cogens. Twelve soft law instruments are identified as having made a substantial contribution to the development of ICH law. The precepts enshrined within these documents inform safeguarding measures in legislative and policy documents. This thesis presents a critical analysis of both hard and soft law instruments. It is argued that ICH law draws upon, and finds its foundation in, three fundamental principles—the principles of cultural rights, the right to education and the right to community participation. These rights are framed, {{in the context of this}} study, as principles which developed within soft law and are further clarified within the ICH Convention. The critical analytical approach to intangible heritage law taken in this exploration reveals a number of issues. The first issue is that the national legislative instruments, and the mechanisms for safeguarding outlined within them, are still largely founded in Western conservation theory and legal norms. This approach is not necessarily reconcilable with the notion of ICH or the local realities of Asian legal systems. The legal systems of many countries in Asia comprise not only state-based legal systems but also unofficial legal systems based on social power structures and customary/community law. The second issue is that there is a fundamental inconsistency between the international and national legal frameworks on heritage conservation. The Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage places strong emphasis on community participation. However, legislating at the national level for the safeguarding of ICH to meet State Party obligations established by the Convention results in a top-down approach that largely transposes Western legal norms into non-Western legal contexts. On the one hand the Convention calls for bottom-up community safeguarding measures, which would incorporate local customary laws and values, and on the other it still relies heavily on top-down state legal systems. This is particularly manifested in some Asian countries where aspects of customary legal systems are themselves an element of the countries’ ICH and as such are the object of safeguarding measures, yet may be in conflict with state legal systems. Through a practical examination of Cambodian heritage law, as applied to the Angkor World Heritage Site, this thesis indicates that the legal framework that protects Angkor is overwhelmingly focused on tangible heritage. The existing framework is largely unchanged from that of the former French administration and reflects an outdated Eurocentric notion of heritage in its physical form. The focus on the tangible has been perpetuated since the World Heritage Convention was introduced by the international emphasis placed on the preservation of the monuments. This thesis shifts the focus to Angkor’s intangible cultural heritage. The analysis highlights a substantive gap in the legal framework and the need for a holistic management approach that incorporates the safeguarding of both the physical and the intangible cultural heritage. The thesis further explores, through the case study of Angkor, how international obligations are interpreted and implemented at a local level. The divergent ideologies of international law and policy, and of states and local communities are further highlighted. The role of local customary systems, in the practice of intangible heritage, presents further conundrums that need to be examined. In order to safeguard intangible heritage values a fine line must be walked between the freezing of culture, the commodification of tradition, the commercialisation of customs, the authenticity of practice, the maintenance of ethnicity and identity, the realisation of cultural rights and the politicisation of heritage. The tackling of these issues implies the need for a balance of competing forces–state and local, private and public, law and custom – and presents both challenges and opportunities for the protection of ICH. The findings presented in this thesis conclude that the safeguarding of ICH necessitates a broader approach than that inherent in the ICH Convention. It argues that further emphasis needs to be placed on local communities’ involvement in safeguarding measures. This requires a fundamental power shift and a move away from state-based regulatory frameworks as the sole means of protecting ICH. The use of localised culturally-sensitive policy approaches, which incorporate community-based legal systems and cultural rights theory, is one possible solution. This broader approach goes beyond the development of an inventory or list of <b>intangible</b> heritage <b>items,</b> nor is it based solely on legal mechanisms. Instead, the analysis of heritage law and the findings at Angkor, suggest the development of a localised culturally-sensitive mixed policy and law approach that is founded on the principles of cultural rights, community participation and education incorporating local ideologies and ‘bottom-up’ mechanisms. The thesis concludes that a full appreciation of the outstanding universal value of heritage sites requires the research, respect and safeguarding of intangible heritage. A draft policy document, which draws on these conclusions, has been developed and is put forward to contribute to the safeguarding of ICH both at Angkor and globally...|$|R

In terms of international climate technology transfer, which comprises both mitigation and adaptation technologies, the prevailing paradigm refers to mainly North–South flows of technology and financial investments, e.g. {{in the frame of}} bilateral and development aid. According to another, complementary paradigm ITT may also take place among groups of countries, e.g. SIDS or LDCs, from developing to developed nations [South–North] as well as among developing countries [South–South] (Brewer 2008). Relating to the intangible dimension of knowledge, Kathuria (2002) suggests a further aspect that analyses of ITT need to address: the movement of people.|$|E
40|$|In a post-industrial economy {{based on}} knowledge, {{the value of}} {{business}} does not given only by physicalproduction capacities, but also by other intangible components such as : trademarks, know-how, patents, technicaldrawings, etc. Many companies may be very valuable because of the control held on these intangible assets and notbecause of some tangible assets. It is especially the case of companies in areas that matter greatly the mark on whichthe property is sold and not necessarily the sold property. This truth of knowledge economy led to developments also in the accounting area regarding accounting forintangible assets. Intangible assets are classified as fixed assets (with long life). Accounting of <b>intangible</b> <b>items,</b> namelythe recognition and evaluation, {{it is far from}} uniform, but takes different forms depending on the Accounting frame towhich the entity reports and that presents the annual financial statements. Further, this article deals with intangible assets from two perspective s: a line with International AccountingReference (International Financial Reporting Standards -IFRS), and the second line with the reporting framework inRomania (Order of Minister of Public Finance no. 1752 / 2005, published in Official Gazette no. 1080 b is) complieswith European Directives (Directive IV of the European Economic Community – CEE and Directive VII of CEE) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{main goal}} of the article is to propose a new {{framework}} exhibiting relationship between tangible dimension and all other intangible dimensions of SERVQUAL used to analyse the relation to re-patronage intention. Research Design & Methods: Hypothesised relationships were tested on data which was collected in Bangkok area using a survey questionnaire. Final sample consisted of 225 respondents, frequent visitors of community malls. The data was analysed using exploratory factor analysis as well as simple and multiple regression analysis. The six constructs, studied in this paper, were examined for differences in means across all demographic variables by employing analysis of variance or ANOVA. Findings: The results exposed that tangible dimension had significant correlation to reliability, empathy, responsiveness and assurance dimensions consecutively. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that re-patronage intention was explained by empathy, responsiveness and assurance dimensions, not reliability dimension. The ANOVA tests showed {{no significant differences in}} means of general data and all other constructs. Implications & Recommendations: To make shoppers {{to come back to the}} malls, managers should recognize the important role of tangible items as an antecedent to <b>intangible</b> <b>items.</b> Retail developers could devote more efforts to maximize the attractiveness of tangible elements and identify the weak areas of service quality by examining the multi-item constructs used to measure service quality. Contribution & Value Added: This study proposed and tested a modified conceptual model adapted from that proposed by Reimer and Kuehn (2005) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{accounting}} harmonisation has been debated for years among accounting professionals around the globe. The {{discussion about the}} uniform application of IFRSs across different jurisdictions {{has been based on}} the different environmental factors, typical of each national economic background. In particular, the effects of the application of IFRSs could be heterogeneous across countries and influenced by national reporting environments. This means that equal levels of compliance with mandatory disclosure requirements and/or consistent measurement and display of similar transactions between different companies may not be achieved. The paper deals with the accounting harmonisation process in Italy, which belongs to Continental Europe, focusing on a very delicate topic: intangible assets, whose importance has progressively increased, especially in recent years. More specifically, the aim of the paper is to define a framework for the problems deriving fromthe introduction of a process connected with the accounting and assessment of intangible assets in the drawing up of financial statements. In particular, the accounting of <b>intangible</b> <b>items,</b> namely the recognition and evaluation, is far from uniform and takes different forms depending on the accounting frame to which the entity presents the annual financial statements. This article deals with intangible assets from two perspectives: a first line with International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRSs), and a second with the Italian General Accepted Accounting Principle which complies with European Directives...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The paper aims {{to explore}} whether <b>intangible</b> <b>items</b> that {{recognised}} in financial statements are value-relevant to {{investors in the}} French context, and whether these items affect the value relevance of accounting information. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical {{data were collected from}} a sample of French listed companies, over the nine-year period of 2005 to 2013. Starting of Ohlson’s (1995) model, the correlation analysis and the linear multiple regressions have been applied. Findings: We find that intangibles and traditional accounting measures as a whole are value relevant. However, the amortization and impairment charges of intangibles and cash flows do not affect the market values of French companies, unlike other variables, which affect positively and substantially the market values. Also goodwill and book values are more associated with market values than intangible assets and earnings respectively. Finally, we find that intangibles have improved the value relevance of accounting information. Practical implications: French legislators must give more interest for intangibles, in order to enrich the financial statements content and increasing the pertinence of accounting information. Auditors must give more attention for intangibles’ examination process, in order to certify the amounts related to intangibles in financial statements, and hence enrich their reliability, what provides adequacy guarantees for investors to use them in decision making. Originality/value: The paper used recently available financial data, and proposed an improvement concerning the measure of incremental value relevance of intangibles items. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} broad areas of public {{administration}} that require valuation for public goods. One {{of these areas}} is concerned with value for cost benefit analysis. The concept here is quantitative, in money terms, and {{the purpose is to}} aid decision making. Planners and economists either calculate, or estimate total costs and total benefits of programs or projects as an aid to decision making. The second broad area involves justifying, or allocating public resources. Benefits bestowed by intangibles such as the arts, or questions that affect the environment are difficult to quantify as value may involve concepts the beneficiaries find difficult to identify or describe. The concept of value involves total costs, but also may involve perceptions of the community about value. Valuation costs may be calculated from the aggregate demand, but estimating demand can be difficult. The third broad area involves estimating demand for government services such as those provided by the Bureau of Statistics, and the Department of Administrative Services, as well as many others, who are being required to charge fees for services previously provided without direct charge. This development is part of the trend called corporatisation now occurring in many countries, including Australia. Economists and planners have a range of approaches available to assist them in the estimation of value, whether it be for the purpose of comparing costs with benefits, or for estimating the demand for tangible or <b>intangible</b> <b>items</b> like the arts or statistics. Surveys have been used for many years to assist a wide range of decisions by private enterprise. The use of surveys by government in Australia has been limited, but is increasing. US and European governments have used surveys to value both more and less tangible public goods since 1970. Surveys have also proved useful to assist many other decisions, including policy making, developing the means for implementing policies, monitoring and adjusting programs, and evaluation. This paper is primarily concerned with surveys. A particular type of survey, known as contingent valuation (CV), has been developed to assist the estimation of value for intangible public goods. Also discussed are other applications of surveys for government decision making, and other ways of imputing or estimating values, largely developed by economists and planners to assist cost benefit analysis. Three examples of surveys used to estimate values are discussed. These include a survey of Sydney households to help estimate the value of clean water; an Australia wide survey to help estimate the value of the arts; and a survey of Australians to help estimate the value of Coronation Hill without mining development. While the paper suggests that surveys have potential to assist a range of government decisions, examples also demonstrate the care required to obtain results that are reasonably precise and reliable...|$|E

[...] Department of Economics and Social Sciences Consortium. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 This dissertation presents {{an examination of}} the pharmaceutical industry with a primary focus on the importance of intangible assets from the original institutional economics perspective. This is done in three main chapters. The first main chapter examines the importance of intangible assets {{within the context of the}} heterodox theory of the business enterprise. It is argued that in the early stage of the going concern – where production is separate from consumption – intangible assets necessitate the creation of monetary bargaining transactions. In industrial capitalism – with the internal separation of the enterprise into industrial and pecuniary divisions – intangible assets take the form of rationing transactions, limiting the number of sellers of a particular product. As the enterprise then evolves into its modern joint-stock form in money manager capitalism, intangible assets become the basis for capitalization, upon which incorporeal property may be issued, increasing the return to shareholders. The second main chapter discusses the structure and performance of the pharmaceutical industry. Based on the concept of centralized private sector planning and Alfred Chandler’s theory of learned organizational capabilities, I develop a core nexus understanding of pharmaceutical industry activity. The core is seen as made up of 15 firms who dictate the direction and evolution of the industry as a whole. I then examine the performance of this core using measurements of financial ratios. Measuring performance in this way is consistent with the stated motives of the business enterprise under money manager capitalism, which embodies the dominance of pecuniary habits of thought over industrial ones. The third main chapter combines the first two, examining one specific member of the core – the Pfizer Corporation – and examines the importance of intangible assets on its activity. Over time, it is shown that Pfizer has become more reliant on intangible assets as an overall portion of total assets, its net tangible assets – the book value of the company – has become negative, and Pfizer relies more heavily on drugs obtained through acquisition, rather than internal development. Money manager capitalism, as a regime of accumulation, rewards enterprises that take on an intangible characteristic. In the pharmaceutical industry, this is done with the aid of mergers and acquisitions due to accounting rules for <b>intangible</b> <b>items</b> such as goodwill and the division of labor between the core and nexus. Dominant pharmaceutical firms, then, should be seen as rent-collecting institutions, as opposed to productive entities.

40|$|The central {{argument}} of this thesis {{is that the}} institution of private property reflects an anthropocentric worldview and is contributing to the current environmental crisis. Drawing on the description of law as a mirror of society, it considers how our idea of law and the institution of private property can adapt to reflect the recent scientific description of human beings as interconnected and mutually dependant on nature. It advocates a paradigm shift in law from anthropocentrism {{to the concept of}} Earth community. The thesis first provides an example laws anthropocentrism by exploring the legalphilosophical concept of private property. Private property is advanced over other legal concepts, because it {{plays a key role in}} governing human interactions with the environment and because it contains some of law’s main messages about nature and our place within it. The thesis analyses three main influences on the development of private property from the humanism of antiquity, the scientific revolution and the influence of liberal political philosophy. It concludes that the dominant rights-based theory of private property is anthropocentric and facilitates environmental harm. The second component of the thesis explores contemporary scientific evidence supporting the ecocentric concept of Earth community. This concept argues that human beings are deeply connected and dependent on nature. It also describes the Earth as a community of subjects and not a collection of objects. Assuming that the social sphere is an important source for law, this thesis considers how a paradigm shift from anthropocentrism to ecocentrism can influence the development of legal concepts. To catalyse this shift, it considers the ‘new story’ proposed by cultural historian and theologian Thomas Berry. This story describes contemporary scientific insights such as interconnectedness in a narrative form Third, the thesis uses the alternative paradigm of Earth community to articulate an emerging legal philosophy called Earth Jurisprudence. It describes Earth Jurisprudence as a theory of natural law and advocates for the recognition of two kinds of law, organised in a hierarchical relationship. At the apex is the Great Law, which represents the principle of Earth community. Beneath the Great Law is Human Law, which represents rules articulated by human authorities, which are consistent with the Great Law and enacted for the common good of the comprehensive Earth Community. In regard to the interrelationship between these two legal categories, two points are crucial. Human Law derives its legal quality from the Great Law and any law in contravention of this standard is considered a corruption of law and not morally binding on a population. Finally, the thesis constructs an alternative concept of private property based on the philosophy of Earth Jurisprudence. It describes private property as a relationship between members of the Earth community, through tangible or <b>intangible</b> <b>items.</b> To be consistent with the philosophy of Earth Jurisprudence, the concept of private property must recognise human social relationships, include nonreciprocal duties and obligations; and respond to the ‘thing’ which is the subject matter of a property relationship. A theory of private property that overlooks any of these considerations is defective and deserves to be labelled such. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, Law School, 201...|$|E
