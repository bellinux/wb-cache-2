5|$|The Naval Treaties of the 1920s and 1930s {{limited the}} number of battleships, though {{technical}} innovation in battleship design continued. Both the Allied and Axis powers built battleships during World War II, though the increasing importance of the aircraft carrier meant that the battleship played a less important role than <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{spent more}} than $62million {{of his own money}} on his campaign, the most {{expensive}} Senate campaign in U.S. historyover $33million of this was spent on the primary election alone, where he defeated former Governor James Florio 58–42%. Franks had been a last-minute choice because New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to run for the Senate. The record $62million amount surpassed Michael Huffington, who spent nearly $28million in an unsuccessful 1994 Senate race.|$|E

5|$|In early November 2010 the United States {{launched}} QE2, {{the second}} round of quantitative easing, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b> The Federal Reserve made an additional $600 billion available for the purchase of financial assets. This prompted widespread criticism from China, Germany, and Brazil that the United States was using QE2 to try to devalue its currency without consideration to the effect the resulting capital inflows might have on emerging economies.|$|E
5|$|Truman's second inauguration was {{the first}} ever {{televised}} nationally. His second term was grueling as his opponents controlled Congress and his policy of rollback in Korea failed. The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, which was much {{more powerful than the}} Soviets' atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b> The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E

5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the Hampstead Railway in only seven years, its opening {{was not the}} financial success that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b> In the Hampstead Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 25million passengers, just half of the 50million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be greatly over-optimistic, as did the improvement in passenger numbers expected on the newly electrified MDR – in each case achieving only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was {{much more difficult to}} fly than <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected,</b> and would not be safe {{in the hands of an}} inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} Mach2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake ramps were variable. Initially, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> that a Mach1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach0.85, {{reducing the amount of}} titanium and therefore cost. A pair of small vanes mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride. The first three B-1As featured the escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member.|$|E

5|$|In the United States and Canada, Tower Heist {{opened in}} 3,367 theaters. The film took $85,000 from midnight {{screenings}} {{and a total}} of $8.5million opening Friday, becoming the number one grossing film for the day. Although the film <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to be the number one film for the weekend, it took $10.5million on the opening Saturday, falling behind the animated film Puss in Boots ($15.3million). Tower Heist became the number two film for the weekend with $24million, behind Puss in Boots ($34million), with 70% of the audience being over the age of 25—the largest segment, 27%, being over 50—and 56% male. The opening audience was ethnically diverse consisting of 48% Caucasian, 21% African American, and 21% Hispanic.|$|E
5|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> {{that use}} of the chutes to {{transfer}} salt between the canal and the river would cease once the lift was opened, but {{by the turn of}} the 19th century, although there were 190,000 tons of cargo using the lift each year, 38,000 tons of salt were still being transferred by chute. From the middle of the 19th century, some of the salt traffic transferred to the railways, and the use of pipelines through which the brine was pumped also affected trade, but as that source of revenue declined, a chemical industry developed in the area around Northwich, which became the major source of income for the Navigation.|$|E
5|$|Kemp's {{ankle injury}} {{took a lot}} longer to heal than <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected,</b> and the team {{reported}} that they hoped {{to get him back}} in September. However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at the plate and his return date was pushed back. He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E

5|$|Nash was {{selected}} as captain of South Melbourne for the 1937 season to replace the retiring Jack Bisset, {{becoming part of the}} first father and son team to captain a VFL/AFL side. It is thought that South Melbourne's newly appointed coach Roy Cazaly influenced the selection of Nash as captain, as Cazaly, Nash's coach in Tasmania, believed Nash to be the best footballer ever. There was some controversy over Nash's selection as captain, as it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> that vice-captain Brighton Diggins would be named captain. In response, Diggins quit South.|$|E
5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein. No. 3 Commando landed at La Breche, west of Ouistreham at 09:05 coming ashore in the second wave. They were engaged before they hit the beach, {{and three of the}} landing craft that the Commandos were travelling in were hit by high-velocity shells. Casualties were high, with No. 6 Troop suffering at least 20 wounded, but in the end they were lower than <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Civil Partnership Act {{came into}} effect on 1 January 2011. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> {{that the first}} ceremonies would not take place until April 2011 due to a three-month waiting period {{required}} by law for all civil ceremonies. However, the legislation does provide a mechanism for exemptions to be sought through the courts, and the first partnership, which was between two men, was registered on 7 February 2011. While this ceremony was carried out publicly in the Civil Registration Office in Dublin, the mainstream media were not present.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{opened on}} 1 May 1945 when the 26th Brigade Group {{landed on the}} small island of Tarakan off {{the east coast of}} Borneo. The goal of this operation was to secure the island's airstrip as a base to support the planned landings at Brunei and Balikpapan. While it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip, intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19 June and the airstrip was not opened until 28 June. As a result, the operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile.|$|E

The competition was won by British athlete Amy Williams, who set new course records for the track on her first and third runs. Williams, who had never before won a World Cup or World Championship event, became the first British athlete to win a solo Winter Olympic gold medal in 30 years. German sliders Kerstin Szymkowiak and Anja Huber won the silver and bronze medals respectively. Williams' teammate Shelley Rudman, who had won the silver medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics, and Canadian Mellisa Hollingsworth, both of whom <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to be in medal contention, were disappointed.|$|E
