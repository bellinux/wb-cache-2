The removal of the nest and relocation of the eggs and young will end the attacks by the parent birds. The eggs are incubated and the resulting young, {{as well as other}} young removed from problem nests, are then placed in foster nests in more remote areas. Preliminary results indicated this will be a very successful way of dealing with the young of problem kites and is an effective way of resolvin...|$|R
50|$|The eastern osprey (Pandion cristatus) is a <b>diurnal,</b> {{fish-eating}} <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b> It {{is a large}} raptor, reaching {{more than}} 60 cm in length and 180 cm across the wings.

50|$|The {{black-winged kite}} (Elanus caeruleus) {{is a small}} <b>diurnal</b> <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> in the family Accipitridae {{best known for its}} habit of {{hovering}} over open grasslands in the manner of the much smaller kestrels. This Eurasian and African species was sometimes combined with the Australian black-shouldered kite (Elanus axillaris) and the white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus) of North and South America which together form a superspecies. This kite is distinctive, with long-wings, white, grey and black plumage and owl like forward-facing eyes with red irises. Although mainly seen on the plains, they are sometimes seen on grassy slopes of hills in the higher elevation regions of Asia. They are not migratory, but make short-distance movements in response to weather.|$|R

5|$|All lemurs, {{particularly}} the smaller species, {{are affected by}} predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs, despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native euplerids, such as the fossa, feral cats, domestic dogs, snakes, <b>diurnal</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> owls, and crocodiles. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus Aquila and the giant Malagasy crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus mahery), {{as well as the}} giant fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including the giant subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than they are today. Today, predator size only restricts owls to the smaller lemurs, usually 100g (3.5oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger <b>diurnal</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> such as the Madagascan harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) and the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus).|$|E
50|$|The osprey (Pandion haliaetus) — {{also called}} fish eagle, sea hawk, river hawk, and fish hawk — is a <b>diurnal,</b> {{fish-eating}} <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> with a cosmopolitan range. It is a medium raptor, reaching more than 60 cm {{in length and}} 180 cm across the wings. It is brown on the upperparts and predominantly greyish {{on the head and}} underparts.|$|R
500|$|The white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), {{also known}} as the white-breasted sea eagle, is a large <b>diurnal</b> <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> in the family Accipitridae. Originally {{described}} by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, it is closely related to Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands, and the two are considered a superspecies. A distinctive bird, the adult white-bellied sea eagle has a white head, breast, under-wing coverts and tail. The upper parts are grey and the black under-wing flight feathers contrast with the white coverts. The tail is short and wedge-shaped as in all Haliaeetus species. Like many raptors, the female is slightly larger than the male, and can measure up to [...] long with a wingspan of up to , and weigh [...] Immature birds have brown plumage, which is gradually replaced by white until the age of five or six years. The call is a loud goose-like honking.|$|R
5000|$|The {{placement}} of Cruschedula as a penguin was not challenged until 1946 by eminent paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson. After examining the holotype, Simpson concluded {{there were no}} distinguishable details that defined the bone as from a penguin, but {{did not have any}} opinion as to what bird group it may have belonged to. [...] The fossil was again restudied in 1964 by Pierce Brodkorb, who asserted the fossil to not be a tarsometatarsus but rather the end of a scapula. In his Catalogue <b>of</b> Fossil <b>Birds</b> Brodkorb placed the genus into the <b>diurnal</b> <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> family Accipitridae. [...] This placement was followed by Simpson in his 1972 Conspectus of Patagonian fossil penguins However, the placement was rejected by Eduardo P. Tonni in his 1980 paper The present state of knowledge <b>of</b> the Cenozoic <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> Argentina where he considered the bone fragment upon which the genus was erected to be undiagnostic. This assessment was supported by Storrs L. Olson in 1985, who quoted Tonni's assessment of the Cruschedula holotype as undiagnostic.|$|R
5|$|The primary predators of {{this species}} are <b>diurnal</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> such as falcons and hawks. During nesting, corvids, grackles, housecats, or rat snakes will prey on their eggs. Cowbirds rarely parasitize {{mourning}} dove nests. Mourning doves reject slightly under a third of cowbird eggs in such nests, and the mourning dove's vegetarian diet is unsuitable for cowbirds.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike <b>diurnal</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than <b>diurnal</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study of bones recovered in various current Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) nests in a Mediterranean region of the Iberian Peninsula. The Egyptian vulture, a <b>diurnal,</b> scavenging, rupicolous <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> is one <b>of</b> four vulture species that currently inhabit the Iberian Peninsula. An analysis of the remains found in the nests confirms that it has a heterogeneous diet that includes remains from human activities (butchery and food production) and the carcasses of dead animals, although it is possible that they also prey on small-sized taxa. The taphonomic study determines these birds" capability of transporting, accumulating and altering bone remains. Some of the elements show marks caused by beak and/or claw impacts brought about primarily during feeding, which have characteristic typologies. Despite {{the fact that this is}} not a bone-eating vulture, it can also be seen that some bones are swallowed. The characteristics of the bone set studied here are important for establishing the origin of bone accumulations on archaeological sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this thesis is a survey on the helminthic fauna of 60 wild canids, 57 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and three wolves (Canis lupus italicus), {{collected}} in Modena and Bologna provinces, Emilia-Romagna region, Italy. The study focused mainly on the gastrointestinal and hepatic helminths. In total, 15 helminth species were identified, two trematodes, seven cestodes and six nematodes. Our study shows that foxes are reservoir hosts of potential zoonotic parasites, including A. alata, a rare digenean trematode in the Italian paeninsula. In the second chapter we present a research on E. granulosus in red foxes from Eastern Emilia-Romagna. Despite not succeeding in isolating the parasite from the intestines analysed, we identified 16 helminth species among which the trematodes Alaria alata and Phagicola sp., the cestode Joyeuxiella sp. and the nematode Molineus legerae, all representing rare helminth species in the Emilia-Romagna region. The third chapter consists of a deeper analysis {{of the discovery of}} the trematode Alaria alata in our region. In the fourth chapter we present a research on respiratory helminths of 90 red foxes from Eastern Emilia-Romagna. Three nematode species were described, namely Eucoleus aerophilus, Filarioides hirthi and Crenosoma vulpis. The fifth chapter is a parasitological survey on the helminthic fauna of 67 <b>diurnal</b> and nocturnal <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b> The helminth community was richer in falconiform and accipitriform than in strigiform birds. In particular A. nisus and B. buteo showed the highest number of parasite species. The sixth chapter is a study on gastro-intestinal nematode parasitic infection in adult cattle (dairy and brood cows) bred in Italy. The survey was performed collecting 427 fecal samples from a bovine slaughterhouse in the province of Bologna. One hundred abomasa were also examined to assess the presence of worm burdens...|$|R

5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and <b>diurnal</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes {{such as the}} western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance {{with a piece of}} fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E

25|$|In 1779 English {{illustrator}} John Frederick Miller was {{the first}} European to describe the secretarybird, and it was soon after assigned to its own genus Sagittarius by French naturalist Johann Hermann in his Tabula Affinitatum Animalium. It was not until 1935 that the species was moved to its own family, distinct from all other birds of prey—a classification confirmed by molecular systematics. Recent cladistic analysis has shown Sagittariidae to be an older branch of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> than Accipitridae and Falconidae, but a younger divergence than Cathartidae. Sometimes, the enigmatic bird Eremopezus is classified as an early relative of the secretarybird, though this is uncertain as the bird is only known from a few fragmentary body parts such as the legs. The earliest fossils associated with the family are two species from the genus Pelargopappus. The two species, from the Oligocene and Miocene respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more {{like those of the}} Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family. In spite of their age, it is not thought that the two species are ancestral to the secretary bird.|$|E
