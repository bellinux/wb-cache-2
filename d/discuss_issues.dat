5|$|In 1956 Driberg {{convened a}} group of Christian socialists that met {{regularly}} at the Lamb public house in Bloomsbury to <b>discuss</b> <b>issues</b> such as imperialism, colonialism, immigration and nuclear disarmament. The group's dispatches, Papers from the Lamb, led to the foundation in 1960 of the Christian Socialist Movement. Although no longer an MP, Driberg remained {{a member of the}} Labour Party's NEC and was active in party affairs. In 1957, in the face of antagonism from trade union leaders repelled by his lifestyle, he became Labour Party chairman, a largely ceremonial role. He travelled widely during his year in office, generally as a Reynolds News correspondent but using the party title to advantage whenever he could. Thus, in a 1958 visit to Moscow to interview space scientists, he obtained two meetings with Nikita Khrushchev.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) talks {{briefly to}} Sen. Lipton about animal rights, and Lipton (who Oscar {{suspects}} is gay) gives Oscar his private cell phone number, asking Oscar {{to call him}} in the evening to <b>discuss</b> <b>issues</b> further. Oscar tells Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that the Senator was hitting on him. Jim says Lipton was likely just schmoozing a voter, talks to Lipton himself, and also gets his number. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) later gets Lipton's number as well, resulting in Oscar thinking that the senator {{may not have been}} hitting on him. When Oscar is leaving, Lipton shakes his hand and caresses Oscar's arm for long enough that Oscar once again believes Lipton was pursuing him.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the revolution of 1905, Tsar Nicholas II accepted a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, after which Lenin felt it safe to return to St. Petersburg. Joining {{the editorial board of}} Novaya Zhizn ("New Life"), a radical legal newspaper run by Maria Andreyeva, he used it to <b>discuss</b> <b>issues</b> facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for a successful revolution. Recognising that membership fees and donations from a few wealthy sympathisers were insufficient to finance the Bolsheviks' activities, Lenin endorsed the idea of robbing post offices, railway stations, trains, and banks. Under the lead of Leonid Krasin, a group of Bolsheviks began carrying out such criminal actions, the best known taking place in June 1907, when a group of Bolsheviks acting under the leadership of Joseph Stalin committed an armed robbery of the State Bank in Tiflis, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Lenin had {{not wanted}} {{to return to the}} Russian Empire, fearing arrest. He changed his opinion when Tsar Nicholas II {{accepted}} a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, with Lenin believing that these would protect him from the Okhrana. Thus, Lenin and his wife returned to Russia in cognito via Sweden and Finland, moving between different safe houses in St. Petersburg, from which he monitored events and wrote up many of his ideas on the progress of the revolution. He was invited to join the editorial board of Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maxim Gorky's wife M.F. Andreyeva, and used this as a vehicle to <b>discuss</b> <b>issues</b> facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and also advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for the revolution to succeed. However, after the armed Moscow Uprising failed, Lenin began to urge the party to stand in elections for the Duma, believing that this would raise the party's public profile. At a Bolshevik Congress in Tampere, Finland, Lenin first met young Bolshevik Joseph Stalin. He also changed his mind {{on the issue of the}} Mensheviks, and began calling for reconciliation between the party's two factions. Members of both groups met at the 4th Party Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in April 1906 where the Mensheviks condemned Lenin for supporting bank robberies and encouraging violence. The Congress resulted in the election of a new Central Committee comprising 7 Mensheviks and 3 Bolsheviks.|$|E
