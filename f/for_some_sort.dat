5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E

5|$|The Smoking Man {{meets with}} the Syndicate, who are {{responsible}} for the bees. Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he wants to hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E

25|$|Like his foe Rommel (and his {{predecessor}} Wavell and successor Montgomery), Auchinleck {{was subjected to}} constant political interference, having to weather a barrage of hectoring telegrams and instructions from Prime Minister Churchill throughout late 1941 and {{the spring and summer}} of 1942. Churchill constantly sought an offensive from Auchinleck, and was downcast at the military reverses in Egypt and Cyrenaica. Churchill was desperate <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of British victory before the planned Allied landings in North Africa, Operation Torch, scheduled for November 1942. He badgered Auchinleck immediately after the Eighth Army had all but exhausted itself after the first battle of El Alamein. Churchill and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Alan Brooke, flew to Cairo in early August 1942, to meet Auchinleck, where it emerged he had lost the confidence of both men.

25|$|In 1802 Napoleon {{built the}} Ourcq canal which brought 70,000 {{cubic meters of}} water a day to Paris, while the Seine river {{received}} up to 100,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day. The Paris cholera epidemic of 1832 sharpened the public awareness of the necessity <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of drainage system to deal with sewage and waste water in a better and healthier way. Between 1865 and 1920 Eugene Belgrand lead the development of a large scale system for water supply and waste water management. Between these years approximately 600 kilometres of aqueducts were built to bring in potable spring water, which freed the poor quality water to be used for flushing streets and sewers. By 1894 laws were passed which made drainage mandatory. The treatment of Paris sewage, though, was left to natural devices as 5,000 hectares of land were used to spread the waste out to be naturally purified. Further, the lack of sewage treatment left Parisian sewage pollution to become concentrated downstream in the town of Clichy, effectively forcing residents to pack up and move elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|While off {{the burning}} Tysami, at 11:00 pm the Chui A-poo {{and his men}} were spotted in {{fourteen}} large junks heading southwest in two lines of seven vessels. Hay ordered his men to battle stations, raised his colors and then gave chase. The wind was very calm but Hay counted on this as it meant his steam ships could advance while the junks could barely move. At 11:45 the Columbine fired the first shots at the largest junk closest to her. The British scored some hits {{but not enough to}} disable any of the junks. From there on the battle continued for several hours as the Columbine chased the pirates, occasionally exchanging fire. The pirates were searching <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of waterway to escape but they found none and it was not until noon the following morning on September 29 that the main action occurred. Chui A-poo was heading west followed by Columbine when the Canton appeared, roughly in front of the war-junks. Seeing the chase, Cantons commander Lieutenant Bridges changed course into the direction of the pirates in order to assist Commander Hay.|$|E
25|$|The Jagdwaffe defences of Germany {{were not}} {{considered}} {{a part of the}} offensive air effort. The German strategy of focusing on offensive aviation to achieve superiority on the enemy, on the home front the force was considered second-rate and unimportant. It did not receive the investment it needed and was too weak in respect of other Luftwaffe arms for proper expansion after the start of hostilities. As a consequence, the force had no representation in the High Command. The organisation remained split under different Air Fleets and was not put under a unified command. When the need <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of air defence was recognised before the outbreak of war, the rush to build the Jagdwaffe was so fast that quality in cohesion and organisation suffered. The expansion, when it did come, came too late. Only nine Jagdgeschwader were in existence in 1939, and no new Geschwader (Wings) were created until 1942. The years 1940 and 1941 were wasted. Only eight were created for defence duties, and the force increased in size by only one-third. The growth of the force and its concepts owed much to the activity of its enemies. The planning of defence was always reactive.|$|E
40|$|Disunification is an {{extension}} of unification to first-order formulae over syntactic equality atoms. Instead of considering only syntactic equality, I extend a disunification algorithm by Comon and Delor to ultimately periodic interpretations, i. e. minimal many-sorted Herbrand models of predicative Horn clauses and, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>sorts,</b> equations of the form s^(x) s^(x). The extended algorithm is terminating and correct for ultimately periodic interpretations over a finite signature and gives rise to a decision procedure for the satisfiability of equational formulae in ultimately periodic interpretations.

Such completions are a key ingredient to several inductionless induction methods...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we aim {{to provide}} a notion of "relative objects", i. e. objects {{equipped}} with <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of subobjects, in differential topology.

Moreover, we want even more direct differential calculus on relative objects and extension of classical notions and theories to relative situations; e. g. functions, vector fields, jet bundles, singularities, and so on. To establish this, the notion of arrangements of manifolds is introduced, which, for example, enables us to control behaviors of smooth maps on manifolds around corners.
