Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E
5|$|The Ulstermen {{eventually}} rouse, {{one by one}} at first, {{and finally}} en masse. The final battle begins. Cú Chulainn stays on the sidelines, recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing. He enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps {{his side of the}} bargain and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field. Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune moment she gets her period, and although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he spares her because he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it right to kill women, and guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as Athlone.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, Macon Dead Jr.'s sister, Pilate, {{is seen as}} nurturing—an Earth Mother character. Born {{without a}} navel, she is a {{somewhat}} mystical character. It is strongly implied that she is Divine—a female Christ—in spite of her name. Macon (Jr.) has not spoken to his sister for years and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> highly of her. She, like Macon, has had to fend for herself {{from an early age}} after their father's murder, but she has dealt with her past in a different way than Macon, who has embraced money as the way to show his love for his father. Pilate has a daughter, Reba, and a granddaughter named Hagar. Hagar falls desperately and obsessively in love with Milkman, and is unable to cope with his rejection, attempting to kill him at least six times.|$|E

On day two, Rubens Barrichello took over and completed 111 laps, finishing third in the standings. This was followed by Button topping the timesheets on the third day by over a second clear of Felipe Massa's Ferrari, completing 130 laps. In response, Massa hailed the BGP 001 as the most competitive pre-season car, stating that he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> anyone can top their times and that Ferrari is currently less competitive than Brawn GP. On {{the final day of the}} test, Barrichello replicated the feat of his team-mate; topping the time sheets by over eight-tenths of a second from Nico Rosberg's Williams, completing 110 laps.|$|E

When he asks her if the problem is Pelléas, she replies {{that he is not}} the cause but she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> he likes her. Golaud tells her not to worry: Pelléas can behave oddly and he is still very young. Mélisande complains about the gloominess of the castle, today {{was the first time she}} saw the sky. Golaud says that she is too old to be crying for such reasons and takes her hands to comfort her and notices the wedding ring is missing. Golaud becomes furious, Mélisande claims she dropped it in a cave by the sea where she went to collect shells with little Yniold. Golaud orders her to go and search for it at once before the tide comes in, even though night has fallen. When Mélisande replies that she is afraid to go alone, Golaud tells her to take Pelléas along with her.|$|E

500|$|Shelley {{frequently}} laments {{the poor}} education on offer to Italians, although she hopes this will spur them to revolt. She <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> {{much of the}} Germans. In her earlier travels, she had described the Germans as rude and disgusting; in 1842, she wrote to her half-sister Claire Clairmont, [...] "I do dislike the Germans—& never wish to visit Germany again—but I would not put this in print—for the surface is all I know."

In a talking head interview, Karen admits that even though she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> he is [...] "into her," [...] she is [...] "kind of into him".|$|E
