40|$|Goal: This {{activity}} {{is designed to}} introduce students to geologic processes on Earth and model how scientists use Earth {{to gain a better}} understanding of other planetary bodies in the solar system. Objectives: Students will: 1. Identify common descriptor characteristics used by scientists to describe <b>geologic</b> <b>features</b> in images. 2. Identify <b>geologic</b> <b>features</b> and how they form on Earth. 3. Create a list of defining/distinguishing characteristics of <b>geologic</b> <b>features</b> 4. Identify <b>geologic</b> <b>features</b> in images of other planetary bodies. 5. List observations and interpretations about planetary body comparisons. 6. Create summary statements about planetary body comparisons...|$|R

50|$|Pre-stack {{inversion}} {{is often}} used when post-stack inversion fails to sufficiently differentiate <b>geologic</b> <b>features</b> with similar P-impedance signatures. Simultaneous inversion solves for S-impedance and density, in addition to P-impedance. While many <b>geologic</b> <b>features</b> can express similar P-impedance characteristics, few will share combined P-impedance and S-impedance traits (allowing improved separation and clarity). Often a feasibility study using the wells logs will indicate whether separation of the desired lithotype can be achieved with P-impedance alone or whether S-impedance is also required. This will dictate whether a pre- or post-stack inversion is needed.|$|R
