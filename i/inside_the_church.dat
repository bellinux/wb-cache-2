Adjoining the church are a convent, sacristy, adoration room/chapel, and an ecclesiastical museum {{in honor of}} the Our Lady of Turumba. The museum contains clothes, perfumes, jewelry, and other historic memorabilia. The original oil painting, found by fishermen, can also be found inside the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was done by volunteers under the {{direction}} of paid plumbers, electricians, and craftsmen. In addition, all of the pattern-makers and mechanics who worked on the building did so without pay. There was also a group of women who shined marble and granite until the pieces were full of luster.|$|E

5|$|The frescoes <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> are {{commonly}} dated to the 14th–15th century, though they follow a standard compositional model {{which had been}} established in Bulgarian church decoration since the 13th century. Unusually, most of the captions which accompany the images are in Byzantine Greek, though a few are in Old Church Slavonic. In terms of style, the murals {{have much in common}} with churches from the southwestern Bulgarian lands.|$|E
5|$|In 1724 the 14th century spire of the Church of the Holy Ghost in Crowcombe {{was damaged}} by a {{lightning}} strike. The top {{section of the}} spire was removed and is now planted in the churchyard, and stone from the spire {{was used in the}} flooring of the church. <b>Inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> carved bench-ends dating from 1534 depict such pagan subjects as the Green Man and the legend of the men of Crowcombe fighting a two-headed dragon.|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 study, Mavrodinov {{also writes}} {{that at the}} time, the church lacked a roof. He {{references}} {{a story about a}} group of Circassians that were settled in Sapareva Banya on the order of the Ottoman authorities after the Crimean War (1853–1856). According to that story, the Circassians sought to pull down the church's roof. However, one of them fell to his death <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> so they fled in horror. The church was thoroughly reconstructed in 1937 by a team under architect Rashenov.|$|E

5|$|<b>Inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718. During {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E
5|$|Reddish {{paintings}} on wooden panels commissioned by Father Antonio Ubeda from 1856 to 1859 {{can be found}} <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> These are the Ascension of Our Lord and Pentecost on the doorway; and two portraits of the Doctors of the Church. A third portrait belonging to the set of Doctors of the Church is on the church museum while the fourth portrait is lost. The paintings Agony in the Garden and Crowning of Thorns, also commissioned by Father Úbeda, is currently housed at the San Agustin Museum in Intramuros, Manila. The works of art are done by Liberato Gachalian.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St. Mary and St. Radegund is a Church of England church, {{located at}} the south end of the village, {{adjoining}} the rectory. It is the only church in the village. Parts of the church date back to different centuries, the earliest being 12th, with later parts added in the 13th, 15th and 16th century. In April 2007, the village's post office was relocated inside the church's bell tower, the first of its kind to actually be located <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Round Church {{featured}} {{marble and}} limestone cornices. These included {{a large number}} of intertwined ornaments and details, such as palmettes, grape clusters, leaves, and chamfers. Besides classic ornamental shapes, the cornices feature some that are entirely new in character or well-known yet redesigned motifs. Floral decoration dominates the cornices. Tiles found <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> ruins depict birds and other animals in addition to geometric shapes and floral motifs, all glazed in either brown, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. The walls were covered in polished marble facing with encrusted shapes.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Garrison Church {{was founded}} in 1212 by Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester. After centuries of decay, it became an {{ammunition}} store in 1540. The marriage of CharlesII to Catherine of Braganza {{took place in the}} church in 1662. After the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in 1814, large receptions were held <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> In 1941, a firebomb fell on the roof, destroying the nave. The church's chancel was saved by servicemen shortly after the raid; however, replacing the roof was determined to be impossible due to the large amounts of salt solution the stonework had absorbed over the years.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other large tombs from the 18th {{century in the}} churchyard—some of which are good {{examples}} {{of the use of}} artificial Coade stone, popular at the time—and several brass and stone memorial tablets <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> from the 16th century onwards. George Hutchinson has a prominent wall memorial in the chancel in addition to his tomb outside; local sculptor Richard Joanes designed it, and there are Coade stone embellishments. Other carved tablets, such as those to Reverend Lewin and Nicholas Spencer, are by obscure London-based mid-19th-century sculptor T. Marsh.|$|E

5|$|If {{the church}} from the {{marginal}} note is equated with the Round Church, {{then it can}} be conclusively dated {{to no more than}} a few years before 907. While the church can be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, some scholars have suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of at least part of the church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} architecture, the church {{features}} a round dome {{and a single}} apse. The naos or cella has {{the shape of a}} cross, in line with the popular Byzantine cross-in-square design. Of particular interest is the formerly two-storey narthex, which is notable for its unusual verticality and the towers {{on either side of the}} entrance. Judging by the models depicted in the donor's portraits <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> it is clear that the towers were originally further apart and the west facade with the narthex included much woodwork. The towers are topped off by sharp-pointed pyramidal elements, with additional sharp-pointed details in each of the pyramids' four corners. The towers and their design are entirely unusual and unprecedented in medieval Bulgarian church architecture. Art historian Nikola Mavrodinov believes these resemble Gothic architecture, though a more modern researcher, Bistra Nikolova, dismisses his assessment and considers these an influence from Hungary or Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|In {{the church}} are bronze plaques commemorating the eleven local {{people who died}} in World War I and the six {{who were killed in}} World War II. There is also a stained glass window showing a saint with a sword {{standing}} on a snake, and crossed flags commemorating those from World War II. There is also a memorial plaque to the local Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> and just inside the porch, on the left of the church door, is a stone figure holding an anchor, which was moved to the church from Walley Court with the flooding of the lake. There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family, then living at the court, by Queen ElizabethI.|$|E
