With {{the help of}} Karma Paul, {{who had been on}} all the Everest expeditions since 1922, they engaged {{fourteen}} Sherpas but Shipton decided he needed perhaps a couple more and a nineteen-year-old was selected. He was completely inexperienced in mountaineering but was chosen according to Shipton largely because of his attractive grin– Tenzing Norgay. The party headed north through Sikkim into Tibet and then travelled west towards Everest on a route through Sar– further south and nearer to Nepal than earlier expeditions had used. When they reached the Nyonno Ri (...) and Ama <b>Drime</b> (...) mountains they split into three groups for exploration. This had all been contrary to the stipulations in their passports issued by Tibet and they were ordered back north through Gyankar Nangpar and onto the traditional road. Earlier from Nyonno Ri they had had a fine view of Everest in unusually good weather conditions and it has since been speculated that, had they made a dash for the summit, they might have succeeded. However, Shipton made no such bid, and indeed it was forbidden by his passport and by the remit of the expedition. They reached Rongbuk Monastery on 4 July.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Ama <b>Drime</b> range {{located at}} the {{transition}} between the high Himalayan range and south Tibet is a N-S active horst that offsets the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS). Within the horst, a paragneissic unit, possibly attributed to the upper Himalayan crystalline series, overly the lower Himalayan crystalline series Ama <b>Drime</b> orthogneissic unit containing large metabasite layers and pods that have experienced pressure >= 1. 4 GPa. Combining structural analysis with new and published pressure-temperature (P-T) estimates as well as U-Th/Pb, Ar- 39 /Ar- 40 and (U-Th) /He ages, the P-T-deformation-time (P-T-D-t) paths of the main units within and {{on both sides of}} the horst are reconstructed. They imply that N-S normal faults initiated prior to 11 Ma and have accounted for a total exhumation <= 0. 6 GPa (22 km) that probably occurred in two phases: the first one until similar to 9 Ma and the second one since 6 to 4 Ma at a rate of similar to 1 mm/yr. In the Ama <b>Drime</b> unit, 1 to 1. 3 GPa (37 to 48 km) of exhumation occurred after partial melting since similar to 30 Ma until similar to 13 Ma, above the Main Central Trust (MCT) and below the STDS when these two fault systems were active together. The switch from E-W (STDS) to N-S (Ama <b>Drime</b> horst) normal faulting between 13 and 12 Ma occurs at the time of propagation of thrusting from the MCT to the Main Boundary Thrust. These data are in favor of a wedge extrusion or thrust system rather than a crustal flow model for the building of the Himalaya. We propose that the kinematics of south Tibet Cenozoic extension phases is fundamentally driven by the direction and rate of India underthrusting...|$|E
40|$|The Ama <b>Drime</b> Massif (ADM) is an {{elongate}} north-south trending antiformal {{feature that}} extends ∼ 70 km north across {{the crest of}} the South Tibetan Himalaya and offsets the position of the South Tibetan Detachment system. A detailed U(-Th) -Pb geochronologic study of granulitized mafic eclogites and associated rocks from the footwall of the ADM yields important insights into the middle to late Miocene tectonic evolution of the Himalayan orogen. The mafic igneous precursor to the granulitized eclogites is 986. 6 ± 1. 8 Ma and was intruded into the paleoproterozoic (1799 ± 9 Ma) Ama <b>Drime</b> orthogneiss, the latter being similar in age to rocks previously assigned to the Lesser Himalayan Series in the Himalayan foreland. The original eclogite-facies mineral assemblage in the mafic rocks has been strongly overprinted by granulite facies metamorphism at 750 °C and 0. 7 – 0. 8 GPa. In the host Ama <b>Drime</b> orthogneiss, the granulite event is correlated with synkinematic sillimanite-grade metamorphism and muscovite dehydration melting. Monazite and xenotime ages indicate that the granulite metamorphism and associated anatexis occurred at < 13. 2 ± 1. 4 Ma. High-grade metamorphism was followed by postkinematic leucogranite dyke emplacement at 11. 6 ± 0. 4 Ma. This integrated data set indicates that high-temperature metamorphism, decompression, and exhumation of the ADM postdates mid-Miocene south directed midcrustal extrusion and is kinematically linked to orogen-parallel extension. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSecondary {{magnetic}} remanences {{are used}} to study late-orogenic rotation and tilting on a E-W transect in southern Tibet at _ 28. 5 _N. Sampling was performed {{on both sides of}} the Ama <b>Drime</b> Massif (ADM). Remanent magnetization resides in pyrrhotite formed during metamorphism and is related to the last cooling event through 325 _C (Curie temperature of pyrrhotite). The existence of antipodal pTRMs demonstrates that the ChRM is of thermoremanent origin and was acquired during cooling of the Tethyan metasediments. Penetrative deformation was still going on in Ronghbuk area until ca 250 _C, whereas it was already completed in Dinggye area. Significant departures from the expected field direction during the age of remanence acquisition cannot be interpreted by consistent vertical axis rotation of blocks. Antagonist deviations {{on both sides of the}} ADM are explained as tiltings around an horizontal axis striking _N 20 _. These tiltings are estimated to be younger than 13 - 12 Ma and they are related to the ADM exhumation initiated since 33 Ma...|$|E
40|$|International audienceActive eclogitization has {{recently}} been inferred at depth beneath the Himalaya from geophysical observations, and the mechanical consequences of eclogitization {{can be observed in}} the field in the eroded and extended nappe stack of the Scandinavian Caledonides. There, Proterozoic metastable granulites and igneous protoliths underwent partial eclogitization during the collision of Baltica with Laurentia. The reaction began in pseudotachylites and veins and eventually formed a connected network of eclogite-facies shear zones that localized deformation and weakened the lower crust of Baltica during the collision with Laurentia. All these features can be compared with the seismic activity of the Indian Lower Crust, its strength loss beneath the Himalayan ranges, and its delayed density increase regarding its penetration in the eclogite facies. The Caledonian Bergen Arc eclogites and the Himalayan Ama <b>Drime</b> eclogites are both derived from continental crust. In both cases, these eclogites were formed contemporaneously with the activation of the main thrusts responsible for the construction of the orogenic wedges, the Main Central Thrust in the Himalayas, and the main thrust below the Jotun Nappe Complex in the Caledonides. The similarities in these two orogens, which compare both in size and structure, highlight the importance of eclogitization at depth as a mechanism for weakening of the lower crust and for decoupling of the crust and lithospheric mantle in collision zones...|$|E
40|$|U(-Th) -Pb dating of zircon, monazite, and {{xenotime}} from metamorphic and {{igneous rocks}} at two outcrops along a north-south transect in the Mount Everest region of southern Tibet provide new {{constraints on the}} timing and duration of thermal events associated with channel flow and the ductile extrusion of the Greater Himalayan Series (GHS). At the southernmost outcrop in the Kangshung Valley, Th-Pb ages from monazite indicate that prograde metamorphism associated with crustal thickening following the India-Asia collision occurred at least as early as 38. 9 ± 0. 9 Ma. A subsequent sillimanite-grade metamorphic event at 28. 0 ± 1. 2 Ma was followed by two phases of leucogranite emplacement at 20. 8 ± 0. 8 and 16. 7 ± 0. 4 Ma. At Thongmön, ∼ 40 km to the northeast of the Kangshung Valley, prograde metamorphism was occurring at ∼ 25. 4 Ma and lasted until 16. 1 ± 0. 1 Ma, reaching ∼ 740 °C and 5 kbar at 22. 4 ± 0. 2 Ma. Immediately following metamorphism, two phases of leucogranite were emplaced at 15. 2 ± 0. 2 and 12. 6 ± 0. 2 Ma, with an intervening phase of ductile deformation. These data combined with ages from the Rongbuk glacier and Ama <b>Drime</b> range, north and east of Everest and the North Himalayan Mabja dome 100 - 140 km to the northeast, suggest that GHS metamorphism lasted ∼ 20 m. yr. and that migmatization and south-directed channel flow peaked around ∼ 23 - 20 Ma and ended by ∼ 16 Ma.

40|$|The {{metamorphic}} {{evolution of}} a granulitized eclogite from the Phung Chu Valley (Eastern Himalaya) was reconstructed combining microstructural observations, conventional thermobarometry and quantitative pseudosection analysis. The granulitized eclogite consists of clinopyroxene, plagioclase, garnet, brown amphibole, and minor orthopyroxene, biotite, ilmenite and quartz. On the basis of microstructural observations and mineral relationships, four metamorphic stages and related mineral assemblages have been recognized: (i) M 1 eclogite-facies assemblage, consisting of garnet, omphacite (now replaced by a clinopyroxene + plagioclase symplectite) and phengite (replaced by biotite +plagioclase symplectite); (ii) M 2 granulite-facies assemblage, represented by clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, garnet, plagioclase and accessory ilmenite; (iii) M 3 plagioclase + orthopyroxene corona developed around garnet, and (iv) M 4 brown amphibole + plagioclase assemblage in the rock matrix. Because of the nearly complete lack of eclogitic mineral relics, M 1 conditions can be only loosely constrained at > 1. 5 GPa and > 580 degrees C. In contrast, assemblage M 2 tightly constrains the peak granulitic stage at 0. 8 - 1. 0 GPa and > 750 degrees C. The second granulitic assemblage M 3, represented by the plagioclase + orthopyroxene corona, formed at lower pressures (similar to 0. 4 GPa and similar to 750 degrees C). During the subsequent exhumation, the granulitized eclogite experienced significant cooling to nearly 700 degrees C, marked {{by the appearance of}} brown amphibole and plagioclase (M 4) in the rock matrix. U-Pb SHRIMP analyses on low-U rims of zircon from an eclogite of the same locality suggest an age of 13 - 14 Ma for the M 3 stage. The resulting decompressional clockwise P-T path of the Ama <b>Drime</b> eclogite is characterized by nearly isothermal decompression from > 1. 5 GPa to similar to 0. 4 GPa, followed by nearly isobaric cooling from similar to 775 degrees C to similar to 710 degrees C. Modelling of phase equilibria by a calculated petrogenetic grid and conventional thermobarometry on a biotite-garnet-sillimanite metapelite hosted in the country rock granitic orthogneiss extends the inferred P-T trajectory down to similar to 630 degrees C and similar to 0. 3 GPa...|$|E
