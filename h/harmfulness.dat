2500|$|A {{consistence}} of {{zero tolerance}} {{is the absolute}} dichotomy between the legality of any use and no use, equating all illicit drugs and any form of use as undesirable and harmful to society. This is contrasting to viewpoints of those who stress the disparity in <b>harmfulness</b> among drugs, {{and would like to}} distinguish between occasional drug use and problem drug use. Although harm reductionists also see drug use as undesirable, they hold that the resources would do more good if they were allocated toward helping problem drug users instead of combating all drug users.

2500|$|The LMG {{underwent}} great growth between 1929 and 1932, {{partly as}} a result of the requirement of Komsomol members to join it. The LMG's hold over the Komsomol is reflected in the latter's programme at its 10th congress that state 'The Komsomol patiently explains to the youth the <b>harmfulness</b> of superstitions and of religious prejudices, organizing for this purpose special study circles and lectures on antireligious propaganda. [...] The League had grown from 87,000 members in 1926 to 500,000 in 1929 and it reached a peak of 5,670,000 in 1931 (dropping to 5.5 million in 1932) (it had intended to get 17 million, however, as its target). It declined to 2 million in 1938, but rose again to 3.5 million in 1941. The Communist party at the time had 1.8 million members. Almost half of the LMG's membership, however, resided in the vicinities of Moscow and Leningrad, which led to the LMG then creating 'cells' across the country in order to reach rural citizens for atheist propagation.|$|E
2500|$|By the 16th century, {{the humanist}} {{ideas of the}} Renaissance (14th–16th century) were slowly accepted; France had {{propagated}} them first to Germany, then to England, during the Protestant Reformation (1517). In that intellectual humanist mode, university education began including preparing the student for a civilized life — of culture and civility — and concern for society’s public affairs. To achieve that, the curriculum comprised the liberal arts Trivium (grammar, rhetoric, logic), and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music) meant {{to prepare students for}} further specialized education in either theology, the law, or medicine. In 1492, the socio-political consequences of the discovery of the New World expanded European university curricula, as human rights and international law became contemporarily relevant matters. The Spanish enslavement of the native (aboriginal) populaces they conquered in the [...] “New World” of the Americas eventually raised ethico-moral questions in Europe about the human rights of the American aboriginals — questions of cultural tolerance evinced by Renaissance humanism, the Bible, and mediæval theories of natural law. In analogy to the ancient world’s works, Rüegg relates the “New World” idea to the idea of “new knowledge”. In the mid-16th century, scholarly and scientific journals made it feasible to “spread innovations among the learned”; by the 18th century, universities published their own research journals. In the 18th century, the Age of Enlightenment also encouraged education’s transition, from the “preservation and transmission of accepted knowledge” to the “discovery and advancement of new knowledge”; the newer universities effected that change more quickly, and adapted Enlightenment ideas about the <b>harmfulness</b> of monarchic Absolutism more readily than did the older universities.|$|E
60|$|O.--I {{think you}} cannot make any {{accurate}} or logical distinction in such matters; but that {{common sense and}} instinct have, in all civilised nations, indicated certain crimes of great social <b>harmfulness,</b> such as murder, theft, adultery, slander, and such like, which it is proper to repress legally; and that common sense and instinct indicate also the kind of crimes which it is proper for laws to let alone, such as miserliness, ill-natured speaking, {{and many of those}} commercial dishonesties which I have a notion you want your paternal government to interfere with.|$|E

This {{relation}} of social character to the possible supply of good Art {{is still more}} direct when we include in our survey the mass of illustration coming under the general head of dramatic caricature--caricature, that is to say, involving right understanding of the true grotesque in human life; caricature of which the worth or <b>harmfulness</b> cannot be estimated, unless we can first somewhat answer the wide question, What is the meaning and worth of English laughter? I say, [...] "of English laughter," [...] because if you can well determine the value of that, you determine {{the value of the}} true laughter of all men--the English laugh being the purest and truest in the metal that can be minted. And indeed only Heaven can know what the country owes to it, on the lips of such men as Sydney Smith and Thomas Hood. For indeed the true wit of all countries, but especially English wit (because the openest), must always be essentially on the side of truth--for the nature of wit is one with truth. Sentiment may be false--reasoning false--reverence false---love false,--everything false except wit; that must be true--and even if it is ever harmful, it is as divided against itself--a small truth undermining a mightier.|$|E

A harmful man, when he is in office, O how much {{mischief}} may he do! Such an one is partial in doing his office, such an one will put the poor by his right, such an one will buy and sell a cause, a man, an interest, will do or not do, as his <b>harmfulness</b> prompts him to it; 'so is a wicked ruler over the poor people' (Prov 28:15). But now our Jesus, our High Priest, is holy, harmless; he will wrong no man, he will deprive no man, he will contemn no man, he will deny to no man that comes to God by him, the benefit and advantage of his blessed intercession; he respecteth not persons, nor taketh reward. A harmful man will stomach, and hate, and prejudice a man; will wait {{for an opportunity to}} do him a mischief; will take the advantage, if he can, to deny him his right, and keep from him his due, when yet it is in the power of his hand to help him. O! but Christ is harmless, harmless as a dove, he thinks no ill, intends no ill, doth no ill; but graciously, innocently, harmlessly, makes intercession for thee; nor will he be prevailed with to prejudice thy person, or to forbear to take up thy name into his lips, be thy infirmities, and weaknesses, and provocations never so many, if thou indeed comest to God by him. He is holy, and harmless, and so the more fit to become our High Priest and to make intercession for us.|$|E

50|$|The culpability {{principle}} {{is often used}} in deciding the punishment of offenders. However there are large numbers of punishments handed down which do not obey this principle.

For example, in Australia the punishment for speeding up to 30 km over the legal speed limit is 3 demerit points.
