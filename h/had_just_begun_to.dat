25|$|The city <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> {{recover from}} the 1926 {{hurricane}} when another devastating hurricane struck, this time to the north, in Palm Beach County. The 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane only slightly damaged Fort Lauderdale, but the enormous death toll contributed to the perception that Florida was not the paradise that had been promoted by developers. When the Great Depression struck in 1929, it {{had little effect on}} the city, which was already in a depression from the real estate bubble burst three years earlier.|$|E
25|$|In February 1866 Surprise {{was visiting}} the Greek island of Santorini, {{which is part}} of the rim of a volcano. The ship {{witnessed}} clouds of steam and explosions as a new island 100 yards long and 50 wide <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> appear from the seabed a few days earlier. The eruption completely filled a channel through Santorini and then began to encroach on houses on the land. Surprise visited a number of ports around the Mediterranean, reporting on their facilities for the Admiralty.|$|E
25|$|Throughout June, Sherman {{continued}} {{to attempt to}} outmaneuver Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's forces. On the 22nd, the regiment saw a stiff fight at the Battle of Kolb's Farm. In this battle, the men had stacked their arms toward the rear of a position they <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> fortify with breastworks, when suddenly two divisions of Confederate troops appeared in the clearing. After running to retrieve their rifles and loading them as {{they returned to the}} line, the 46th and the rest of their brigade, supported by artillery, proceeded to handily repulse the Rebels, inflicting terrible casualties, but incurring very few of their own.|$|E

25|$|In 1884, {{his mother}} died and his aging father was growing weaker, forcing Phan to help support the family. In 1885, the Cần Vương {{movement}} began its uprising against French rule, hoping to install the boy Emperor Hàm Nghi as the ruler of an independent Vietnam by expelling colonial forces. The imperial entourage fled the palace in Huế and attempted to start the uprising from a military base in Nghệ An. The scholar gentry of the province rose up, and Phan attempted to rally approximately 60 classmates who were prospective examination candidates {{to join in the}} uprising. Phan called his new unit the Army of Loyalist Examination Candidates (Si tu Can Vuong Doi) and convinced an older cử nhân graduate to act as its commander. They <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> collect money and raw materials to make ad hoc weapons when a French patrol attacked the village and scattered the students. Phan's father forced him to seek out the commander to have the membership list destroyed to avoid French retributions.|$|E
25|$|Wilder {{moved with}} her family from Wisconsin in the year 1869, when she was two years old. They stopped in Rothville, Missouri, and settled in Kansas, in Indian country near what is now Independence. Her younger sister Carrie (1870–1946) was born there in August 1870, not long before they moved again. According to Wilder in later years, {{her father had been}} told that the {{location}} would soon be open to white settlers but that was incorrect; their homestead was actually on the Osage Indian reservation and they had no legal right to occupy it. They <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> farm when they heard rumors that the settlers would be evicted, and they departed in spring of 1871. Although Laura portrayed the leave and that of other settlers as prompted by rumors of eviction in both her novel and in her Pioneer Girl memoirs, in the memoirs she also noted that her parents needed to recover their Wisconsin land because the buyer had not paid the entire mortgage. Several Kansas neighbors apparently were allowed to buy the land they had settled on so the rumors may have been untrue.|$|E

500|$|Virginia is {{also seen}} in Poe's prose. The short story [...] "Eleonora" [...] (1842)which {{features}} a narrator preparing to marry his cousin, {{with whom he}} lives alongside her mothermay also refer to Virginia's illness. When Poe wrote it, his wife <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> show signs of her illness. It was shortly thereafter that the couple moved to New York City by boat and Poe published [...] "The Oblong Box" [...] (1844). This story, which shows a man mourning his young wife while transporting her corpse by boat, seems to suggest Poe's feelings about Virginia's impending death. As the ship sinks, the husband would rather die than be separated from his wife's corpse. The short story [...] "Ligeia", whose title character suffers a slow and lingering death, may also be inspired by Virginia. After his wife's death, Poe edited his first published story, [...] "Metzengerstein", to remove the narrator's line, [...] "I would wish all I love to perish of that gentle disease", a reference to tuberculosis.|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{has said}} that he prefers to believe the {{overdose}} was accidental. He recalled that Drake's parents had described his mood in the preceding weeks as having been very positive, and that he had planned to move back to London to restart his music career. Boyd believes that this uplift in spirits was followed by a [...] "crash back into despair". Reasoning that Drake may have taken a high dosage of antidepressants to recapture this sense of optimism, he said he prefers to imagine Drake [...] "making a desperate lunge for life rather than a calculated surrender to death". Writing in 1975, NME journalist Nick Kent commented on the irony of Drake's death {{at a time when he}} <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> regain a sense of [...] "personal balance". In contrast, Gabrielle Drake has said she prefers to think her brother committed suicide, [...] "in the sense that I'd rather he died because he wanted to end it than it to be the result of a tragic mistake. That would seem to me to be terrible." ...|$|E
500|$|Abandoning his {{position}} at Fromentières, where Marmont's infantry <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> irrupt, Blücher ordered {{the continuation of}} the retreat towards Champaubert and Étoges, with Kleist's Corps on the left, south of the road and Kaptzevitch's Corps on the right, north of the road. Again taking advantage from the flat terrain, Grouchy was able to advance rapidly and fall onto the rear of the Coalition infantry squares, which were now slowly withdrawing in echelon and efficiently using the terrain to take shelter from the artillery bombardment. With night approaching and their retreat towards Étoges now barred by enemy cavalry, the Prussian squares began to lose cohesion. Spotting this weakness, Grouchy, who had been reinforced by Bordesoulle's division, energetically launched his three divisions against the Coalition squares, dispersing a number of them, with these men fleeing in disorder to take refuge in the Étoges forest. The old Blücher, who had been bravely exposing himself to great danger in order to boost the morale his men, was almost taken prisoner, together with his Chief of Staff, Gneisenau, Generals [...] Kleist, Kapsevitch and Prince Augustus of Prussia.|$|E

By the time Marcy wrote his 1859 guide, canned foods were increasingly available but remained expensive. Canning also added weight to a wagon.

[...] Her scholarship incorporated {{a variety of}} structuralist and poststructuralist perspectives—including deconstruction, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and feminist theory—into a critical, interdisciplinary study of literature. [...] As a scholar, teacher, and translator, Johnson helped make the theories of French philosopher Jacques Derrida accessible to English-speaking audiences in the United States {{at a time when}} they <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> gain recognition in France.
