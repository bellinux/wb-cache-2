40|$|INTRODUCTION The current rage of {{activity}} in superconductivity research and tantalizing hints of room-temperature superconductors have sent researchers worldwide scurrying in search of clever uses for superconductive materials. In our own scurrying we investigated the theoretical properties of an ideal superconducting coaxial cable (see FIGURE 1) for the transmission of information over large distances (many kilometers). We found that at 100 GHz bandwidth the intrinsic attenuation along such a cable is on the order of. 1 dB per kilometer. Furthermore, for a given cable, the loss {{is proportional to the}} square of the frequency. Thus, at 10 GHz, one could expect losses on the order of 10 - 3 dB/km. This low loss, coupled with a generous signal to noise ratio, provides bit rates of 100 Gbit/sec over more than 600 kilometers. At 10 Gbit/sec the distance increases to over 60, 000 kilometers: about 1. 5 times the earth's circumference. Such a highbandwidth, <b>extre...</b>|$|E

For the factoids, we explored the meta approach: we submit the questions to the several open domain question answering systems available on the Web and applied our redundancy-based triangulation algorithm to analyze their outputs in order to identify the most promising answers. Our results support the added value of the meta approach: the performance of the combined system surpassed the underlying performances of its components. To answer definitional ("other") questions, we were looking for the sentences containing re-occurring pairs of noun entities containing the elements of the target. For robust retrieval, we applied our redundancy based Internet mining technique to identify the concepts (single word terms or phrases) that were highly related to the topic (query) and expanded the queries with them. All our results are above the mean performance in the categories in which we have participated, with one of our robust runs being the best in its category among all 24 participants.

40|$|This article investigates, both {{theoretically}} and empirically, {{the economics}} of stock market crashes. Using more than 100 years of daily data on the DJIA (and shorter series on NASDAQ, IBM, and Caterpillar), we first document empirically that (a) {{the probability of a}} daily stock market decline in excess of 5 % is non-negligible (about 0. 25 %); (b) stock market crashes are not only relatively more likely to occur than rallies (higher crash arrival rates), but substantially more brutal; (c) the pre- 1945 crash valuation measures depart radically from the post- 1945 counterpart with the left tail decaying to zero much slower than the right tail; and (d) the motion of large percentage price declines and rises conforms closely with the characteristics of the Fr'echet distribution (asymptotically). To realistically model the empirical properties of crashes and extremes, we propose a family of Markov processes for which the density of the maximum percentage price drop can also be derived. The objective probability of the crash is found to be related, in an intuitive manner, to higher-order moments of the return distribution. Examination of this model suggests that the implied probabilities are not at odds with the empirical counterparts. To assess the implications of our findings for real-life investment analysis, we generated buy/sell signals contingent on the crash probability. Investment trading rules relying on the model's prediction outperform traditional ones (e. g., buy and hold). Our implementation methods are sufficiently versatile to discover crash/rally information embedded in option markets. Exploiting more than 17, 000 out-of-money option prices, the framework quantifies three dimensions of crash discovery (i) time-variations in Arrow-Debreu security price on the <b>extre</b> [...] ...|$|E

Materials and Methods: We adapted a circulatory model for CPR with PLR. First we compared cardiac output (CO), coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), blood flow to heart (Qheart), and blood flow to neck and brain (Qhead) of standard chest compression-only CPR with and without PLR; second we simulated the effects of PLR in different situations, by varying the thoracic pump factor (TPF) from 0 to 1; third we simulated the effects when the legs are lifted to the different heights. Finally, we compared our results with those obtained from a published clinical study. Results: According to the simulation model, (1) When TPF is in the interval (0, 1), CPP, CO, Qheart, and Qhead are improved with PLR, among them with half-thoracic/half-cardiac pump effect (TPF is 0. 5), CPP, CO, Qhead, and Qheart increase the most (by 14, 14, 15, and 17 %). (2) When TPF is 1 (pure thoracic pump, with an emphysema or extremely thick thorax), PLR has almost no effect on CPP, CO, and Qheart (- 1, 2, and 0 %), whereas Qhead is increased by 9 %; (3) Regardless of {{whether there is a}} cardiac or thoracic pump effect, PLR is able to increase Qhead by 9 - 15 %. (4) When the legs are lifted to 30 ° to the ground, the volume transferred from legs to upper body is 36 % of the initial volume in legs; when the legs are lifted to 45 °, the volume transferred is 43 %; when the legs are lifted to 60 °, the volume transferred is 47 %; when the legs are lifted to 90 °, the volume transferred is 50 %.

40|$|Preservation of {{historical}} buildings {{is a hot}} topic, and g e t t i n g hotter if predictions about global warming and climate change impact upon the built environment {{in the way we}} think they will. Invasions of exotic insect species and <b>extre</b> m e population fluctuations of indigenous species are widely re p o rted around the world. Timber pests are no exception, and we have already seen termites establish themselves in Southwest England and observed an increase in the p revalence of the house longhorn beetle, H y l o t rupes bajulus. This may be partly due to climate change, but it is also p robably related to changes in lifestyle. Central heating systems are now present in most historical buildings. And coupled with reduced ventilation, it can lead to condensation and warm e r, more humid environments inside buildings, c reating a more conducive environment for timber pests. It is also feared that another European timber pest, the death-watch beetle (Xestobium rufovillosum), is on the increase, which is a particular worry for architectural conservationists as the beetle has a preference for ancient oak timber found in cathedrals, palaces and stately homes (Belmain et al., 1998). Historically, beginning with attempts to treat the roof timbers of Westminster Hall {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century, surface treatment with chemicals has been employed as the treatment method of choice. Surf a c e t reatment has proved, however, of very limited effect in controlling the death-watch beetle in such historic buildings. As a result, between 1993 and 1997 the European Commission funded the international collaborative research project Woodcare, led by English Heritage, to understand the interaction between beetle behaviour, timber and fungus with a view to understand why surface treatments so often fail, and to evolve alternative environmentally acceptable treatment methods (Ridout, 1999).

40|$|In {{the extant}} {{managerial}} literature, the recent contribution by J. Pine II and J. H. Gilmore, The Experience Economy Goes Beyond Service, has attracted our attention {{because it offers}} so much food for thought regarding the possible evolutionary pathways that advanced societies’ consumption models could follow and the consequent strategic challenges that businesses will have to face {{in order to meet}} their clients’ new needs and to successfully adapt to market changes. Based on their observations of American society, certainly that with the greatest propensity toward consumption, and starting from the implicit hypothesis that demand is constantly on the lookout for new objects and forms of consumption, for new emotions and sensations, and with greater consumer expectations (Ritzer, 2000), the two scholars suggest the provocative thesis that, by now, the era of services is on its way out {{to make way for the}} experience economy. In this new scenario, in which there is little or nothing left to purchase, for the <b>extre</b> mely demanding and aware consumer, value is created by the enterprise that offers experiences, rather than goods and services. In the American authors’ view, experiences represent economic proposals that differ greatly from services, at least to the same extent that services differs from goods; nevertheless, they still represent ‘products’ which, like goods and services, can be offered to the client either singly or in combination with other outputs (good, services) in the form of ‘packages’. Moreover, compared to services, experiences stand out for their uniqueness and capacity to be personal, instead of personalized, in addition to the fact that they are ‘staged’ and not simply handed out. This implies that enterprises must undergo a transformation from being mere providers of services or sellers of goods to becoming ‘stage directors’ of experiences for the client who, in the new perspective, is called ‘guest’. By the same token, writes Rifkin, the economy is being transformed, from “gigantic factory” to “endless theater” and now “every business is show business” (Rifkin, 2000, p. 219). Consumer satisfaction and loyalty are determined by the ability of organizations to go beyond the normal capacity to satisfy demand, trying to transcend expectations through new and completely unexpected offerings for the clientele; it is a matter of staging surprises, thus widening the gap between what the client perceives and what s/he expects to get (Pine and Gilmore, p. 117). According to Toffler (1988, p. 236), “we will become the first civilization in history to utilize highly advanced technology to produce the most transitory and, at the same time, the most enduring of products: the human experience”. The experience economy model, which came out in the U. S. in parallel with numerous other managerial theories and models in support of the ‘theatricalization of economic activities’ (Grove, Fisk, and Bitner, 1997), seemed, to us, particularly applicable to the tourism industry and especially to tourism districts. The latter are territories in which it is a daily task of tourism operators to formulate offerings that are often inspired by the logic of providing the clientele with a more or less integrated mix of goods and services in which, however, there is an experiential dimension that is purely casual, spontaneous, and unintended, with no real economic or marketing objective. In a context of entertainment economy (Bird, 2002), the evolution of tourist demand towards forms of demand for experiences actually forces agents in the sector, if they are to remain competitive, to develop a new conceptual framework and adopt original managerial tools for fulfilling this demand. In other words, if consumers tend to essentially purchase emotions and experiences, then the supply side must be populated with producers and sellers of ‘memories’ (Valdani and Guenzi, 1998), and the marketing of services and of experiences must use the theater model as its point of reference (Grove, Fisk, and Bitner, 1997). The aim of this article is to propose an application of the experience economy model to tourism and, in particular, to tourist districts (Pencarelli, 2001), interpreted as a paradigm of the Viable Systems Approach (VSA) (Golinelli, 2000). This concept has allowed us to discern what type of districts, otherwise labeled as touristic systems, local tourist offering systems and so on in the literature, fit the concept of ‘system’ in a narrow sense and what the prerequisites are, therefore, that a district must meet in order to qualify as a viable system. From this work it emerges that, among the various factors needed for a district (in the strictest sense) to fall within the viable systemic concept, there must be the indispensable presence of a governing body, to which we refer in our proposal for possible tourist district market-oriented management tools. We propose applying the marketing concept to tourist districts with all due conceptual caution, aware of the limitations inherent in both theory and managerial actions, in undertaking to shift into territorial contexts paradigms and tools that were developed with reference to organizational systems. The marketing paradigm most effective for our purposes is that of total relationship marketing (Gummesson, 1999), which goes beyond the traditional framework of marketing management to move toward the concept of marketing-oriented management. Total relationship marketing is based on a holistic approach which aims to build and maintain longterm, positive relationships with single clients and other stakeholders, and which recognizes that the end value for the client is co-created with all of the parties involved. From this standpoint, Gummesson’s thesis, analogous to the relationship marketing approach put forward by Peck, Christopher, Payne, and Clark (1999), promotes the idea that relationship marketing represents the convergence of the marketing paradigm and that of total quality (Cozzi, Ferrero, 2000), and focuses on customer satisfaction and customer service. In other words, it is a question of adopting an integrated managerial perspective that is culturally holistic, in keeping with the viable system concept. What is to be avoided is the logic of focusing the marketing only on the final client thereby falling into a near-sighted approach that underestimates the importance of truly satisfying an audience when all of the theater components have worked together well. Indeed, concentrating exclusively on the external consumer means ignoring the fact that, in an organizational system, there are stakeholders (internal clients, distributers, suppliers, financial backers, public institutions, mass media, etc.) whose complete satisfaction is an indispensable condition for satisfying the final client and for long-term competitive success. Finally, from our work there emerges, alongside the indisputable merits of providing innovative and holistic elements for reflection and action for the governance of tourist districts in the new consumption scenario, that the experience economy model also presents some negative aspects. These aspects should not be overlooked in the governance of touristic systems when, for instance, following in the wake of a strong theme, the choice is made to stage experiences aimed at enhancing existing facets of the territory or region (in terms of both front region and back region) and build artificial touristic spaces that tourists must pay for in an area where a real experience could be enjoyed for free. We allude, in particular, to the danger that in an effort to make an offering so spectacular in terms of providing tourists with experiences, emotions, memories, dreams come true, or other forms of entertainment, it risks becoming excessively trite and overly commercialized, thus creating desensitized clients who are even resentful of the various forms of experience-tourism and are less apt to be amazed, awed, and surprised. Pushing too hard or inappropriately on the spectacular experience lever can actually make people want to run from anything that makes their free time, which should be for creative and recreational activities of choice, become ‘mandated time’ geared toward forced consumption. Ultimately, time is manipulated so that it no longer enriches and relaxes but rather, impoverishes and tires individuals, negatively impacting on their quality of life (Rifkin, 2000, p. 201; Pratesi, 2002, pp. 73 - 74). The experience economy model must therefore be adopted prudently, avoiding interpretations that are totally uncritical which can occasionally be seen in Pine and Gilmore; instead, it would be preferable to follow the suggestions of Grove, Frisk, and Bitner (1997) according to whom, when management embraces the theater metaphor, it is essential that a staging of experiences be authentic (tourists can tell immediately when a situation or an attitude is fake and they usually do not appreciate it), adaptable, and appropriate (every performance must be adapted to the situation, to the client, etc.), as well as be sufficiently applicable to the context being managed...|$|E
