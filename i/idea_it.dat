5|$|Some {{fans have}} {{suggested}} that our new Enterprise should carry a plaque somewhere which commemorates the fact it was named after the first space shuttle launched from Earth in 1970s. This is an intriguing <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> also has publicity advantages if properly released at the right time. It won't hurt NASA's feelings either. I'll leave it to you {{where you want it}} on the vessel.|$|E
5|$|A few modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley's {{death on the}} grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive {{and that he was}} the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal. Against this <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> has been argued that he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position. The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c.1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal of Matters of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth. This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip, poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{problems}} were only transient, however, {{and by the}} time 1984 had come to a close, Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success. Having only $60,000 left in the bank, Laliberté went back to the Canadian government to secure funding for a second year. While the Canadian federal government was enthusiastic, the Quebec provincial government was resistant to the <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> was not until Quebec's premier, René Lévesque, intervened on their behalf that the provincial government relented. The original big top tent that was used during the 1984 Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil tour can now be seen at Carnivàle Lune Bleue, a 1930s-style carnival that is home to the Cirque Maroc acrobats.|$|E
5|$|Thomas' father Ross Goodall {{posted the}} video to YouTube on 6 November 2014. He later {{explained}} to media {{that he wanted}} to make the video available to his family and had no <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> would become popular online. CNN reported that after its appearance on YouTube, the video was viewed over 200,000 times in its first 48 hours online. This more than doubled the next day, and less than a week later it had over 900,000 total views. BBC News observed that Capaldi's message had become a viral video, and ITV News described response to the video as a global phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, {{common with}} many British sitcoms of that era, Dad's Army {{was made into}} a feature film. Backers Columbia Pictures imposed {{arbitrary}} changes, such as recasting Liz Fraser as Mavis Pike and filming outdoors in Chalfont St Giles rather than Thetford, which made the cast unhappy. The director, Norman Cohen, whose <b>idea</b> <b>it</b> was to make the film, was nearly sacked by the studio.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Lambert {{attempted}} {{to win the}} rights to produce Doctor Who independently for the BBC; however, this effort was unsuccessful because the Corporation was already in negotiations with producer Philip Segal in the United States.

25|$|La Mia Vita ("My Life"), Mussolini's {{autobiography}} written {{upon request}} of the American Ambassador in Rome (Child).

25|$|There {{is almost}} nothing {{occurring}} {{most of the}} time but unison melodies and very lengthy drone basses, which is all very Armenian. It is also very modern indeed in its elegant simplicity and adamant modal integrity, being, in effect, as tight and strong in its way as a twelve-tone work of the Austrian type. There is no harmony either, and the brilliance and excitement of parts of the piano concerto were due entirely to vigor of <b>idea.</b> <b>It</b> really takes a sound musicality to invent a succession of stimulating ideas within the bounds of an unaltered mode and without shifting the home-tone.|$|E
