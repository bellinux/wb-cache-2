5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion {{can be regarded as}} a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Locusts are the {{swarming}} {{phase of}} certain species of short-horned grasshoppers {{in the family}} Acrididae. Swarming behaviour <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the grasshopper to change colour, feed more and breed faster. The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to the evidential {{problem of}} evil {{which raises the}} problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and {{perfectly}} loving) God exists, {{there should be no}} evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.|$|E

5|$|The Third Amendment (Amendment III) to the United States Constitution places {{restrictions}} on the quartering of soldiers in private homes without the owner's consent, forbidding the practice in peacetime. The amendment <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to Quartering Acts passed by the British parliament during the buildup to the American Revolutionary War, which had allowed the British Army to lodge soldiers in private residences.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{letter was}} written in {{response}} to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of the letter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people. The tone of the letter is clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.|$|E
5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an achievement is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the creator, the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's proposition that the greatest disability would be non-existence <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to Anselm's assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses this logic to assume that non-existence must be a disability.|$|E

5|$|Swarming {{behaviour}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to overcrowding. Increased tactile {{stimulation of}} the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, {{with a population of}} up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to the evidential {{problem of}} evil, {{which raises the}} concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, {{there should be no}} evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into {{question}} God's nature or his existence– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good– the corruption of God's good creation.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Public Engagement was {{established}} on October 19, 2012, and includes the Rural Secretariat, the Voluntary and Non-Profit Secretariat, the Youth Engagement office, the Strategic Partnership Initiative, and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Office. Innovation, Business and Rural Development Minister Keith Hutchings was appointed as the minister {{responsible for the}} office, while Steve Kent was appointed parliamentary secretary for the office. Several days after his appointment Hutchings announced {{that the government was}} looking at putting restaurant inspection reports online for the public viewing. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had spent $457 obtaining inspection reports earlier the year, which had been criticized by former Service NL Minister Paul Davis during the debate on Bill 29. On November 22, 2012, Hutchings and Service NL Minister Nick McGrath announced that the public could now go on the government's website and see recent health and sanitation inspection reports for restaurants. While both opposition parties agreed with the government's decision to make the reports available online, Liberal MHA Andrew Parsons said that “I have no doubt that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to the Bill 29 criticism".|$|E

5|$|The diving reflex <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to {{immersion}} that overrides {{the basic}} homeostatic reflexes. It optimises respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores {{to the heart}} and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins and muskrats), and also exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed pulse rate, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals.|$|E
5|$|The letter, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to Boniface who had {{requested}} his support, reveals Ælfwald's sound understanding of Latin. Ælfwald's letter reassures Boniface {{that his name}} was being remembered by the East Angles: it contains an offer to exchange {{the names of their}} dead, so that mutual prayers could be read for them. According to Richard Hoggett, a phrase in the letter, 'in septenis monasteriorum nostorum sinaxis', has been interpreted incorrectly by historians to imply that there were at the time seven monasteries in Ælfwald's kingdom in which prayers were being read, a theory which has proved difficult for scholars to explain. Hoggett argues that the words in the phrase refer to the number of times that the monks offered praise during the monastic day and not to the number of monasteries then in existence. He points out that this interpretation was published by Haddan and Stubbs as long ago as 1869.|$|E

25|$|One socio-historical {{explanation}} {{that has been}} offered for the growing prevalence of the abstract in modern art – an explanation linked to the name of Theodor W.

25|$|Afrocentrism (also Afrocentricity) is a {{cultural}} ideology or worldview {{that focuses on the}} history of black Africans. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to global (Eurocentric) attitudes about African people and their historical contributions; it revisits their history with an African cultural and ideological focus. Afrocentricity deals primarily with self-determination and African agency and is a Pan-African ideology in culture, philosophy, and history.|$|E
