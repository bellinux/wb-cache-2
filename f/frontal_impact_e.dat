These properties qualify them for applications requiring high mobility and direct interaction with human users or uncertain environments. An essential requirement for such a robot is that it must under no circumstances {{pose a threat to}} the human operator. To actually quantify the potential injury risk emanating from the manipulator, impact test were carried out using standard automobile crash-test facilities at the ADAC 1.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In Europe, the deployment characteristics of frontal crash restraints are generally optimised to best protect an average young male, since a 50 th percentile male dummy is used in a stylised <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> scenario. These single point restraint systems may not provide similar levels of effectiveness when the crash scenarios vary {{with respect to the}} regulatory and consumer crash test procedures. Previous research has demonstrated that varying restraint deployment characteristics according to occupant and crash variation can provide further injury reduction in <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts.</b> This thesis reports the investigation conducted to assess the potential real world injury reduction benefit of smart restraint systems in <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts.</b> The intelligent capability of the restraint was achieved by varying the seat belt load limiter (SBL) threshold, according to the frontal crash scenario. Real world accident data (CCIS) were analysed to identify the target population of vehicle occupants and <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> scenarios where employing smart load limiters could be most beneficial, particularly in reducing chest injury risk.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the FIMCAR (<b>Frontal</b> <b>Impact</b> and Compatibility Assessment Research) project are to answer the remaining open questions identified in earlier projects (such as understanding of {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of force based metrics and barrier deformation based metrics, confirmation of specific compatibility issues such as structural interaction, investigation of force matching) and to finalise the <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> test procedures required to assess compatibility.

The identified real world safety issues were used to develop a list of compatibility characteristics which were then prioritised within the consortium.

40|$|Objective: To improve vehicle {{safety in}} frontal collisions, the crash {{compatibility}} between the colliding vehicles is crucial. Compatibility aims to improve both {{the self and}} partner protection properties of vehicles. Although compatibility has received worldwide attention for many years, no final assessment approach has been defined. Methods: Within the <b>Frontal</b> <b>Impact</b> and Compatibility Assessment Research (FIMCAR) project, different <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> test procedures (offset deformable barrier [ODB] test as currently used for Economic Commission for Europe [ECE] R 94, progressive deformable barrier test as proposed by France for a new ECE regulation, moveable deformable barrier test as discussed worldwide, full-width rigid barrier test as used in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard [FMVSS] 208, and full-width deformable barrier test) were analyzed regarding their potential for future <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> accidents based on accident investigations involving newer cars. Test procedures were developed with both a crash test program and numerical simulations. Results: The proposal from FIMCAR {{is to use a}} full-width test procedure with a deformable element and compatibility metrics in combination with the current offset test as a <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> assessment approach that also addresses compatibility. Conclusions: By adding a full-width test to the current ODB test it is possible to better address the issues of structural misalignment and injuries resulting from high acceleration accidents as observed in the current fleet. The estimated benefit ranges from a 5 to 12 percent reduction of fatalities and serious injuries resulting from <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> accidents. By using a deformable element in the full-width test, the test conditions are more representative of real-world situations with respect to acceleration pulse, restraint system triggering time, and deformation pattern of the front structure. The test results are therefore expected to better represent real-world performance of the tested car. Furthermore, the assessment of the structural alignment is more robust than in the rigid wall test. Supplemental materials are available for this article.

Thus far, wheelchair tiedown and occupant restraint systems (WTORS) loading has mostly been examined under <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> conditions. Because of the inherent crash dynamic differences, rear-impact loading of WTORS is expected to differ greatly. In this study, three identical, reinforced, manual, folding, X-braced ANSI/RESNA WC 19 wheelchairs were subjected to an International Organization for Standardization-proposed rear-impact crash pulse. WTORS loads (front tiedowns, rear tiedowns, lap belt, and shoulder belt) were measured and compared with <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> WTORS loading. Rear impact produced substantially higher loads (up to 7, 851 N) in the front tiedowns than <b>frontal</b> <b>impact.</b> The rear tiedowns experienced relatively negligible loading (up to 257 N) in rear impact, while rear-impact dynamics caused the lap belt (maximum load of 1, 865 N) to be loaded substantially more than the shoulder belt (maximum load of 68 N). Considering differences in <b>frontal</b> and rear <b>impact</b> WTORS loading is important to proper WTORS design and, thus, protection of wheelchair-seated occupants subjected to rear-impact events...|$|R
40|$|Offset and angled <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts</b> {{represent}} a crash type {{that is more}} common than full-frontal collisions. Several {{studies have shown that}} over 70 % of all <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts</b> are offset or oblique. These studies thus indicate the importance of having crash tests representing offset and oblique frontal collisions so that protective systems may be evaluated that offer offset or oblique occupant protection. The evaluation of such protective systems requires access to biofidelic crash test dummies that accurately replicate the human body motion in <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts</b> with oblique dummy loadings. This thesis investigates how the performance of todays 50 th percentile male <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> dummies may be improved in oblique collisions with oblique frontal occupant motions. In {{the first part of this}} thesis the kinematics of the 50 th percentile male <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> dummies, Hybrid III, THOR 99 and THOR Alpha, were compared with corresponding kinematics of PMHS in oblique crash tests. The PMHS data included results from oblique frontal, near side (the occupant moves into the shoulder belt anchor) and far side (the occupant moves away from the shoulder belt anchor), sled tests at 15 °, 30 ° and 45 ° angles. The test subjects were belted with three-point belts and the impact speed was 30 km/h. The results indicated that the <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> dummies slipped out of the shoulder belts more easily than the PMHS. This was mainly an effect of stiffer shoulder complexes than those of the PMHS. The results from the first part of this thesis was the foundation of the second part were the shoulder range-of-motion and resistance of motion i. e. stiffness was compared between volunteers and that of the 50 th percentile male <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> dummies, Hybrid III and THOR Alpha. The test conditions were in static loading conditions simulating frontal collisions. Five volunteers, a Hybrid III and a THOR Alpha were positioned in a test rig where both arms were loaded statically in the forward-upward direction at 90 &# 61616;, 135 &# 61616; and 170 &# 61616; angles while sternum was supported. The results showed that the volunteers motions are at least three times larger for the maximum load (200 N/arm) than those of the Hybrid III and the THOR Alpha. The results in this study indicate that the biofidelity of the dummies used today in full-frontal, oblique and offset frontal collisions may be improved by redesigned shoulder complexes.

Surrogates were placed on a buck, capable of accommodating different anthropometry with similar initial positioning. Duplicate tests were conducted at low, medium, and high (3. 6, 6. 9, and 15. 8 m/s) velocities. Upper and lower neck forces and moments were determined from load cell measures and its locations with respect to the ends of the neck. Head excursion-time responses were more repeatable in the Hybrid III dummy than the THOR dummy. Hybrid III dummy response was more rigid in the sagittal plane. Peak THOR motions were closer to PMHS. Based on times of occurrences of peak excursions, THOR was closer to PMHS at all velocities, while Hybrid III dummy showed biofidelity at the medium and high velocities. Controlled positioning and testing with different surrogates provide an evaluation of inter-subject responses. THOR was more likely to “get the head where and when it needs to be” in <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts.</b> With the importance of testing at lower speeds due to recent recognition of real-world injuries, these data suggest that THOR may be an optimal dummy for <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts.</b> Comparisons of head-neck kinetic data with PMHS are valuable in <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> injury assessments...|$|R

Objective: To determine whether varying the seat belt load limiter (SBL) according to crash and occupant characteristics could have real-world injury reduction benefits in <b>frontal</b> <b>impacts</b> and, if so, to quantify those benefits. Methods: Real-world UK accident data were used to identify the target population of vehicle occupants and frontal crash scenarios where improved chest protection could be most beneficial.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} FIMCAR (<b>Frontal</b> <b>Impact</b> and Compatibility Assessment Research) {{project was}} to propose a <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> {{assessment}} approach addressing self- and partner protection. Research strategies and priorities were based on earlier research programs and the FIMCAR accident data analysis looking at modern cars. The identified real world safety issues – such as structural interaction (especially under-/override), high acceleration loading of the occupant especially in large overlap accidents and insufficient horizontal and vertical load spreading were used for evaluating the different test candidates. In addition to the issues mentioned above, the FIMCAR accident analysis suggested that frontal force compartment integrity matching is less of an issue as originally expected. FIMCAR developed a car-to-car test program that investigated the performance of vehicle structures. Results of the test program show {{that the presence of}} a lower load path contributes to a more robust performance of the vehicle. The rearward offset of a lower load path could be reviewed and used to quantify when a lower structure design can contribute to structural interaction in both <b>frontal</b> and side <b>impact</b> configurations. In addition to the car crash test programme, numerical models of actual cars and barriers were developed and used. As car-to-car simulations with models of different car manufacturers are almost impossible because of confidentiality, Parametric Car Models (PCM) and Generic Car Models (GCM) were developed. Due to the parametric design of the PCMs it is possible to modify the models in an easy and fast way. The GCMs model virtual cars which represent an average real car of the respective category in a comparable way to the OEM models. Within the FIMCAR project, different <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> test candidates were analysed regarding their potential for future <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car <b>frontal</b> <b>impact.</b> Test procedures were developed with both a crash test programme and numerical simulations. This analysis resulted in the combination of the Full Width Deformable Barrier test (FWDB) with compatibility metrics and the existing Offset Deformable Barrier (ODB) as described in UN-ECE Regulation 94 with additional cabin integrity requirement as being proposed as the FIMCAR assessment approach. The advantages of the FWDB compared to the rigid wall are the more representative pulse and deformation pattern as well as the better assessment of load paths. The introduction of a (M) PDB without compatibility metrics (that FIMCAR was unable to deliver in time) was considered as not being appropriate. The proposed <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> assessment approach addresses many of the issues identified by the FIMCAR consortium (impact alignment, high acceleration pulse loading, maintenance of compartment strength requirements, etc.) but not all <b>frontal</b> <b>impact</b> and compatibility issues could be addressed (load spreading). A benefit analysis estimated the benefit of the following three options: no change, introduction of full width test with compatibility assessment in addition to current ECE R 94 and introduction of full width test with compatibility assessment and replacement of current ODB test by PDB test with load spreading metric. The comparison of calculated break even costs for option 2 with estimated costs for achieving the benefit from previous projects suggests a positive cost benefit ratio.
