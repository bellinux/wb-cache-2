Among such characteristics, we consider the following: the spatial distance between the collaborating institutions, the institutional distance (we assume that there is institutional distance if the collaborating institutions are of a different kind), {{the stability of the}} collaborations (if they are occasional or repeated) and the content of the research (if basic or applied). We analyse what kind of relationship exists between such dimensions.

40|$|Determining new {{and higher}} and stable {{yielding}} varieties {{is one of}} the most important objectives of rice breeding. To achieve this goal, ten promising lines of rice along with two improved cultivars (Hashemi and Kadous) were compared at National Rice Research Institute in Rasht, Iran, for three years (2006, 2007 and 2008). The experimental design was randomized complete blocks with four replications in these three years. The combined analysis of variance indicated significant difference among genotypes, for the traits studied. This indicates genetic variation among genotypes understudy. The interaction of genotype × year for yield was significant which demonstrate different responses of genotypes during different years. Different stability analysis methods were used to determine the higher and stable yielding variety like: environmental variance, coefficient of variability, coefficient of regression proposed by Finaly and Wilkinson, Deviation from regression by Eberhart and Russel, Shukla's stability variance, Wricke's <b>equivalence,</b> <b>coefficient</b> of determination of Pintus and non-parametric method of rank. By using these analyses it was found that Hashemi was a stable yielding variety. It was also revealed that line No. 9 (IR 78530 - 45 - 3 - 1 - 3), line No. 6 (IR 76993 - 49 - 1 - 1) and 8 (IR 78533 - 30 - 2 - 1) were found as stable producer lines...|$|E
40|$|In the {{scientific}} collaborations among different institutions {{at least two}} types of distance may be identified: spatial and institutional. We talk about spatial distance if the institutions are located in different places; about institutional distance if the collaborating institutions are of a different kind. Given that there are both barriers and incentives to overcome such distances, the specific focus {{of this paper is}} on the way the institutions involved in the collaboration deal with them. We are interested in studying if more stable collaborations have different characteristics from the more occasional ones on {{the point of view of}} spatial and institutional distance,. We also aim to study also what kind of dependencies exist among these types of distance: if there is a trade-off among them, or a relation of complimentarity.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{energy management}} strategies {{for a new}} hybrid pneumatic engine concept which is specific by its configuration {{in that it is}} not the vehicle but only the engine itself which is hybridized. Different energy management strategies are proposed in this paper. The first is called Causal Strategy (CS) and implements a rule-based control technique. The second strategy, called Constant Penalty Coefficient (CPC), is based on the minimization of equivalent consumption, where the use of each energy source is formulated in a comparative unit. The balance between the consumption of different energy sources (chemical or pneumatic) is achieved by the introduction of an equivalence factor. The third strategy is called Variable Penalty Coefficient (VPC). In fact, it is beneficial to consider the <b>equivalence</b> <b>coefficient</b> as variable within the amount of pneumatic energy stored in the air-tank i. e. state of charge, because the choice of propulsion mode should be different if the tank is full or empty. In this case, the penalty coefficient appears as a non linear function of the air-tank state of charge. Another way to adapt the penalty coefficient is to recognize a reference pattern during the driving cycle. The coefficient value can then be changed according to an optimized value found for each of the reference cycles. This strategy is called Driving Pattern Recognition (DPR). It involves a technique of sliding window pattern recognition. The concept is to convert the whole driving cycle into smaller pieces to which the equivalence factor can be appropriately adapted. This strategy is based on the assumption that the current driving situation does not change rapidly and thus the pattern is likely to continue into the near future. The identification window size is a parameter which has to be adjusted to attain the maximum of identification success over the reference cycle. We propose to define reference patterns as statistical models. The pattern recognition method is based on a correlation function. To improve analysis, all the results obtained with different energy management strategies are compared with a Dynamic Programming approach (DP) considered as the optimal solution. Results show that about 40 % of fuel saving can be achieved by DP. The VPC and DPR strategies give better results than the CPC strategy, not so far from the results obtained with DP...|$|E

This paper also gives a classification of those noncommutative polynomials invariant under conjugating each coordinate by a different unitary matrix. Up to unitary equivalence such a polynomial must be a direct sum of univariate polynomials. Comment: 29 pages; includes a table of contents and an inde...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMany {{algorithms}} {{have been}} proposed {{during the last decade}} {{in order to deal with}} inverse problems. Of particular interest are convex optimization approaches that consist of minimizing a criteria generally composed of two terms: a data fidelity (linked to noise) term and a prior (regularization) term. As image properties are often easier to extract in a transform domain, frame representations may be fruitful. Potential functions are then chosen as priors to fit as well as possible empirical coefficient distributions. As a consequence, the minimization problem can be considered from two viewpoints : a minimization along the coefficients or along the image pixels directly. Some recently proposed iterative optimization algorithms can be easily implemented when the frame representation reduces to an orthonormal basis. Furthermore, it can be noticed that in this particular case, it is equivalent to minimize the criterion in the transform domain or in the image domain. However, much attention should be paid when an overcomplete representation is considered. In that case, there is no longer <b>equivalence</b> between <b>coefficient</b> and image domain minimization. This point will be developed throughout this paper. Moreover, we will discuss how the choice of the transform may influence parameters and operators necessary to implement algorithms...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there are differences in the meaning of work, as defined by values and life role salience, amongst Black and White young adults in South Africa. Super’s career development theory combined with one of his key research projects, the Work Importance Study, provided an empirical point of departure for the present study. The Values Scale and the Life Role Inventory were completed by 802 first-year university students (332 Black; 470 White). The means and standard deviations of the 22 Values Scale subscales illustrated that similar values emerge as salient for both groups. The 22 subscales were subjected to a principal axis factor analysis. Five factors were extracted and a Direct Oblimin rotation was performed. The rotated solution revealed the presence of distinct clusters of factor loadings. The five factors were described as Self Orientation, Physical Orientation, Humanism, Social Orientation and Autonomous Orientation. Inspection of the means and standard deviations of these factors indicated the presence of differences in the relative importance of the value factors between the two groups. Overall, culture accounted for 15 % of the variance in the Values Scale factors. A subsequent discriminant analysis revealed that the Humanism Values Scale factor contributed the most to the separation of the two groups. The results of this analysis support the presence of cultural differences in value salience between the two groups. The means and standard deviations of the Life Role Inventory indicated differences in life role salience between the two groups. A discriminant analysis revealed that culture accounted for 27 % of the variance in the combination of the five life roles. ANOVAs showed that the biggest difference between the two groups was observed in the Leisure life role. The results of this analysis support the presence of cultural differences in life role salience between the two groups. In comparing the scores of the Values Scale factors and the Life Role Inventory Commitment subscales a Pearson’s product-moment correlation revealed the presence of many coefficients of 0. 30 and above. Subsequently an interbattery factor analysis was performed. The Tucker-Lewis reliability coefficients indicated a three factor solution for the White group and a four factor solution for the Black group to be appropriate. Thereafter a Varimax rotation was performed. The structural <b>equivalence</b> <b>coefficients</b> indicated factor <b>equivalence</b> between the two groups. For the White group and the Black group three factors were namedOrientation towards Collectivism, Work Motivation and Social Autonomy. The fourth factor for the Black group was named Social Affiliation. On the basis of the commonality of factors and structural equivalence of three factors, it was concluded that the two groups share similar meaning of work as measured by the relation between the values and life role salience.

40|$|AbstractWire damping {{materials}} (such as Metal Rubber, MR, or “spring cushion”, etc.) {{are widely}} used for protection of a pipeline against vibration. A calculation method for an arbitrary shaped pipeline with damping supports made of the MR material was developed {{by means of the}} finite element ANSYS software package. Dependencies of MR support stiffness and energy dissipation coefficient on various parameters (material density, wire diameter, thickness, preliminary static deformation) are obtained as these two characteristics influence the quality of MP supports. An <b>equivalence</b> viscous damping <b>coefficient</b> was obtained {{on the basis of the}} equality of the hysteretic loop area for the viscous damping system and dry friction in the wire material. The method takes into account a non-linearity of the MR material by the iteration method. The method allows obtaining a pipeline vibration amplitude and stress in the pipeline for its 3 D vibration. Calculation results are proved by experiment with the ARAMIS non-contact measurement system. The error is less than 9 %, thus, it is possible to use this method for practical application: placement of pipeline supports and design of these supports parameters. It allows reducing a large experimental work of stress measurement in pipelines during pipeline system design. Any engineer who is able to work with the ANSYS software can use it. It is possible to develop this method for calculation of a pipeline system with many pipelines connected by damping supports...|$|R

Comparisons of a sample of individual emergency patients 2 ̆ 7 syndrome assignments according to the EMS versus each of the two hospital categorization schemes were made by matching EMS run records to their corresponding emergency department patient encounter records. This new, linked dataset was analyzed to assess the level of agreement beyond chance between the three possible pairs of syndrome categorization schemes in assigning patients to a respiratory or non-respiratory syndrome and to a gastrointestinal or non-gastrointestinal syndrome. Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s kappa statistics were used to measure chance-adjusted agreement between categorization schemes (raters). Z-tests and a chi-square-like test based on the variance of the kappa statistic were used to test the <b>equivalence</b> of kappa <b>coefficients</b> across syndromes, population subgroups and pairs of syndrome assignment schemes. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive value positive and predictive value negative of EMS dispatch and chief complaint-based categorization schemes were also calculated, using the ICD- 9 -coded ED diagnosis-based categorization scheme as the criterion standard. Comparisons of all performance characteristic (i. e. sensitivity, specificity, predictive value positive and predictive value negative) values were made across categorization schemes and surveillance syndromes to determine whether they were significantly different. The use of EMS dispatch codes for assigning emergency patients to surveillance syndromes was found to have limited but statistically significant reliability in relation to more commonly used syndrome grouping methods based on chief complaints or ICD- 9 coded ED diagnoses. The reliability of EMS-based syndrome assignment varied significantly by syndrome, age group and comparison rater. When ICD- 9 coded ED diagnosis-based grouping is taken as the criterion standard of syndrome definition, the validity of EMS-based syndrome assignment was limited but comparable to chief complaint-based assignment.
