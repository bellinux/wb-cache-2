25|$|Vesiculo-erosive skin disease. This—a {{reference}} to the characteristic blistering (vesicles) and open sores (erosions) noted in patients—is the pattern seen in CEP, PCT, VP, and HCP. The changes are noted only in sun-exposed {{areas such as the}} face and back of the hands. Milder skin disease, such as that seen in VP and HCP, consists of increased skin fragility in exposed areas with a tendency to form blisters and erosions, particularly after minor knocks or scrapes. These heal slowly, often leaving small scars that may be lighter or darker than normal skin. More severe skin disease is sometimes seen in PCT, with prominent lesions, darkening of exposed skin such as the face, and hypertrichosis: abnormal hair growth on the face, particularly the cheeks. The most severe disease is seen in CEP and a rare variant of PCT known as <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (HEP); symptoms include severe shortening of digits, loss of skin appendages such as hair and nails, and severe scarring of the skin with progressive disappearance of ears, lips, and nose. Patients may also show deformed, discolored teeth or gum and eye abnormalities.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> is {{a severe}} {{cutaneous}} porphyria caused by deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase {{and is considered}} to be the homozygous form of familial (type II) porphyria cutanea tarda. To elucidate further the relation between these conditions, we studied five Spanish families with <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> and nine unrelated Spanish patients with familial porphyria cutanea tarda. Immunoreactive and catalytic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase was decreased by greater than 95 % in the five patients with <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria.</b> Hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity was decreased to 22 % of normal. Four patients were homozygous for a mutation (G 281 E) originally identified in a Tunisian family; the fifth patient was a compound heterozygote for this mutation. The calculated carrier frequency for G 281 E in Spain is one in 1800. None of the nine familial porphyria cutanea tarda patients carried the G 281 E mutation. However, one G 281 E heterozygote in a family with <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> had overt porphyria cutanea tarda. These findings suggest that the G 281 E mutation is functionally less severe than erythrocyte measurements indicate, that its clinical penetrance is very low in heterozygotes, and that, for this particular mutation, <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> is the homozygous form of familial porphyria cutanea tarda...|$|E
40|$|Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the {{condition}} {{resulting from a}} deficiency of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity, is the commonest form of porphyria. Both acquired and familial form exist and are commonly associated in adults with liver disease and hepatic iron overload. The condition is extremely rare in children; most cases of childhood PCT are familial and some particularly severe cases {{have been shown to}} have a <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> or homozygous uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency. A case is described of <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> in which the disease was first precipitated at the age of two by a coincidental hepatitis A infection and improved as the hepatitis cleared. This paper reviews the evidence that viral hepatitis may precipitate overt PCT in children in a manner analogous to the precipitation of PCT in adults by alcohol associated liver disease...|$|E
40|$|A {{deficiency}} {{in the activity}} of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), the fifth enzyme of the haem biosynthetic pathway, is found in {{familial porphyria cutanea tarda}} (F-PCT) and <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (HEP). A new mutation (R 292 G) and a deletion have been found in a pedigree with two HEP patients (two sisters). The R 292 G mutation was not detected in 13 unrelated affected patients with F-PCT, so it appears to be uncommon. The possibility that the arginine 292 may participate at the active site of the enzyme is discussed. A summary of the 7 mutations/deletions found in the UROD gene with their frequency is presented...|$|E
40|$|Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase {{activity}} {{was measured in}} hemoglobin-free lysates from two patients with <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (HEP) and from 12 unrelated patients with {{familial porphyria cutanea tarda}} (PCT). In HEP patients, enzyme activities were 5 % of normal, and familial studies clearly confirmed that patients with HEP are cases of homozygous PCT. Immunoreactive uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase was measured by developing a direct and noncompetitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA). For the 12 familial PCT patients, we found an immunoreactive protein decreased (51 %) to the same extent as the catalytic activity (48 %) [cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) negative]. The children from the HEP family were also CRIM negative, contrasting with another HEP family previously described as CRIM positive; our data support the hypothesis of a heterogeneity in familial uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the molecular basis of uroporphyrinogen (URO) decarboxylase deficiency responsible for <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (HEP) and familial porphyria cutanea tarda, we used a human URO decarboxylase cDNA to analyze the organization and expression of the URO decarboxylase gene in lymphoblastoid cells from normal individuals and from two patients with HEP. We could detect neither deletions nor rearrangements in the URO decarboxylase gene. Synthesis, processing, and cell-free translation of the specific transcripts appeared to be normal. The half-life of the abnormal protein was 12 times shorter than that of the normal enzyme. The results indicate that the enzyme defect is due to a rapid degradation of the protein in vivo. This study is the first to provide information regarding the molecular mechanism responsible for the URO decarboxylase deficiency in HEP...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (HEP) {{is due to}} {{a marked}} {{deficiency}} of uroporphyrinogen (URO) decarboxylase, a cytosolic enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Using a radioimmunoassay method, we determined the concentration of URO decarboxylase protein in erythrocytes from a patient with mild HEP and found that the enzyme protein concentration had markedly decreased to less than 7 % of the normal controls. This finding, however, was in contrast to the enzyme activity in the patient's erythrocytes, which was 16 % of normal control levels and different from previously reported HEP cases in that erythrocytes in our patient contained disproportionately elevated URO decarboxylase activity in comparison to its immunoreactive material. Our findings suggests the possibility of a mutant isozyme in this patient that is not immunoreactive with an antibody raised against the normal enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Heme, like chlorophyll, is a {{primordial}} molecule {{and is one}} of {{the fundamental}} pigments of life. Disorders of normal heme synthesis may cause human diseases, including certain anemias (X-linked sideroblastic anemias) and porphyrias. Porphyrias are classified as hepatic and erythropoietic porphyrias based on the organ system in which heme precursors (5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen and porphyrins) are chiefly overproduced. The hepatic porphyrias are further subdivided into acute porphyrias and chronic hepatic porphyrias. The acute porphyrias include acute intermittent, hereditary copro-, variegate and ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria. Chronic hepatic porphyrias include porphyria cutanea tarda and <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria.</b> The erythropoietic porphyrias include congenital erythropoietic porphyria (Gűnther’s disease) and erythropoietic protoporphyria. In this review, we summarize the key features of normal heme synthesis and its differing regulation in liver versus bone marrow. In both organs, principal regulation is exerted at the level of the first and rate-controlling enzyme, but by different molecules (heme in the liver and iron in the bone marrow). We also describe salient clinical, laboratory and genetic features of the eight types of porphyria...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{zebrafish}} {{model of}} <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (HEP), we identify a previously unknown mechanism underlying heme-mediated regulation of exocrine zymogens. Zebrafish bach 1 b, nrf 2 a and mafK are all {{expressed in the}} zebrafish exocrine pancreas. Overexpression of bach 1 b or knockdown of nrf 2 a result in the downregulation of {{the expression of the}} exocrine zymogens, whereas overexpression of nrf 2 a or knockdown of bach 1 b cause their upregulation. In vitro luciferase assays demonstrate that heme activates the zymogens in a dosage-dependent manner and that the zymogen promoter activities require the integral Maf recognition element (MARE) motif. The Bach 1 b-MafK heterodimer represses the zymogen promoters, whereas the Nrf 2 a-MafK heterodimer activates them. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays show that MafK binds to the MARE sites in the 5 ′ regulatory regions of the zymogens. Taken together, these data indicate that heme stimulates the exchange of Bach 1 b for Nrf 2 a at MafK-occupied MARE sites and that, particularly in heme-deficient porphyria, the repressive Bach 1 b-MafK heterodimer dominates, which can be exchanged for the activating Nrf 2 a-MafK heterodimer upon treatment with hemin. These results provide novel insights into the regulation of exocrine function, as well as the pathogenesis of porphyria, and should be useful for designing new therapies for both types of disease...|$|E
40|$|A {{deficiency}} in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) enzyme activity, the fifth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, {{is found in}} patients with {{sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda}} (s-PCT), familial porphyria cutanea tarda (f-PCT), and <b>hepatoerythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (HEP). Subnormal UROD activity is due to mutations of the UROD gene in both f-PCT and HEP, but no mutations have been found in s-PCT. Genetic analysis has determined that f-PCT is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In contrast, HEP, a severe form of cutaneous porphyria, is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. HEP is characterized by a profound deficiency of UROD activity, and the disease is usually manifest in childhood. In this study, a strategy was designed to identify alleles responsible for the HEP phenotype in three unrelated families. Mutations of UROD were identified by direct sequencing of four amplified fragments that contained the entire coding sequence of the UROD gene. Two new missense mutations were observed at the homoallelic state: P 62 L (proline-to-leucine substitution at codon 62) in a Portuguese family and Y 311 C (tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 311) in an Italian family. A third mutation, G 281 E, was observed in a Spanish family. This mutation has been previously described in three families from Spain and one from Tunisia. In the Spanish family described in this report, a paternal uncle of the proband developed clinically overt PCT as an adult and proved to be heterozygous for the G 281 E mutation. Mutant cDNAs corresponding to the P 62 L and Y 311 C changes detected in these families were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Recombinant proteins proved to have subnormal enzyme activity, and the Y 311 C mutant was thermolabile...|$|E
