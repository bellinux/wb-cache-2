5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wood</b> and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E
25|$|Their predicament {{began on}} June 9, 1976, {{the day of}} her twenty-sixth birthday. The day before, she and Kevin had moved into a house a few miles away from their old {{apartment}} in Los Angeles. While unpacking, Dana suddenly becomes dizzy, and her surroundings begin to fade away. When she comes to her senses, she finds herself at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood,</b> near a river where a small, red-haired boy is drowning. Dana wades in after him, drags him to the shore, and tries to resuscitate him. The boy's mother, who had been unable to save him, begins screaming and hitting Dana, accusing her of killing her son, whom she identifies as Rufus. A man arrives and points a gun at Dana, terrifying her. She becomes dizzy again and arrives back at her new house with Kevin beside her. Kevin, shocked at her disappearance and reappearance, tries to understand if the whole episode was real or a hallucination.|$|E
500|$|They {{reached the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood,</b> {{close to the}} Temple de l'Amour, and came across a man seated beside a garden kiosk, wearing a cloak and large shady hat. According to Moberly, his {{appearance}} was [...] "most repulsive... its expression odious. His complexion was dark and rough." [...] Jourdain noted [...] "The man slowly turned his face, which was marked by smallpox; his complexion was very dark. The expression was evil and yet unseeing, and though I {{did not feel that}} he was looking particularly at us, I felt a repugnance to going past him. A man later described as [...] "tall... with large dark eyes, and crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat" [...] came up to them, and showed them the way to the Petit Trianon.|$|E

6000|$|Half <b>an</b> hour <b>of</b> riding {{brought them}} to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woods,</b> and here they had to proceed in single file, or [...] "Indian fashion," [...] as Belle {{expressed}} it.|$|R
60|$|After {{crossing}} <b>a</b> {{level stretch}} <b>of</b> prairie, {{they came to}} the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woods.</b> Not far off was a shack similar to those to be seen all over this section of our country.|$|R
2500|$|About [...] {{south of}} White Oak Road and [...] east of Five Forks, Mackenzie's troopers {{encountered}} a considerable force of Roberts's men posted in rifle pits along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood</b> along White Oak Road {{with an open}} field to their front. Rapid fire from Mackenzie's men who were armed with Spencer repeating carbines kept the Confederates pinned down and allowed Mackenzie personally to lead Major Robert S. Monroe's battalion of the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry on horseback across the rifle pits into White Oak Road, striking the left flank of the Confederate line. The North Carolina cavalrymen retreated in confusion as {{the remainder of the}} 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry charged the Confederate cavalry's line. Union brigade commander Colonel Samuel P. Spear was wounded in the mopping up operation.|$|E
2500|$|At the First Battle of Manassas, {{also known}} as the First Battle of Bull Run, on July 21, 1861, the 1st Maryland was {{combined}} with the 13th Virginia Infantry, 10th Virginia Infantry and 3rd Tennessee Regiments to form the 4th Brigade, led by Brigadier General E. Kirby Smith. Smith's men were late in arriving at the battle and approached the Confederate left near Chinn Ridge. The battle got off to a bad start when Elzey was forced to assume temporary command of the brigade, as General Smith was shot from his horse and injured by enemy fire. However, Elzey was able to bring his men into line facing the flank of the Federal army, the brigade commanded by General Oliver O. Howard. His men advanced to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood</b> without being detected by the Union army and opened fire, after which they charged over open ground into the Union position. Soon they were joined by Colonel Jubal A. Early on the Confederate left flank and shortly afterwards Howard's line began to disintegrate. As the federal forces fled, General Beauregard congratulated Elzey, commending him as [...] "the Blucher of the day".|$|E
60|$|While thus engaged {{they came}} to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood,</b> and the boy sat down to rest upon an old {{sawhorse}} that some woodcutter had left there.|$|E
50|$|It {{lies at the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woods,</b> {{and is now the}} {{location}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> picnic site. It is one of the earliest examples <b>of</b> <b>a</b> barrow with separate chambers. It was constructed around 2800 BCE.|$|R
50|$|The Spodnje Radvanje Mass Grave (Grobišče Spodnje Radvanje) lies {{south of}} the city, on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woods</b> about 250 m from the house at Spodnje Radvanje no. 31. It {{contains}} the remains of unknown victims and its location was identified in 2002.|$|R
60|$|So he rode {{at such a}} gait for a {{considerable}} pass until, by and by, he perceived Sir Palamydes upon the road before him; and Sir Palamydes {{was at that time}} come to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woods</b> where there were several stone windmills with great sails swinging very slowly around before a strong wind that was blowing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} it would be safe in any {{farmhouse}} within ten miles of here; but if you like to come with me, my hut stands at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood,</b> and you could leave him there without much risk." ...|$|E
60|$|At the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood</b> there lived {{an old man}} who {{had only}} one son, and one day he called the boy to him and said he wanted some corn ground, but the youth must be sure never to enter any mill where the miller was beardless.|$|E
60|$|After a time, Rollo found, on {{the margin}} of the field, near the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood,</b> an old stump, taller than he was, much decayed. There was a hole in the top. Rollo climbed up so that he could put a stick in, and run it down, to see how far down the hole {{extended}}. He found that it extended down very near to the bottom.|$|E
5000|$|Žeje pri Komendi is {{the site}} of two known mass graves from the period {{immediately}} after the Second World War. The graves contain the remains of 10 to 15 prisoners from Kamnik that were murdered in May and June 1945. Their nationality and whether they were soldiers or civilians is unknown. The Kuhar Woods Mass Grave (Grobišče Kuharjev boršt) is located near a path on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woods</b> north <b>of</b> the main settlement. The Smovc Mass Grave (...) is located southwest of the main settlement.|$|R
50|$|BorekA {{small group}} of {{farmsteads}} 2 km southwest of Kamionka, {{on the north side}} of the country road to Samokleski. The farmsteads are builtup against the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small <b>wood.</b>|$|R
60|$|After {{continuing}} his journey {{for an hour}} without further interruption he saw before him the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great <b>wood,</b> and knew that {{in the midst of}} this forest of trees was the castle of Maetta.|$|R
60|$|Then they {{determined}} to kill Penelope also, and, attacking her with their tomahawks, they so cut and wounded {{her that she}} fell down bleeding and insensible. Having built a fire, these brave warriors cooked themselves a comfortable meal, and then departed. But Penelope was not killed, and, coming to her senses, her instincts {{told her that the}} first thing to do was to hide herself from these bloodthirsty red men: so, slowly and painfully, she crawled away to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood,</b> and found there a great hollow tree, into which she crept.|$|E
60|$|Foster would sooner {{have kept}} him, but {{was unwilling to}} admit that he did not like to be alone. It was not very far to the thorn tree and Pete would soon {{overtake}} him. He went on, but did not loiter, and noted how his footsteps echoed along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood</b> ahead. In fact, the noise he made rather jarred his nerves, but the grass by the roadside was hummocky and wet. The road was dark beside the wood, for the moon was near the tops of the black firs, but there were gaps through which the silver light shone down.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{a moment}} only I stood irresolute, then, {{throwing}} down my gun, I ran forward to my friend's assistance. I had a vague {{belief that he}} was suffering from a fit or some form of convulsion. Before I could reach his side he was down and quiet. All sounds had ceased, but, with a feeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired, I now saw the same mysterious movement of the wild oats prolonging itself from the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood.</b> It was only when it had reached the wood that I was able to withdraw my eyes and look at my companion. He was dead." ...|$|E
50|$|The third {{source of}} Sviyaga is {{in a rather}} better {{position}} and is located to the west {{from the village of}} Baevka. It originates from a spring on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pine <b>wood.</b> The springs are powerful, and the water is clean.|$|R
5000|$|During the Battle of Opequon or Third Winchester, as the XIX Corps was reorganizing its lines, Thoburn's {{division}} {{came up from}} {{reserve and}} took position at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woods.</b> Sheridan soon arrived and directed Thoburn to move forward {{as soon as the}} other division of the Eighth Corps was ready. About 3 p.m. [...] "a mighty battle yell," [...] {{from the other side of}} Red Bud Run announced the arrival of those troops. The Union lines advanced, and, as one participant recalled, [...] "For thirty minutes the battle that ensued was perfectly terrific, but then the forces in our front gave way, and in an instant we were over their works, and after them with yells and shouts of victory." ...|$|R
5000|$|Borek [...] is a {{small village}} in Gmina Kamionka (Kamionka Commune), Lubartów County in Poland in Lublin Voivodeship. <b>A</b> small group <b>of</b> {{farmsteads}} 2 km southwest of Kamionka, {{on the north side}} of the country road to Samoklęski.

60|$|Of course, it came at last; he who {{ignores the}} law of probabilities {{challenges}} an adversary that is seldom beaten. It was at Resaca, in Georgia, during the movement {{that resulted in the}} taking of Atlanta. In front of our brigade the enemy's line of earthworks ran through open fields along a slight crest. At each end of this open ground we were close up to him in the woods, but the clear ground we could not hope to occupy until night, when darkness would enable us to burrow like moles and throw up earth. At this point our line was a quarter-mile away in the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood.</b> Roughly, we formed a semicircle, the enemy's fortified line being the chord of the arc.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{had been}} sitting on the bridge, but he jumped up as a rhythmic tramp of feet came down the hillside. Dust rose among the cornfields and hung in a white streak along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood,</b> {{and then with a}} {{twinkling}} flash of steel, small, ocher-colored figures swung out of the shadow. They came on in loose fours, in an unending line that wound down the steep slopes and reached the bridge-head. Then orders rolled across the stream, the line narrowed, and the measured tramp changed to a sharp uneven patter. The leading platoon were breaking step as they crossed the bridge. Dick frowned impatiently. This was a needless precaution. The engineers' work was good; it would stand the percussive shock of marching feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I propose {{beginning}} the alterations at once," [...] I explained. [...] "By luck there {{happens to be}} a gamekeeper's cottage vacant and within distance. The agent is going to get me the use of it for a year--a primitive little place, but charmingly situate on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood.</b> I shall furnish a couple of rooms; and for part of every week I shall make a point of being down there, superintending. I have always been considered good at superintending. My poor father used to say it was the only work I seemed to take an interest in. By being on the spot to hurry everybody on I hope to have the 'show,' as you term it, ready by the spring." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} Willard {{came up from}} the harbour and took Miss Sally down to see Eden. Eden was a tiny, cornery, gabled grey house just across the road and down a long, twisted windy lane, {{skirting}} the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beech <b>wood.</b> Nobody had lived in it for four years, {{and it had a}} neglected, out-at-elbow appearance.|$|R

She wears a garland in her hair. The {{foreground}} is in shadow, with sunlight visible through the trees. Shrubs in blossom and the size of the sheep suggest springtime.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of the 5th the VI corps led by the 26th New Jersey and 5th Vermont began {{crossing}} the Rappahannock River near Deep Run. The initial attempt at crossing was soon repulsed by Confederates entrenched in rifle pits on the southern bank. After artillery fire failed to dislodge the Confederates, Sedgewick ordered two regiments to cross in pontoon boats. The Union troops were able to successfully land the boats on the southern bank and overrun the rifle pits, capturing 35 prisoners. They then advanced up the bank to <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woods</b> where they encountered <b>a</b> strong detachment <b>of</b> Confederates supported by artillery. A hot fire fight ensued that was described as [...] "severe" [...] at times before the Union advance was halted and driven back across the river, suffering 57 casualties. When the Federals failed to attack again, Hill withdrew the following day to rejoin the army.|$|R
60|$|While I was yet a mere child I {{was sent}} to a daily school, about two miles distant. The schoolhouse was on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood,</b> close by a brook {{overhung}} with birches, alders, and dwarf willows. We of the school who lived at some distance came with our dinners put up in little baskets. In the intervals of school hours we would gather round a spring, under a tuft of hazel-bushes, and have a kind of picnic; interchanging the rustic dainties with which our provident mothers had fitted us out. Then, when our joyous repast was over, and my companions were disposed for play, I would draw forth one of my cherished story-books, stretch myself on the green sward, and soon lose myself in its bewitching contents.|$|E
60|$|Ralph {{had noticed}} a cottage, {{standing}} by {{itself at the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood,</b> at some little distance from the bivouac of {{the night of the}} 30th of November; and had stopped for a moment, and asked a few questions of the woman who lived there. She had appeared a kind-hearted woman, full of hatred for the invader; and had two sons in the Mobiles, who had marched north when Paris was first threatened, and who were now besieged there. For this cottage Ralph determined to make, in order--if the owners would receive him--to take shelter in the house; otherwise, to find a refuge in the wood, itself, where he doubted not that they would assist him to lie hid for a few days. He had no great fear of a very active search being made for fugitives, at present, as the Prussians had only driven back two divisions of the French army; and had, Ralph believed, plenty of work on their hands, for some time.|$|E
60|$|Having {{thanked the}} old woman with {{tears in her eyes}} for her hospitality, and for the good news she had given her, the Princess set out on her journey and rested neither night nor day, so great was her longing to see her husband again. On and on she walked until her last pair of shoes fell in pieces. So she threw them away and went on with bare feet, not heeding the bogs nor the thorns that wounded her, nor the stones that bruised her. At last she reached a {{beautiful}} green meadow on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wood.</b> Her heart was cheered by the sight of the flowers and the soft cool grass, and she sat down and rested for a little. But hearing the birds chirping to their mates among the trees made her think with longing of her husband, and she wept bitterly, and taking her child in her arms, and her bundle of chicken bones on her shoulder, she entered the wood.|$|E

5000|$|Zgornja Kapla is {{the site}} of three known mass graves or unmarked graves {{associated}} with the Second World War. All of the victims were murdered in May 1945 by the Jože Lacko Detachment of the Partisan forces.
