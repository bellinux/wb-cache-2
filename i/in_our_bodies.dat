25|$|According to d'Eslon, Mesmer {{understood}} {{health as}} {{the free flow}} of the process of life through thousands of channels <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>bodies.</b> Illness was caused by obstacles to this flow. Overcoming these obstacles and restoring flow produced crises, which restored health. When Nature failed to do this spontaneously, contact with a conductor of animal magnetism was a necessary and sufficient remedy. Mesmer aimed to aid or provoke the efforts of Nature. To cure an insane person, for example, involved causing a fit of madness. The advantage of magnetism involved accelerating such crises without danger.|$|E
25|$|In his 2005 book, The Singularity is Near, Kurzweil {{suggests}} that medical advances would {{allow people to}} protect their bodies {{from the effects of}} aging, making the life expectancy limitless. Kurzweil argues that the technological advances in medicine would allow us to continuously repair and replace defective components <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>bodies,</b> prolonging life to an undetermined age. Kurzweil further buttresses his argument by discussing current bio-engineering advances. Kurzweil suggests somatic gene therapy; after synthetic viruses with specific genetic information, the next step would be to apply this technology to gene therapy, replacing human DNA with synthesized genes.|$|E

The term probiotic is currently used to name ingested microorganisms associated with benefits for humans and animals. The term came into more common use after 1980. The introduction of the concept (but not the term) is generally attributed to Nobel laureate Élie Metchnikoff, who postulated that yogurt-consuming Bulgarian peasants lived longer lives because of this custom. He suggested in 1907 that [...] "the dependence of the intestinal microbes on the food {{makes it possible to}} adopt measures to modify the flora <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> and to replace the harmful microbes by useful microbes". A significant expansion of the potential market for probiotics has led to higher requirements for scientific substantiation of putative benefits conferred by the microorganisms.|$|E

Inner Commands of the Book of Changes, Ch'ih-sung tzu's Classic, and The Life-dealing Amulets of the Ho-t'u-chi are unanimous {{in saying that}} the gods of heaven and earth who {{are in charge of}} misdeeds make deductions from people's three-day reckonings according to the degree of their wrongdoing. As these reckonings decrease, a man becomes poorer and falls ill; frequently he suffers anxiety. When no more are left, he dies. Since there are hundreds of things that may give rise to deductions, I cannot give a complete account. It is also said that there are Three Corpses [...] <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>bodies,</b> which, though not corporeal, actually are of a type with our inner, ethereal breaths, the powers, the ghosts, and the gods [...] They want us to die prematurely. (After death they become a man's ghost and move about at will to where sacrifices and libations are being offered.) Therefore, every fifty-seventh day of the sixty-day cycle they mount to heaven and personally report our misdeeds to the Director of Fates. Further, during the night of {{the last day of the}} month the hearth god also ascends to heaven and makes an oral report of a man's wrongs. For the more important misdeeds [...] a whole period of three hundred days is deducted. For the minor ones they deduct one reckoning , a reckoning being three days. Personally, I have not yet been able to determine whether this is really so or not, but that is because the ways of heaven are obscure, and ghosts and gods are hard to understand. (6, tr. Ware 1966:115-6) ...|$|E
