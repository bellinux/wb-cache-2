25|$|On 23 January 1806 Unique {{encountered}} a large French privateer. An engagement followed during which Brand was killed. Unique foundered shortly after she surrendered. One {{mention of the}} action reports that the French vessel had twice the armament of Unique, and that the British schooner sank with her colours still <b>flying.</b> <b>Brand</b> was reportedly killed while leading an attempt to board the French vessel. All the other British officers also died in the action.|$|E
60|$|But this time, {{before he}} dozed again, he tied a burning pine-knot {{to his right}} hand. His eyes were closed but few minutes when the burn of the flame on his flesh awakened him. For several hours he adhered to this programme. Every time he was thus awakened he drove back the wolves with <b>flying</b> <b>brands,</b> {{replenished}} the fire, and rearranged the pine-knot on his hand. All worked well, but there came {{a time when he}} fastened the pine- knot insecurely. As his eyes closed it fell away from his hand.|$|R

50|$|The fire {{could have}} spread further, but Toronto west of Church Street was saved by a rain shower at about 3:30 a.m. This wet down {{the roofs of}} {{buildings}} to the west, {{making it harder for}} <b>flying</b> <b>brands</b> to ignite them. The wind was from the north-east, pushing the fire away from the court house, fire hall and St. Andrew's Church west of Church Street. At 4 a.m., troops arrived to assist the firefighters, and it was this assistance that likely saved the buildings {{on the south side of}} King Street from major damage. According to The Globe, the fire was mostly extinguished by 5 a.m.|$|R

5000|$|Founded in 1931 by Charles Wilmot and Joe Mansour, International Model Aircraft Ltd. (IMA) {{originally}} {{used the}} Frog brand name (said {{to stand for}} [...] "Flies Right Off the Ground") on the Interceptor Mk.4 semi-scale rubber-band powered flying model, launched the following year. Also in 1932, a marketing partnership with the toy company Lines Bros Ltd. was formed and other Frog <b>brand</b> <b>flying</b> models followed. In 1936, a range of 1:72 scale aircraft models in kit or pre-built form, moulded in cellulose acetate, was launched under the Frog Penguin name (alluding to the non-flying nature of these models). These were the world's first plastic model construction kits. An early release was the No.21P Empire Flying Boat, issued in 1938.|$|R
50|$|The Airline was {{established}} in 2002 and started operations in June 2003. It was owned by Mike Hawkins (49.9%) and Shaun Dewey (49.9%) and operated from London Gatwick Airport, Newcastle International Airport and Manchester Ringway Airport. SilverJet acquired Flyjet in October 2006. The Flyjet London Gatwick base was then closed and Head Office and Operations all relocated from London Gatwick Airport to London Luton Airport. The Airline continued to operate under the Flyjet Charter brand from Newcastle and Manchester Airports, with the SilverJet Scheduled <b>brand</b> <b>flying</b> from London Luton Airport. Newcastle and Manchester bases were closed in October 2007 and the two Boeing 757-200ERs (G-FJEA, G-FJEB) were returned to the leasing company, with the Boeing 767-200ER G-FJEC (which was then re-registered as G-SJET) being retained and operated by SilverJet.|$|R
500|$|Still {{very much}} {{interested}} in insects, Edwards spent his spare time at the California Academy of Sciences studying butterflies under Hans Hermann Behr, the academy's curator for Lepidoptera, the scientific order of moths and butterflies. Elected {{a member of the}} academy in 1867, he concentrated on describing the structure and habits of moths and butterflies on the Pacific coast from British Columbia to Baja California. He went to visit John Muir in Yosemite Valley in June 1871, with a letter of introduction from Jeanne Carr, the wife of California's chief geologist Ezra S. Carr. The letter described Edwards as [...] "one of Nature's truest and most devoted disciples", a sojourner who [...] "has the keys to the Kingdom". After the visit, Muir occasionally sent specimens from the Sierras to add to Edwards' collection, carried to San Francisco by men such as geologist and artist Clarence King who were returning from Yosemite field study. Edwards presented a series of papers to the academy entitled Pacific Coast Lepidoptera, and classified two species as new to science. He named one Gyros muiri for Muir, with [...] "Hy. Edw." [...] as the attribution. In 1872, Muir sent Edwards a letter, writing [...] "You are now in constant remembrance, because every <b>flying</b> flower is <b>branded</b> with your name." [...] In 1873, Edwards became the curator of entomology at the academy, and began to serve on the Publications Committee which produced the journal Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences. Beginning early that year, he befriended George Robert Crotch. Although it is sometimes claimed that he accompanied Crotch on his insect collecting tour of California, Oregon and British Columbia, Edwards was only aware of Crotch's travels as a correspondent. [...] Edwards independently visited British Columbia in 1873, missing Crotch by several days at Vancouver Island. [...] In 1874, Edwards began to serve as one of the academy's vice presidents, and for the academy in late 1874 after Crotch's death from tuberculosis, he published a memorial tribute to the man. Edwards also wrote one of many tributes to academician Louis Agassiz at his death in late 1873. At the academy on January 2, 1877, Edwards was elected member for life.|$|R
