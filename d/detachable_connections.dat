40|$|Shape-memory-materials show good {{actuating}} properties {{based on}} their high reversible strain potential. The implicit positioning range can profitably be used in micro machines, if <b>detachable</b> <b>connections</b> between shape-memory-elements and adjacent steel-components are sufficiently realized. In this paper theoretical approaches to describe the design principles of the shaft to collar connections are followed by experimental validation of clamping and pressfit connections. The variation of the preload for clamping connections can be predicted if the temperature-dependent elasticity of the shape-memory element is known. The experimental results for longitudinal pressfit connections match the extended theoretical elastic plastic model. The load transfer is characterized by considerable slip between shaft and collar even if small loads are applied. This results in huge hysteresis for cyclic loading. The evaluation of the surface appearance confirms the necessity of the calculated large joint length. Dependent on the temperature and the micro structure of the shape-memory-component different wear mechanisms are of major importance. (orig.)

40|$|In battery applications, every {{electrical}} connection of battery cells {{is important because}} it influences functionality, efficiency, and safety. Increased contact resistances generate more heat at the affected terminals and if contact resistances of parallel-connected battery cells differ the current divides unequally. Amongst different techniques, <b>detachable</b> <b>connections</b> are easy to handle and have advantages for service, repair and recycling. Usually, detachable {{electrical connection}}s are based on the functional principle of press contacts. So, press contacts are frequently used for consumer batteries in electronic devices, for pouch battery cells in scientific tests, and for large battery cells with screw connections. This paper focusses on the electrical contact resistance of press contacts for battery cells. A novel measuring method to assess the contact resistance itself is presented. Common terminal and connector metals for battery cells and the dependence of their contact resistances on the contact pressure, surface roughness, and contact area are investigated and compared with welding techniques. Only if these dependencies are considered, contact resistances as low as for welded connections are achieved. Furthermore, due to its hard passivating Al 203 surface film, aluminum contacts need a certain surface roughness. The obtained results can serve for modeling and development of battery assemblies...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{main advantages}} and disadvantages of mobile mortar concrete plants in comparison with stationary concrete mixing units. The main idea of the mobility is to provide quick movement. In its turn, this approach imposes some restrictions on dimensions and weights of concrete mixing equipment. However {{in the context of the}} concrete mixing equipment and construction site as whole the mobility concept is considered in the form of three components: minimum expenses on site preparation for assembly of a mortar concrete plant, transportability, reduction in installation and startand-adjustment periods. In this regard processing chain for production of concrete and mortar mixes is divided in separate complete operations. Then it is necessary to develop modules which are performing the required operations. Every module is developed in accordance with the size of a shipping container in order to make transportation convenient. <b>Detachable</b> <b>connections</b> are stipulated in the place of module linkages, electrical wiring, pipelines for supply water and chemical admixtures, pneumatics. Henceforth, these connections make it possible to reduce time for on-site assembly and disassembly of the equipment. The paper presents a mobile mortar concrete unit of block-module arrangement which has been developed within the framework of the State Scientific Research Programme at the BNTU. The unit has been manufactured using production capacities of JSC “Viprotekh” and it has been successfully introduced in production process. One of the promising directions is to use the mobile mortar concrete plants which are located and which are operating directly on construction sites. Their economic efficiency becomes higher with an increase of distance to the nearest stationary mortar concrete unit and scope of concreting works. Mobile mortar concrete plants are mainly intended for construction organizations which are realizing construction projects away from urban infrastructure and transportation networks: bridges, dams, highways, transport junctions. While ensuring the same production output of concrete these plants are located in close proximity to the construction site and the required mortars can be supplied directly to the site with the help of special concrete pumps. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Screw thread {{connection}} {{is a common}} way of <b>detachable</b> <b>connection.</b> The invalidation of screw {{thread connection}} will lead to mechanical failure or even retirement. Vibration tapping is essentially a kind of high-energy impact cutting which increases the rigidity of the tool. Composite vibration tapping simultaneously with repeated cutting action reduces the surface recovery of plastic materials and enhances metal cutting rate. Theoretical study and experimental results show that vibration tapping improves the metal cutting rates, enhances the machining accuracy and makes screw thread connection assembly easier. At the same time, vibration tapping process does not reduce the strength of screw thread. As the screw thread can be more uniformed cut at different depths, vibration tapping enhances the strength of screw thread slightly...|$|R
