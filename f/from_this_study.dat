5|$|In 2015 a major DNA {{study of}} golden jackals {{concluded}} that the six C.aureus subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species C.anthus (African golden wolf), {{reducing the number of}} golden jackal subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> shows the golden jackal diverging from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago and the African golden wolf diverging 1.3million years ago. The study found that the golden jackal and the African golden wolf shared a very similar skull and body morphology and that this had confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull and body morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.|$|E

5|$|In October and November 2004, the IOC {{established}} an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The {{goal was to}} apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic programme. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This {{may be due to the}} increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E
5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E

25|$|More recent {{research}} has extended established findings of age related decline in executive functioning, by examining related cognitive processes that underlie healthy older adults’ sequential performance. Sequential performance refers to the execution of a series steps needed to complete a routine, such as the steps required to make {{a cup of coffee}} or drive a car. An important part of healthy aging involves older adults’ use of memory and inhibitory processes to carry out daily activities in a fixed order without forgetting the sequence of steps that were just completed while remembering {{the next step in the}} sequence. A recent study examined how young and older adults differ in the underlying representation of a sequence of tasks and their efficiency at retrieving the information needed to complete their routine. Findings <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> revealed that when older and young adults had to remember a sequence of 8 animal images arranged in a fixed order, both age groups spontaneously used the organizational strategy of chunking to facilitate retrieval of information. However, older adults were slower at accessing each chunk compared to younger adults, and were better able to benefit from the use of memory aids, such as verbal rehearsal to remember the order of the fixed sequence. Results <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> suggest that there are age differences in memory and inhibitory processes that affect people’s sequence of actions and the use of memory aids could facilitate the retrieval of information in older age.|$|E
25|$|Expanded newborn {{screening}} is also opposed by among some health care providers, {{who are concerned}} that effective follow-up and treatment may not be available, that false positive screening tests may cause harm, and issues of informed consent.

25|$|A 1998 {{study was}} {{performed}} using three comparable Louisiana medium security prisons, {{two of which}} were privately run by different corporations and {{one of which was}} publicly run. The data <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> suggested that the privately run prisons operated more cost-effectively without sacrificing the safety of inmates and staff. The study concluded that both privately run prisons had a lower cost per inmate, a lower rate of critical incidents, a safer environment for employees and inmates, and a higher proportional rate of inmates who completed basic education, literacy, and vocational training courses. However, the publicly run prison outperformed the privately run prisons in areas such as experiencing fewer escape attempts, controlling substance abuse through testing, offering a wider range of educational and vocational courses, and providing a broader range of treatment, recreation, social services, and rehabilitative services.|$|E

25|$|Although forced-choice {{questionnaires}} show {{a statistically}} significant sex- difference, critics {{of the theory of}} evolved sex differences in jealousy question these findings. In consideration of the entire body of work on sex differences, Harris (2003) asserted that when methods other than forced-choice questionnaires are used to identify an innate sex difference, inconsistencies between studies begin to arise. For example, in a study by Sangrin & Guadango (2005), the authors found that women sometimes report feeling more intense jealousy in response to both sexual and emotional infidelity. The results of these studies also depended on {{the context in which the}} participants were made to describe what type of jealousy they felt, as well as the intensity of their jealousy. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> it is clear that context plays a role in the responses men and women give researchers and therefore how sex-differences are interpreted.|$|E

25|$|Nasutoceratops was {{assigned}} to the Centrosaurinae in 2013, in a relatively basal position. A phylogenetic analysis performed by Sampson et al. (2013) found Nasutoceratops to be the sister taxon of Avaceratops. According to this study, the existence of Nasutoceratops would support the hypothesis of faunal separation between the north and south of Laramidia. Its clade would differ from the northern centrosaurines in the retention of long brow horns and a short nose horn, combined with developing, convergent with the Chasmosaurinae, low epiparietals. In 2016, this clade was named Nasutoceratopsini; it contains Nasutoceratops as well as ANSP 15800 (the holotype of Avaceratops), MOR 692 (previously treated as an adult specimen of Avaceratops), the newly-described CMN 8804 from the Oldman Formation, and another undescribed ceratopsian found in Malta, Montana.

25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{attempting to}} account for the rapid decline and abandonment of Angkor have hypothesized natural disasters such as disease (Bubonic Plague), earthquakes, inundations, or drastic climate changes as the relevant agents of destruction. A study of tree rings in Vietnam, produced a record of early monsoons that passed through this area. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> we can tell that during the 14th-15th centuries monsoons were weakened and eventually followed by extreme flooding. Their inability to adapt their flooding infrastructure may have led to its eventual decline. Recent research by Australian archaeologists suggests that the decline may have been due to a shortage of water caused by the transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. LDEO dendrochronological research has established tree-ring chronologies indicating severe periods of drought across mainland Southeast Asia in the early 15th century, raising the possibility that Angkor's canals and reservoirs ran dry and ended expansion of available farmland.|$|E
