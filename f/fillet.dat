40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to observe the relationships between operator’s work performance (speed of <b>filleting</b> and actual output rate of round codfish as well as of <b>fillets)</b> and his physiological parameters (mean heart rate, blood pressure and product of mean heart rate and blood pressure) during codfish <b>filleting</b> operation, and at the same time collect sufficient data to observe the effect of factors, such as speed of <b>filleting</b> and size of fish on the actual output rate and percentage yield of <b>filleting.</b> The effect of size of round codfish <b>filleted</b> on mean heart rate and normal output rate (round fish as well as <b>fillets)</b> of the <b>filleting</b> operator was also investigated. [...] This study was carried out at a small fish processing plant. Four average skilled male <b>filleting</b> operators were selected with the help of plant supervisors. Each subject was asked to work at five different <b>filleting</b> speeds, on an individual type <b>filleting</b> table layout. “Head on-gut in” codfish was supplied to each operator in 75 lb. boxes. A total of about 2625 lbs. of round codfish was processed during this study. A total of 35 individual experiments were performed. The actual time of <b>filleting</b> each box of 75 lbs. round codfish, performance rating (speed of <b>filleting),</b> number of codfish/ 75 lb. box, weight of skin-on <b>fillets,</b> operator’s mean heart rate and blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) were recorded for each <b>filleting</b> experiment. [...] Within the range and scope of this study, the analysis of the results indicated following trends: [...] 1. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of <b>filleting</b> and mean heart rate of the operator. [...] 2. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of <b>filleting</b> and systolic blood pressure of the operator. [...] 3. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of <b>filleting</b> and product of mean heart rate and systolic blood pressure of the operator. [...] 4. Significant linear negative relationship between speed of <b>filleting</b> and percentage yield produced. [...] 5. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of <b>filleting</b> and actual output rate (round fish as well as <b>fillets)</b> produced. [...] 6. Significant linear positive relationship between actual output rate (round fish as well as <b>fillets)</b> and mean heart rate of <b>filleting</b> operator. [...] 7. Significant linear positive relationship between size of round fish <b>filleted</b> and actual output rate (round fish as well as <b>fillets)</b> produced. [...] 8. Significant linear positive relationship between size of round fish <b>filleted</b> and mean heart rate of the operator. [...] 9. Significant curvilinear positive relationship between size of round fish <b>filleted</b> and normal output rate (round fish as well as <b>fillets)</b> produced. [...] Management in fish plants could use the relationships between work performance (actual output rate, etc.) and physiological parameters (mean heart rate, etc.) to design a better method of <b>filleting,</b> working height and work layout etc., and therefore improve the efficiency of the plant, without causing unnecessary higher physiological loads on the operator. [...] This study also suggests that management in fish plants should set work standards by establishing relationships between size of fish and normal output rate for a range of different species of fish, input quality of fish, offshore-inshore fish, and dressed-undressed condition of the fish...|$|R

Cod caught off {{the west coast}} of Norway were immediately <b>filleted</b> after slaying, packed in plastic bags and irradiated at the Institute of Atomic Energy, Kjeller. The doses were 25, 50, 90 and 180 krad. Irradiated and nonirradiated <b>fillets</b> were stored at 0 °C and analysed at intervals with respect to proteolytic activity, total bacterial count, trimethylamine (TMA), total volatile base (TVB), volatile acids (VA), hypoxanthine and glutamate-oxalacetate-transaminase (GOT). In irradiated cod <b>fillets</b> the proteolytic activity was considerably lower than in nonirradiated <b>fillets.</b> The proteolytic activity is correlated with the bacterial count, which was significantly decreased by irradiation. Correspondingly, TMA, TVB, VA and hypoxanthine formation were retarded by irradiation. The GOT concentration was lower in irradiated <b>fillets</b> than in nonirradiated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate whether the essential oil of Aloysia triphylla (EOAT) used in vivo as a sedative in the water for transporting fish could increase the oxidative stability of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) <b>fillets</b> during frozen storage. The chemical composition of EOAT and of <b>fillets</b> from fish exposed to EOAT (0, 30 or 40 µL L- 1) were assessed. The pH and lipid oxidation parameters (conjugated dienes, CD; thiobarbituric acid-reactive-substances, TBARS) were evaluated in the <b>fillets</b> throughout the storage period (- 18 ± 2 oC/ 17 months). The main compounds found in EOAT were α- and β-citral. Treatment with EOAT did not modify the proximate composition of the <b>fillets,</b> but 40 µL L- 1 EOAT reduced pH levels {{when compared to the}} control <b>fillets</b> (P< 0. 05). Compared to the control <b>fillets,</b> the <b>fillets</b> from fish treated with 30 and 40 µL L- 1 EOAT had higher initial CD values (P< 0. 05), whereas <b>fillets</b> from fish treated with 40 µL L- 1 EOAT had lower TBARS levels after 6, 9 and 17 months of storage (P< 0. 05). Results indicated that use of EOAT as a sedative in silver catfish transport water delays the degradation of primary oxidation products (CD) into secondary products (TBARS) in the frozen <b>fillets.</b> This delay in the lipid oxidation rate may increase the shelf life of frozen <b>fillets...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} three {{experiments}} were conducted to compare physical and microbiological properties of raw and marinated broiler breast <b>fillets</b> selected as being either lighter or darker than normal. Visibly light- and dark-colored breast <b>fillets</b> were divided into marinated and control groups, and vacuum-tumbled for 20 min at 4 C under 80 kPa pressure. Breast <b>fillets</b> from the four treatment groups were evaluated for shear values, raw and cooked meat pH, drip-loss, cook-loss, water-holding capacity, and 7 d psychrotrophic count. The light-colored <b>fillets</b> were significantly lighter, less red, and more yellow than the dark <b>fillets.</b> Lightness values increased when <b>fillets</b> were marinated. Moreover, the light <b>fillets</b> had a lower pH than dark <b>fillets.</b> The pH values of raw and cooked breast meat were related to meat color but not marination. Dark-colored <b>fillets</b> had significantly higher marination pick-up and a higher fraction of bound moisture and significantly lower drip and cook-loss.

40|$|Recently, {{the poultry}} {{industry}} has encountered an emerging muscle myopathy known as woody breast (WB), which {{is characterized by}} hardness throughout the Pectoralis major muscle. Two experiments were performed to assess sensory characteristics and acceptability of WB meat and {{to determine the effect}} of broiler age on meat quality factors in varying severities of WB. <b>Fillets</b> were categorized as normal (NORM), moderate (MOD), or severe (SEV) WB. In Experiment 1 (Exp. 1), descriptive (n= 9 trained panelists) and consumer (n= 74 panelists) sensory analysis was conducted with NORM and SEV <b>fillets</b> at hot and cold serving temperatures (HOTNORM, COLDNORM, HOTSEV, COLDSEV). In Experiment 2 (Exp. 2), a consumer sensory panel (n= 70 panelists) evaluated acceptability of normal and WB meat from broilers processed at 45 or 63 -d of age. Meat quality factors, including compression force, sarcomere length, MORS energy (MORSE), BMORS energy (BMORSE), cook loss, and peak counts of the shear curves (PC-MORS and PC-BMORS), were measured on broilers processed at 45, 63, and 70 -d of age. In Exp. 1, descriptive sensory results showed that COLDSEV <b>fillets</b> had greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) hardness than HOTSEV <b>fillets.</b> Consumer sensory results indicated higher (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) overall impression and chicken texture scores for NORM <b>fillets</b> than SEV <b>fillets.</b> HOTNORM <b>fillets</b> had higher (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) chicken texture JAR scores than HOTSEV, while COLDNORM <b>fillets</b> had higher (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) chicken juiciness JAR scores than COLDSEV. Consumer sensory analysis in Exp. 2 resulted in 3 segmented groups (Group A, B, C) among the panelists based on overall liking of the samples. Panelist responses indicated that Group C had higher (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) overall liking scores for SEV <b>fillets</b> than NORM <b>fillets.</b> Meat quality analysis from Exp. 2 demonstrated greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) compression force, sarcomere length, and cook loss in SEV <b>fillets</b> than NORM <b>fillets.</b> Both MORSE and BMORSE values increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with age, and SEV <b>fillets</b> had greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) PC-BMORS than MOD and NORM <b>fillets.</b> Results suggest descriptive attributes and consumer acceptability responses are related to WB.
