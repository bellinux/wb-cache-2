In {{order to better}} consider this emission change pattern in future emission inventories, {{in the present study}} inland water transport emissions of NO x, CO 2 and PM were investigated under real world conditions on the river Rhine, Germany, in 2013. An average NO 2  ∕ NO x emission ratio of 0. 08  ±  0. 02 was obtained, which is indicative of ship diesel engines without <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> systems.

40|$|Tightening {{environmental}} constraints on {{exhaust gas emissions}} of gasoline and Diesel engines led to a growing interest in new and highly sophisticated gas sensors. Such sensors will be required in future <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> systems for the selective real time detection of pollutants such as nitric oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Restrictions on cost and device dimensions imposed by the automobile industry make semiconductor gas sensors promising candidates for the realization of cheap and small-size sensor devices. This work deals with semiconductor field effect devices with catalytically active platinum (Pt) electrodes and potential applications of such devices in automotive <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> systems. To allow for continuous operation at high temperatures, silicon carbide (SiC) and group III-nitrides such as GaN and AlGaN were used as semiconductor materials. Different devices have been realized with such materials: SiC based MOS capacitors (MOSiC), GaN Schottky diodes and GaN/AlGaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMT). The principle feasibility of SiC and GaN based field effect gas sensors for automotive applications was tested under laboratory conditions using synthetic gas mixtures. Exhaust gas components such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxides (NO and NO 2), various saturated and unsaturated hydro-carbons as well as water vapor, oxygen (O 2) and hydrogen (H 2) were used as test gases in appropriate concentrations with the sensor devices being operated {{in a range of}} temperatures extending from room temperature up to 600 degree C.

40|$|In {{the urban}} {{environment}} road traffic {{is the dominant}} source of aerosol particles while in coastal and harbour areas shipping is also a significant source. For shipping there are no direct regulations regarding particle emissions. For road traffic the emissions of particle mass has been regulated for over two decades but only {{during the last few}} years particle number has been included in emission regulations. Generally, nanoparticles are better described by their number rather than mass since they contribute insignificantly to the total particle mass of urban particles. Furthermore, particle number is believed to be a better metric for describing health effects than particle mass. Particle number and mass of the nanoparticles is however more difficult to measure both because of their small size but also because {{they are part of a}} highly dynamic system with constant exchange with the gas phase. The studies described in this thesis were conducted with the aim of increasing the knowledge on the emissions of nanoparticles from shipping and city transit buses. The focus has been on size resolved particle number emissions. The evolution of nanoparticles was studied by conducting measurements by extractions from the inside of the exhaust system and from the exhaust plume. Emissions of nanoparticles depend on combustion conditions, <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatments,</b> the fuel and ship/vehicle variations. In this study engine load and engine speed was found to be the most important factors studying individual vehicles or ships. For example, manoeuvring of a ship in the port areas was found to contribute to up to a factor of 64 times higher particle number emissions than during stable engine load at open sea. It was found the variation between vehicles or ships was the most important factor when studying a fleet of vehicles or ships operating on different fuels and/or <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatments.</b> For example, from a selection of 35 buses a few diesel fuelled buses were responsible for most of the particle mass emissions while a few buses fuelled with compressed natural gas were responsible for most of the particle number emissions. Controlling these extreme emitting individuals or specific operating conditions could be an effective way of reducing the total emission of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles extracted from the exhaust system are different compared to the nanoparticles found in the exhaust plume. In the ship exhaust system a soot mode was often found together with a volatile nucleation mode. In the ship exhaust plume the volatile nucleation mode coagulated quickly leaving soot covered with volatile material. Soot emissions were lower for the studied buses which supress condensation and the lower total number concentrations in the bus emissions reduce the rate of coagulation. Nucleation mode particles for the studied buses were found both in the exhaust system and in the exhaust plume. Nucleation versus condensation of volatile material has implications for the measured particle number and in addition, soot covered with volatile material has a denser structure than soot without condensable material. Non-volatile particles with a diameter of ~ 10 nm were found in the ship plume measurements which were not present in the on-board measurements. A hypothesis of organo-sulphates being formed in the exhaust plume was presented which could explain the formation of these particles. This emphasis that processes in the atmosphere can be of importance but they will not be covered in on-board or laboratory measurements...|$|R

Diesel exhaust (DE) {{is one of the}} major harmful components of traffic-related air pollution. Exposure to DE affects several physiological systems, including the airways, and pulmonary diseases are increased in highly populated urban areas. Hence, there are urgent needs to (1) create newer and lesser polluting fuels, (2) improve <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatments</b> and reduce emissions, and (3) understand mechanisms of actions for toxic effects of both conventional and cleaner diesel fuels on the lungs. These steps could aid the development of diagnostics and interventions to prevent the negative impact of traffic-related air pollution on the pulmonary system. Exhaust from conventional, and to a lesser extent, clean fuels, contains particulate matter (PM) and more than 400 additional chemical constituents. The major toxic constituents are nitrogen oxides (NOx) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PM and PAHs could potentially act via transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. In this review, we will first discuss the associations between DE from conventional as well as clean fuel technologies and acute and chronic airway inflammation. We will then review possible activation and/or potentiation of TRP vanilloid type 1 (TRPV 1) and ankyrin 1 (TRPA 1) channels by PM and PAHs. Finally, we will discuss and summarize recent findings on the mechanisms whereby TRPs could control the link between DE and airway inflammation, which is a primary determinant leading to pulmonary disease.

40|$|BackgroundChanging {{the fuel}} supply from {{petroleum}} based ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to biodiesel and its blends {{is considered by}} many to be a viable option for controlling exposures to particulate material (PM). This is critical in the mining industry where approximately 28, 000 underground miners are potentially exposed to relatively high concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM). This study was conducted to investigate the mutagenic potential of diesel engine emissions (DEE) from neat (B 100) and blended (B 50) soy-based fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biodiesel in comparison with ULSD PM using different engine operating conditions and <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> configurations. MethodsThe DPM samples were collected for engine equipped with either a standard muffler or a combination of the muffler and diesel oxidation catalytic converter (DOC) that was operated at four different steady-state modes. Bacterial gene mutation activity of DPM was tested on the organic solvent extracts using the Ames Salmonella assay. ResultsThe results indicate that mutagenic activity of DPM was strongly affected by fuels, engine operating conditions, and <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems. The mutagenicity was increased with the fraction of biodiesel in the fuel. While the mutagenic activity was observed in B 50 and B 100 samples collected from both light-and heavy-load operating conditions, the ULSD samples were mutagenic only at light-load conditions. The presence of DOC in the exhaust system resulted in the decreased mutagenicity when engine was fueled with B 100 and B 50 and operated at light-load conditions. This was not the case when engine was fueled with ULSD. Heavy-load operating condition in the presence of DOC resulted in a decrease of mutagenicity only when engine was fueled with B 50, but not B 100 or ULSD. ConclusionsTherefore, the results indicate that DPM from neat or blended biodiesel has a higher mutagenic potency than that one of ULSD.

Fluidic no-moving-part valves, inexpensive and robust, are proposed as an attractive alternative.

40|$|Particulate {{matter is}} formed during {{incomplete}} combustion in modern diesel and gasoline engines. These particulates start to grow from tiny carbonaceous structures or condensed volatiles and eventually form larger porous agglomerates. When emitted to the ambient air, they {{may end up}} in human lungs and eventually cause premature deaths among susceptible individuals. It is therefore imperative to remove as much (on a mass basis) and as many (on a number basis) of these particles before the exhaust exits the tailpipe. In the continued development and optimization of <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> systems {{for the removal of}} diesel and gasoline particulate matter, computer-aided simulations can help both to cut the design and development time and to provide information that is otherwise difficult to access by direct measurements. In the present work, detailed mathematical models are used to investigate the motion and deposition of particulate matter in generic <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> systems. It is shown that particulate matter from internal combustion engines can be divided into three groups depending on their size, and that these groups are transported differently in the aftertreatment system. This is reflected in the extent and location of particle deposition, and can be taken advantage of in emission control engineering. Furthermore, it is shown that the different sensitivity of the particles to the range of transport phenomena present have important consequences for the construction of computationally efficient models for describing the particle motion. In addition, the effects of turbulence on the motion of particulate matter are discussed. It has often been suggested that the turbulent-to-laminar flow transition {{in the first part of}} the channels enhance the mass transfer characteristics of a monolithic reactor. With the aid of comprehensive numerical models, the effects of the upstream turbulence on the extent of particle deposition inside the channels can be quantified. It is also shown that the flow field – and thus the particle motion – inside the channels can be significantly affected by ageing and deposit accumulation in the areas surrounding the channel inlets. </p...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the lower}} EURO 4 {{emission}} limits, <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems for heavy- and light-duty vehicles will be necessary which are more efficient than the today 3 -way- or oxidation-type catalysts. Practicable <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems are, for example, particle traps, SCR or NOx- adsorber catalysts, and combinations of these systems. Most of these exhaust control devices require fuels with sulphur contents below 10 ppm. Then the sulphate emissions from lubricants containing about 0. 5 % sulphur {{is in the same}} order of magnitude as sulphate emissions from low sulfur fuels. Measured data on the influence of sulphur from lubricating oils on future exhaust treatment systems are very limited. Conclusions have mostly been drawn from experimental results with low sulphur fuels. It cannot be ruled out, especially for NOx- adsorbers, that sulphur will adversely affect performance, thus making a reduction of sulphur levels in engine oils necessary. As far as diesel exhaust is concerned lubricants contribute approximately 20 - 26 % to total particulate matter and more than 50 % to the soluble organic fraction (SOF). Ash deposits derived from additives that contain zinc, calcium, sulphur, or phosphorous are likely to block the newly developed particle filter systems. Also for diesel technologies incorporating precious-metal catalysts (e. g. DOC, CDPF, CR-DPF, Urea- SCR) low sulphur levels are advantageous because the mass of sulphate particulate matter formed from fuel or lubricant sulphur is reduced. Conventional three-way catalysts are less sensitive, the light-off temperature being mainly affected. In summary, all available studies suggest that the lower the level of sulphur the lower emissions are. Furthermore phosphorous (associated with the antiwear additive ZDTP) was shown to limit catalyst life and, together with thermal degradation, is responsible for reduced catalyst efficiency over time. Although there is still a lack of quantitative technical information, it can be assumed that engine oil will make a significant contribution to EURO 4 limits of tail-pipe emissions, resulting mainly from secondary poisoning effects on catalyst and filter systems. Further research is thus necessary to make existing engine oil formulations and vehicle lubricant consumption compatible with the requirements of new <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> technology.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results of diesel <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> testing and analysis done under the FreedomCAR program. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) adsorber technology was selected based on a previous investigation of various NOx aftertreatment technologies including non-thermal plasma, NOx adsorber and active lean NOx. Particulate Matter (PM) emissions were addressed by developing a catalyzed particulate filter. After various iterations of the catalyst formulation, the aftertreatment components were integrated and optimized for a light duty vehicle application. This compact <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> system is dual leg and consists of a sulfur trap, NOx adsorbers, and catalyzed particulate filters (CPF). During regeneration, supplementary ARCO ECD low-sulfur diesel fuel is injected upstream of the adsorber and CPF in the exhaust. Steady state and transient emission test results with and without the <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> system (EAS) are presented. Results of soot filter regeneration by injecting low-sulfur diesel fuel and slip of unregulated emissions, such as NH 3, are discussed. Effects of adsorber size and bypass strategy on NOx conversion efficiency and fuel economy penalty are also presented in this paper. The results indicate that if the supplementary fuel injection is optimized, NH 3 slip is negligible. During the FTP cycle, injection of low sulfur diesel fuel can create temperature exotherms high enough to regenerate a loaded CPF. With the optimized NOx adsorber regeneration strategies the fuel injection penalty can be reduced by 40 to 50 %. Results for various other issues like low temperature light off, reductant optimization, exhaust sulfur management, system integration and design trade-off, are also presented and discussed in this paper.

In the second stage (Tier II) a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions by about 20 % compared to the previous values is required. The third stage of emission limits for nitrogen oxides (Tier III) shall apply to new buildings with keel laying from 1 January 2016 when navigating Emission Control Areas (ECAs). In particular, this third stage imposes a strong challenge for engine manufacturers, ship operators and certifiers (Recognised Organisations / classification societies) from a technical and operational point of view. As without specific treatment of the exhaust gases the third level of emission limits for nitrogen oxides is unlikely to be met. For this reason the International Maritime Organization recently published guidelines for the use of after-treatment systems. The correct executions of the guidelines have to be proven and guaranteed {{from the perspective of a}} classification society. Moreover the installation and operation of such systems must be both: in compliance with these guidelines and in conformity with a safe ship operation. To this end, Germanischer Lloyd has extended its rules to a section on <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> systems. In this work latest updates and future emission standards for marine applications are introduced. The purpose of this work is to show technical solutions for <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> systems from the perspective of a classification society with a strong focus on its technical, operational, organizational and administrative challenges...|$|R
40|$|Emissions from {{internal}} combustion engines contain many components {{that have a}} detrimental {{effect on the environment}} and on human health, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). In addition, the final product of any combustion of fossil fuel - carbon dioxide (CO 2) - contributes to global warming. In order to reduce the emissions of CO 2, more efficient engines are needed, and these typically necessitate the development of new <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> systems. Lean-burn engines (e. g. the diesel engine) are more efficient than conventional petrol engines, but emit more PM and require addition of a reducing agent to reduce NOx. Usually, a urea-water solution or a hydrocarbon is sprayed into the system. In addition, the PM content of the exhaust must be reduced in terms of both mass and number. In the current work, detailed mathematical models are used to investigate the motion and deposition of PM and droplets in generic <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> systems. It is shown that PM from {{internal combustion}} engines can be divided into three groups depending on their size, and that these groups are transported differently in the aftertreatment system. This is reflected in the extent and location of particle deposition, and can be taken advantage of in emission control engineering. Several particle transport models of differing complexity are presented and used to study the PM trapping characteristics of a number of filter designs. Also the influence of turbulence on the transport of particulate matter and droplets in aftertreatment systems is studied by means of numerical simulations. Finally, a model for simulations of gas-solids systems involving particles of size significant to that of the bounding geometry but also to the mean free path of the gas is presented. This very challenging flow situation is encountered inside the pores of a porous wall in a typical diesel particulate filter. It is shown that the new model can provide more accurate results than the previously available methods of similar computational cost. </p...|$|R
40|$|The present work proposes the {{exploitation}} of solar energy for the dissociation of water and production of hydrogen via an integrated thermo-chemical reactor/receiver system. The basic idea {{is the use of}} multi-channelled honeycomb ceramic supports coated with active redox reagent powders, in a configuration similar to that encountered in automobile <b>exhaust</b> catalytic <b>aftertreatment.</b> Iron-oxide-based redox materials were synthesized, capable to operate under a complete redox cycle: they could take oxygen from water producing pure hydrogen at reasonably low temperatures (800 °C) and could be regenerated at temperatures below 1300 �C. Ceramic honeycombs capable of achieving temperatures in that range when heated by concentrated solar radiation were manufactured and incorporated in a dedicated solar receiver/reactor. The operating conditions of the solar reactor were optimised to achieve adjustable, uniform temperatures up to 1300 °C throughout the honeycomb, making thus feasible the operation of the complete cycle by a single solar energy converter...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} meet {{stringent}} emissions regulations set by the Environment Protection Agency, diesel engine manufacturers install <b>exhaust</b> <b>aftertreatment</b> systems that reduce the tailpipe emissions. At low temperatures (usually below 200 C), these systems lose their eectiveness, resulting in higher system out emissions. This problem arises during prolonged low load operation such as idling, and during cold start. Using the variable valve actuation for implementing reverse breathing, rebreathing, and cylinder deactivation (CDA) has been proposed {{as a means to}} elevate exhaust gas temperatures. This thesis discusses a research eort focused on reverse, rebreathing and CDA as potential solutions for aftertreatment thermal management without any fueling penalty.

40|$|Compression ignited (CI) engines, {{commonly}} known as diesel engines, are widely used power sources with complex emissions used in on-road and nonroad applications. To find out the impact of diesel exhaust emissions on health and the environment, both regulated and unregulated exhaust gas properties have to be evaluated. Especially, emissions obtained with new fuels and new <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatments</b> have to be examined properly to avoid an increased impact of emissions of harmful substances. This thesis deals with {{the issue in the}} following papers: In Paper I, a mixture of acetal and diesel has been investigated in a 9 - liter Scania diesel engine. A marked decrease in particle number emissions and the estimated particle mass was obtained when acetal was blended into regular Swedish diesel fuel. A small penalty in engine power was observed, but the net effect was, nevertheless, a reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide per ESC cycle. Emissions of HC, CO, NOX, some aldehydes and hydrocarbons were only slightly affected by the new fuel composition. An exception was the emission of acetaldehyde, which was almost quadrupled, probably reflecting the decomposition and oxidation of acetal to acetaldehyde. In Papers II-IV, the potential to obtain low emissions of particles and NOX from a CI engine, running on ethanol and equipped with exhaust gas recirculation, EGR, catalyst and diesel particle filter, DPF, are investigated. Results obtained from a CI engine running on ethanol with the ignition improver Beraid were compared with results from a CI engine running on diesel. Both engines were 9 -liter Scania CI engines from the same engine family. Paper II covers differences originating from the fuel, together with effects from EGR, catalyst and the DPF. It was concluded that the emission control system shows a large potential for reducing particles and NOx and that these features could probably be further improved if the system is optimized for the ethanol fuelled CI engine. In paper III, the fuels influence on various particle properties was investigated, e. g., particle size and distribution, particle shape, composition and morphology. It was shown that the ethanol fuelled CI engine emitted lower particle mass, particles of smaller sizes and approx. the same or greater number emissions than the diesel fuelled engine. It was also revealed that the solid particles emitted from the ethanol engine are composed mainly of carbon and that the carbon has the same crystallite structure as carbon particles emitted from engines running on diesel. Furthermore, it was also confirmed that agglomerated particles were dependent upon speed, fuel and emission control. The purpose of Paper IV was to investigate the fuels as well as the influence of EGR, the catalyst and DPF on four specific aldehydes and 14 individual hydrocarbons. There were both quantitative and qualitative differences between the emitted compounds from the engines running on ethanol and diesel fuel, respectively. The emissions of aldehydes decreased between 56 % and 95 % when the ethanol fuelled CI engine was equipped with <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment.</b> The corresponding decrease for the diesel fuelled CI engine was between 74 % and 94 %. The summarized levels of analyzed emitted hydrocarbons were higher for the diesel fuelled engine compared to the levels emitted from the ethanol fuelled engine. However, the reduction, when connecting the exhaust gas after treatment system to diesel fuelled CI engine was larger, 90 %, than the 47 % reduction obtained when the system was connected to the ethanol fuelled CI engine. The <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> system worked more effectively when coupled to the diesel engine. A general conclusion, therefore, is that {{it should be possible to}} adjust this system better to reach lower emission levels for the ethanol fuelled CI engine. Paper V describes how the ethanol fuelled CI engine in Papers II-IV was optimized with different EGR scenarios and tested, both according to stationary (ESC) and transient conditions (ETC). A second DPF was also tested together with an oxidation catalyst. Particles were clearly affected by the EGR settings and the tested <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment.</b> In fact, when the DPF was used, particulate emissions were lower than stipulated for on–road regulations, Euro V and EEV. An efficient reduction of NOX emission levels was obtained by applying EGR; depending on <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment,</b> setting and test cycle used, the reductions of NOX were between 73 % and 33 %. Unfortunately, the high reduction of NOX was followed by a concomitant increase of CO, HC and particulate matter, PM, together with fuel penalty. The remedy for the higher emission levels of HC, CO and PM was an oxidation catalyst and a DPF. A humid air motor system (HAM) for reduction of NOX was investigated in paper VI. Earlier studies have demonstrated that the system has a capacity to lower NOX emissions from heavy duty diesel fuelled CI engines. The study aimed to investigate the HAM system´s influence on the emissions of particles, which generally increased, contrary to aldehyde emissions, which decreased and also to monitor essential engine parameters, water consumption, and also to verify the reducing ability. The NOX reduction capability was verified to be 51 % without any optimization. The complex nature of exhaust gas makes it impossible to analyze all properties of the exhaust. The work in this thesis has been focused on particles, particle properties and emissions of unregulated compounds, in order to elucidate aspects exhaust of other than the one obtained when measuring regulated emissions.

40|$|A new cost-based control {{strategy}} is presented that optimizes engine-aftertreatment performance under all operating conditions. This Integrated Emission Management strategy minimizes fuel consumption within the set emission limits by on-line adjustment of air management {{based on the}} actual state of the <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>aftertreatment</b> system. Following a model-based approach, Integrated Emission Management offers a framework for future {{control strategy}} development. This approach alleviates calibration complexity, since it allows to make optimal trade-offs in an operational cost sense. The potential of the presented cost-optimal control strategy is demonstrated for a modern heavy-duty Euro VI engine. The studied diesel engine is equipped with cooled EGR, Variable Geometry Turbocharger, and a DPF-SCR aftertreatment system. A simulation study shows that the proposed Integrated Emission Management strategy accomplishes 2 % to 3 % reduction in fuel consumption and operating costs compared to a baseline strategy. Further potential benefits include reduced heat rejection associated with the EGR system and reduced DPF regeneration frequency. © 2011 SAE International...|$|R
