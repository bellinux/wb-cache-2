5|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, there has been great interest in studying the <b>icy</b> moons in detail. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. The Europa Orbiter was a planned NASA mission to Europa, which was canceled in 2002. Its main objectives included determining {{the presence or absence of}} a subsurface ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter <b>Icy</b> Moons Orbiter), which was canceled in 2005, and a European Jovian Europa Orbiter mission were also studied, but were superseded by the Europa Jupiter System Mission.|$|E
5|$|ESA's Jupiter <b>Icy</b> Moon Explorer (JUICE) {{has been}} {{selected}} as part of ESA's Cosmic Vision science program. It is expected to launch in 2022 and, {{after a series of}} flybys in the inner Solar System, arrive in 2030. In 2012, the European Space Agency's selected the JUpiter <b>ICy</b> moon Explorer (JUICE) as its first Large mission, replacing its contribution to EJSM, the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO). The partnership for the Europa Jupiter System Mission has since ended, but NASA will continue to contribute the European mission with hardware and an instrument.|$|E
5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an <b>icy</b> mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). The current state of the <b>icy</b> mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Ioan Gruffudd as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe: The ship's only {{officer to}} lead a {{lifeboat}} to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the <b>icy</b> waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.|$|E
5|$|On December 14, 2009, {{there was}} a 60–70 vehicle pileup due to fog and <b>icy</b> conditions, forcing {{the closure of the}} highway in both directions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>icy</b> Galilean moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, all {{generate}} induced magnetic {{moments in}} response to changes in Jupiter's magnetic field. These varying magnetic moments create dipole magnetic fields around them, which act to compensate {{for changes in the}} ambient field. The induction is thought to take place in subsurface layers of salty water, which are likely to exist in all of Jupiter's large <b>icy</b> moons. These underground oceans can potentially harbor life, and evidence for their presence {{was one of the most}} important discoveries made in the 1990s by spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The next planned {{mission to}} the Jovian system is the European Space Agency's Jupiter <b>Icy</b> Moon Explorer (JUICE), due to launch in 2022. Several close flybys of Callisto are planned during the mission.|$|E
5|$|The next planned {{mission to}} the Jovian system will be the European Space Agency's Jupiter <b>Icy</b> Moon Explorer (JUICE), due to launch in 2022, {{followed}} by NASA's Europa Clipper mission in 2025.|$|E
5|$|The satellite's {{name was}} soon {{suggested}} by astronomer Simon Marius, for the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus's lover. Beginning with Pioneer 10, several spacecraft have explored Ganymede. The Voyager probes refined measurements of its size, while Galileo discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field. The next planned {{mission to the}} Jovian system is the European Space Agency's Jupiter <b>Icy</b> Moon Explorer (JUICE), due to launch in 2022. After flybys of all three <b>icy</b> Galilean moons, the probe is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an <b>icy</b> mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (317km) is about 54% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 40% of the moon’s mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Umbriel is about 0.24GPa (2.4kbar). The current state of the <b>icy</b> mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|White was {{initially}} {{enrolled at the}} Lombardy Street Public School. After completing his grammar schooling, he matriculated at the Institute for Colored Youth (<b>ICY)</b> in 1853. Founded by the Society of Friends (Quakers), the <b>ICY</b> emphasized high moral standards for its students and offered a classical study of Latin, Greek, and trigonometry. While enrolled, White expressed an acute awareness of black society and psychological concepts in essays he presented. On May 24, 1855, he addressed Governor James Pollock at a special reception for the institute, touching {{on the issue of}} African American citizenship. The same year, White was elected secretary of the Banneker Institute, a student instructional society that convened weekly to have scholarly discussions. White was his class's lone graduate from the <b>ICY</b> on May 6, 1857; he earned praise for his popularity among classmates and professors alike.|$|E
5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that <b>icy</b> bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of <b>icy</b> fluff.|$|E
5|$|Another {{canceled}} {{proposal to}} orbit Ganymede was the Jupiter <b>Icy</b> Moons Orbiter. It {{was designed to}} use nuclear fission for power, ion engine propulsion, and would have studied Ganymede in greater detail than previously. However, the mission was canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts. Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an <b>icy</b> and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an <b>icy</b> and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{dissolving}} in the water, {{oxygen and}} other gases {{are trapped in}} a type of structure called a clathrate. In clathrate structures, gases are enclosed in an <b>icy</b> cage and look like packed snow. These structures form at the high-pressure depths of Lake Vostok and would become unstable if brought to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{appointed}} Thomas Robertson as Scotias captain. Robertson was {{an experienced}} Antarctic and Arctic sailor who had commanded the whaling ship Active on the Dundee Whaling Expedition. The {{rest of the}} 25officers and men, who signed for three-year engagements, were all Scotsmen, many used to sailing in <b>icy</b> waters on whaling voyages.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's {{battered}} surface lies {{on top of}} a cold, stiff, and <b>icy</b> lithosphere that {{is between}} 80 and 150km thick. A salty ocean 150200km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10km. The existence of an ocean is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer can be as thick as 250300km. Failing an ocean, the <b>icy</b> lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300km.|$|E
5|$|Clay-like {{minerals}} (specifically, phyllosilicates), {{often associated}} with organic matter on Earth, have been detected on the <b>icy</b> crust of Europa. The presence of the minerals {{may have been the}} result of a collision with an asteroid or comet.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{a teacher at the}} <b>ICY,</b> White closely collaborated with Octavius Catto, an {{important}} civil rights activist and long-time friend of White's who shared a similar social group and views on education. Both men, former cricket players at the <b>ICY,</b> believed baseball was another outlet for African Americans to promote social reform and prove their right for full citizenship. In the spring of 1866, White and Catto established the Philadelphia Pythians, a baseball club composed mainly of men from the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization. Catto, a hard-hitting shortstop and second baseman, was the de facto captain on the field, while White became the team's secretary, responsible for scheduling games, arranging festivities, and recording statistics. Soon, Pythian games became a popular fixture of the black community.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{the existence of}} lakes of liquid water entirely encased in Europa's <b>icy</b> outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell. If confirmed, the lakes could be yet another potential habitat for life.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581d is {{probably}} too massive {{to be made}} only of rocky material. It may have originally formed on a more distant orbit as an <b>icy</b> planet that then migrated closer to its star.|$|E
5|$|In this {{championship}} {{version of}} the game, a finish line is set up farther downstream {{and the winner is}} the first to pass this point. The competition originally took place every January, but it was moved to March due to <b>icy</b> weather in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter <b>Icy</b> Moons Orbiter (JIMO) was a {{partially}} developed fission-powered spacecraft with ion thrusters that was cancelled in 2006. It {{was part of}} Project Prometheus. The Europa Lander Mission proposed a small nuclear-powered Europa lander for JIMO. It would travel with the orbiter, which would also function as a communication relay to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Oberon may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an <b>icy</b> mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (480km) is about 63% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 54% of the moon's mass—the proportions are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Oberon is about 0.5GPa (5kbar). The current state of the <b>icy</b> mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Oberon may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core–mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, is up to 40km and its temperature is around 180K. However, the internal structure of Oberon depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known at present.|$|E
5|$|The {{climb up}} or down from the summit plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known {{accident}} spot. In winter it involves climbing down another snow cornice onto steep <b>icy</b> ground. There {{have been a number}} of accidents at this spot in recent years, making it as dangerous as Striding Edge.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} great {{interest}} in studying the <b>icy</b> moons in detail because {{of the possibility of}} subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter <b>Icy</b> Moons Orbiter) was cancelled in 2005. A subsequent proposal was developed for a joint NASA/ESA mission called EJSM/Laplace, with a provisional launch date around 2020. EJSM/Laplace would have consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter. However, ESA had formally ended the partnership by April 2011, citing budget issues at NASA and the consequences on the mission timetable. Instead, ESA planned to go ahead with a European-only mission to compete in its L1 Cosmic Vision selection.|$|E
5|$|Among Scott's first acts as {{governor}} was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first {{address to the}} legislature on December 13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when he slipped on the <b>icy</b> steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term {{as governor}}.|$|E
5|$|By 2:00 AM {{the entire}} army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road through {{what is now}} Hamilton Township. The men were ordered to march with {{absolute}} silence. Along the way, a rumor was spread that they were surrounded and some frightened militiamen fled for Philadelphia. The march was difficult, {{as some of the}} route ran through thick woods and it was <b>icy,</b> causing horses to slip, and men to break through ice on ponds.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its <b>icy</b> surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its <b>icy</b> surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto <b>icy</b> surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.|$|E
5|$|During {{a raid on}} the {{northern}} Italian city of Verona on 12 October 1944, Raw's aircraft was hit by two anti-aircraft shells that destroyed its hydraulics system and an engine, wounded the radio operator and opened 166 holes in the fuselage. Despite this damage, Raw was able to return the B-24 safely to its base. He suffered frostbite to his feet, as damage to the plane's nose caused <b>icy</b> winds to enter the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Europa is the smoothest known {{object in}} the Solar System, lacking {{large-scale}} features such as mountains and craters. However; according to one theory, Europa's equator may be covered in <b>icy</b> spikes called penitentes, which may be up to ten meters high, due to direct overhead sunlight on the equator, causing the ice to sublime forming vertical cracks. The prominent markings crisscrossing Europa appear to mainly be albedo features that emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa, because its surface is tectonically too active and therefore young. Europa's <b>icy</b> crust has an albedo (light reflectivity) of 0.64, {{one of the highest}} of all moons. This indicates a young and active surface, based on estimates of the frequency of cometary bombardment that Europa likely experiences, the surface is about 20 to 180 million years old. There is currently no full scientific consensus among the sometimes contradictory explanations for the surface features of Europa.|$|E
5|$|Flight 663 {{was unable}} to recover from its unusually steep bank and plunged into the <b>icy</b> water of the Atlantic Ocean, where it {{exploded}} with bright orange flames. The Pan American 707 {{was the first to}} relay news of the crash, as it was receiving permission to land. Air Canada Flight 627, which had departed a few minutes prior to Flight 663, also radioed news of an explosion in the water.|$|E
5|$|Frozen is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated film {{produced}} by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It {{was directed by}} Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, the latter of whom also wrote the screenplay, and was {{produced by}} Peter Del Vecho. The film focuses on Anna, a princess who sets off on a journey to find her estranged sister, Elsa, whose <b>icy</b> powers have inadvertently trapped their kingdom in eternal winter.|$|E
5|$|Game of Thrones {{is roughly}} {{based on the}} storylines of A Song of Ice and Fire, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the {{continent}} of Essos. The series chronicles the violent dynastic struggles among the realm's noble families for the Iron Throne, while other families fight for independence from it. It opens with additional threats in the <b>icy</b> North and Essos in the east.|$|E
