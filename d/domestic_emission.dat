50|$|While {{there would}} always be some cheap <b>domestic</b> <b>emission</b> {{reductions}} available in Europe, the cost of switching from coal to gas could be in the order of €40-50 per tonne CO2 equivalent.

The price depends on the distribution of risk between seller and buyer. The seller could get a very good price if it agrees to bear the risk that the project's baseline and monitoring methodology is rejected; that the host country rejects the project; that the CDM Executive Board rejects the project; that the project for some reason produces fewer credits than planned; or that the buyer doesn't get CERs at the agreed time if the international transaction log (the technical infrastructure ensuring international transfer of carbon credits) is not in place by then.

In this study, <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> are estimated from the regional population density including rural or urban character, the amount of fuel (wood and charcoal) used per cape per year and emission factors. The population density {{and the amount of}} fuel are two key parameters that make up the regional emissivity (0. 0081 to 0. 0685 kg/m 2 per year), which discriminates the nineteen regions of Côte d’Ivoire into seven groups. <b>Domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> range from 0. 016 to 0. 1 g/m 2 per year for NOx, 3. 9 to 33 g/m 2 per year for CO and 35. 2 to 297 g/m 2 per year for CO 2. Regions with high <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> are located in forest areas and are both producers and consumers of charcoal.

The report consists of three parts. The first part sets the context of this study by giving a brief overview of the current Dutch NOx trading proposals, as well as giving an overview of the discussions with the European Commission on the compatibility of domestic NOx trading with European Community environmental law. It also gives a brief overview of proposals for <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> trading in NOx, SO 2 and VOC in other Member States, in particular the United Kingdom. It concludes that plans to implement <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> trading have to date been limited, with {{one of the main reasons}} for this being that Member States feel that the scope for the implementation of such trading regimes is narrow under current Community law, the main impediment being the IPPC Directive. The second part of this report explores in more depth the limitations imposed on the implementation of <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> trading in NOx, SO 2 and VOC under current Community law. It concludes that such trading could be partly or wholly accommodated under the solvents Directive, the LCP Directive and the NEC Directive. Each of these Directives however requires that the provisions of the IPPC Directive are respected in addition to the specific requirements under those Directives. Emissions trading under the IPPC Directive can only take place up to October 2007 for existing installations that are not substantially modified, or parallel to the application of Emission Limit Values (ELVs) set on the basis of Best Available Techniques (BAT) as a minimum standard. The IPPC Directive requires an installation-by-installation determination of ELVs on the basis of BAT. While the implementation of BAT in practice is likely to allow a degree of emissions trading beyond the reductions required under the IPPC Directive, the scope of such trading may be limited. Trading is not allowed for the installations covered under the waste incineration Directive within the standards set by that Directive, but could be introduced to achieve further reductions. The third part of this report discusses specific approaches to accommodating <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> trading under the IPPC Directive. It starts with an overview of the IPPC Directives three key safeguards that must be respected when introducing the possibility for emissions trading within its framework: the need to achieve a high level of protection, the need to protect the local environment and the need to maintain an integrated approach. It then analyses two proposed approaches for doing so, the current Dutch NOx trading proposal and the Commissions GHG tra...|$|R

40|$|China, as {{the biggest}} GHG emitter and the largest {{developing}} country, has been urged by international society to take responsibilities for reducing GHG, especially in the post-Kyoto commitment period. Currently, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) assigns the responsibility to parties who produce the GHG, using the production-based GHG emissions inventories. However, some scholars argue that if consumption-based GHG emissions inventories were used, China would be less responsible for GHG emissions because GHG emissions embedded in exporting products directly contribute to its total emissions. This paper analyzes China’s CO 2 emissions in 2007 using Economic Input-Output (EIO) method, and finds that China’s <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> make up {{a large proportion of}} total emissions, and export-embodied emissions accounts for 15 % of <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions.</b> What’s more, results of production-based accounting method are different from results of consumption-based accounting method.

50|$|Table 3 {{also shows}} how these {{processes}} of production, consumption and trade have changed from 1990 (commonly chosen for baseline levels) to 2008. Global emissions have risen 39%, {{but in the}} same period developed countries seem to have stabilized their <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions,</b> whereas developing countries’ <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> have doubled. This ‘stabilization’ is arguably misleading, however, if the increased trade from developing to developed countries is considered. This has increased from 0.4 Gt CO2 to 1.6 Gt CO2 - a 17%/year average growth meaning 16 Gt CO2 have been traded from developing to developed countries between 1990-2008. Assuming a proportion of the increased production in developing countries is to fulfil the consumption demands of developed countries, the process known as carbon leakage becomes evident. Thus, including international trade (i.e. the methodology of consumption-based accounting) reverses the apparent decreasing trend in emissions in developed countries, changing a 2% decrease (as calculated by production-based accounting) into a 7% increase across the time period. This point is only further emphasized when these trends are studied at a less aggregated scale.|$|R

We examine trends in Hg precipitation concentrations at 47 Mercury Deposition Network (MDN) sites during 2004 – 2010 by using the GEOS-Chem nested-grid Hg simulation. We run the model with constant anthropogenic emissions and subtract the model results from the observations. This helps to remove the variability in observed Hg concentrations caused by meteorological factors, including precipitation. We find significant decreasing trends in Hg concentrations in precipitation at MDN sites in the Northeast (− 4. 1  ±  0. 49 % yr− 1) and Midwest (− 2. 7  ±  0. 68 % yr− 1). Over the Southeast (− 0. 53 ±  0. 59 % yr− 1), trends are weaker and not significant, while over the West, trends are highly variable. We conduct model simulations assuming a 45 % decrease in Hg emissions from domestic sources in the modeled period and a uniform 12 % decrease in background atmospheric Hg concentrations. The combination of <b>domestic</b> <b>emission</b> reductions and decreasing background concentrations explains the observed trends over the Northeast and Midwest, with <b>domestic</b> <b>emission</b> reductions accounting for 58 – 46 % of the decreasing trends.

We show that, when stringent <b>domestic</b> <b>emission</b> controls are applied, air quality is predicted to improve across the US, except surface O 3 over the western and central US under RCP 8. 5 conditions, where rising background ozone counteracts <b>domestic</b> <b>emission</b> reductions. Under the RCP 4. 5 scenario, surface O 3 is substantially reduced (about 5 ppb), with daily maximum 8 h averages below the primary US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 75 ppb (and even 65 ppb) in all the NPs. PM 2. 5 is significantly reduced in both scenarios (4 μg m − 3; ~ 50 %), with levels below the annual US EPA NAAQS of 12 μg m − 3 across all the NPs; visibility is also improved (10 – 15 dv; > 75 km in visibility range), although some western US parks with Class I status (40 – 74 % of total sites in the US) are still above the 2050 planned target level to reach the goal of natural visibility conditions by 2064. We estimate that climate-driven increases in fire activity may dominate summertime PM 2. 5 over the western US, potentially offsetting the large PM 2. 5 reductions from <b>domestic</b> <b>emission</b> controls, and keeping visibility at present-day levels in many parks. Our study indicates that anthropogenic emission patterns will be important for air quality in 2050. However, climate and land use changes alone may lead to a substantial increase in surface O 3 (2 – 3 ppb) with important consequences for O 3 air quality and ecosystem degradation at the US NPs.

However, model simulations were able to accurately represent both the long-term decadal surface {{concentrations of}} particle sulfate and nitrate and an episode in early 2003 of substantially elevated nitrate measured across the UK by the AGANet network. The latter was identified as consisting of three separate episodes, each of less than 1 month duration, in February, March and April. The primary cause of the elevated nitrate levels across the UK was meteorological: a persistent high-pressure system, whose varying location impacted {{the relative importance of}} transboundary versus <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions.</b> Whilst long-range transport dominated the elevated nitrate in February, in contrast it was <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> that mainly contributed to the March episode, and for the April episode both <b>domestic</b> <b>emissions</b> and long-range transport contributed. A prolonged episode such as the one in early 2003 can have substantial impact on annual average concentrations. The episode led to annual concentration differences at the regional scale of similar magnitude to those driven by long-term changes in precursor emissions over the full decade investigated here. The results demonstrate that a substantial part of the UK, particularly the south and southeast, may be close to or exceeding annual mean limit values because of import of inorganic aerosol components from continental Europe under specific conditions. The results reinforce the importance of employing multiple year simulations in the assessment of emissions reduction scenarios on particulate matter concentrations and the need for international agreements to address the transboundary component of air pollution...|$|R
