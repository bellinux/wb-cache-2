25|$|In 1993 {{the museum}} {{finally agreed to}} return the four Inuit skeletons to Greenland for proper burial. Representatives of the Museum went to Greenland that year to participate. In {{contrast}} to peoples in other areas, some local Inuit thought that the burial was more desired by the Christian representatives of the museum, and that the remains could <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> appropriately been kept in New York. David Hurst Thomas' study of the case shows the complexity of reburial and repatriation cases, {{and the need for}} individual approaches to each case by all affected parties.|$|E
500|$|Hutchinson {{justified}} the hardline stance {{that contributed to}} the crisis by claiming it was his duty as governor to uphold the revenue laws, while American opponents such as James Bowdoin observed that he could <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> easily refused to accept the tea when it was clear that popular sentiment would make it impossible to land the tea. British critics complained that he should have asked the British troops in Boston to intervene. [...] After it became known that other tea ships sent to North America had turned back, Hutchinson continued to justify his actions in letters to England, anticipating hearings on the matter once he arrived there.|$|E

2500|$|In Journal of Hindu Studies, David Buchta {{wrote that}} the author's {{position}} is [...] "clearly and coherently argued and well-supported", stating that [...] "the balance that Nicholson's analysis offers, correcting exaggerated claims about the colonial invention of Hinduism, is its most important contribution {{to the study of}} Hinduism". Furthermore, Nicholson [...] "shows sensitivity to the political implications of the discussion and the possibility that scholarship supporting the pre-colonial development of a sense of Hindu unity can be co-opted in support of communalism", and is therefore [...] "careful to emphasise that, while Hindus may have long agreed that a sense of unity exists, the details <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> long been to subject of debate and development".|$|E
2500|$|Also {{referred}} to as contextual behavior, prosocial behavior, and extra-role behavior, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) consists of employee behavior {{that contributes to the}} welfare of the organization but {{is beyond the scope of}} the employee’s job duties. [...] These extra-role behaviors may help or hinder the attainment of organizational goals. [...] Research supports five dimensions of OCB: altruism, conscientiousness, courtesy, sportsmanship, and civic virtue. [...] Researchers have found that the OCB dimensions of altruism and civic virtue can <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much of an impact on manager’s subjective evaluations of employees’ performances as employees’ objective productivity levels. [...] The degree to which OCB can influence judgments of job performance is relatively high. [...] Controversy exists as to whether OCB should be formally considered as a part of performance appraisal (PA).|$|E
2500|$|Between Metro-land’s heyday {{before the}} Second World War {{and the end}} of the 20th century, the {{proportion}} of owner-occupied dwellings in England, already rising fast from the mid-1920s, doubled from a third to two-thirds. In Tropic of Ruislip, Leslie Thomas’s humorous account of suburban sexual and social mores in the mid-1970s (adapted for television as Tropic, ATV 1979), the steady flow of families from council housing on one side of the railway to an executive estate on the other side served to illustrate what was becoming known as “upward mobility”. Another sign was that, by the end of the book, [...] "half the neighbourhood" [...] of Plummers Park (probably based on Carpenders Park, on the outskirts of Watford) had moved south of the River Thames to Wimbledon or nearby Southfields. This was put down to the [...] "attractions of Victoriana", which, like suburbia itself, championed at the time by Betjeman’s Metro-land, was coming back into fashion; however, it appeared to <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much to do with couples following each other round in order to maintain extramarital affairs.|$|E

2500|$|Subjective {{measures}} directly assess SA {{by asking}} individuals {{to rate their}} own or the observed SA of individuals on an anchored scale (e.g., participant situation awareness questionnaire (PSAQ) – Strater, Endsley, Pleban, & Matthews, 2001; the situation awareness rating technique (SART) – Taylor, 1989). Subjective measures of SA are attractive {{in that they are}} relatively straightforward and easy to administer. [...] However, several limitations should be noted. Individuals making subjective assessments of their own SA are often unaware of information they do not know (the [...] "unknown unknowns"). Subjective measures also tend to be global in nature, and, as such, do not fully exploit the multivariate nature of SA to provide the detailed diagnostics available with objective measures. Nevertheless, self-ratings may be useful in that they can provide an assessment of operators' degree of confidence in their SA and their own performance. Measuring how SA is perceived by the operator may provide information as important as the operator's actual SA, since errors in perceived SA quality (over-confidence or under-confidence in SA) may <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> harmful an effect on an individual's or team's decision-making as errors in their actual SA (Endsley, 1998).|$|E
