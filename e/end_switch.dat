50|$|The {{subsequent}} inquiry {{took place}} in the Town Hall, Barnsley and took six days. Sir Henry Walker, the Chief Inspector of Mines chaired the inquiry and presented the report to Captain Harry Crookshank (Henry Frederick Comfort Crookshank. 1st Viscount Crookshank) who was the Parliamentary Secretary, Mines, 1935-39. At the inquiry, evidence was then taken concerning the loader motor. The electrician had been instructed to make a general overhaul of the electrical apparatus in 1’s district which meant that he would remove the covers and examine the commutator and the starter of each unit. His instructions were that before he removed the covers at the loader motor he would see that the gate <b>end</b> <b>switch</b> was out and the cable between it and the starting switch was disconnected and that he would not run the motors with these covers off. After the explosion the starter switch was found in the off position and the gate <b>end</b> <b>switch</b> had been cut off at the surface. Mr. Thomas Storrs, the chief electrician said he had been present on many occasions when the motors had been opened up and this was the first instance in which he had found a cover off a motor when the cable was connected. Mr. G. Cook, Senior Inspector, was present when the body of the loader was found between the loader and {{the left side of the}} gate pack, close to the commutator. This was on the other side from the switch but it was possible for him to reach the switch. The evidence seemed to point to the explosion being caused by a spark from the switch or the commutator of the loader motor but there was no absolute proof.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{algorithm}} that minimizes {{the number of}} active Spine switches to dynamically manage the number of Spine switches needed according to the traffic load in datacenters. Based on an investigation on energy consumption, a high <b>end</b> <b>switch</b> can save tremendous energy (e.g., 84  %) when {{it is in the}} Hibernation mode [19]. The main difference between our algorithm and aforementioned approaches is that our algorithm uses the Spine-Leaf topology. Our current focus is not specifically for SDN. But the concept can be integrated with SDN, as our approach also makes use of a controller to Spine switches, as shown in Section III.|$|E
40|$|A small-footprint, full surface-mount-component {{printed circuit}} board employs MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) power {{switches}} to switch high currents from any input power supply from 3 to 30 V. High-force shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators generally require high current (up to 9 A at 28 V) to actuate. SMA wires (the driving element of the actuators) can be quickly overheated if power is not removed {{at the end of}} stroke, which can damage the wires. The new analog driver prevents overheating of the SMA wires in an actuator by momentarily removing power when the end limit switch is closed, thereby allowing complex control schemes to be adopted without concern for overheating. Either an integral pushbutton or microprocessor-controlled gate or control line inputs switch current to the actuator until the <b>end</b> <b>switch</b> line goes from logic high to logic low state. Power is then momentarily removed (switched off by the MOSFET). The analog driver is suited to use with nearly any SMA actuator...|$|E
