The band felt that having the same producer improved communication and allowed the band to work more freely.

40|$|Background: A high {{percentage}} of young children present with <b>flatfeet.</b> Although the percentage of those with <b>flatfeet</b> declines with age, about 15 % of the population maintains a flat arch. A reduction in longitudinal arch height usually combines with excessive subtalar joint pronation and {{may be related to}} other musculoskeletal problems of the lower extremity kinetic chain. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe and compare the lower extremity kinematics between children with normal arches and those with flexible <b>flatfeet,</b> with the intent of providing practical information for decision making when treating children with flexible <b>flatfeet.</b> Methods: Twenty children with flexible <b>flatfeet</b> (years age mean (SD), 9. 7 (0. 9) years) and 10 children with normal arches (yeas age mean (SD), 9. 6 (1. 2) years) were included. Kinematic data (maximum and minimum angles, and movement range, velocity, and excursion) of the hip, knee and rearfoot were collected during walking using Liberty Electromagnetic Tracking System. Kinematic variables were compared between the normal arches and flexible <b>flatfeet</b> groups using repeated measures mixed effects ANOVA. Results: Movement patterns at the hip, knee and ankle joints were similar between children with flexible <b>flatfeet</b> and with normal arches. The results of ANOVA showed no significant main effect or interaction in any of the kinematic variables (P ≥ 0. 05) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{compare the}} effects of foot muscle {{strengthening}} exercises with and without elastic band to the dynamic balance function in children aged 8 – 12 years with flexible <b>flatfeet.</b> Methods: Forty-one children (aged 8 – 12 years) with flexible <b>flatfeet</b> and dynamic balance problem were randomly allocated into either the intervention or control group. Both groups received thrice weekly training for 6 weeks. The foot strengthening exercise regimens consisted of pronation, supination, short foot, and tiptoeing using elastic band for the intervention group and without elastic band for the control group. Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) was tested before and after 6 weeks of training. Results: A statistically significant difference of normalized SEBT scores was found for both groups in both legs (p= 0. 00, p< 0. 05). The intervention group was significantly better {{than the control group}} for both right and left legs (p= 0. 00, p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Foot muscle strengthening either with or without elastic band improves dynamic balance in children aged 8 – 12 years with flexible <b>flatfeet.</b> Exercise given with elastic band significantly shows better improvement in the dynamic balance compared to without elastic band.

5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} <b>flatfoot</b> flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose]	 This	 study	determined	 the	difference	between	<b>flatfeet</b>	 and	normal	 feet	 in	 humans	on	 an {{ascending}} slope	using	electromyography	(EMG). 	[Subjects]	 This	study	was	conducted	on	 30 	adults	having	normal feet (n= 15) 	 and	<b>flatfeet</b>	(n= 15),	 all	of	whom	were	 21 	to	 30 	years	old. [Methods]	 A	treadmill	(AC 5000 M,	 SCIFIT,) 	 {{was used}} to	analyze	kinematic	features	during	gait. These	features	were	analyzed	at	slow,	 normal,	 and	fast	gait	veloci-ties on	an	ascending	slope. A	surface	electromyogram	(TeleMyo	 2400 T,	 Noraxon	Co.,	 USA) 	 was	used	to	measure muscle activity	changes. [Results]	 The	activities	of	most	muscles	in	the	subjects	with	<b>flatfeet</b>	were	significantly	dif-ferent from	the	muscle	activities	in	the	subjects	with	normal	feet	at	different	gait	velocities	on	an	ascending	slope. There were	 significant	 differences	 in	 the	 vastus	medialis	 and	 abductor	 hallucis	muscles. [Conclusion]	 Because muscle activation	of	the	vastus	medialis	in	relation	to	stability	of	the	lower	extremity	has	a	tendency	to	increase	with an increase	in	gait	velocity	on	an	ascending	slope,	 we	hypothesized	that	higher	impact	transfer	to	the	knee	joints occurs in	subjects	with	<b>flatfeet</b>	due	to	the	lack	of	a	medial	longitudinal	arch	and	that	the	abductor	halluces	muscles, which provide	dynamic	stability	to	the	medial	longitudinal	arches,	 do	not	activate	well	when	they	are	needed	in subjects with	<b>flatfeet...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Flatfeet</b> {{are divided}} into rigid and mobile forms. Rigid <b>flatfeet</b> usually lead to the {{development}} of pain. The most common reason of rigid <b>flatfeet</b> is a tarsal coalition. Mobility of the tarsal joints is checked by specific clinical tests. The study investigated the sensitivity and specificity of foot mobility tests - the “tip toes test”, Jack test, manual examination of passive and eversion and inversion. The study found the following parameters: the sensitivity of the “tip toes test”, Jack test was 87 % and 85 %, specificity - 65 % and 64 %. The sensitivity of the manual examination of passive and eversion and inversion was - 80 %, specificity - 88 %. The last test has a high specificity compared to the “tip toes test” and Jack test. Detection limits the mobility of the tarsal joints can be an indication for radiography for the detection of tarsal coalitions...|$|R

25|$|Five Hand Reel, who {{combined}} Irish and Scottish personnel, {{emerged as}} the most successful exponents of the style. From the late 1970s the attendance at, and numbers of, folk clubs began to decrease, as new musical and social trends began to dominate. However, in Scotland the circuit of ceilidhs and festivals helped prop up traditional music. Two {{of the most successful}} groups of the 1980s that emerged from this dance band circuit were Runrig and Capercaillie. A by-product of the Celtic Diaspora was the existence of large communities across the world that looked for their cultural roots and identity to their origins in the Celtic nations. From the US this includes Scottish bands Seven Nations, Prydein and <b>Flatfoot</b> 56. From Canada are bands such as Enter the Haggis, Great Big Sea, The Real Mckenzies and Spirit of the West.|$|E

30|$|Flexible <b>flatfeet</b> in {{children}} [paediatric flexible <b>flatfeet</b> (PFF)] are common, with a prevalence between 2.7 and 18.1  % [1, 2]. It {{is thought to}} be the most frequent reason for attendance at paediatric orthopaedic clinics [3]. Most clinicians believe that PFF is a normal variant of foot type and requires no intervention [4]. Others believe that, in a proportion of cases, PFF leads to significant foot and ankle symptoms which do require intervention [5]. The exact percentage of cases that develop symptoms is debated, with estimates varying from 10 – 60  % [5, 6]. It is also estimated that up to 63  % of children with PFF have functional impairment [6]. Symptoms may relate to early muscle fatigue and foot-and-ankle-complex instability, leading to capsule and/or ligament strain and imbalance. It is hypothesised that this leads to progressive deformity, degenerative arthropathy and problems into adulthood. Excessive hindfoot valgus associated with PFF may also affect the normal biomechanical function of the foot and ankle [7].|$|R
