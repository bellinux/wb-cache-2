5|$|John Scott <b>Haldane</b> was {{commissioned}} by the Royal Navy to develop a safe decompression procedure. The current method was a slow linear decompression, and <b>Haldane</b> was concerned that this was ineffective due to additional nitrogen buildup in the slow {{early stages of the}} ascent.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the old Conservative {{government}} Cave left office on 23 January 1924. He was replaced by Lord <b>Haldane,</b> who was serving for a second time and was sworn in on 25 January. <b>Haldane</b> was in favour of the creation of a Ministry of Justice, and although Schuster was privately against it he suggested that he would have accepted the responsibilities of such a Ministry on the condition that it remained under his control as the Lord Chancellor's Office was. <b>Haldane</b> was ill, however, and the Labour government lasted only ten months thanks to the publishing of the Zinoviev Letter, and no large-scale reforms such as the creation of a Ministry of Justice were ever pushed through.|$|E

50|$|Many {{different}} hypotheses {{have been}} advanced {{to address the}} evolutionary mechanisms to produce <b>Haldane's</b> rule. Currently, the most popular explanation for <b>Haldane's</b> rule is the composite hypothesis, which divides <b>Haldane's</b> rule into multiple subdivisions, including sterility, inviability, male heterogamety, and female heterogamety. The composite hypothesis states that <b>Haldane's</b> rule in different subdivisions has different causes. Individual genetic mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive, and these mechanisms may act together to cause <b>Haldane's</b> rule in any given subdivision. In contrast to these views that emphasise genetic mechanisms, another view hypothesizes that population dynamics during population divergence may cause <b>Haldane's</b> rule.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{speciation}} has puzzled scientists for decades, but only recently they {{have they been}} able to reveal the genetic basis of reproductive isolation. Much emphasis has been on <b>Haldane’s</b> rule, the observation that the heterogametic sex often suffers more from hybridization than the homogametic sex. Most research on <b>Haldane’s</b> rule has focused on diploid organisms with chromosomal sex determination. We argue that species lacking chromosomal sex determination, such as haplodiploids, also follow <b>Haldane’s</b> rule and thus {{should be included in}} the definition of this rule. We provide evidence for <b>Haldane’s</b> rule in Nasonia wasps and describe how haplodiploids can be used to test the different theories that have been proposed to explain <b>Haldane’s</b> rule. We discuss how the faster-male and faster-X theories can shape speciation differently in haplodiploids compared to diploids. ...|$|R
5|$|In December 1905, the Balfour {{government}} collapsed, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman became Prime Minister, {{leading a}} minority Liberal government. Richard <b>Haldane</b> was appointed Secretary of State for War, an almost accidental selectionhe {{himself had been}} aiming to be Lord Chancellor, whilst Campbell-Bannerman offered him the post of Attorney-General, then the Home Office, and had offered the War Office to two other men before <b>Haldane</b> offered to take it. Despite this inauspicious beginning, he would becomein the words of Douglas Haig"the greatest Secretary of State for War England has ever had". <b>Haldane</b> took the post with no preconceived ideas as {{to the role of}} the Army, but quickly settled on the idea that efficiency was essential as a precursor to making financial economies. After a brief hiatus during the 1906 general election, which the Liberals won comfortably, <b>Haldane</b> turned his attention to the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and <b>Haldane</b> began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular Expeditionary Force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force.|$|E
5|$|The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{reformed}} {{the auxiliary}} {{forces of the}} British Army by transferring existing Volunteer and Yeomanry units into a new Territorial Force (TF); and disbanding the Militia {{to form a new}} Special Reserve of the Regular Army. This reorganisation formed {{a major part of the}} <b>Haldane</b> Reforms, named after the creator of the Act, Richard <b>Haldane.</b>|$|E
5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals {{won by a}} landslide, obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 seats in the House of Commons, <b>Haldane</b> {{turned his attention to}} the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and <b>Haldane</b> began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period <b>Haldane</b> settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.|$|E
40|$|During {{the process}} of speciation, {{diverging}} taxa often hybridize and produce offspring wherein the heterogametic sex (i. e., XY or ZW) is unfit (<b>Haldane’s</b> rule). Dominance theory seeks to explain <b>Haldane’s</b> rule {{in terms of the}} difference in X-linked dominance regimes experienced by the sexes. However, X inactivation in female mammals extends the effects of hemizygosity to both sexes. Here, we highlight where the assumptions of dominance theory are particularly problematic in marsupials, where X inactivation uniformly results in silencing the paternal X. We then present evidence of <b>Haldane’s</b> rule for sterility but not for viability in marsupials, as well as the first violations of <b>Haldane’s</b> rule for these traits among all mammals. Marsupials represent a large taxonomic group possessing heteromorphic sex chromosomes, where the dominance theory cannot explain <b>Haldane’s</b> rule. In this light, we evaluate alternative explanations for the pre-ponderance of male sterility in interspecific hybrids, including faster male evolution, X–Y interactions, and genomic conflict hypotheses.

5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, was close to retirement. The current Lord Chancellor Lord <b>Haldane</b> {{believed}} that the duties of a Lord Chancellor were too much for one man, and should be divided between a Lord Chancellor and a Minister of Justice. As such he looked for a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until <b>Haldane</b> became Lord Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1912 naval law was passed, Britain and Germany {{attempted}} {{to reach a}} compromise with the <b>Haldane</b> Mission, led by the British War Minister Richard <b>Haldane.</b> The arms reduction mission ended in failure, however, and the 1912 law was announced shortly thereafter. The Germans were aware at as early as 1911, the Royal Navy had abandoned {{the idea of a}} decisive battle with the German fleet, in favor of a distant blockade at the entrances to the North Sea, which the British could easily control due to their geographical position. There emerged the distinct possibility that the German fleet would be unable to force a battle on its own terms, which would render it militarily useless. When the war came in 1914, the British did in fact adopt this strategy. Coupled with the restrictive orders of the Kaiser, who preferred to keep the fleet intact {{to be used as a}} bargaining chip in the peace settlements, the ability of the High Seas Fleet to affect the military situation was markedly reduced.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. <b>Haldane</b> and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. <b>Haldane</b> assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E

5|$|In 1902 Victor Henri {{proposed}} a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, {{but at the}} time the experimental significance of the hydrogen ion concentration was not yet recognized. After Peter Lauritz Sørensen had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909 the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian postdoc Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation, which is now generally referred to as Michaelis-Menten kinetics (sometimes also Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. <b>Haldane,</b> who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered today a starting point in modeling enzymatic activity.|$|E
5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, <b>Haldane</b> and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E
