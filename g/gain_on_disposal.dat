40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. Chapter 1 Introduction In {{his budget}} speech of 23 February 2000 the {{minister}} of finance Mr Trevor Manuel announced the introduction of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in South Africa. Internationally, the idea of such tax is uncommon, with many ofour trading partners having implemented CGT decades ago. In order to give effect on the proposal relating to CGT, an Eighth Schedule {{has been added to}} the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. The Eighth Schedule determines a taxable gain or loss and a new section 26 A of the principal Act provides that the taxable gain is included in taxable income. The date from which capital gains tax started was 1 October 2001. Chapter 2 The transfer ofprimary residence from private individuals The Department of Inland Revenue makes a distinction between what it calls Property Investors and Property Traders. This is a very important distinction; A Property Investor will be liable to pay Income Tax, on rental income and Capital <b>Gains</b> Tax (CGT) <b>on</b> profits made when selling the property in the normal way, however, a Property Dealer (also known as a trader) will find that all his or her profits made on the sale of a property are taxed as Income Tax and not taxed as Capital Gains. So, the key to deciding your tax minimising strategy is figure out whether you will be treated as a dealer or an investor. The Eighth Schedule to th~ Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 provides that only natural persons (individuals) are entitled to exclude the first R 1 million of <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> <b>disposal</b> of their primary residences. Chapter 3 & 4 The transfer of primary residence from Trusts, Companies and Close Corporations Many individuals have historically purchased their residence in companies for a variety of reasons, including protection from creditors, avoidance of transfer duty and estate duty and circumvention of the repealed Group Areas Act. These persons now face a potential Capital Gains Tax (CGT) liability when their company, close corporation or trust disposes of the residence. ~ The Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act 2004 provides that only natural persons (individuals) and special trusts are entitled to exclude the first R 1 million of <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> <b>disposal</b> of their primary residence. This exclusion does not apply where a company, close corporation or trust owns the residence. Chapter 5 Transfer Duty A system whereby conveyancers will be able to lodge transfer duty declarations and make payments electronically via the internet will become operational during April 2005. Conveyancers will be ab, le to lodge the declarations by transferors (sellers) and transferees (purchasers) to SARS branches electronically and simultaneously make payments to designated SARS bank accounts. SARS will verify the duty calculations and authorizes the issue of a transfer duty receipt. Conveyancers wishing to make use of ev filing should register as e-filers by visiting the e-Commerce section of the SARS website. Chapter 6 Conclusion and Recommendation...|$|R

[...] This adjustment also applies to additional amounts deducted in the year of acquisition of the assets. For more details on these calculations, see MACRS.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{provisions}} {{scattered throughout the}} income tax legislation seek {{to deal with the}} evil of dividend stripping (primarily s 177 E of ITAA 1936, s 207 - 145 and 207 - 150 of ITAA 1997). However nowhere in the legislation is there a definition of dividend stripping. This has been of concern to tax advisers because (in the absence of the availability of the CGT small business concessions) plain vanilla tax planning has traditionally favoured a shareholder who controls a private company with undistributed profits first stripping the profits out of the company by way of a dividend issue before selling the shares. Of course, it all depends on the tax profile of the company and the shareholder bur a scenario can be envisaged whereby the dividend would be tax free to the shareholder and any capital <b>gain</b> <b>on</b> the <b>disposal</b> of the shares minimised (or a loss generated). The more recent the acquisition of the company by the shareholder the greater the concern that the dividend stripping rules may have an application...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} key issues, aspects, and {{attributes}} concerning {{capital gains tax}} (CGT) to enable the formulation of policy guidelines that might be used if a CGT were considered in New Zealand. It contends {{that the development of}} the New Zealand’s policy <b>on</b> taxing capital <b>gains</b> has continued in a somewhat ad hoc and inconsistent fashion. The lack of a uniform approach to capital gains taxation has resulted in detailed, but complex, legislation which leads to “policy inconsistencies and unintended incentives built into the tax structure” (Oliver, 2001, pp. 80 – 81). The study bridges the divide between theoretical analysis of CGT and implementation issues on operating a CGT. It attempts to address one primary research question and an associated secondary question. The primary research question is: should capital gains be taxed more comprehensively than at present? As a start, it examines the two important issues surrounding income definition and the capital/income distinction. In this regard, the research first attempts to identify the definition(s) of capital gains from the New Zealand perspective(s). This is followed by investigating the key areas of the tax system in order to seek the best way of taxing capital gains. This study also attempts to address the secondary research question, i. e., why (or why not) do the tax experts favour (or oppose) a comprehensive CGT? In this respect, this study identifies 23 factors/issues that are related to the tax experts’ attitudes towards a particular form of a CGT model (i. e., current hybrid approach, a realisation-based CGT or an accrual-based CGT). A mixed-methods design has been adopted in this study involving both a quantitative (survey) and a qualitative (interview) method in analysing the data to determine the tax experts’ overall perceptions of a CGT in New Zealand and the CGT adoption factors which influenced them. One important finding of the comparative analyses was that all tax experts generally agreed that the lack of a comprehensive CGT could provide more significant tax planning opportunities. However, many tax experts did not support the comprehensive income concept as they disagreed with the benefits derived from the gains in horizontal equity through adopting a CGT. This study has identified several important policy issues and reviewed their implication for the adoption of a CGT in New Zealand. The finding of the study revealed that the tax experts strongly supported the exemption of the <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> <b>disposal</b> of a taxpayer’s main residence and the tax preference for inflation adjustment. Another important policy issue is the implementation of an accrual-based CGT. Most tax experts considered a realisation-based CGT would be better than an accrual one. In particular, they were concerned about the liquidity problems and the compliance costs involved in an accrual-based CGT regime i. e., the annual valuation of all assets. These findings represent a first step towards a theoretical CGT framework. It is hoped that the knowledge gained in this study would give a greater understanding into the practical decision-making process that could result in a better public acceptance for a tax reform...|$|R

In addition, the effect of any applicable double tax agreement ('DTA') to such disposals was considered. In certain countries - such as Angola and Nigeria - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident will not be subject to capital gains tax in the respective country where the property is situated regardless {{of the value of the}} shares that is attributable to immovable property. In certain countries - such as Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident may be subject to capital gains tax upon the disposal of an interest in immovable property in the respective country in which the immovable property is held regardless of the value of the shares that is attributable to immovable property, unless a DTA provides otherwise. In certain other countries - such as Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho and South Africa - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident may be subject to capital gains tax upon the disposal of an interest in immovable property in the respective country in which the immovable property is held, however this will depend in general on the percentage of the value of shares that is attributable to immovable property, unless a DTA provides otherwise.
