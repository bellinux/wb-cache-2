5|$|Purportedly born in Weston on the {{outskirts}} of Bath, Ælfheah became a monk early in life. His birth took place around 953. He first entered the monastery of Deerhurst, but then moved to Bath, where he became an anchorite. He was noted for his piety and austerity, and rose to become abbot of Bath Abbey. The 12th century chronicler William of Malmesbury recorded that Ælfheah was a monk and prior at Glastonbury Abbey, but this is not accepted by all historians. <b>Indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> Ælfheah became abbot at Bath by 982, perhaps as early as around 977. He perhaps shared authority with his predecessor Æscwig after 968.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> {{society in}} North Britain {{contained}} relatively {{large numbers of}} slaves, often taken in war and raids, or bought, as St. Patrick indicated the Picts were doing from the Britons in Southern Scotland. Slavery probably reached relatively far down in society, with most rural households containing some slaves. Because they were taken relatively young and were usually racially indistinguishable from their masters, many slaves {{would have been more}} integrated into their societies of capture than their societies of origin, in terms of both culture and language. Living and working beside their owners they in practice may have become members of a household without the inconvenience of the partible inheritance rights that divided estates. Where there is better evidence from England and elsewhere, it was common for such slaves who survived to middle age to gain their freedom, with such freedmen often remaining clients of the families of their former masters.|$|E
25|$|In fact, <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> black Americans also practiced family {{planning}} to a comparable {{degree in the}} post-slavery period, and several factors seem to have influenced a desire for smaller families among various demographic groups in the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|All <b>indications</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> the Mafia Commission {{had murdered}} all four men in {{retribution}} for the unsanctioned murder of Bruno.|$|R
50|$|The City of Syracuse has {{no records}} to {{indicate}} <b>that</b> the arboretum <b>was</b> ever planted as planned. Every <b>indication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> by 1938 {{the public had}} showed {{little interest in the}} partially planted arboretum and for <b>that</b> reason it <b>was</b> used almost exclusively as a park. There is no record of the arboretum having been used in compliance with its original educational or scientific mission. Every <b>indication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the community and the City of Syracuse, New York abandoned the James Pass Arboretum as an arboretum.|$|R
50|$|Official {{results were}} not {{expected}} until {{days after the}} election. Early <b>indications</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> the Islamic Dawa Party turned as largest party in Shi'a south. This was confirmed in preliminary results released on 10 February 2009 as of 5 February.|$|R
25|$|Very little {{information}} is available regarding the flags carried by early American Marines, although <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the Grand Union Flag was carried ashore by the battalion led by Captain Samuel Nicholas on New Providence Island, 3 March 1776. It {{is quite possible that}} the Gadsden flag was also carried on this expedition.|$|E
25|$|The root {{is known}} to be a {{powerful}} emetic. A proteolytic enzyme known as pedilanthain can be extracted from the plant's latex, and has been shown in experiments to be effective against intestinal worms and to reduce inflammation when ingested. In 1995, a galactose-specific lectin was purified from the plant's latex, and <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> it might be useful in combatting diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|In November 2003 Air New Zealand {{extended}} the successful low-cost domestic Express concept to trans-Tasman routes. Early <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> this move has also proved successful, {{with an estimated}} 10% increase of bookings {{in the first few}} months of operation. On 30 June 2004 the airline commenced non-stop services from Auckland to San Francisco, the first new international destination for eight years. In September 2004 Air New Zealand was named Best Long Haul Airline in the seventh annual Conde Nast Traveller UK Readers' Awards.|$|E
50|$|Born in London, England, Young {{was the son}} of an architect, {{and early}} <b>indications</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> the son would pursue the father's career. He was educated at Sherborne School, Sherborne, Dorset and the University of London before being {{accepted}} into Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.|$|R
60|$|At length, as autumn approached, every <b>indication</b> <b>was</b> given <b>that</b> {{the final}} moment had arrived.|$|R
50|$|After Aurora finally {{returned}} to Cape Evans in January 1917, there were further searches, equally fruitless. All the <b>indications</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> Mackintosh and Hayward had either fallen through the ice, {{or that the}} ice on {{which they had been}} walking had been blown out to sea during the blizzard.|$|R
25|$|During World War II, Pramoedya (like many Indonesian Nationalists, Sukarno and Suharto among them) {{at first}} {{supported}} the occupying forces of Imperial Japan. He believed the Japanese {{to be the}} lesser of two evils, compared to the Dutch. He worked as a typist for a Japanese newspaper in Jakarta. As the war went on, however, Indonesians were dismayed by the austerity of wartime rationing and by increasingly harsh measures taken by the Japanese military. The Nationalist forces loyal to Sukarno switched their support to the incoming Allies against Japan; all <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> Pramoedya did as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> it {{probably}} had large seasonal changes in discharge, evident by cross-bedded sandstones deposited at stages of lower flow, although whilst the flow was seasonal, {{it is perhaps}} doubtful if this system was ephemeral in nature for there is relatively little evidence of any large-scale aeolian sandstones in the basinal settings of the Midlands. It is clear that more locally sourced material such as carboniferous limestone and reworked earlier Triassic sandstone from the Clent Formation just south of Birmingham were also important components of the river systems as they flowed northwards giving some indication of the relief of the basin margins.|$|E
25|$|In 1732 the Admiralty {{decided to}} ask the Master Shipwrights {{in each of the}} Royal dockyards to report to them on how best they thought the ships could be improved. The responses, when they finally arrived, were conservative, {{offering}} only minor adjustments to certain dimensions. There was little agreement between the changes proposed, and no further progress was made until May 1733 when Sir Jacob Ackworth of the Navy Board — the Surveyor of the Navy at the time — proposed to the Admiralty some changes to the dimensions of the 50-gun and 60-gun ships, most notably an increase in breadth. The Admiralty accepted these proposals, and the ones that followed in later months for the other types, and these new dimensions became the effective new Establishment, though they never technically superseded the 1719 dimensions; there was no 1733 Establishment. <b>Indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the Admiralty desired more far-reaching reforms that what was actually implemented, but {{due in part to the}} absence of anyone with practical shipbuilding knowledge on the Board, the Board of Admiralty lacked the ability to realise them.|$|E
30|$|A {{recent review}} of {{hysterectomy}} in the United States {{found that the}} majority performed between 1990 and 1997 were abdominal, and the most common <b>indication</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of fibroids [1]. Of the uterine fibroid masses, 79 % were removed abdominally compared with 12 % vaginally and 8.5 % laparoscopically.|$|R
25|$|The {{cytotoxic}} antibiotics are {{a varied}} group {{of drugs that}} have various mechanisms of action. The common theme that they share in their chemotherapy <b>indication</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they interrupt cell division. The most important subgroup is the anthracyclines and the bleomycins; other prominent examples include mitomycin C, mitoxantrone, and actinomycin.|$|R

25|$|The 'red plan' {{targeted}} {{victims and}} detailed action {{to be taken}} against them. The scenario, as described by Max Coleman in A Crime Against Humanity: Analysing the Repression of the Apartheid State, was as follows:Step 1: A person or a target would be identified as an enemy of the State. A cell member would then be instructed to monitor the 'target'.Step 2: A project - i.e. the elimination of a target would be registered with the co-ordinator. The co-ordinator would then have the project authorised by the regional manager and the managing director.Step 3: The CCB member would then do a reconnaissance to study the target's movements with a view to eliminating him or her.Step 4: The operative would propose the most practical method to the managing director. If the director felt this method was efficient, he would sign the proposal at what was called an 'in-house' meeting. There adjustments could be made to the plan before it was approved. The budget would be considered and finance would be made available for the project. The finance would come from the budget the Defence Force allocated to CCB activities. <b>Indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> money was always paid in cash.Step 5: The co-ordinator would be requested to make available the necessary arms and ammunition such as limpet mines, poison and/or live ammunition or other logistical support such as transport, etc.Step 6: The project would be carried out and the target would be eliminated. To do this the cell member could engage the assistance of what were termed 'unconscious members'. These were essentially underworld criminals who would, for money, kill as instructed. These 'unconscious' members were never told of the motive or the SADF connection - a false motive was usually supplied.|$|E
500|$|Norway {{parliament}} member Inga Marte Thorkildsen {{weighed in}} on the situation, and stated to the Oslo, Norway newspaper Dagbladet, [...] "All <b>indications</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the Scientologist sect has played a direct role in Kaja's choice to take her own life." [...] Ballo's friend and study partner Henry Møinichen told Dagbladet, [...] "I think Kaja would be alive today {{if she had not}} gone to the Scientologists." [...] Psychologist Rudy Myrvang told Aftenposten that testing procedures such as the personality test conducted by Scientology could have negative consequences; he said the goal was focused on [...] "breaking you down, and then they'll offer to build you up again". Myrvang characterized the Scientology personality test as a recruitment tactic for the organization. Dagbladet consulted an expert on the subject of assessment tests, Ole I. Iversen, who characterized the Scientology personality test as [...] "unethical and junk".|$|E

40|$|This book {{is about}} the {{convergence}} of two important streams of educational innovation: distance education and the educational use of personal computers (PCs).
