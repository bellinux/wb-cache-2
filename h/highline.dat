5000|$|The {{graphite}} bomb {{was first used}} against Iraq in the Gulf War (1990-1991), knocking out 85% of the electrical supply. Similarly, the BLU-114/B [...] "Soft-Bomb" [...] {{graphite bomb}} was used by NATO against Serbia in May 1999, disabling 70% of that country's power grid. After initial success in disabling Serbian electric power systems, the electric supply was restored in less than 24 hours. The BLU-114/B was again used {{a few days later}} to counter Serbian efforts to restore damage caused by the initial attack. In the later stage of Operation Allied Force, NATO's air forces used conventional bombs and rockets to target power <b>highlines</b> and transformer stations. Graphite bombs only work on power lines that are not insulated.|$|R
5000|$|Since the 1970s, tourism {{has played}} an {{increasing}} {{role in the}} local economy.

2500|$|Tricklining {{has become}} {{the most common form of}} slacklining because of the easy setup of [...] {{slackline}} kits. Tricklining is often done low to the ground but can be done on <b>highlines</b> as well. A great number of tricks can be done on the line, and because the sport is fairly new, there is plenty of room for new tricks. Some of the basic tricks done today are walking, walking backwards, turns, drop knee, running and jumping onto the slackline to start walking, and bounce walking. Some intermediate tricks include: Buddha sit, sitting down, lying down, cross-legged knee drop, surfing forward, surfing sideways, and jump turns, or [...] "180s." [...] Some of the advanced tricks are: jumps, tree plants, jumping from line-to-line, 360s, butt bounces, and chest bounces. With advancements in webbing technology & tensioning systems, the limits for what can be done on a slackline are being pushed constantly. It is not uncommon to see expert slackliners incorporating flips and twists into slackline trick combinations.|$|R
5000|$|Andy {{spelled out}} his {{approach}} to life - dubbed [...] "slacklife" [...] - in a November 2010 interview with Brenden Gebhart. Slacklife is: “A concept adopted by slackliners who live a life consistently and continually inspired by slacklining. Slacklining is not considered a sport by society. There is no slackline magazine. There are no set rules. No set definitions. No standardized equipment. No statistics. Most importantly, there are no true professionals. In fact there is pretty much no reason to slackline except {{for the sake of}} slacklining itself. That is the slacklife. Rules and regulations involved in the habitual and ridiculous effort to remove RISK entirely from society has made living the slacklife inside of society damn near impossible. Liability and insurance are the two words crippling the sport of slacklining today. “Slackers,” living the “slacklife,” instead; travel the globe in search of the most inspiring places to practice slacklining. Tricklining, longlining, <b>highlining,</b> and free solo are all separate facets of slacklining. Training all of these facets is an incredibly positive way to stay physically and mentally fit. This training is becoming a pseudo-religion amongst the community of slackliners; otherwise called the “slacklife.” Living in the moment, being immersed in the wilderness, challenging your body, developing your mind, confronting, controlling, and conquering one’s fear of death, and pursuing the pure, true, and honest unbridled feeling of freedom {{to do what you want}} is the foundation supporting the Slacklife.” ...|$|R

Initially, Neons were available in many bold colors including Nitro yellow-green, Lapis Blue, Aqua, and Magenta, however paint color choices became more subdued by the 1998-1999 model years, as the majority of buyers opted for more traditional colors.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Colter {{founded the}} Arizona <b>Highline</b> Reclamation Association, {{the goal of}} which {{was to create a}} system of dams and {{reservoirs}} in the state, utilizing the waters of the Colorado. The concept also had the support of Colter's long-time political ally, Hunt, who had been re-elected as governor in 1922, defeating the man who had defeated Colter in the 1918 governorship race, Campbell. Early in 1924, Colter announced that he would be challenging incumbent Carl Hayden for his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Hayden was a proponent of the Sante Fe Compact, and this was seen as an internal struggle within the Democratic party in Arizona. However, for reasons unknown, Colter later withdraw from the race, although Hayden did tone down his support for the agreement.|$|E
