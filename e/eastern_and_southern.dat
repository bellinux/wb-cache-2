5|$|The {{tensions}} {{between these two}} competing historical and cultural traditions erupted into political and social conflict during the Ukrainian crisis, which began when then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union on 21 November 2013. Support for closer ties with Europe was strong in western and central Ukraine, whilst many in <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> Ukraine traditionally favoured stronger relations with Russia. President Yanukovych, who drew most of his support from eastern regions, was forced out of office in February 2014. His ouster was followed by protests in <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> Ukraine that placed {{a strong emphasis on}} the importance of historical ties to Russia, the Russian language, and antipathy towards the Euromaidan movement.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites have been {{recorded}} from the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), a semiaquatic rodent found in the <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> United States, north to New Jersey and Kansas and south to Florida and Texas, and in Tamaulipas, far northeastern Mexico. Some of these parasites are endoparasites, internal parasites, while others are ectoparasites, external parasites.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} social, cultural, ethnic, and {{linguistic}} factors {{contributed to the}} sparking of unrest in <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> Ukraine {{in the aftermath of}} the early 2014 revolution in Ukraine. Following Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, resurfacing historical and cultural divisions and a weak state structure hampered the development of a unified Ukrainian national identity. In <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> Ukraine, Russification and ethnic Russian settlement during centuries of Russian rule caused the Russian language to attain primacy, even amongst ethnic Ukrainians. In Crimea, ethnic Russians have comprised the majority of the population since the deportation of the indigenous Crimean Tatars by Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin following the Second World War. This contrasts with western and central Ukraine, which were historically ruled by a variety of powers, such as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Austrian Empire. In these areas, the Ukrainian ethnic, national, and linguistic identity remained intact.|$|E
5|$|Early genetic {{studies were}} focused on lions from <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> parts of Africa, and already showed that lions can {{possibly}} be divided in two main clades: one {{to the west of}} the Great Rift Valley and the other to the east. Lions in eastern Kenya are genetically much closer to lions in South Africa than to lions in the Aberdare Range in western Kenya or in Uganda.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Pterocles are mainly found in the drier parts of northern, <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> Africa though the range of some species extends into the Middle East and western Asia. The Madagascar {{sandgrouse}} is restricted to Madagascar. The black-bellied sandgrouse and the pin-tailed sandgrouse also occur in Spain, Portugal and southern France. Most species are sedentary though some make local migrations, typically to lower altitudes in winter.|$|E

The soil {{on either side of the}} fault line is significantly different; the <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> parts of Stroma are covered by fertile clay fed by bedrock minerals, while less fertile boggy ground predominates on the west side.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line (numbered T4, {{coloured}} azure blue) is {{a commuter}} railway {{line in the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> suburbs of Sydney and {{is a part of}} the Sydney Trains network. The line was constructed in the 1880s to Wollongong to take advantage of agricultural and mining potentials in the Illawarra area. In March 1926 it became the first railway in New South Wales to run electric train services.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} B.curtisii grow singly, scattered, {{or in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} {{coniferous}} or mixed woods, often with pines. Fruit bodies generally appear from August to November. The geographical distribution of the fungus is limited to <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> North America. In the United States, it occurs from New England south to Florida, and west to Texas. The species was newly reported from Mexico in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The immune {{response}} of tree sparrows is less robust {{than that of}} the house sparrow and has been proposed as a factor in the greater invasive potential of the latter. The house sparrow and tree sparrow are the most frequent victims of roadkill on the roads of Central, <b>Eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>Southern</b> Europe. The maximum recorded age is 13.1 years, but three years is a typical lifespan.|$|E

5|$|Al-Kharrat {{commenced}} guerrilla {{operations in}} September, targeting French forces posted in the <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> Ghouta. His prominence rose {{as he led}} nighttime raids against the French in Damascus, during which he disarmed army patrols and took soldiers hostage. In al-Shaghour, Souk Saruja and Jazmatiyya, al-Kharrat and his band burnt down all French-held buildings. In {{the first week of}} October, sixty French gendarmes were dispatched to the Ghouta to apprehend al-Kharrat and his fighters. The gendarmes were quartered in the home of al-Malihah's mukhtar (village headman). In the evening, the rebels attacked the residence, killing one gendarme and capturing the rest; the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed.|$|E

5|$|Cheetah fossils {{found in}} the lower beds of the Olduvai Gorge site in {{northern}} Tanzania {{date back to the}} Pleistocene. The extinct species of Acinonyx are older than the cheetah, with the oldest known from the late Pliocene; these fossils are about three million years old. These species include Acinonyx pardinensis (Pliocene epoch), notably larger than the modern cheetah, and A.intermedius (mid-Pleistocene period). While the range of A.intermedius stretched from Europe to China, Apardinensis spanned over Eurasia as well as <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> Africa. A variety of larger cheetah believed to have existed in Europe fell to extinction around half a million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from <b>eastern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
