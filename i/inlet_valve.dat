5|$|The capsule {{built for}} the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. In late July, the launch date was set for September 18, but delays with the Atlas booster's delivery {{and a series of}} technical concerns with the safety of the rocket motors caused it to be pushed back several weeks. Some of this {{had to do with the}} modified propulsion system, but also concern over Atlas ICBM tests earlier in the year. There had been no Atlas failures caused by the turbopumps for almost three years, but in late 1961-early 1962, two static firing tests experienced pump failure and explosion of the engine, followed by an Atlas missile in April 1962 that exploded almost immediately at liftoff due to a failure of the sustainer turbopump. Analysis of these incidents failed to locate any specific cause for the pump explosions, but all of them occurred when running untested hardware modifications and during movement of the sustainer <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> to the flight-ready open position. It was thus decided to give MA-8's booster a thorough checkout before it could be deemed flight-worthy. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test on the pad would expose the sustainer turbopump to the failure mode in question. This was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.|$|E

25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as the fuel is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} the fuel bowl. The float lifts upward toward the bottom of the inverted fuel bowl. With the float at the bottom of the fuel bowl, the fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> opens, as it would when there is not enough fuel in the fuel bowl. With the fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> open, the fuel pump continues pumping fuel into the fuel bowl, where the resulting excess fuel causes the fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|E

When the piston {{reached the top of}} the cylinder, the steam <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened. The condenser being at a lower pressure, drew the steam from the cylinder into the condenser where it cooled and condensed from water vapor to liquid water, maintaining a partial vacuum in the condenser that was communicated to the space of the cylinder by the connecting passage. External atmospheric pressure then pushed the piston down the cylinder.|$|E

When it stops completely, {{there is a tendency}} for the turbine shaft to deflect or bend if allowed to remain in one position too long. This is because the heat inside the turbine casing tends to concentrate in {{the top half of the}} casing, making the top half portion of the shaft hotter than the bottom half. The shaft therefore could warp or bend by millionths of inches.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{backward}} flow of piezoelectric pumps, this paper presents a single-active-chamber piezoelectric membrane pump with multiple passive check valves. Under the condition of a fixed total number of passive check valves, by means of changing the <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> and outlet valves’ configuration, the pumping characteristics in terms of flow rate and backpressure are experimentally investigated. Like the maximum flow rate and backpressure, the testing {{results show that the}} optimal frequencies are significantly affected by changes in the number <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> and outlet valves. The variation ratios of the maximum flow rate and the maximum backpressure are up to 66 % and less than 20 %, respectively. Furthermore, the piezoelectric pump generally demonstrates very similar flow rate and backpressure characteristics when the number of <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> in one kind of configuration is {{the same as that of}} outlet valves in another configuration. The comparison indicates that the backflow from the pumping chamber to inlet is basically the same as the backflow from the outlet to the pumping chamber. No matter whether the number of <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> or the number of outlet valves is increased, the backflow can be effectively reduced. In addition, the backpressure fluctuation can be significantly suppressed with an increase of either <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> or outlet valves. It also means that the pump can prevent the backflow more effectively at the cost of power consumption. The pump is very suitable for conditions where more accurate flow rates are needed and wear and fatigue of check valves often occur...|$|R
2500|$|A floatless {{pressure}} carburetor {{is a type}} {{of aircraft}} fuel control that provides very accurate fuel delivery, prevents ice from forming in the carburetor and prevents fuel starvation during negative [...] "G" [...] and inverted flight by eliminating the customary float-controlled fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>valve.</b> [...] Unlike the float-type carburetor fuel system that relies on venturi suction to draw fuel into the engine, a pressure carburetor only uses the venturi to measure the mass airflow into the engine and manages the flow of fuel that is continuously under pressure from the fuel pump to the spray nozzle. In 1936, the first Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburetor (a model PD12-B) was installed and flown on an Allison V-1710-7.|$|E
2500|$|Float type carburetors {{are able}} to {{compensate}} for these unstable conditions through various design features, but only within reason. For example, once the float type carburetor is under negative g conditions, such as a rapid nose down attitude, the float lifts {{toward the top of}} the fuel bowl as the float becomes weightless when the aircraft descends faster than the float and the fuel. The float is [...] lifted upward by inertia, closing the fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> as if the fuel bowl was full of fuel. Cutting off the fuel supply causes the fuel-air ratio to become greater than sixteen to one, which is then too lean for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the flight}} the {{loosened}} nut caused increasingly excessive valve clearance eventually allowing collision of the valve {{head with the}} rising piston fracturing the valve stem, which then allowed the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> to drop open, resulting in the ignition by the spark plug of the pressurised fuel/air mixture within the inlet manifold and, eventually, the pumping of the ignited fuel outboard of the rocker cover and along {{the outside of the}} engine, leading to an extensive fire in the engine nacelle. Due to the fire [...] originating in the induction system, where the supercharged fuel/air mixture was at higher pressure than atmospheric, the heart of the fire was much hotter burning and intense than would be the case in a simple fuel fire.|$|E
