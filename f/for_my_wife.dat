500|$|As the Japanese {{advanced}} towards New Guinea {{in early}} 1942, the RAAF urgently established three new fighter units for Australia's northern defence, Nos.75, 76 and 77 Squadrons. Jackson {{was promoted to}} acting squadron leader and appointed commanding officer (CO) of No.75 Squadron on 19March, barely {{two weeks after the}} unit was formed at Townsville, Queensland. He took over from Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, who had led No.3 Squadron in the Middle East and been given the task of preparing No.75 for operations at Port Moresby, where the local Australian Army garrison was under regular attack by Japanese bombers. Jeffrey later recalled chiding Jackson for his eagerness to return to combat despite having already done enough in the war, to which the latter replied, [...] "What are you fighting for? King and country? Well, I'm fighting <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and kids and no Jap bastard's going to get them!" [...] On 21March, Jackson led the squadron's main force to Seven Mile Aerodrome {{to take part in the}} defence of Port Moresby, a crucial early battle in the New Guinea campaign, and what military aviation historian Andrew Thomas called [...] "one of the most gallant episodes in the history of the RAAF". [...] The unit was equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks, whose long-awaited arrival had seen them irreverently dubbed [...] "Tomorrowhawks", [...] "Neverhawks", and [...] "Mythhawks" [...] by the beleaguered garrison at Moresby. Jackson's age of thirty-four was considered advanced for a fighter pilot, and he was affectionately known as [...] "Old John" [...] to his men, one of whom was his younger brother Les, now a flight lieutenant. As CO, Jackson's leadership was to prove inspirational to his pilots, many of whom had received only nine days of training in fighter tactics, and fired their guns just once.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in the Genesis narrative demonstrate that adultery was understood to be a natural phenomenon. [...] These occur in the times of the Patriarchs over a span of about 200 years, the last one occurring more than 400 years before the giving of the law through Moses. In Genesis 12, Abram’s wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh’s palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts “serious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.” Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram’s wife and tells him, [...] "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell {{me that she was}} your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife?</b> Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go." ...|$|E

[...] The morning papers discussed the event in big headlines that the first full-blooded Indian baby had been born at the Buffalo Bill grounds. [...] Colonel Cody was to be its godfather, and the baby was named after the reigning Queen of England. [...] The child’s full name was to be Alexandra Birmingham Cody Standing Bear. [...] The next morning Cody {{came to me and}} asked if my wife and baby could be placed in the side-show. [...] He said the English people {{would like to see the}} face of a newly born Indian baby lying in an Indian cradle or ‘hoksicalaa postan.' [...] I gave my consent, and the afternoon papers stated that the baby and mother could be seen the following afternoon. [...] Long before it was time for the show to begin, people were lining up on the road. [...] My wife sat on the raised platform, with the little one in the cradle before her. [...] The people filed past, many of them dropping money in a box for her. [...] It was a great drawing card for the show; the work was very light <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> and as for the baby, before she was twenty-four hours old she was making more money than my wife and I together." ...|$|E
