5000|$|Offsets are {{of various}} durations. They may be planned {{to last for}} 1 or 2 years, but 8-10 year plans are very common; {{exceptionally}} long is an offset like Al Yamamah Program, a BAE-UK offset in Saudi Arabia in place since 1987. Clients (sovereign countries) have in place mechanisms to control their implementations, and to certificate milestone accomplishments in their offset programs. An offset supervision authority certifies the advancement in the offset completion in percentages, issuing offset certificates. These certificates may be issued to prime contractors fulfilling their offset agreement, but also to offset <b>fulfillers,</b> that have subcontracted the job from prime contractors and registered as such in the foreign countries. When there are multipliers, such certificates express the percentage of completion in [...] "credit value" [...] ("actual value" [...] X multiplier). Offset <b>fulfillers</b> redeems the offsets certificates through contracts or subcontracts with the prime contractor. More recently, given the importance {{and the growth of}} offset practices around the world, offset <b>fulfillers</b> can “sell” their certificates to prime contractors other than their initial one, {{as long as they have}} national offset commissions authorizations.

60|$|Certainly it {{is clear}} enough that such love as that implied by Siegfried's first taste of fear as he cuts through the mailed coat of the {{sleeping}} figure on the mountain, and discovers {{that it is a}} woman; by her fierce revolt against being touched by him when his terror gives way to ardor; by his manly transports of victory; and by the womanly mixture of rapture and horror with which she abandons herself to the passion which has seized on them both, is an experience which it is much better, like the vast majority of us, never to have passed through, than to allow it to play more than a recreative holiday part in our lives. It did not play a very large part in Wagner's own laborious life, and does not occupy more than two scenes of The Ring. Tristan and Isolde, wholly devoted to it, is a poem of destruction and death. The Mastersingers, a work full of health, fun and happiness, contains not a single bar of love music that can be described as passionate: the hero of it is a widower who cobbles shoes, writes verses, and contents himself with looking on at the sweetheartings of his customers. Parsifal makes an end of it altogether. The truth is that the love panacea in Night Falls On The Gods and in the last act of Siegfried is a survival of the first crude operatic conception of the story, modified by an anticipation of Wagner's later, though not latest, conception of love as the <b>fulfiller</b> of our Will to Live and consequently our reconciler to night and death.|$|E

50|$|One {{could say}} that nothing would have emerged, if only Wiitakorpi would have humbly asked the {{experienced}} American giant for an advise {{on how to use}} indirect offsets. He could have solved the problem of bribes (if any bribe was due) by establishing an offset <b>fulfillers</b> in Liechtenstein, or in one of the convenient branches of LGT. No need to transfer the money through Austria to Liechtenstein. While Austria treasures bank privacy, it abides to money laundry international laws. In Austria the alleged Patria case scheme was exposed, perhaps because of a zealous bank clerk (or perhaps because Slovenia did not buy the Austrian Pandur). In any case, the fault is to blame on the naïve Jorma Wiitakorpi, leader of an excellent but dwarfish defense company. To be sure, a wire transfer to Feldkirch (Austria) as compensation for a defense contract is called bribe, while the same wire transfer to Schaanwald (Liechtenstein) as compensation for the same contract is called indirect offset. No much difference, geographical speaking, only 4 km in the Alps, but a great difference in international defense contractors sophistication. LGT Luxembourg branch can transform that money (being it a bribe or a fake indirect offset certificate) in whatever one likes in the Schengen area. Substantially but also legally speaking it is still corruption, but hard to understand even for investigative journalists.|$|R
5000|$|In {{medium and}} large tenders for weapons systems the bid {{can be very}} complex, {{involving}} one or more than one company as bidder. The main offer is guided by a prime contractor that may have other companies associated to the bid as partners or as subcontractors. However, {{in regards to the}} agreed offset proposal only the prime contractor is liable toward the final client for its fulfillment. Since offsets are increasingly complex, the prime contractor may hire subcontractors to fulfill its contractual obligations. While the liability for the offsets stays with the prime contractor, the job can be executed by a subcontractor, or an offset fulfiller.One of the collateral benefits of offsets in U.S. (probably not offsetting the adverse effects of defense offsets on economy and jobs) is the proliferation of legal and economic jobs in the “offsets sector,” that goes from international legal companies to the fully staffed international offices of U.S. defense companies. In addition, the establishment of new companies in “offset” venture capital, in “offset” marketing assistance: offset <b>fulfillers</b> that provide their support services to the defense and aerospace industry. While many offset programs originally evolved as a result of defense and aerospace sales, today many new offset / Industrial Partnership programs have developed as a result of nations wanting to improve their industrial base, level of technology and desire to become more self-sufficient across a broad range of industry sectors. As a result of this new interest and demand for Industrial Partnership, there has been both a growth and establishment of new offset associations. There are both Global and Domestic [...] "Offset" [...] / Industrial Partnership organizations. The largest and most widely attended global association is GOCA, the Global Offset and Countertrade Association, whose purpose is to promote trade and commerce between companies around the world and their foreign customers through a greater understanding of countertrade and offset. Each year GOCA hosts several industry meetings in partnership with other European and American offset organizations such as the ADS, Aerospace Defence Securityhttp://www.adsgroup.org.uk and DIOA, the U.S. Defense Industry Offset Associationhttp://www.dioa.org. DIOA was established in 1985 by members of the U.S. Defense Industry to foster education, networking and guidelines for professionalism in offsets implementations. The industry meetings referenced above are attended by leading global industrial companies, companies that specialize in providing support services for Industrial Partnership fulfillment, and by various government and military authorities, mostly from national ministries of defense and economy, who oversee and monitor offset and Industrial Partnership programs. The purpose of these industry meetings is to educate, and to foster relationships between the various offset obligors and beneficiaries so that real and sustainable economic benefits can be delivered to nations who are seeking to improve their respective economies. Offsets and Industrial Partnership programs have been evolving for over three decades and there are dozens of articles that describe various successes and challenges that have resulted from implementing offset programs. The most widely read publication that deals with the developments in the Offset and Industrial Participation arena is Countertrade and Offset ("CTO")http://www.cto-offset.com.|$|R

According to him, Christian missions are like leaven, though, not seen from outside, yet is innately transforming. According to O.

[...] The idea of Christ the <b>fulfiller</b> imbued the minds of South India, part of then-Madras Presidency, due to the teachings of Miller at Madras Christian College and due to his missionary work in Madras.

The five Kona chiefs supporting Kamehameha were: Keeaumoku Pāpaiahiahi (Kamehameha's father-in-law/grand Uncle), Keaweaheulu Kaluaāpana (Kamehameha's uncle), Kekūhaupio (Kamehameha's warrior teacher), Kameeiamoku and Kamanawa (twin uncles of Kamehameha). They defended Kamehameha as the Unifier Ka Na`i aupuni. High Chiefs Keawe Mauhili and Keeaumoku were by genealogy the next in line for Ali`i Nui. Both chose the younger nephews Kiwala`o and Kamehameha over themselves.

40|$|AbstractBesides the {{conventional}} public opinion pollsters, mass media {{have also been}} long to be another significant player in Indonesian polling activities. The numerous players of mass media in conducting polling since 1987, and the high intensity of media polling publications, have raised the question whether the media polling reflects the so-called the people's voices and preferences. This paper argues that despite popular and significant, mass media polling so far has not been reliable instrument to reflect Indonesian voice of the people. The built-in advantages of media polling are, such as, fast, timely, low marginal cost per completed response, {{as well as the}} enlivening news value which presents the most popular society responses to such issue; in the context of contemporary Indonesia, however, the media polling has a problem of representativeness to demonstrate the public voice. Moreover, as most of the media pollsters are lack of proper methodology in polling works, media polling has only been trustworthy to be a curiosity <b>fulfiller.</b> At the moment, instead of being a voxpopuli mirror, media polling may be seen as a solely public entertainer...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} contextual {{conceptions of}} Christ among young urban converts, within the Evangelical Church of Congo (EEC). The basic data consists of interviews, conversion stories, gathered during fieldwork in 1995 - 1997. From the data explicit and implicit conceptions of Christ were deducted {{and accounted for}} in the study. The main analytical questions are: How do young people (aged 17 - 35) conceive of Jesus Christ when they witness in church that they "want to leave sin and follow Jesus," and how do these conceptions relate to the context. In order to produce {{answers to these questions}} the interview data have been related to the context of the young, including the Kongo traditional worldview, life in a society in crisis, traditional church life, charismatic prayer groups and the christologies of three African theologians, namely Bénézet Bujo, Kä Mana and Raymond Buana Kibongi. The study ends with a concluding chapter describing Jesus Christ as the true <b>fulfiller</b> of contextual offices: Yaya (the older brother) and Nganga (the traditional priest) ...|$|E
40|$|Human Speech {{has often}} been {{presented}} as the crucial line dividing humanity from animals, with Literacy then entering in as the <b>fulfiller</b> of human destiny, the redeemer from primitive orality, and, in alphabetic apotheosis, the all-conquering hero of the west's civilising mission. This epic tale, pervasive as it still remains, is now under attack from many directions, not least in the expanding work on multiple literacy practices. This paper takes the complementary line of starting from the 'oral' end of the apparent equation. Building on anthropological fieldwork, experience of teaching at the UK's Open University, and the gathering comparative literature, it questions the limiting linguistic bias of this tale – itself a kind of myth explaining and justifying the social order. Verbal language {{is just one of}} many modes and media of human communication and can only be fully understood in conjunction with them. The traditional myth also underplays the multiplex nature of language itself: researchers across several disciplines are now increasingly revealing the multimodal nature of human speech and writing. To focus on narrower definitions of language and, as in the heroic elevation of 'orality' and 'literacy', to propose the treatment of language as the crucial factor in human culture is to proffer a thin and single-line tale of human history and, with it, a misleading and ethnocentric account not only of humanity more generally but also of many of our actual educational practices. It needs to be replaced by a broader, more cross-cultural and more generous model of both learning and communication...|$|E
40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Frage nach der Vereinbarkeit des Politischen Islam mit Demokratie. Der Begriff wird oft als Schreckgespenst in der politischen Arena benützt und weil es viele Unklarheiten im Zusammenhang damit zu geben scheint habe ich versucht am Beispiel der Muslimbruderschaft in Ägypten herauszufinden ob Demokratie und Politischer Islam vereinbar sind. Welche Rolle spielte die Organisation in Demokratisierungsprozessen nach dem Arabischen Frühling? Als Mohammed Mursi 2012 Präsident des Landes wurde war ein Islamist in der Rolle des Erfüllers von Hoffnungen auf ein demokratischeres und freieres Ägypten. Während der Proteste 2011 erklärte die Bruderschaft immer wieder ihre Unterstützung für Demokratie, Menschenrechte und die freie Meinungsäußerung. Aber, wie diese Arbeit zeigt, in der Vorstellung des Islamismus ist es vor allem das göttliche Recht, die Scharia, welches das Fundament des Staates bildet. Der Souverän ist Gott und nicht das Volk. In solch einem Staat wird Demokratie zur leeren Hülle. This work {{deals with}} the {{question}} if Political Islam and democracy is compatible. Islamism {{is one of the}} most contested terms in Europe today. As it is often used as a bogey in the political arena and there seems to be a lot of ambiguity to it, I have tried to shed light on the subject and detect certain narratives about it. Exemplified by one of the most prominent organisations of Political Islam, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, I asked what role it played in democracy building processes after the Arab Spring. Although the protests were also sparked by economic grievances, it certainly was a huge outcry for a more democratic and free Egypt. After the revolution, the Brotherhood won the parliamentary and the presidential election. When Mohammed Mursi became president of the country in 2012, he was in the role of the <b>fulfiller</b> of the hopes and demands of the protesters. During the course of the protests, the Brotherhood declared its support for democracy and freedom of expression, but as this work shows, in the Islamist sense the foundation of the state is divine law, the sharia, the sovereign is god and not the people. In such a social model democracy becomes a shell...|$|E
