40|$|The {{chemical}} composition and cytotoxic {{activity of the}} essential oils extracted from leaves of Croton matourensis and flowers and leaves of Croton micans were investigated. GC-FID and GC-MS analysis revealed that forty six compounds comprised 95. 5 % of C. matourensis essential oil, with the main components being <b>fenchyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (19. 5 %), methyleugenol (14. 2 %), isoelemicine (11. 3 %), elemicine (7. 6 %), spathulenol (6. 9 %) and valencene (5. 8 %). In the analysis of C. micans oils, 63 compounds that comprised 98. 9 % were identified from the flower oil, the principal being <b>fenchyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (41. 6 %), α-caryophyllene (12. 6 %), β-cubebene (5. 0 %), β-caryophyllene (5. 5 %), α-cubebene (5. 3 %), β-elemene (4. 7 %) and valencene (4. 6 %). The oil from leaves gave <b>fenchyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (25. 3 %) α-caryophyllene (20. 7 %), α-selinene (12. 8 %) and β-bourbene (9. 3 %) as major constituents. The cytoxicity of these oils was screened by the MTT method against three human tumour cell lines and primary culture of human dermis fibroblasts (normal control cells). The {{results indicate that the}} oils have a moderate cytotoxicity against LoVo (colon carcinoma), X- 17 (colon carcinoma), HeLa (cervical cancer), and control cells...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{essential}} oils {{obtained from the}} seeds and leaves of Foeniculum vulgare Mill. cultivated in Bangladesh revealed that anethole was the major constituent (58. 5 % in seed oil and 51. 1 % in leaf oil), followed by limonene (19. 6 % in seed oil and 22. 9 % in leaf oil). Other components present in leaf oil included anisaldehyde, <b>fenchyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and fenchone, while seed oil contained fenchone, α-pinene, <b>fenchyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> γ-terpinene and anisaldehyde. Besides, minor constituents like camphene, camphor, myrcene, pahllandrene, ocimene, β-bisabolene and apiol were obtained from seeds and leaves. The plant was identified by matching with voucher specimen (J- 1695) preserved in the herbarium of BCSIR Laboratories, Chittagong. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation method from leaves and seeds collected from the plants grown in BCSIR campus, Chittagong, during July 2006. The isolated oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Family Umbelliferae), is a perennial or annual herb and a typical aromatic plant that grows and grown {{all over the world}} for its fruits used as culinary spice. The oils from leaves and seeds of F. vulgare were analyzed by electron impact ionization method on GC- 17 A Gas Chromatograph (Shimadzu) coupled to a QP 5050 A Mass Spectrophotomete...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatile}} {{constituents of}} the rhizome and root oils of Vietnamese A. breviligulata were investigated by high resoln. GC and GC/MS. More than 35 components were identified. The rhizome oil consisted mainly of b-pinene (11. 1 %), borneol (7. 0 %), b-caryophyllene (8. 0 %), a-humulene (7. 9 %) and caryophyllene oxide (10. 5 %). The major {{components of the}} root oil were 1, 8 -cineole (6. 0 %), borneol (5. 5 %), <b>fenchyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (8. 8 %), b-caryophyllene (7. 5 %), a-humulene (10. 8 %) and caryophyllene oxide (13. 0 %...|$|E
40|$|Beta zeolite with Si/Al ratio {{equal to}} 40 was {{synthesised}} {{and used as}} solid catalyst in acetoxylation of camphene. The main product of camphene acetoxylation was isobornyl acetate being also formed bornyl acetate and <b>fenchyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Effects of various parameters, such as reactant molar ratio, reaction temperature, catalysts loading and reusability of the catalyst were studied to optimise the reaction conditions. The catalytic stability of beta zeolite in the acetoxylation of camphene was studied by performing consecutive batch runs with the same catalyst sample. After the third run, it was observed similar values of the catalytic activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatiles}} obtained {{separately from}} the terminal branches (woody and non-woody), cones and roots of Tetraclinis articulata gathered from the area of Zaghouan (Tunisia) have been analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Remarkable {{differences were found between}} the constituent percentages of the different studied organs. The main components in the non-woody branches volatile oil were naphtalen (6. 6 %), Z -muurolene (29. 0 %) while Camphene (43. 2 %), Z-β-ocimene (11. 7 %), nonanol (5. 3 %) and a non identified compound (12 %) were the main components in the wood branches volatile concentrate. In the cones oil, the most important compounds found were trans-pinacarveol (6. 1 %), p-cymene- 8 -ol (10. 4 %), <b>fenchyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (5. 1 %), β-phellandrene (8. 1 %) and carvone (5. 3 %). The major constituent in the oil of roots was found to be Camphene (70. 2 %). A comparison of these data with previous results reported in the literature showed surprising differences...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} foliar {{application}} of different concentrations of amino acids (tyrosine and phenylalanine) and phenolic acids (trans-cinnamic acid, benzoic acid and salicylic acid) on growth, pigment content, hormones levels and essential oil content of Ammi visnaga L {{were carried out}} during two successive seasons. It is clear that foliar application of either amino acids or phenolics significantly promoted the growth parameters in terms of shoot height, fresh and dry biomass, number of branches and number of umbels per plant. The increment of growth parameter was associated with elevated levels of growth promoters (IAA, GA 3, total cytokinins) and low level of ABA. The greatest increase in the previously mentioned parameters was measured in plants exposed to different concentrations of phenols particularly in benzoic acid-treated plants. Such effect was concentration dependent. All treatments led to significant increments in yield seeds and oil content. Moreover, gas liquid chromatographic analysis revealed that the main identified components of essential oil were 2, 2 -dimethyl butanoic acid, isobutyl isobutyrate, α-isophorone, thymol, <b>fenchyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and linalool. Phenolics and amino acid treatments resulted in qualitative differences in these components of essential oil...|$|E
40|$|Floral {{scent of}} 13 night-flowering Silene species (Caryophyllaceae) was {{collected}} by head-space adsorption and analysed via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Benzenoids together with isoprenoids dominated the scent in all species. Among the benzenoids, benzal-dehyde (Silene subconica 35. 5 %, Silene succulenta 23. 1 %, Silene sericea 15. 6 %, Silene vul-garis 12. 2 %, and Silene nutans 9. 9 %), methylbenzoate (Silene saxifraga 96. 1 %, S. succulenta 15. 2 %), benzyl acetate (Silene dichotoma 37. 8 %, S. nutans 30. 1 %, Silene italica 9. 0 %, and Silene latifolia 5. 5 %), or benzyl alcohol (Silene viscosa 36. 1 %) {{occur in the}} largest amounts. p-Cresol is only found in the floral scent of S. dichotoma (28. 5 %). Among the isoprenoids, monoterpenes occur in the largest amounts (myrcene 23 % in Silene chlorantha, trans-β-oci-mene 27. 2 % in S. nutans and 34. 9 % in S. sericea, <b>fenchyl</b> <b>acetate</b> 12. 7 % in S. chlorantha, β-linalool 40. 5 % in S. chlorantha and 14. 5 % in S. italica).
