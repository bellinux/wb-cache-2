25|$|Later, when {{telephony}} {{began to}} replace telegraphy, {{it was found}} that the currents in the earth induced by power systems, electrical railways, other telephone and <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuits,</b> and natural sources including lightning caused unacceptable interference to the audio signals, and the two-wire or 'metallic circuit' system was reintroduced around 1883.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{cooperate}} with the development of military industry, in Tianjin, the Qing government built the earliest <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuit,</b> China's first autonomous standard railway, Kaiping Railway Company and Chinese Engineering and Ming Company. Chinese Engineering and Ming Company is the earliest large-scale mechanized coal-mining factory which offered military industries energies and materials. In 1878,Li Hongzhang was assigned to purchase Chinese Engineering and Ming Company that was established by Tong King-sing. At first, it was assumed to be government-managed, but later on {{because of the lack of}} fund, the Qing government converted it into government-supervised and merchant-managed. [...] In the year of 1879, the <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuit</b> starting from Zhili Supervising Bureau, crossing the eastern department of Tianjin Machine Factory, Zizhulin concession, Chinese Merchants Steamship Company, toTaku Forts and Beitang military camp, is the earliest <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuit</b> in China. After that, the Tianjin-Shanghai <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuit</b> was constructed.Then the government established Tianjin Telegraph Headquarters in Tianjin, accompanied by the east subsidiary, the north subsidiary and the south subsidiary three subsidiaries. Although Tianjin Telegraph Group was [...] "government-supervised and merchant-managed", all the [...] "top official telegraphs" [...] about foreign and military affairs would be sent in an order of [...] "government first".Established in 1880, the Tangshan-Xuegezhuang railway was suggested by Li Hongzhang to extend to Dagu and Tianjin for transporting Kaiping coals and munitions by Beiyang military forces. In 1887, Li Hongzhang changed the name of Kaiping Railway Company into Tianjin Railway Company(also Jingu Railway Company). After the construction of Jintang railway was completed, concerning about the defense of Beiyang, Li Hongzhang initiated the construction of railway from Tianjin to Shanhai Pass which was centered in Tianjin. Besides, in order to boost the trade contacts between the North and the South, Li Hongzhang established China Merchants Steamship Navigation Company as early as 1872. Its headquarter was in Shanghai, and Tianjin branch company was located in South Zizhuulin in Tianjin.|$|R

50|$|The first {{generation}} of the hotline used two full-time duplex <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuits.</b> The primary circuit was routed from Washington, D.C. via London, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki to Moscow. TAT-1, the first submarine transatlantic telephone cable carried messages from Washington to London. A secondary radio line for back-up and service messages linked Washington and Moscow via Tangier. This network was originally built by Harris Corporation.|$|R

5000|$|Morse lent {{his support}} to Cyrus West Field's ambitious plan to {{construct}} the first transoceanic telegraph line. Morse had experimented with underwater <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuits</b> since 1842. He invested $10,000 in Field's Atlantic Telegraph Company, took a seat on its board of directors, and was appointed honorary [...] "Electrician". In 1856, Morse traveled to London to help Charles Tilston Bright and Edward Whitehouse test a 2,000-mile-length of spooled cable.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time as Chappe, the Swedish {{inventor}} Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz experimented with the optical telegraph in Sweden. In 1794 he inaugurated his telegraph with a poem dedicated to the Swedish King on his birthday. The message went from the Palace in Stockholm to the King at Drottningholm. Edelcrantz eventually developed his own system which was quite different from its French counterpart and nearly twice as fast. The system was based on ten collapsible iron shutters. The various positions of the shutters formed combinations of numbers which were translated into letters, words or phrases via codebooks. The telegraph network consisted of telegraph stations positioned at about 10 km from one another.Soon <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuits</b> linking castles and fortresses in the neighbourhood of Stockholm were set up and the system was extended to Grisslehamn and Ã…land. Subsequently, <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuits</b> were introduced between Gothenburg and Marstrand, at Helsingborg and between Karlskrona and its fortresses. Sweden was the second country in the world, after France, to introduce an optical telegraph network. The Swedish optical telegraph network was restricted to the archipelagoes of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Karlskrona. Like its French counterpart, it was mainly used for military purposes.|$|R

50|$|A relay is an {{electrically}} operated switch. Many relays use an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch, but other operating principles are also used, such as solid-state relays. Relays are used {{where it is}} necessary to control a circuit by a separate low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal. The first relays were used in long distance <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuits</b> as amplifiers: they repeated the signal coming in from one circuit and re-transmitted it on another circuit. Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.|$|R
50|$|Telegraph {{lines in}} rural areas {{typically}} used one wire earth return circuits, this is a system whereby one conductor is installed on insulators mounted on <b>telegraph</b> poles. The <b>circuit</b> return current travels back via the earth to the origin battery. One wire on a pole was very economical to build and one wire circuits expanded rapidly to remote rural communities. Telephone circuits as distinct from <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuits</b> ideally use two wires to provide a noise free line. Once telephone communications became more commonplace in big cities there became more interest in voice telephone lines for long distance communications to smaller centers remote from the cities. Voice messages improved the correctness of the information and could allow more messages to be sent including direct person to person communications. Telegraphs typically operated between two telegraph offices and the messages written on a telegraph note and hand delivered to the recipient.|$|R

50|$|The use of {{flexible}} cords with plugs at their ends and sockets (jacks) to make temporary connections {{dates back to}} cord-type manually operated telephone switchboards (if not even earlier, possibly for <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuits).</b> Cords with plugs at both ends had been used for many decades {{before the advent of}} Moog's synthesizers to make temporary connections (patches) in such places as radio and recording studios. These became known as patch cords, and that term was also used for Moog modular systems. As familiarity developed, a given setup of the synthesizer (both cord connections and knob settings) came to be referred to as a patch, and the term has persisted, applying to systems that do not use patch cords.|$|R
5000|$|A {{standard}} <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuit</b> connects all the keys, sounders and {{batteries in}} a single series loop. Thus the sounders actuate only when both keys are down (closed, also known as [...] "marking" [...] - [...] after the ink marks made on paper tape by early printing telegraphs). So the receiving operator has to hold their key down or close a built-in shorting switch in order to let the other operator send. As a consequence, the receiving operator could interrupt the sending operator by opening their key, breaking the circuit and forcing it into a [...] "spacing" [...] condition. Both sounders stop responding to the sender's keying, alerting the sender. (A physical break in the telegraph line {{would have the same}} effect.) ...|$|R
2500|$|G. W. Pierce had an eye {{for finding}} the main {{sticking}} point in physical processes. For electronics he saw that resonance was a key phenomenon. His five-part series [...] "Experiments on resonance in wireless <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuits</b> in Physical Review (1904-7) are evidence of his leadership. By 1910 his first textbook Principles of Wireless Telegraphy was published. It is in this text, and others by John Ambrose Fleming, that the term modulation is first used to describe imprinting an audio wave onto a high-frequency carrier wave by variation of amplitude of the carrier. In 1912 he worked with A. E. Kennelly on motional impedance (see below). In 1914 he was assigned the directorship of the Cruft Physics Laboratory at Harvard. Then in 1917 he gained the rank of professor.|$|R

40|$|In 1926 Carson {{produced}} {{his paper}} on ground return effects for overhead wires. It is surmised that the intended {{application of this}} work was <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuits.</b> The equations, however, have since been applied to transmission networks ranging from printed circuit boards to power systems. Carson in his derivation makes many assumptions, {{most of which are}} only alluded to. This makes defining the boundary conditions and consequently the scope of applicability for the work difficult. The basis for his work was an integral wave equation of general form, the derivation of which can be traced through later papers on the subject to a paper by Von Hoerschelmann. Efforts to obtain copy of Von Hoerschelmann's paper have made it apparent that this derivation is not available. This paper re-derives the wave equation of general form, details the assumptions used in derivation, compares them to what are believed to be Carson's assumptions and so defining the scope of Carson's equations...|$|R
50|$|In the 1890s and 1900s the Telegraph {{authorities}} {{were faced with}} the dilemma of modernising the old telegraph systems, then in use for 40 or more years, to new voice telephone systems. The cost to convert the hundreds of kilometers of overhead 'one wire' systems to 'two wire' for telephone would have been enormous. Extra wire, crossarms, and transposition of wires to reduce crosstalk all added to the conversion cost. Where conversion could be justified by high traffic levels, meaning high income from those busy lines, they were quickly converted to two wire telephone circuits, {{but in many cases}} the cost could not be justified. A method was invented whereby a telephone circuit could be established using the one wire and earth return method similar to the <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuit</b> method. The <b>telegraph</b> could be retained as this was still accepted as the basic method for transferring simple data someone similar to SMS text messages versus voice calls today.|$|R
5000|$|In 1894 Lodge {{showed that}} the Branly coherer could be {{employed}} to transmit telegraphic signals, and in order that the filings should not remain [...] "cohered" [...] after the cessation of the electric oscillations, he devised an electro-mechanical [...] "tapper" [...] {{on the principle of}} the ordinary [...] "buzzer," [...] or electric door-bell, the hammer of which was caused to tap the glass tube as long as the electric oscillations continued. The filings thus virtually take the place of a key in the ordinary <b>telegraph</b> <b>circuit.</b> In the normal state the key is open; in the presence of electrical oscillations the key is closed. Thus, by opening and closing the key for a longer or shorter period, signals corresponding to dots and dashes may be produced. In other words, by setting up electric oscillations for periods of time corresponding to dots and dashes, messages may be transmitted from the sending station, and if, at the receiving station, a recording instrument (controlled by the coherer), such as the ordinary Morse register, be provided, a record of the message in dots and dashes may be obtained. Dr. Lodge in fact used a tapper operated continuously by clockwork.|$|R
