People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E

While preparing for the show, Krauss said she found the songs very simple to learn because of their catchy melodies that could function in any musical style. While traveling on the Up! Tour, Twain decided to cover of AC/DC's [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long" [...] (1980) for the television special. However, she edited the song's lyrics to void them of the crudeness she was not fond of singing along to as a teenager. Krauss later expressed her opposing views, saying she would have personally kept the original lyrics. The show was modeled after Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black, leather jumpsuit. The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville, Tennessee to a crowd of 300 attendants. Up! Close and Personal was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, who also directed Up!

30|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} lies in that we present a novel approach to finite-time stability of a switched system.

It is shown that less conservative results can be derived when {{more information about the}} switching signal is available. By selecting the appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee finite-time boundness of the systems. The finite-time boundness (FTB) criteria can be tackled in the form of LMIs. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} the boundedness of multilinear fractional strong maximal operator M_R,α associated with rectangles or related to more general basis with multiple weights A_(p⃗,q),R. In the rectangles setting, we first gave an end-point estimate of M_R,α, {{which not only}} extended the famous linear result of Jessen, Marcinkiewicz and Zygmund, but also extended the multilinear result of Grafakos, Liu, Pérez and Torres (α= 0) to the case 0 <α<mn. Then, in one weight case, we gave several equivalent characterizations between M_R,α and A_(p⃗,q),R, by applying a <b>different</b> approach <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have used before. Moreover, a sufficient condition for the two weighted norm inequality of M_R,α was presented and a version of vector-valued two weighted inequality for the strong maximal operator was established when m= 1. In the general basis setting, we further studied {{the properties of the}} multiple weights A_(p⃗,q),R conditions, including the equivalent characterizations and monotonic properties, which essentially extended one's previous understanding. Finally, a survey on multiple strong Muckenhoupt weights was given, which demonstrates the properties of multiple weights related to rectangles systematically. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

Accordingly, the question whether the current silicon substrate and associated computing paradigm is the most suitable approach to all types of computation has come to the fore. Macromolecular materials, so successfully employed by nature, possess uniquely promising properties as an alternate substrate for information processing. The two key features of macromolecules are their conformational dynamics and their self-assembly capabilities. The purposeful design of macromolecules capable of exploiting these features has proven to be a challenge, however, for some groups of molecules it is increasingly practicable. We here introduce an algorithm capable of designing groups self-assembling of nucleic acid molecules with multiple conformational states. Evaluation using natural and artificially designed nucleic acid molecules favours this algorithm significantly, as compared to the probabilistic approach. Furthermore, the thermodynamic properties of the generated candidates are within the same approximation as the customised trans-acting switching molecules reported in the laboratory...|$|R

For brevity, we take only a avoid an oscillation between K^ 0, K̅^ 0 and ππ states if we start from a hermitian Hamiltonian whose states all have discrete energy levels. We therefore treat the ππ state more appropriately to have a continuous energy spectrum to achieve the decay of K^ 0, K̅^ 0 into ππ.
