5|$|The European <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> (often also {{referred}} to as the Eurozone crisis or the European sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis)</b> is a multi-year <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> that has been taking place in the European Union since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other Eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E

40|$|Though {{currency}} and <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> quite often occur simultaneously, {{the links between}} {{these two types of}} crises are not well understood. We review how {{currency and}} <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> could be related due to common causes, contagion effects from one crisis to the other, and complementary budget financing aspects. In an empirical analysis based on a panel of 80 countries over the period 1975 - 2000, we first investigate the determinants of each crisis separately. Then we estimate links between both crises employing instrumental variables techniques. We find that, while there is a negative lagged influence of currency <b>crises</b> on <b>debt</b> <b>crises,</b> currency crises significantly increase the risk of contemporaneous <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> and vice versa.

40|$|In the {{literature}} on currency and banking crises {{it has become the}} standard procedure to distinguish pure currency crises, pure banking crises and combined (“twin”) currency and banking crises. We show theoretically and empirically that a similar differentiation should be chosen with regard to currency and <b>debt</b> <b>crises.</b> Twin currency and <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> differ from both pure currency and pure <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> in their determinants, course of events, and economic consequences. We find that each type of crises has a unique set of macroeconomic causes. We also identify internal contagion and selection bias effects, which may lead to biased empirical estimates if twin crises are not treated as a specific type of crises. Such a separation allows to significantly improve the efficiency of early warning systems especially for <b>debt</b> and twin <b>crises.</b> currency <b>crises,</b> <b>debt</b> <b>crises,</b> twin crises, emerging markets...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the short and {{medium-term}} impact of <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> on GDP. Using an unbalanced panel of 154 countries from 1970 to 2008, the paper shows that <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> produce significant and long-lasting output losses, reducing output by about 10 percent after 8 years. The results also suggest that <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> tend to be more detrimental than banking and currency crises. The significance of the results is robust to different specifications, identification and endogeneity checks, and datasets. ...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} ad hoc {{meetings}} of Heads of State or Government of the Euro area countries {{were held in}} 2010 and 2011 to discuss the Sovereign <b>Debt</b> <b>crisis.</b> It was agreed in October 2011 that they should meet regularly twice a year (with extra meetings if needed). This will normally be {{at the end of}} a European Council meeting and according to the same format (chaired by the President of the European Council and including the President of the Commission), but usually restricted to the (currently 19) Heads of State or Government of countries whose currency is the euro.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study by}} economists at St Gallen University credit rating {{agencies}} have fuelled rising euro zone indebtedness by issuing more severe downgrades since the sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> unfolded in 2009. The authors concluded that rating agencies were not consistent in their judgments, on average rating Portugal, Ireland, and Greece 2.3 notches lower than under pre-crisis standards, eventually forcing them to seek international aid. On a side note: as of end of November 2013 only three countries in the eurozone retain AAA ratings from Standard & Poor, i.e. Germany, Finland and Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{sovereign}} debt having risen substantially {{in only a}} few eurozone countries, with the three most affected countries Greece, Ireland and Portugal collectively only accounting for 6% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), it has become a perceived problem for the area as a whole, leading to speculation of further contagion of other European countries and a possible break-up of the eurozone. In total, the <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> forced five out of 17 eurozone countries to seek help from other nations by the end of 2012.|$|E
40|$|We show {{theoretically}} and empirically that twin {{currency and}} <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> {{should be treated}} as a particular crisis type.

5|$|European {{banks are}} {{estimated}} to have incurred losses approaching €1 trillion between {{the outbreak of the}} financial crisis in 2007 and 2010. The European Commission approved some €4.5 trillion in state aid for banks between October 2008 and October 2011, a sum which includes the value of taxpayer-funded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts. This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that Europe is not suffering from a sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> but rather from a banking crisis.|$|E
5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, {{fears of a}} sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected. To {{be included in the}} eurozone, countries had to fulfil certain convergence criteria, but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November 2011, the ECB, the US Federal Reserve, {{the central}} banks of Canada, Japan, Britain and the Swiss National Bank {{provided}} global financial markets with additional liquidity {{to ward off}} the <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> and to support the real economy. The central banks agreed to lower the cost of dollar currency swaps by 50 basis points to come into effect on 5 December 2011.

5|$|Other {{government}} {{decisions in}} 1929 had attracted controversy as well. Page handed down his last budget on 22 August, which hinted at the burgeoning <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> and {{introduced a new}} tax on entertainment and theatres to help cover the deficit. The tax was very unpopular with the public, and the entertainment industry mounted a vocal campaign to stop it. Bruce, supported by the Brigden Report of 1929, also raised concern that protective tariffs were too high and were in need of reform a position controversial with the powerful protected industries.|$|E
5|$|Stocks surged {{worldwide}} {{after the}} EU announced the EFSF's creation. The facility eased {{fears that the}} Greek <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> would spread, and this led to some stocks rising {{to the highest level}} in a year or more. The euro made its biggest gain in 18 months, before falling to a new four-year low a week later. Shortly after the euro rose again as hedge funds and other short-term traders unwound short positions and carry trades in the currency.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{causes of}} the <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> varied. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt {{as a result of}} banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. The structure of the eurozone as a currency union (i.e., one currency) without fiscal union (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed to the crisis and limited the ability of European leaders to respond. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the issue of how to balance bailouts (or "lending into arrears") with debt reductions (or "private sector involvement") in the resolution of sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crises.</b> It provides a review of recent proposals to regulate sovereign debt renegotiations under a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism.

40|$|The paper compiles a {{new data}} base, {{based on the}} earlier work by Kray and Nehu, to assess the {{determinants}} of sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> over the last forty years. A simple statistical analysis of {{the cause of the}} crises is performed. It shows that neither the serial defaulter nor the "global crisis" theories of sovereign crises explain much. Sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> owe mostly to the level of indebtedness of the countries. About half the risk factor such as we shall compute it originates from this term. The remainder owes for another 25 % to the quality of governance of the country, such as captured by the CPIA index which measures indirectly the ability of countries to wither external bad shock. On these fronts, we show that the bulk of countries which were at the center of previous crises are now below the danger zone, which explains why, for them, this <b>crisis</b> was different. <b>debt</b> <b>crises...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} {{currency}} devaluations and oil crises in the 1970s led most countries to float their currencies. The world economy became increasingly financially integrated in the 1980s and 1990s due to capital account liberalization and financial deregulation. A series of financial crises in Europe, Asia, and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile capital flows. The global financial crisis, which {{originated in the}} United States in 2007, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide Great Recession. A market adjustment to Greece's noncompliance with its monetary union in 2009 ignited a sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> among European nations known as the Eurozone crisis.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, who {{were in the middle of}} an acute <b>debt</b> <b>crisis.)</b> Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, and as {{a result}} of Europe's <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> that {{resulted}} in PSA Peugeot Citroën (PSA) Group slow sales, Mitsubishi Motors announced the suspension of its supply of the i-MiEV electric vehicle to PSA, although the period for supplying vehicles under their contract as part of original equipment manufacturer agreements has not yet ended. The suspension is part of the decision of several Japanese manufacturers to suspend their joint development projects and contracts with several European partners. By early August 2012, PSA had sold a total of 6,575 Peugeot iOns and Citroën C-Zeros since their launch in Europe in 2010, while Mitsubishi had assembled almost 11,000 electric cars destined to PSA, leaving the French carmaker with more than 4,400 electric cars in unsold inventory. PSA only sold 50% of the sales target set for 2011 and according to PSA the supply was only temporarily interrupted.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} unveils the {{importance}} of regional characteristics of sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> in Latin America and South East Asia. It proposes and empirically corroborates a refinement of the logit approach, for assessing sovereign risk, which draws upon a region-specific parameterization—composite estimator. The analysis identifies some common features of <b>debt</b> <b>crises</b> that largely reflect domestic solvency, liquidity factors and, to a lesser extent, trade-balance variables and external shocks. Nonetheless, heterogeneity effects and regional signals point towards the use of region-specific models. Such approach depicts specific risk factors such as openness and debt burden for Latin America and reserves, output and government expenditure for Asia, thereby suggesting distinctive aspects to <b>debt</b> <b>crises.</b> Out-of-sample forecast comparisons further {{support the use of}} the composite estimator. The latter outperforms the simple pooled and random effects approach on the basis of various criteria, albeit slightly biased towards false non-crises predictions.

5|$|Up to January 2011, {{market prices}} for NZ Units were largely {{set by the}} {{international}} price for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units. In March 2011, European concerns over {{the implications of the}} Fukushima nuclear disaster for their nuclear reactors reduced atomic power generation and increased coal thermal generation. This caused extra demand for CERs in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and CER prices exceeded $NZ25 a tonne, the effective price cap in the NZ ETS. NZ buyers switched from the more expensive CERS to cheaper NZUs which were traded at a record price of more than NZ$21 per tonne. In July 2011, concerns over the Eurozone sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> combined with the high volumes of CERS being issued caused international CER prices to fall to a range between 9 and 10 euros. NZU prices fell to $NZ16.|$|E
5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E
5|$|The European <b>debt</b> <b>crisis</b> {{erupted in}} the wake of the Great Recession around late 2009, and was {{characterized}} by an environment of overly high government structural deficits and accelerating debt levels. When, as a negative repercussion of the Great Recession, the relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large capital losses, most states in Europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans, because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy. As of January 2009, a group of 10 central and eastern European banks had already asked for a bailout. At the time, the European Commission released a forecast of a 1.8% decline in EU economic output for 2009, making the outlook for the banks even worse. The many public funded bank recapitalizations were one reason behind the sharply deteriorated debt-to-GDP ratios experienced by several European governments {{in the wake of}} the Great Recession. The main root causes for the four sovereign debt crises erupting in Europe were reportedly a mix of: weak actual and potential growth; competitive weakness; liquidation of banks and sovereigns; large pre-existing debt-to-GDP ratios; and considerable liability stocks (government, private, and non-private sector).|$|E

40|$|Membership in a {{currency}} union is not irreversible. Exit expectations may emerge during sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>crises,</b> because exit allows countries {{to reduce their}} liabilities through {{a currency}} redenomination.

The model permits explosive dynamics of debt and sovereign yields inside currency unions and allows us to distinguish between exit expectations and those of an outright default. By estimating the model on Greek data, we quantify the contribution of exit expectations to the crisis dynamics during 2009 – 2012...|$|R
