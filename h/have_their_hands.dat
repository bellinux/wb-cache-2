5|$|Politically, {{however, the}} battle is {{considered}} a failure for France. Initially, France had desired a revolt against the governor of Salé to force repayment and avoid destruction of the city, but this did not occur. The French demanded that those who killed Christians in the city be sentenced to death, and that thieves <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> cut off; however, the governor of Salé simply banished these people from the city.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen {{standing in front of}} a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E

25|$|Competitors race either {{individually}} or in {{teams in the}} manner of a relay race. If the egg falls from the spoon then competitors may be required to stop, retrieve, and reposition their egg; or to start again; or may even be disqualified. Due to the lesser penalty imposed for dropping the egg, and consequent encouragement of greater risk-taking, the first penalty scenario may result in a race that is faster overall. Common methods of cheating include sticking the egg to the spoon, or holding onto the egg with one finger. For an extra challenge, contestants might carry the spoon with both hands, with their teeth, or <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> tied behind their backs.|$|E
500|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was carved}} in Carrara, Italy, {{from a single}} 200-ton block of white Pentelic marble, quarried near Athens. It depicts five [...] "larger than life" [...] nude figures, including three females, one male and one child. The statue is set on a pedestal within a fountain, surrounded by water jets. The figures' forms curve upward, {{and two of the}} females <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> raised, while the third [...] "sleeps in the rear". The male figure appears to float and is reaching up with both hands, while the child figure is located behind the foremost female.|$|E
500|$|Five {{days after}} {{arriving}} at Sobibor, Pechersky was again approached by Solomon Leitman {{on behalf of}} Leon Feldhendler, {{the leader of the}} camp's Polish Jews. Leitman {{was one of the few}} prisoners who understood Russian and Pechersky didn't speak either Yiddish or Polish. Pechersky was invited to talk with a group of Jewish prisoner leaders from Poland, to whom he spoke about the Red Army victory in the Battle of Stalingrad and partisan victories. When one of the prisoners asked him why the partisans won't rescue them from Sobibor, Pechersky reportedly replied: [...] "What for? To free us all? The partisans <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> full already. Nobody will do our job for us." ...|$|E

500|$|Archer and Nicholls cite among {{possible}} {{causes of the}} commercial failure of Doppelgänger its [...] "quirky, offbeat nature" [...] {{and the loss of}} public interest in space exploration after the Apollo 11 mission. The subject of the July 1969 Moon landing dominated a contemporary review in The Milwaukee Journal, in which Bennett F. Waxse noted comparisons with Doppelgänger: [...] "...the spacemen find a few bugs in their 'LM' and crash on the planet. And do they ever <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> full in getting back to Earth!" [...] Writing that the proliferation of technical dialogue hampers the acting, he concluded, [...] "...the makers of this space exploiter may get lots of mileage at the box office, but Neil, Buzz and Mike did it better on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|The visual {{begins with}} {{a shot of the}} three singers walking down a street in Venice Beach, {{followed}} by them getting ice cream and being on top of a motorcycle. As the singers lip-sync their verses, the camera zooms in each singer. These are interspersed with clips of the trio {{standing in front of a}} wall with several graffitis. Later on, they are seen sitting on chairs on a beach, with [...] "coquettish" [...] sunglasses; walking near the sea. As the song builds to its last compass, they run to an orange convertible, in which they drive to a desert. They reach the desert and are joined by a marching band, who play the drums heard in the song. The group exits the car and start dancing to the sound of the drums. The very last scene of the music video sees Siobhan driving them away as they <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> in the air, and the screen fades to black.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{introduced}} a new automated voice control system called Siri, that allows the user to give the iPhone commands, which it can execute and respond to. For example, iPhone commands such as [...] "What is the weather going to be like?" [...] will generate a response such as [...] "The weather is to be cloudy and rainy and drop to 54degrees today." [...] These commands can vary greatly and control almost every application of the phone. The commands given {{do not have to}} be specific and can be used with natural language. Siri can be accessed by holding down the home button for a short amount of time (compared to using the regular function). An impact of Siri, as shown by Apple video messages, is that it is much easier for people to use device functions while driving, exercising, or when they <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> full. It also means people with trouble reading, seeing, or typing can access the phone more easily.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the space}} {{over the north}} east buttress, we see Jesus being mocked and {{ridiculed}} by five guards ("Christ aux outrages"). [...] He sits on a stool. His hands are bound and he is blindfolded. A soldier standing on the left holds a whip ready to start the flogging. Three soldiers stand behind Jesus and two <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> raised ready as though to strike him. Another soldier kneels at Jesus' side taunting him and asking who has hit him.|$|E

2500|$|In a fully upright stance, {{the boxer}} stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a {{half-step}} {{in front of}} the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches {{in front of the}} face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the [...] "textbook" [...] stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents.|$|E
2500|$|Competitors wear {{protective}} headgear and gloves {{with a white}} strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end just {{is a way to}} make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless the fighters weigh under 165 pounds, thus allowing them to wear 10 ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches – any boxer repeatedly landing low blows below the belt is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced. Amateur bouts which end this way may be noted as [...] "RSC" [...] (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (RSCO), outscored opponent (RSCOS), injury (RSCI) or head injury (RSCH).|$|E
