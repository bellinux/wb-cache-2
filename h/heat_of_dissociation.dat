40|$|In {{a marine}} environment, gas {{hydrates}} are stable at certain pressure (sea level) and temperature (bottom water temperature) conditions. Changes {{in these conditions}} may result in the destabilization of the gas hydrates. In this study we investigate the temporal response of a continental margin gas hydrate reservoir {{to changes in the}} pressure and/or temperature regime, considering the latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> hydrate <b>dissociation</b> and the long response times to conductive heat transport in submarine sediments. Gas hydrates and the surrounding sediments do not instantly respond to changing environmental conditions. A vertical subsoil column without gas hydrates needs more than 5, 000 years to adapt its temperature profile to an increase in seafloor temperature. A vertical subsoil column containing gas hydrates has the same response time if the stability of the hydrates is not affected. Although, when gas hydrates stability is affected due to changes in their environment, the response time to these changes is extended. Destabilized gas hydrates will dissociate into methane gas and water. The dissociation process happens at a constant temperature and requires a lot <b>of</b> energy (<b>heat).</b> <b>Dissociation</b> <b>of</b> gas hydrates thus delays the response time of the surrounding subsoil; up to 100, 000 years may pass before the temperature profile completely adapted to the changed environmental parameters.

One sample cell is fitted with a magnetically driven stirrer and an internal electrical conductivity cell. The stirrer is used to assist in hydrate formation and the electrical conductivity cell is used to track hydrate formation. The calorimeter has been calibrated both electrically and chemically and has been shown to have a sensitivity of 790 μVolts/Watt at 298 K. It can be operated in either isothermal or scanning temperature modes but has been used only in isothermal mode for the work reported here.

40|$|Exchange {{reactions}} between molecular complexes {{and excess}} acid or base {{are well known}} and have been extensively surveyed in the literature(l). Since the exchange mechanism will, in some way involve {{the breaking of the}} labile donor-acceptor bond, it follows that a discussion of the factors relating to bonding in molecular complexes will be relevant. In general, a strong Lewis base and a strong Lewis acid form a stable adduct provided that certain stereochemical requirements are met. A strong Lewis base has the following characteristics (1),(2) (i) high electron density at the donor site. (ii) a non-bonded electron pair which has a low ionization potential (iii) electron donating substituents at the donor atom site. (iv) facile approach of the site of the Lewis base to the acceptor site as dictated by the steric hindrance of the substituents. Examples of typical Lewis bases are ethers, nitriles, ketones, alcohols, amines and phosphines. For a strong Lewis acid, the following properties are important:(i) low electron density at the acceptor site. (ii) electron withdrawing substituents. (iii) substituents which do not interfere with the close approach of the Lewis base. (iv) availability of a vacant orbital capable of accepting the lone electron pair of the donor atom. Examples of Lewis acids are the group III and IV halides such (M=B, AI, Ga, In) and MX 4 - (M=Si, Ge, Sn, Pb). The relative bond strengths of molecular complexes have been investigated by:- (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v] (vi) dipole moment measurements (3). shifts of the carbonyl peaks in the IIIR.

Using pyridine, nitrobenzene, acetonitrile and trimethylamine as reference Lewis bases, {{it was found that the}} acid strength varied in order:RBx 3 > BC 1 3 >BF 3 • For the acetonitrile-boron trihalide and trimethylamine boron trihalide complexes in nitrobenzene, an-NMR study (7) showed that the shift to lower field was. greatest for the BB~ 3 adduct ~n~ smallest for the BF 3 which is in agreement with the acid strengths. If electronegativities of the substituents were the only important effect, and since c~ Br,one would expect the electron density at the boron nucleus to vary as BF 3 <BC 1 ~ BBr 3 and therefore, the acid strength would vary as BF~BC 1) BBr 3 : However, for the boron trihalides, the trend is in the opposite direction as determined experimentally. Considerable back-bonding (20), (21) between the halogen and the boron atoms has been proposed as the predominating factor, i. e. ~rt- back-bond between a lone electron pair on the halogen and the vacant orbital on the boron site. The degree of back-bonding varies inversely as the bo~on halogen distance and one would therefore expect the B-F bond to exhibit greater back-bonding character than the B-Cl or B-Br bonds. Since back-bonding transfers electron density from substituent to the boron atom site, this process would be expected to weaken the Lewis acid strength. This explains the Lewis acid strength increasing in the order BF 3 BC 1 3 BBr 3.

40|$|The polymer {{electrolyte}} {{fuel cell}} (PEFC) {{is being developed}} for use in heavy- and light-duty transportation applications. While this fuel cell has been used successfully in buses and vans with compressed hydrogen as the on-board fuel [1, 2], the fuel cell system must incorporate fuel processing (reforming) for any other on-board fuel to produce the hydrogen or hydrogen-rich fuel gas to be fed to the fuel cell stack. This is true even for alternative methods of storing hydrogen, such as use of a metal hydride or liquefied hydrogen. The ``fuel processing`` needed to recover the hydrogen includes providing the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissociation</b> of the hydride and cooling the hydrogen to {{the temperature of the}} fuel cell stack. Discussed below are some of the options being considered for processing of on-board fuels (other than compressed hydrogen) to generate the fuel cell anode gas, and the effects of fuel processing on system design, efficiency, steady-state and dynamic performance, and other factors...|$|E
40|$|The CH 4 -flue gas {{replacement}} in {{naturally occurring}} gas hydrates has attracted significant attention {{due to its}} potential {{as a method of}} exploitation of clean energy and sequestration of CO 2. In the replacement process, the thermodynamic and structural properties of the mixed gas hydrates are critical factors to predict the heat flow in the hydrate-bearing sediments and the heat required for hydrate dissociation, and to evaluate the CO 2 storage capacity of hydrate reservoirs. In this study, the 13 C NMR and gas composition analyses confirmed that the preferential enclathration of N 2 molecules in small 512 cages of structure I hydrates improved the extent of the CH 4 recovery. A high pressure micro-differential scanning calorimeter (HP μ-DSC) provided reliable hydrate stability conditions and <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissociation</b> values in the porous silica gels after the replacement, which confirmed that CH 4 in the hydrates was successfully replaced with flue gas. A heat flow change associated with the dissociation and formation of hydrates was not noticeable during the CH 4 -flue gas replacement. Therefore, this study reveals that CH 4 -flue gas swapping occurs without structural transitions and significant hydrate dissociations. &# 169; 2015 Elsevier Ltdclose 2...|$|E

40|$|The {{search for}} {{molecular}} gas in dwarf galaxies is reviewed. While the early {{recognition that the}} CO emission in low-mass galaxies is weak has been confirmed by extensive mapping programmes, the interpretation is still under debate. The initial straight-forward interpretation of a high star formation efficiency in dwarf irregular galaxies has in the meantime been replaced by considerations <b>of</b> <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> CO in a dust-deficient interstellar medium as well as different excitation conditions in such galaxies. A few nearby dwarf irregular galaxies {{that have been the}} targets of more detailed studies in the CO line are revieved.
