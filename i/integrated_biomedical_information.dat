Since 1998, the database has integrated more data resources and data types, such as protein expression and gene network information. It has also improved {{the speed and}} sophistication of the search engine, and expanded from a gene-centric dogma to contain gene-set analyses. Version 3 of the database gathers information from more than 90 database resources based on a consolidated gene list.

40|$|Abstract. Clinical genomics, the {{marriage}} of clinical information and knowledge about the human or pathogen genome, holds enormous promise for the healthcare and life sciences domain. Based on a more in-depth understanding of the human and pathogen molecular interaction, clinical genomics {{can be used to}} discover new targeted drugs and provide personalized therapies with fewer side effects, at reduced costs, and with higher efficacy. A key enabler of clinical genomics is a sound standards-based biomedical information integration middleware. This middleware must be able to de-identify, integrate and correlate clinical, clinical trials, genomic and images metadata from the various systems. We describe MedII, a novel biomedical information integration research technology that some of its components were integrated in IBM Clinical Genomics solution. We also introduce the need for biomedical information preservation to assist in ensuring that the <b>integrated</b> <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> can be read and interpreted decades from now...|$|E

40|$|With more {{rare and}} {{critical}} diseases, medical diagnoses and disease prevention constitutes {{one of the}} challenging {{and at the same}} time most difficult fields in modern health care. Using interdisciplinary ap-proaches where different areas of research such as biology, chemistry, mathematics, and computer science meet together in order to analyze, understand and reconstruct complex medical processes, those projects typically achieve excellent research results but are inefficient and un-feasible for daily medical workflows. The EU funded project ViroLab should address this important issue by combining different scientists together into one project in order to design and develop a working platform for researchers and especially for doctors, which facilitates medical knowledge discovery and decision support for HIV drug resistance for daily clinical usage.

Abstract The {{manner in which}} Medical Family Therapists (MedFTs) share patients’ <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> during collaboration with physicians has not been described in the research literature. The qualitative study presented here was designed to address this gap. Narratives of MedFT <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> sharing were gathered from 12 pioneers and leaders in the field using semi-structured interviews based on Elite Interviewing techniques. Thematic analysis {{was performed on the}} data using a Framework Analysis technique. A typology of <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> commonly shared by the elite participants is described. A 5 -point recursive process to share <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> was developed based on the cumulative wisdom of the elite participants. The sharing of <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> is found to have developed reflexively by the participants in response to the demands and pressures of the healthcare environment. Key factors contributing to successful information sharing include the existence of professional and personal relationships between healthcare collaborators, and the relational skills of the MedFT to successfully communicate with the healthcare team. It is concluded that the successful development of the <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> sharing practice is related to the family systems orientation and training of these field pioneers.

40|$|Background Although <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> {{is growing}} rapidly, it is {{difficult}} to find and retrieve validated data especially for rare hereditary diseases. There is an increased need for services capable of integrating and validating information as well as proving it in a logically organized structure. A XML-based language enables creation of open source databases for storage, maintenance and delivery for different platforms. Methods Here we present a new data model called fact file and an XML-based specification Inherited Disease Markup Language (IDML), that were developed to facilitate disease information integration, storage and exchange. The data model was applied to primary immunodeficiencies, but it can be used for any hereditary disease. Fact files <b>integrate</b> <b>biomedical,</b> genetic and clinical information related to hereditary diseases. Results IDML and fact files were used to build a comprehensive Web and WAP accessible knowledge base ImmunoDeficiency Resource (IDR) available at [URL] webcite. A fact file is a user oriented user interface, which serves as a starting point to explore information on hereditary diseases. Conclusion The IDML enables the seamless integration and presentation of genetic and disease information resources in the Internet.

40|$|Abstract. The {{large amount}} and {{diversity}} of available <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> has put a high demand on existing search systems. Such a tool {{should be able to}} not only retrieve the sought information, but also filter out irrelevant documents, while giving the relevant ones the highest ranking. Focusing on <b>biomedical</b> <b>information,</b> this work investigates how to improve the ability for a system to find and rank relevant documents. To achieve this goal, we apply a series of information retrieval techniques to search in <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> and combine them in an optimal manner. These techniques include extending and using well-established information retrieval (IR) similarity models such as the Vector Space Model (VSM) and BM 25 and their underlying scoring schemes. The techniques also allow users to affect the ranking according to their view of relevance. The techniques have been implemented and tested in a proofof-concept prototype called BioTracer, which extends a Java-based open source search engine library. The results from our experiments using the TREC 2004 Genomic Track collection are promising. Our investigation have also revealed that involving the user in the search process will indeed have positive effects on the ranking of search results, and that the approaches used in BioTracer can be used to meet the user’s <b>information</b> needs.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{intends to}} present a novel {{approach}} to the extraction of additional and/or complementary <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the human brain. The extraction of the <b>biomedical</b> <b>information</b> is conducted through three mathematical engineering tools called Classic-Curvature, Intensity-Curvature Functional and Intensity-Curvature Measure, which are calculated through a model function fitted to the MRI data. The mathematical engineering tools require that the model function benefits of the property of second-order differentiability. The Classic-Curvature, the Intensity-Curvature Functional and the Intensity-Curvature Measure descend from the unifying theory and the unified theory originally conceived {{for the improvement of}} the interpolation error. The advantage provided through the methodological approach is that an immense number of possible Classic-Curvature, Intensity-Curvature Functional and Intensity-Curvature Measure images can be derived through re-sampling at the intra-pixel coordinate, and this fact provides the possibility to choose images which give the best result in diagnostic practice.
