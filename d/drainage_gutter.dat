50|$|Wickhambreaux {{retains the}} medieval pattern of {{development}} of grander homes around {{the green and}} smaller workers' cottages and small businesses in their own separate area. The Street is narrow and lined with closely packed buildings predominantly built up to the road edge. This character area contains 17 listed buildings and 23 locally listed properties. The form, layout and character of this street hark back to a much earlier era. Until 1966 the road still had the central <b>drainage</b> <b>gutter</b> from the Middle Ages and is still locally known as Gutter Street.|$|E
50|$|Arkaim was a {{circular}} stronghold, umbegone by two concentric bastions made of adobe with timber frames, {{and covered with}} unburnt clay bricks. Within the circles, close to the bastions, were around sixty dwellings with hearth, cellars, wells and metallurgical furnaces. They opened towards an inner circular street paved with wood. The street was lined by a covered <b>drainage</b> <b>gutter</b> with pits for water collection. At {{the centre of the}} complex there was a rectangular open space. The complex had four ingangs, consisting of intricately constructed passages and oriented towards the cardinal points. Evidence suggests that the complex was built according to a plan, which indicates that the society had a developed structure of roles and had leaders with great authority.|$|E

ALTs at some schools, mostly junior high schools, are expected to eat lunch with the students. These ALTs might {{not be allowed to}} leave the school for lunch or to run personal errands during their break. ALTs may be instructed to use non-standard English in front of students. They are sometimes asked to perform clerical tasks, such as correcting student writing assignments, by the Japanese teachers.|$|R
40|$|Mosquitoes {{are very}} {{dominant}} vectors of common diseases in tropical region including Ambon Municipality, Indonesia. Three genera of mosquitoes namely Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex transmitted malaria, dengue fever, and lymphatic filariasis, respectively. Breeding sites of Anopheles and Culex are usually outdoors in dirty water such as <b>drainage,</b> <b>gutters,</b> and swamps, while that of Aedes is indoors in clean water such as flower vase, tubs, and opened water drum. Annual Parasite Incidence (API), which is {{number of cases}} per a thousand populations, is used to determine malaria cases in Ambon Municipality. The highest API of 6. 54 was in Nusaniwe District in 2012, while that of 5. 92 was in Teluk Ambon-Baguala District in 2013. Number of cases of dengue fever increased {{in the last three}} years. Since 2011, there are 8 cases of lymphatic filariasis in Ambon Municipality. Methods that are commonly used to control the vectors are source reduction as well as larval and adult controls. Surveillance was generally done by observing only {{the presence or absence of}} larvae in their breeding sites. Intensive surveillance in terms of collection and identification of the vectors as well as development of effective control methods are needed...|$|R

40|$|Senecio aquaticus is a {{problematic}} pest species {{due to its}} toxic nature. It can cause economic and habitat loss. Senecio aquaticus occurs on the rare and very species rich MG 8 plant community. This community relies on management practices including grazing and hay cutting to persist. Where S. aquaticus is prevalent agricultural abandonment could lead to habitat loss. At present there are no adequate control methods for S. aquaticus as current ones are costly or may damage habitat. This thesis aimed to take an ecological approach to this problem {{to find a new}} control method that was both cost effective and would not damage the habitat. Four potential control methods were trialled. Farmyard manure application, Lime, <b>Drainage</b> <b>gutters</b> and Early hay cut, aiming to take advantage of S. aquaticus s poor competitive ability, by promoting the surrounding vegetation and out-competing the Senecio. Early hay cut aimed to prevent seed set. Hay cut and manure decreased the Senecio population after two years, hay cut having the biggest effect. Lime and drainage did not reduce abundance although S. aquaticus abundance was demonstrated to correlate with high water table. Pot experiments revealed that cutting time should be around the is" June to prevent plants reflowering and before seedset. Seed bank analysis indicated a short lived seed bank. Competition experiments revealed root competition to be most influential and adult plants most sensitive. Productivity decreased with competition intensity. Early hay cut had no negative impact on the plant community, however manure decreased diversity and likeness to MG 8 with an increase in grass and loss of forbes. Due to this negative impact on plant community it should not be used. This study recommends the use of early hay cut around the is" of June for two consecutive years as a S. aquaticus control method.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the wall shear stress {{on the bed and}} sidewalls of an open channel receiving lateral inflow was obtained from experimental measurements of the {{distribution of}} the velocity in the viscous sublayer using a laser doppler velocimeter. The experiments were conducted in a 0. 4 m wide by 7. 5 m long flume. Lateral inflow was provided into the channel from above via sets of nozzles positioned toward the downstream end of the flume. Lateral inflow was provided over a length of 1. 9 m. The results indicate that the local boundary shear stresses are significantly influenced by lateral inflow. The significant variation occurs near and around the region where the lateral inflow enters the channel. At various measurement positions along the lateral inflow zone, mean boundary, mean wall, and mean bed shear stresses were obtained and compared. The results indicate that the mean boundary shear stresses increase from the upstream to the downstream ends of the lateral inflow zone. The results also indicate that the mean bed shear stress is always greater than the mean wall shear stress, which are approximately 30 – 60 % of the mean bed shear stress. The friction factor in the Darcy–Weisbach equation was obtained from both the mean boundary shear stress and from the equation describing the water surface elevation in an open channel receiving lateral inflow ~equation for spatially varied flow with increasing discharge!. The results indicate that the estimated friction factors from the latter approach are significantly larger. Also, the estimated friction factors from both approaches are higher than the values predicted from the Blasius equation which describes the friction factor for wide uniform open channel flows. They were also higher than values predicted from the Keulegan equation, which is an empirically derived equation for flow in roof <b>drainage</b> <b>gutters.</b> The study highlights the deficiencies in the existing equations used to predict friction factors for spatially varied flow and that further research is required to explore the distribution of boundary shear stress in an open channel receiving lateral inflow...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} station {{opened in}} August 1848, being relocated from Whittlestone Head station to the north. A more substantial stone building {{was built in}} 1859, {{as part of a}} larger contract, with similar stations being erected along the branch at The Oaks, Bromley Cross and Turton, by Manchester firm Joseph Greenup and Co. Demolition took place around the mid-1970s, several years after the station closed. The station also exhibited a large outside wall platform clock, as still seen at 'sister' station Bromley Cross today. The 1859 contract was for both a station building and staff 'cottage' as erected at other stations along the branch. The 1891 O.S. map survey reveals that only two immediately nearby cottages existed - what is today the well-known Strawbury Duck (then called Bridge House) and also a divided cottage alongside, Bridge Cottages.Entwistle also served the factories at Know Mill. Until recently the remains of an overhead cable railway, connecting the factory to the railway goods yard, were visible in an adjoining woods. The mills were demolished when the level of the Wayoh Reservoir was raised and the station was reduced in size following the Beeching report of 1963 and the singling of the Bromley Cross to Blackburn section of the line a decade later. Entwistle goods yard closed in November 1959. One easily missed surviving historical feature alongside the station access path and close to the entrance gate, is the carved 'LYR' boundary marker stone, one of several that remain in place in the section between Bromley Cross and Entwistle. Entwistle also has in place its traditional 'York' platform flag stones, but much of this is now covered over by modern anti-slip rubberised boarding sheets. In winter, with vegetation died back, the fenced off central platform area reveals around nine exactly four feet long by 10in across stone blocks, with a semi-circular groove neatly cut along their full lengths. These were left behind in the mid-1970s following demolition of the original station and may have been part of the upper station building walls where the <b>drainage</b> <b>guttering</b> sat over.|$|R

It is an early example of Modern {{architecture}} in Arkansas, using brick and poured concrete, and metal frame windows, as residential building materials. Its flat roof notably included an experimental water-control system that was intended to allow water to pool on it as a passive cooling mechanism; this system never worked properly, and required repeated roof replacements {{and the addition of}} a <b>guttered</b> <b>drainage</b> system to correct. The house is two stories, blocky in shape, with a flat-roof porch that extends from the entrance to the driveway, where it forms a porte-cochere.|$|R

40|$|A {{major source}} of {{pollution}} of urban waterways is from urban runoff. Research over the past 20 years has lead to {{a greater understanding of}} the source and how to control many pollutants. However, recent investigations by the authors has identified that concrete, being the dominant material for public <b>drainage</b> systems including <b>gutters</b> and pipes, has {{a significant impact on the}} chemistry of urban water runoff. This in turn is influencing the water quality within urban creeks. Across the Northern suburbs of Sydney, reference or undisturbed natural creeks are acidic and characterised by their low alkalinity and electrical conductivity. Urban creeks, located with similar geology and soil, are mildly acidic to mildly alkaline with much higher alkalinity and electrical conductivity. To ascertain what may be a causal factor for this difference in water chemistry, rainwater collected within the catchment was pumped through various concrete pipes and along gutters. The results identify that the dissolution of cement products changes a range of analytes particularly calcium, bicarbonate, potassium and pH. There are significant changes to urban water quality as a result of the intransport processes associated with the concrete drainage system. This should be factored into the design of urban drainage schemes particularly if they discharge into naturally acidic or minerally poor waterways. 12 page(s...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Right of Way for many suburban highways which require capacity expansion is restricted by adjoining commercial and residential development. This type of restriction sometimes necessitates the use of curb and <b>gutter</b> <b>drainage</b> facilities adjacent to high speed through traffic lanes, eliminating the need for parallel drainage ditches and thus reducing the right of way requirement for the project. These roadways are usually associated with high travel speeds and a high level of access. Currently, no design criteria exist for this type of situation. It was the purpose of this thesis to investigate operational effects of a paved shoulder in high speed curb and gutter sections, in order to establish design recommendations. The operational effects to be evaluated include conflict rates, lane distributions and free flow speeds. Sixteen sites were selected from various geographic locations in the state of Texas for study. These sites included locations both with and without paved shoulders. By observing traffic during the morning and evening peak periods, traffic volumes, conflict rates and lane distributions were determined. Data from sites without paved shoulders was then compared to data from sites with paved shoulders to determine whether the shoulder would have any effect on various measures of effectiveness. These measures included conflict rates, lane distributions and free flow speeds. The results of the thesis indicate a higher conflict rate in those sites without a paved shoulder. Conflict rates in these sites were also much more sensitive to increases in traffic volume than in those sites with a paved shoulder. The data also indicated, for the entire range of traffic volumes, a significantly higher proportion of vehicles in the right lane in those locations with a paved shoulder indicating that the shoulder might act as a buffer from obstructions. Finally, {{there was no significant difference}} in free flow speed from one type of cross section to the next. It was recommended that a paved shoulder be provided for average daily traffic volumes in excess of 5000 vehicles per day and that further study be conducted into design procedures as related to lane distributions...|$|R
