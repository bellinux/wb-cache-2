40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has been investigated using MD simulations. The interaction of three AMPs, magainin, melittin and defensin with model phopholipid bilayers has been simulated. The peptides are seen {{to interact with the}} phosphate moieties and induce large fluctuation in the position of these moieties along the membrane normal. Subsequently, nanometer-sized toroidal pores formed spontaneously in the membranes, the lipid molecules bending inwards to line the water channel. The peptides did not <b>insert</b> <b>fully</b> into the pore and the maximum in the density profile was at the head-group region. In all cases, peptide aggregation was found to be crucial to induce pore formation, though the number of peptides required varied for the different AMPs. No large changes were observed, prior to pore formation, in the bilayer properties such as thickness, area-per-lipid and order parameters. The study allows a detailed understanding of the action of AMPs...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDuring {{eukaryotic}} translation initiation, initiator tRNA {{does not}} <b>insert</b> <b>fully</b> into the P decoding {{site on the}} 40 S ribosomal subunit. This conformation (POUT) is compatible with scanning mRNA for the AUG start codon. Base pairing with AUG is thought to promote isomerization to a more stable conformation (PIN) that arrests scanning and promotes dissociation of eIF 1 from the 40 S subunit. Here, we present a cryoEM reconstruction of a yeast preinitiation complex at 4. 0  Å resolution with initiator tRNA in the PIN state, prior to eIF 1 release. The structure reveals stabilization of the codon-anticodon duplex by the N-terminal tail of eIF 1 A, changes {{in the structure of}} eIF 1 likely instrumental in its subsequent release, and changes in the conformation of eIF 2. The mRNA traverses the entire mRNA cleft and makes connections to the regulatory domain of eIF 2 α, eIF 1 A, and ribosomal elements that allow recognition of context nucleotides surrounding the AUG codon...|$|E
40|$|The CaBPs {{represent}} a subfamily of small EF-hand containing calcium (Ca 2 +) -sensing proteins related to calmodulin that regulate key ion channels in the mammalian nervous system. In a recent bioinformatic analyses we determined that CaBP 7 and CaBP 8 form an evolutionarily distinct branch within the CaBPs (also {{known as the}} calneurons) a finding {{that is consistent with}} earlier observations characterising a putative C-terminal transmembrane (TM) spanning helix in each of these proteins which is essential for their sub-cellular targeting to the Golgi apparatus and constitutive secretory vesicles. The C-terminal position of the predicted TM-helix suggests that CaBP 7 and CaBP 8 could be processed in a manner analogous to tail-anchored integral membrane proteins which exhibit the ability to insert across membranes posttranslationally. In this study we have investigated the topology of CaBP 7 and CaBP 8 within cellular membranes through a combination of trypsin protection and epitope accessibility analyses. Our results indicate that the TM-helices of CaBP 7 and CaBP 8 <b>insert</b> <b>fully</b> across membranes such that their extreme C-termini are luminal. The observed type-II membrane topology is consistent with processing of CaBP 7 and CaBP 8 as true tail-anchored proteins. This targeting mechanism is distinct from any other calmodulin related Ca 2 +-sensor and conceivably underpins unique physiological functions of these proteins...|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{standard was}} defined for both 5 V and 3.3 volt cards, with 3.3 V cards having a key {{on the side}} {{to prevent them from}} being <b>inserted</b> <b>fully</b> into a 5 V-only slot. Some cards and some slots operate at both voltages as needed. The original standard was built around an 'enhanced' 16-bit ISA bus platform. A newer version of the PCMCIA standard is CardBus (see below), a 32-bit version of the original standard. In addition to supporting a wider bus of 32 bits (instead of the original 16), CardBus also supports bus mastering and operation speeds up to 33 MHz.|$|R
5000|$|A {{corkscrew}} is a {{tool for}} drawing corks from wine bottles, beer bottles and other household bottles before the invention of screw caps and Crown corks. In its traditional form, a corkscrew simply consists of a pointed metallic helix (often called the [...] "worm") attached to a handle, which the user screws into the cork and pulls to extract it. Corkscrews are necessary because corks themselves, being small and smooth, are difficult to grip and remove, particularly when <b>inserted</b> <b>fully</b> into an inflexible glass bottle. More recent styles of corkscrew incorporate various systems of levers that further {{increase the amount of}} force that can be applied outwards upon the cork, making easier the extraction of difficult corks.|$|R

When the capsule was driven to the shot tower and inserted into the spherical tamper, inside the explosive assembly, it stuck. [...] Bacher recognized that expansion of the capsule due to the heat given off by the plutonium core was causing the jam, and that leaving the two parts in contact would equalize temperatures and allow the capsule to be <b>inserted</b> <b>fully.</b> After watching the test, his reaction was merely [...] "Well, it works." ...|$|R

The geometry was checked for overdefined or undefined zones by two-dimensional plots of cuts through the core configuration with the MCNP geometry plotting capabilities, and by a three-dimensional view of the core configuration with the SABRINA code. Cross sections were defined for a hypothetical core of 67 standard fuel elements and 38 low-enriched uranium fuel elements [...] all filled with fresh fuel.

50|$|While {{criticality}} at fast energies may {{be achieved}} with uranium enriched to 5.5 weight percent Uranium-235, fast reactor designs have often been proposed with enrichments {{in the range of}} 20 percent for a variety of reasons, including core lifetime: If a fast reactor were loaded with the minimal critical mass, then the reactor would become subcritical after the first fission had occurred. Rather, an excess of fuel is inserted with reactivity control mechanisms, such that the reactivity control is <b>inserted</b> <b>fully</b> at the beginning of life to bring the reactor from supercritical to critical; as the fuel is depleted, the reactivity control is withdrawn to mitigate the negative reactivity feedback from fuel depletion and fission product poisons. In a fast breeder reactor, the above applies, though the reactivity from fuel depletion is also compensated by the breeding of either Uranium-233 or Plutonium-239 and 241 from Thorium 232 or Uranium 238, respectively.|$|R

25|$|This {{style of}} connector, {{produced}} by Italian manufacturer BTicino, {{appeared in the}} 1960s and was intended {{as an alternative to}} the Europlug or CEI 23-16 connectors then in use. The socket is an almost rectangular socket, with one or more lateral key pins and indentations to prevent inverting the polarised plug, or connecting plugs and sockets with different current ratings. At least four models were produced: three single-phase general purpose connectors rated respectively 10 A, 16 A and 20 A; plus a three-phase industrial connector rated 10 A; all of them have different key-pin positioning so plugs and sockets cannot be mismatched. The socket is closed by a safety lid (bearing the word ‘’Magic’’ on it) which can be opened only with an even pressure on its surface, thus preventing the insertion of objects (except the plug itself) inside the socket. The contacts are blades positioned on both sides of the plug; the plug is energized only when it is <b>inserted</b> <b>fully</b> into the socket.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{address the}} problem of {{identification}} of the gunflints in the Modern Time complexes. Gunflints are a specific type of historical and archaeological sources. Distribution of these products is entirely connected with distribution of firearms with flintlock ignition mechanisms. The typology of gunflints is essentially similar to the typology of Stone Age microlith inserts. In both cases fragments of blades and lamellar flakes served as workpieces. The authors describe three small complexes of gunflints from the Crimea. Flints have been found on the eighteenth-century Russian military camps in Bakhchisarai and Belogorsk, also in Sevastopol. The complex from Sevastopol is connected with the Eastern War (1853 – 1856). The published gunflint <b>inserts</b> <b>fully</b> meet the standards of West European gunflints. A large share of flints has a lead shell which was intended to fix the flint in the hammer of ignition mechanism. Parameters of flints suggest application of guns of various calibers in the Russian army. The place of production of gunflints is still uncertain...|$|R
50|$|Remedial {{measures}} for impingement attack include {{modifications to the}} system to reduce the average water velocity, e.g. by using larger diameter tubes or, if appropriate, to lower the pump speed, and/or to redesign {{the part of the}} installation concerned to eliminate the cause of local turbulence, e.g. by using slow or swept bends and tee fittings rather than elbows and square tees. It is important to minimise the possibility of any local turbulence occurring by ensuring that the ends of tubes cut with a tube cutter are deburred and that the tubes are <b>inserted</b> <b>fully</b> to the stops in the fitting before the joints are made, as referred to earlier in this section. In some cases, where the above approaches are not possible, the length of copper tube affected can sometimes be replaced by materials more resistant to corrosion-erosion, e.g. 90/10 copper-nickel (BS Designation CN102) using appropriate fittings, or stainless steel to BS 4127:1994.|$|R
