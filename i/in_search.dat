40|$|While {{searching for}} objects, we combine {{information}} from multiple visual modalities. Classical theories of visual search assume that features are processed independently prior to an integration stage. Based on this, one would predict that {{features that are}} equally discriminable <b>in</b> single feature <b>search</b> should remain so <b>in</b> conjunction <b>search.</b> We test this hypothesis by examining whether <b>search</b> accuracy <b>in</b> feature <b>search</b> predicts accuracy <b>in</b> conjunction <b>search.</b> Subjects searched for objects combining color and orientation or size; eye movements were recorded. Prior to the main experiment, we matched feature discriminability, making sure that <b>in</b> feature <b>search,</b> 70 % of saccades were likely {{to go to the}} correct target stimulus. In contrast to this symmetric single feature discrimination performance, the conjunction search task showed an asymmetry in feature discrimination performance: <b>In</b> conjunction <b>search,</b> a similar percentage of saccades went to the correct color as <b>in</b> feature <b>search</b> but much less often to correct orientation or size.
