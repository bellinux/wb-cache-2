5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. <b>Echolalia</b> has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|Coprolalia (the {{spontaneous}} utterance {{of socially}} objectionable or taboo words or phrases) {{is the most}} publicized symptom of Tourette's, {{but it is not}} required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit it. <b>Echolalia</b> (repeating the words of others) and palilalia (repeating one's own words) occur in a minority of cases, while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.|$|E
5|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. <b>Echolalia</b> (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.|$|E
5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (<b>echolalia)</b> or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
25|$|Stereotyped or {{repetitive}} motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypies, {{lining up}} toys or flipping objects, <b>echolalia,</b> idiosyncratic phrases).|$|E
25|$|Complex phonic tics include <b>echolalia</b> (repeating words just {{spoken by}} someone else), {{palilalia}} (repeating one's own previously spoken words), lexilalia (repeating words after reading them), and coprolalia (the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases). Coprolalia {{is a highly}} publicized symptom of Tourette syndrome; however, only about 10% of TS patients exhibit coprolalia.|$|E
25|$|In all {{of these}} ways, TSA {{is very similar to}} a more {{commonly}} known language disorder, receptive aphasia. However, transcortical sensory aphasia differs from receptive aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition and exhibit <b>echolalia,</b> or the compulsive repetition of words. Transcortical sensory aphasia cannot be diagnosed through brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as the results are often difficult to interpret. Therefore, clinicians rely on language assessments and observations to determine if a patient presents with the characteristics of TSA. Patients diagnosed with TSA have shown partial recovery of speech and comprehension after beginning speech therapy. Speech therapy methods for patients with any subtype of aphasia are based on the principles of learning and neuroplasticity. Clinical research on TSA is limited because it occurs so infrequently in patients with aphasia that {{it is very difficult to}} perform systematic studies.|$|E

2500|$|Vocal {{imitation}} happens quickly: {{words can}} be repeated within 250-300 milliseconds both in normals (during speech shadowing) and during <b>echolalia.</b> The imitation of speech syllables possibly happens even quicker: people begin imitating the second {{phone in the}} syllable [...] earlier than they can identify it (out of the set , [...] and [...] ). [...] Indeed, [...] "...simply executing a shift to [...] upon detection of a second vowel in [...] takes very little longer than does interpreting and executing it as a shadowed response". Neurobiologically this suggests [...] "...that the early phases of speech analysis yield information which is directly convertible to information required for speech production". Vocal repetition can be done immediately as in speech shadowing and <b>echolalia.</b> It can also be done after the pattern of pronunciation is stored in short-term memory or long-term memory. It automatically uses both auditory and where available visual information [...] about how a word is produced.|$|E
2500|$|Words in sign languages, {{unlike those}} in spoken ones, are made not of {{sequential}} units but of spatial configurations of subword unit arrangements, the spatial analogue of the sonic-chronological morphemes of spoken language. [...] These words, like spoken ones, are learnt by imitation. [...] Indeed, rare cases of compulsive sign-language <b>echolalia</b> exist in otherwise language-deficient deaf autistic individuals born into signing families. At least some cortical areas neurobiologically active during both sign and vocal speech, {{such as the}} auditory cortex, {{are associated with the}} act of imitation.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{speech input}} output {{imitation}} often occurs independently of speech comprehension {{such as in}} speech shadowing when a person automatically says words heard in earphones, and the pathological condition of <b>echolalia</b> in which people reflexively repeat overheard words. This links to speech repetition of words being separate in the brain to speech perception. Speech repetition occurs in the [...] dorsal speech processing stream while speech perception occurs in the ventral speech processing stream. Repetitions are often incorporated unawares by this route into spontaneous novel sentences immediately or after delay following [...] storage in phonological memory.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms {{include a}} {{clouding}} of consciousness, somatic conversion symptoms, confusion, stress, loss of personal identity, <b>echolalia,</b> and echopraxia. Individuals also give approximate answers to simple questions such as, [...] "How many legs on a cat?" [...] "Three"; [...] "What's {{the day after}} Wednesday?" [...] "Friday"; and so on. The disorder is extraordinarily rare with fewer than 100 recorded cases. While individuals of all backgrounds have been reported with the disorder, there is a higher inclination towards males (75% or more). The average age of those with Ganser syndrome is 32, though it stretches from ages 15–62 years old.|$|E
2500|$|Vocal imitiation {{arises in}} {{development}} before speech comprehension and also babbling: 18-week-old infants spontaneously copy vocal expressions provided the accompanying voice matches. [...] Imitation of vowels {{has been found}} as young as 12 weeks. It is independent of native language, language skills, word comprehension and a speaker's intelligence. Many autistic and some mentally disabled people engage in the <b>echolalia</b> of overheard words (often their only vocal interaction with others) without understanding what they echo. Reflex uncontrolled echoing of others words and sentences occurs in roughly half of those with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. The ability to repeat words without comprehension also occurs in mixed transcortical aphasia where it links to the sparing of the short-term phonological store.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people with}} {{developmental}} disabilities exhibit challenging behavior, defined as [...] "culturally abnormal behaviour(s) of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour {{which is likely to}} seriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities". Common types of challenging behavior include self-injurious behavior (such as hitting, headbutting, biting), aggressive behavior (such as hitting others, screaming, spitting, kicking, swearing, hairpulling), inappropriate sexualized behavior (such as public masturbation or groping), behavior directed at property (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped behaviors (such as repetitive rocking, <b>echolalia</b> or elective incontinence). Such behaviors can be assessed to suggest areas of further improvement, using assessment tools such as the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF).|$|E
50|$|<b>Echolalia</b> can be {{the result}} of left {{hemisphere}} damage. In specific damage to the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere has been linked to effortful <b>echolalia.</b> Cases of <b>echolalia</b> have appeared after lesions of the left medial frontal lobe and supplemental motor areas. Unintentional or nonfunctional <b>echolalia</b> shows similarities to imitation behavior seen after disinhibition of the frontal network is most likely related to mirror neurons. In cases where <b>echolalia</b> is a part of mixed transitory aphasia the perisylvian language area remains intact, but the surrounding anterior and posterior association cortexes suffer from infarction or degeneration.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Echolalia</b> {{can be an}} {{indicator}} of communication disorders in autism, but is neither unique to, nor synonymous with syndromes.Echophenomena (particularly <b>echolalia</b> and echopraxia) were defining characteristics in the early descriptions of Tourette syndrome (TS). [...] <b>Echolalia</b> also occurs in aphasia, schizophrenia, dementia, catatonia, epilepsy, after cerebral infarction (stroke), closed head injury, in blind children, children with language impairments, as well as certain developing neurotypical children. Other disorders associated with <b>echolalia</b> are Pick's disease, frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, as well as pervasive developmental disorder.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Echolalia</b> can be {{categorized}} as immediate (occurring immediately after the stimulus) vs. delayed (some time after the occurrence of a stimulus). [...] Immediate <b>echolalia</b> results from quick recall of information from the short-term memory and [...] "superficial linguistic processing". [...] A typical pediatric presentation of immediate <b>echolalia</b> might be as follows: a child is asked [...] "Do you want dinner?"; the child echoes back [...] "Do you want dinner?", followed by a pause, and then a response, [...] "Yes. What's for dinner?" [...] In delayed <b>echolalia</b> the patient repeats words, phrases, or multiple sentences after a delay that can be anywhere from hours to years later. Immediate <b>echolalia</b> can be indicative that a developmental disorder exists, {{but this is not}} necessarily the case. Sometimes <b>echolalia</b> can be observed when an individual echoes back a statement to indicate they are contemplating a response and fully heard the original statement.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>echolalia</b> {{can be an}} impairment, the {{symptoms}} can involve a large selection of underlying meanings and behaviors across and within subjects. Mitigated <b>echolalia</b> refers to a repetition in which the original stimulus is somewhat altered, and ambient <b>echolalia</b> refers to the repetition (typically occurring in individuals with dementia) of environmental stimuli such as a television program running in the background.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, <b>echolalia</b> was {{regarded}} as negative, non-functional behavior. However, researchers such as Barry Prizant and colleagues have emphasized the communicative function of <b>echolalia.</b> [...] Among the communicative functions noted are turntaking, requesting, self-regulation and rehearsal to aid comprehension. [...] <b>Echolalia</b> can be categorized as communicative (within context and with [...] "apparent communicative purpose") vs. semicommunicative (an [...] "unclear communicative meaning").|$|E
50|$|Examples of mitigated <b>echolalia</b> are pronoun {{changes or}} syntax corrections. The first {{can be seen}} in the example of asking the patient “Where are you going?” and with patient {{responding}} “Where am I going?” The latter would be seen in the clinician asking “Where are I going?” and the patient repeating “Where am I going?” In mitigated <b>echolalia</b> some language processing is occurring. Mitigated <b>echolalia</b> {{can be seen in}} dyspraxia and aphasia of speech.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Echolalia</b> {{is common}} in young {{children}} who are first learning to speak. <b>Echolalia</b> {{is a form of}} imitation. Imitation is a useful, normal and necessary component of social learning: imitative learning occurs when the [...] "observer acquires new behaviors through imitation" [...] and mimicry or automatic imitation occurs when a [...] "reenacted behavior is based on previously acquired motor (or vocal) patterns". [...] Ganos et al (2012) define <b>echolalia</b> as an [...] "automatic imitative action without explicit awareness". [...] Children often first babble syllables and eventually words they hear. For example, a baby may often hear the word “bottle” in various sentences. The baby first repeats with only syllables such as “baba” but as their language skills progress the child will eventually be able to say the word “bottle”. <b>Echolalia</b> becomes less and less common as a child’s language skills develop. It is not possible to distinguish the imitative learning form of <b>echolalia</b> that occurs as part of normal development from automatic imitation or <b>echolalia</b> characteristic of a disorder until about the age of three, when some ability for self-regulation is developed. [...] A disorder may be suspected if automatic imitation persists beyond the age of three.|$|E
50|$|A Japanese {{case report}} {{describes}} a 20-year-old college {{student who was}} admitted to the hospital complaining about headaches and meningitis; however, he also exhibited signs of ambient <b>echolalia.</b> The researchers stated that the young patient's repetition was occurring at approximately the same tempo as his normal speech rate. The patient did not simply repeat words he had heard one after another. The patient reported that his ambient <b>echolalia</b> appeared to be random but appeared when he was distracted. He was also aware of his <b>echolalia,</b> but said he is unable to stop the repetitions.|$|E
5000|$|Uta Frith, Prizant {{and others}} have {{interpreted}} <b>echolalia</b> as evidence of [...] "gestalt" [...] processing in children with autism, including in the acquisition of language. However, a 1990 study on the acquisition of grammar by Tager-Flusberg and Calkins found that <b>echolalia</b> did not facilitate grammatical development in children with autism.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{estimated}} that up to 75% of persons on the autism spectrum have exhibited <b>echolalia.</b> A symptom of some children with ASD is the struggle to produce spontaneous speech. Studies have shown {{that in some cases}} <b>echolalia</b> is used as a coping mechanism allowing a person with autism to contribute to a conversation when unable to produce spontaneous speech.Studies in the 1980s showed that there may be communicative intent with delayed <b>echolalia,</b> [...] "depending on the context in which it occurs"; this research on children with autism [...] "raised questions related to behavior modification programs that defended the revocation or replacement of immediate echolalia".|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>echolalia</b> in task {{response}} to facilitate generalization {{is an area}} that holds much promise. Research in this area is certainly needed. Marjorie H. Charlop performed a series of task experiments with autistic children. The results suggest that perhaps in certain tasks (i.e., receptive labeling), <b>echolalia</b> should not be eliminated, but taken advantage of as it may facilitate acquisition and generalization for autistic children.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Echolalia</b> (also {{known as}} echologia or echophrasia) {{is defined as}} the {{unsolicited}} repetition of vocalizations made by another person (by the same person is called palilalia). In its profound form it is automatic and effortless. It is one of the echophenomena, closely related to echopraxia, the automatic repetition of movements made by another person; both are [...] "subsets of imitative behavior" [...] whereby sounds or actions are imitated [...] "without explicit awareness". [...] <b>Echolalia</b> may be an immediate reaction to a stimulus or may be delayed.|$|E

50|$|As {{with many}} other autistic traits, if speech {{continues}} to develop more normally, this pronoun reversal {{might be expected to}} disappear.

5000|$|Stephen W. Potts, a {{lecturer}} in literature, describes chapter 9 {{of the novel}} as making [...] "broad use of the rhetorical motifs of contradiction, negation, and deflation", from the <b>echolalia</b> of the chapter title ("Major Major Major Major") onwards. Potts also discusses Maj. Major's father.|$|E
5000|$|Echomimetic is an {{adjective}} that is best {{explained in}} English {{by the term}} onomatopoeic, i.e. derived from onomatopoeia as the latter noun is used in philology and literature and in the explanation {{of the origin of}} words in dictionaries. In modern Greek lexicography, the term onomatopoeia is virtually non-existent and the words of which the etymology it describes are almost always designated as echomimetic. However, the [...] "echo" [...] of echomimetic is different from the [...] "echo" [...] of <b>echolalia.</b> The [...] "echo" [...] of <b>echolalia</b> comes from Greek ἠχώ, which is the source for the modern English word echo, the two words being synonymous; while the [...] "echo" [...] of echomimetic comes from Greek ἦχος which means [...] "sound". Mimetic comes from Greek μιμητικός, meaning [...] "imitating". In German philology the term lautmalend is used instead of echomimetic or onomatopoeic. It derives from German Laut, [...] "sound" [...] and malen [...] "to paint" [...] (as in art). The word Echomimie in German designates a psychiatric phenomenon akin to <b>echolalia</b> where gestures and grimaces substitute for the voice. In French, the word onomatopée is used for onomatopoeia. Examples of echomimetic words in English are [...] "bow wow", [...] "miaow", [...] "squeak", [...] "squeal".|$|E
