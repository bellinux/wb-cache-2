5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of medicines {{are derived from}} plants, both traditional medicines used in <b>herbalism</b> and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include aspirin, taxol, morphine, quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and vincristine. Plants used in <b>herbalism</b> include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known herbals were {{produced}} in Europe between 1470 and 1670. The invention in Germany of {{printing from movable type}} in a printing press c. 1440 was a great stimulus to <b>herbalism.</b> The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script and the addition of woodcut illustrations that more closely resembled the plants being described.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} as <b>herbalism,</b> {{the study}} and use of plants for their medicinal properties. Many records of the Holocene period date early botanical knowledge {{as far back as}} 10,000 years ago. This early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within Tennessee, which make up much of the Cherokee land today. The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} in prehistory as <b>herbalism</b> with {{the efforts of}} early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, {{making it one of}} the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} are in wide use {{around the}} world. In {{most of the}} developing world, especially in rural areas, local traditional medicine, including <b>herbalism,</b> is (2015) {{the only source of}} health care for people, while in the developed world, alternative medicine including use of dietary supplements is marketed aggressively using the claims of traditional medicine. As of 2015, most products made from medicinal plants had not been tested for their safety and efficacy, and products that were marketed in developed economies and provided in the undeveloped world by traditional healers were of uneven quality, sometimes containing dangerous contaminants. Traditional Chinese medicine makes use {{of a wide variety of}} plants, among other materials and techniques. Researchers from Kew Gardens found 104 species used for diabetes in Central America, of which seven had been identified in at least three separate studies. The Yanomami of the Brazilian Amazon, assisted by researchers, have described 101 plant species used for traditional medicines.|$|E
5|$|The European Renaissance brought {{expanded}} {{interest in}} both empirical {{natural history and}} physiology. In 1543, Andreas Vesalius inaugurated the modern era of Western medicine with his seminal human anatomy treatise De humani corporis fabrica, {{which was based on}} dissection of corpses. Vesalius was {{the first in a series}} of anatomists who gradually replaced scholasticism with empiricism in physiology and medicine, relying on first-hand experience rather than authority and abstract reasoning. Via <b>herbalism,</b> medicine was also indirectly the source of renewed empiricism in the study of plants. Otto Brunfels, Hieronymus Bock and Leonhart Fuchs wrote extensively on wild plants, the beginning of a nature-based approach to the full range of plant life. Bestiaries—a genre that combines both the natural and figurative knowledge of animals—also became more sophisticated, especially with the work of William Turner, Pierre Belon, Guillaume Rondelet, Conrad Gessner, and Ulisse Aldrovandi.|$|E

25|$|<b>Herbalism</b> {{and massage}} therapy (from Ayurveda) are {{sweeping}} the spas across America. Meditation and yoga (from India) {{have also been}} widely adopted by health spas, and spiritual retreats of many religious bases. They {{are also part of}} the spiritual practice of the many Americans who are not affiliated with a mainline religious group.|$|E
25|$|In China, archaeological {{evidence}} {{of medicine in}} Chinese {{dates back to the}} Bronze Age Shang Dynasty, based on seeds for <b>herbalism</b> and tools presumed to have been used for surgery. The Huangdi Neijing, the progenitor of Chinese medicine, is a medical text written beginning in the 2nd century BCE and compiled in the 3rd century.|$|E
25|$|As {{science and}} {{technology}} developed, medicine became more reliant upon medications. Throughout history and in Europe right until the late 18th century, not only animal and plant products were used as medicine, but also human body parts and fluids. Pharmacology developed in part from <b>herbalism</b> and some drugs are still derived from plants (atropine, ephedrine, warfarin, aspirin, digoxin, vinca alkaloids, taxol, hyoscine, etc.). Vaccines were discovered by Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur.|$|E
25|$|Medicine in the Middle Ages had {{its roots}} in pagan and folk practices. This {{influence}} was highlighted by the interplay between Christian theologians who adopted aspects of pagan and folk practices and chronicled them in their own works. The practices adopted by Christian medical practitioners around the 2nd century, and their attitudes toward pagan and folk traditions, reflected an understanding of these practices, especially humoralism and <b>herbalism.</b> The practices of Christian medicine stemmed from these pagan and folk practices.|$|E
25|$|Several {{books on}} <b>herbalism</b> {{have claimed that}} some of the herbs in the therapy have anti-tumor effects in vitro. According to {{botanist}} James A. Duke of the United States Department of Agriculture, eight of the nine Hoxsey-tonic herbs have some anti-tumor activity in animal models, five have antioxidant effects, and all nine have antimicrobial activity that may be linked to cancer-fighting effects. Duke's assessment was that the Hoxsey tonic ingredients showed very significant chemical and biological anticancer activity.|$|E
25|$|Prehistoric {{medicine}} incorporated plants (<b>herbalism),</b> animal parts, and minerals. In {{many cases}} these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests, shamans, or medicine men. Well-known spiritual systems include animism (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits), spiritualism (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); shamanism (the vesting {{of an individual}} with mystic powers); and divination (magically obtaining the truth). The field of medical anthropology examines {{the ways in which}} culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health, health care and related issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{particular}} modalities {{used by a}} naturopath {{vary with}} training and scope of practice. These may include <b>herbalism,</b> homeopathy, acupuncture, nature cures, physical medicine, applied kinesiology, colonic enemas, chelation therapy, color therapy, cranial osteopathy, hair analysis, iridology, live blood analysis, ozone therapy, psychotherapy, public health measures and hygiene, reflexology, rolfing, massage therapy, and traditional Chinese medicine. Nature cures include a range of therapies based on exposure to natural elements such as sunshine, fresh air, or heat or cold, as well as nutrition advice such as following a vegetarian and whole food diet, fasting, or abstention from alcohol and sugar. Physical medicine includes naturopathic, osseous, or soft tissue manipulative therapy, sports medicine, exercise, and hydrotherapy. Psychological counseling includes meditation, relaxation, and other methods of stress management.|$|E
25|$|In 1895, {{the world}} was in the Second Industrial Revolution, marked by {{innovation}} and creativity. Health care had emerged from the practice of heroic medicine. All varieties of treatments and cures including scientific medicine, vitalism, <b>herbalism,</b> magnetism and leeches, lances, tinctures and patent medicines were competing {{to be the new}} method for the century. Neither consumers nor many practitioners had much knowledge of either the causes of, or cures for, illnesses. The theory of modern medicine, fueled by Louis Pasteur's refutation of the centuries-old spontaneous generation theory in 1859, was growing as Charles Darwin published his book on natural selection. The German bacteriologist Robert Koch formulated his postulates, bringing scientific clarity to what was a new field. Drugs, medicines and quack cures were becoming more prevalent and were unregulated. Concerned about what he saw as the abusive nature of drugging, MD Andrew Taylor Still ventured into magnetic healing (meaning hypnotism) and bonesetting in 1875. He opened the American School of Osteopathy (ASO) in Kirksville, Missouri in 1892.|$|E
500|$|<b>Herbalism</b> {{flourished in}} the Islamic world, {{particularly}} in Baghdad and in Al-Andalus. Among many works on medicinal plants, Abulcasis (936–1013) of Cordoba wrote The Book of Simples, and Ibn al-Baitar (1197–1248) recorded hundreds of medicinal herbs such as Aconitum, nux vomica, and tamarind in his Corpus of Simples. [...] Avicenna included many plants in his 1025 The Canon of Medicine. Abu-Rayhan Biruni, Ibn Zuhr, Peter of Spain, and John of St Amand wrote further pharmacopoeias.|$|E
500|$|Otto Brunfels (c. 1489–1534), Leonhart Fuchs (1501–1566) [...] and Hieronymus Bock (1498–1554) {{were known}} as the [...] "German fathers of botany" [...] {{although}} this title belies {{the fact that they}} trod in the steps of the scientifically feted Hildegard of Bingen whose writings on <b>herbalism</b> were Physica and Causae et Curae (together known as Liber subtilatum) of 1150. The original manuscript is no longer in existence but a copy was printed in 1533. Another major herbalist was Valerius Cordus (1515–1544).|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, {{the rise of}} modern chemistry, {{toxicology}} and pharmacology reduced the medicinal value of the classical herbal. [...] As reference manuals for botanical study and plant identification herbals were supplanted by Floras– systematic accounts of the plants found growing in a particular region, with scientifically accurate botanical descriptions, classification, and illustrations. Herbals have seen a modest revival {{in the western world}} since the last decades of the 20th century, as <b>herbalism</b> and related disciplines (such as homeopathy and aromatherapy) became popular forms of alternative medicine.|$|E
500|$|Turner {{stated that}} she was on a [...] "downhill slide" [...] for much of the 1970s, {{drinking}} heavily, not eating, missing performances, and weighing only 95 pounds. [...] "I was a sipper but I never got high or drunk," [...] Turner said in a 1982 interview. [...] "It was much more insidious. It was starting to affect my liver and my health... I was very sick." [...] She decided to stop drinking, and began eating all organic food; she would credit <b>herbalism</b> as helping her overcome her alcoholism. Turner claimed she was chaste for the remainder of her life, after her final divorce in 1969 and had no desire to marry again.|$|E
500|$|In ancient Sumeria, {{hundreds}} of medicinal plants including myrrh and opium are listed on clay tablets. The ancient Egyptian Ebers Papyrus lists over 800 plant medicines such as aloe, cannabis, castor bean, garlic, juniper, [...] and mandrake. From ancient {{times to the}} present, Ayurvedic medicine as documented in the Atharva Veda, the Rig Veda and the Sushruta Samhita has used {{hundreds of}} pharmacologically active herbs and spices such as turmeric, which contains curcumin. The Chinese pharmacopoeia, the Shennong Ben Cao Jing records plant medicines such as chaulmoogra for leprosy, ephedra, and hemp. This was expanded in the Tang Dynasty Yaoxing Lun. In the fourth century BC, Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus wrote the first systematic botany text, Historia plantarum. In the first century AD, the Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in De materia medica; it remained the authoritative reference on <b>herbalism</b> for over 1500 years, into the seventeenth century.|$|E
500|$|Horsefield {{learned to}} read during a single year's {{attendance}} at school when he was six, after which {{he went to work}} for a gingham weaver. His education continued with twice-weekly evening tuition in writing and arithmetic until he was around 15 years old. James Cash, a journalist, amateur botanist and the first chairman of the Manchester Cryptogamic Society, says Horsefield received some education for a short time when he started work: the weaver for whom he served charged two shillings (10p) per calendar quarter to instruct his young employees in reading. This instruction took the form of the employees reading out lessons to him while they worked at their handlooms. An avid reader, his interest in botany was piqued when he obtained a copy of Nicholas Culpeper's 1653 book, The Complete Herbal, of which he said, [...] "The wonderful properties that are there ascribed to plants excited in me a strong desire to get acquainted with the plants themselves." [...] Thereafter he attended working-men's botanical societies and meetings in public houses, thus meeting a broad church of people with interests not only in the science of botany but also in floriculture, <b>herbalism</b> and horticulture.|$|E
500|$|As {{a student}} of the {{classics}} he was passionate about Greece, its mountains and plants (such as Paeonia) and all things Greek, both ancient and modern. The Stearns had formed a friendship with Constantine Goulimis and Niki and Angelos Goulandris, founders of the Goulandris Museum of Natural History [...] in Kifissia, Athens. Stearn first met the Goulandris' in 1967, and offered practical help with their museum. He also stayed with them {{when he and his wife}} visited Greece. Niki Goulandris illustrated both Wild Flowers of Greece that Goulimis and Stearn wrote in 1968. as well as his Peonies of Greece (1984). The latter work typified Stearn's encyclopaedic approach, including topics such as mythology and <b>herbalism</b> in addition to taxonomy. Stearn then took on the editorship of Annales Musei Goulandris, the scientific journal of the Museum (1976–1999), succeeding Werner Greuter, the first editor, having been instrumental in getting the journal launched in 1973. Eldwyth Ruth Stearn took on the job of compiling the indexes. When he retired from this position he was 88, and was succeeded by John Akeroyd. He was a liberal contributor to the journal, and during this time he and Eldwyth Ruth Stearn undertook their translation of The Greek Plant World in Myth, Art, and Literature (1993).|$|E
500|$|Sheep {{may fall}} victim to poisons, {{infectious}} diseases, and physical injuries. As a prey species, a sheep's system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators. However, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally listless. Throughout history, {{much of the money}} and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments. Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm. In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use. However, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions. [...] In the US, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 530. [...] In the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as homeopathy, <b>herbalism</b> and even traditional Chinese medicine to treat sheep veterinary problems. Despite some favorable anecdotal evidence, the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in scientific journals. The need for traditional anti-parasite drugs and antibiotics is widespread, and is the main impediment to certified organic farming with sheep.|$|E
