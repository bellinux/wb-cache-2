2500|$|Contracts between {{companies}} and third parties, however, {{may turn out}} to be unenforceable on ordinary principles of agency law if the director or employee obviously exceeded their authority. As a general rule, third parties need not be concerned with constitutional details conferring power among directors or employees, which may only be found by laboriously searching the register at Companies House. In general, if a third party acts in good faith, then any contract, even one going beyond the constitutional authority of the director or employee with whom they strike a deal, is valid. However, if it would appear to a reasonable person that a company employee would not have the authority to enter an agreement, then the contract is voidable at the company's instance so long as there is no equitable bar to rescission. The third party would have a claim against the (probably less solvent) employee instead. First, an agent may have <b>express</b> <b>actual</b> <b>authority,</b> in which case there is no problem. Her actions will be attributed to the company. Second, an agent may have implied actual authority (also sometimes called [...] "usual" [...] authority), which falls within the usual scope of the employee's office. Third, an agent may have [...] "apparent authority" [...] (also called [...] "ostensible" [...] authority) as it would appear to a reasonable person, creating an estoppel. If the actions of a company employee have authority deriving from a company constitution in none of these ways, a third party will only have recourse for breach of an obligation (a warrant of authority) against the individual agent, and not to the company as the principal. The Companies Act 2006 section 40 makes clear that directors are always deemed to be free of limitations on their authority under the constitution, unless a third party acting in callous bad faith takes advantage of a company whose director acts outside the scope of authority. For employees down the chain of delegation, it becomes less and less likely that a reasonable contracting party would think big transactions will have had authority. For instance, it would be unlikely that a bank cashier would have the authority to sell the bank's Canary Wharf skyscraper.|$|E

5000|$|Implied actual {{authority}}, {{also called}} [...] "usual authority", is authority an agent has {{by virtue of}} being reasonably necessary to carry out his express authority. As such, it can be inferred by virtue of a position held by an agent. For example, partners have authority to bind the other partners in the firm, their liability being joint and several, and in a corporation, all executives and senior employees with decision-making authority by virtue of their position have authority to bind the corporation.Other forms of implied actual authority include customary authority. This is where customs of a trade imply the agent to have certain powers. Wool buying industries it is customary for traders to purchase in their own names.Also incidental authority, where an agent is supposed to have any authority to complete other task which is necessary and incidental to completing the <b>express</b> <b>actual</b> <b>authority.</b> This must be no more than necessary ...|$|E
5000|$|Lord Denning MR {{held that}} he did have authority, but it was <b>actual</b> <b>authority</b> because (like a [...] "course of dealing" [...] in {{contract}} law) {{the fact that the}} board had let Mr Richards continue to act had in fact created <b>actual</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Toward {{the outside}} world, {{the acts of}} directors, {{officers}} and other employees will be binding on the corporation depending {{on the law of}} agency and principles of vicarious liability (or respondeat superior). It used to be that the common law recognized constraints on the total capacity of the corporation. If a director or employee acted beyond the purposes or powers of the corporation (ultra vires), any contract would be ex ante void and unenforceable. This rule was abandoned in the earlier 20th century, and today corporations generally have unlimited capacity and purposes. However, not all actions by corporate agents are binding. For instance, in South Sacramento Drayage Co v Campbell Soup Co it was held that a traffic manager who worked for the Campbell Soup Company did not (unsurprisingly) have authority to enter a 15-year exclusive dealing contract for intrastate hauling of tomatoes. Standard principles of commercial agency apply ("apparent authority"). If a reasonable person would not think that an employee (given his or her position and role) has authority to enter a contract, then the corporation cannot be bound. However, corporations can always expressly confer greater authority on officers and employees, and so will be bound if the contracts give <b>express</b> or implied <b>actual</b> <b>authority.</b> The treatment of liability for contracts and other consent based obligations, however, differs to torts and other wrongs. Here the objective of the law to ensure the internalization of [...] "externalities" [...] or [...] "enterprise risks" [...] is generally seen to cast a wider scope of liability.|$|R

Though retaining its legal position as under the republic, in practice, however, the <b>actual</b> <b>authority</b> of the imperial senate was negligible, as the emperor held the true power in the state. As such, membership in the senate became sought after by individuals seeking prestige and social standing, rather than <b>actual</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Actual</b> <b>authority</b> {{can be of}} two kinds. Either the {{principal}} may have expressly conferred authority on the agent, or authority may be implied.

5000|$|In law, {{apparent}} authority {{refers to the}} authority of an agent as it appears to others, and it can operate both to enlarge <b>actual</b> <b>authority</b> and to create <b>authority</b> where no <b>actual</b> <b>authority</b> exists. [...] The law relating to companies and to ostensible authority are in reality only a sub-set of the rules relating to {{apparent authority}} and the law of agency generally, but because of the prevalence of the issue in relation to corporate law (companies, being artificial persons, are only ever able to act at all through their human agents), it has developed its own specific body of case law. However, some jurisdictions use the terms interchangeably.|$|R
25|$|In 1229, the Consiglio dei Pregadi or Senate, was formed, being 60 members {{elected by}} the major council. These {{developments}} left the doge with little personal power and put <b>actual</b> <b>authority</b> {{in the hands of}} the Great Council.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and South Africa, {{apparent}} authority (also called [...] "ostensible authority") {{relates to the}} doctrines {{of the law of}} agency. It is relevant particularly in corporate law and constitutional law. Apparent authority refers to a situation where a reasonable third party would understand that an agent had authority to act. This means a principal is bound by the agent's actions, even if the agent had no <b>actual</b> <b>authority,</b> whether <b>express</b> or implied. It raises an estoppel because the third party is given an assurance, which he relies on and would be inequitable for the principal to deny the authority given. Apparent authority can legally be found, even if <b>actual</b> <b>authority</b> has not been given.|$|R

25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman Republic, the {{constitutional}} balance of power shifted from the Roman Senate to the Roman Emperor.

As such, membership in the senate became sought after by individuals seeking prestige and social standing, rather than <b>actual</b> <b>authority.</b> During the reigns of the first emperors, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers were all transferred from the Roman assemblies to the senate. However, since the control that the emperor held over the senate was absolute, the senate acted as a vehicle through which the emperor exercised his autocratic powers.|$|R
