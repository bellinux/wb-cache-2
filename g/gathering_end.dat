The voting rights were given only to males of certain wealth.

However, due to political disagreements over the autonomy for Lithuania, the <b>gathering</b> <b>ended</b> without a joint resolution. Each nationality created their own resolution. The Lithuanians gathered 230 signatures in support of their project, sent it the Russian Union for Women's Equality, and were invited to the All-Russian Women's Congress.

40|$|Aim. This article {{deals with}} the methods of {{reducing}} pollution at major repairs (renovation) of urban buildings. Methods. On the basis of field and theoretical studies we received empirical dependences and characteristic curves of the amounts of: construction waste, total emissions into the atmosphere, the cost of capital repairs (reconstruction) with calculated construction volumes and technical condition of constructions. These graphic and empirical regularities prove the connection {{of the amount of}} construction waste and total emissions to the atmosphere with the technical condition of the building during reconstructions. Results. The developed method of reducing environmental pollution during reconstruction of buildings in urban areas includes 5 stages starting from information <b>gathering</b> <b>ending</b> with reusing construction waste. Preliminary forecasting and assessment of major repairs (reconstruction) is possible while making calculations by derived formulas. For planning of measures to reduce pollution we have developed a scheme for treatment of construction wastes and offered alternatives for their use. Conclusions. The use of construction waste, produced during major repairs (renovation) of urban buildings, as secondary raw materials, reduces environmental pollution.  </p...|$|R
40|$|System {{development}} has been an innovational trend {{in the field of}} Information systems in both past and present time; and users of the system {{is one of the key}} success in the development life cycle of human and computer based systems. Information system is one of the most emerging technologies in developing countries; Nigeria as a case and the development of these IS is deployed in both private and public sectors of the economy for organizational data management. Due to some characteristics of developing countries such as poor communication facilities, unequal distribution of wealth, large population and so many others, many of these information system {{development has}} been carried out for the provision of services to both public and private organizations. But on the other hand, such projects have failed in one way or the other due to poor end user involvement in or during the development process. For this research, the involvement of users in developing country and more appropriate concepts which developers/designer could possibly use to involve users for a successful system were studied. The approach to this investigation was with the use of questionnaire which was distributed to the users of two different systems which were developed using different concepts of user involvement (Scenario-based user involvement technique and Interview-based user involvement technique). Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), was used for this quantitative analysis and the Independent t-test analysis was done to prove the significance between these systems. The findings from this study shows that in the developing countries such as Nigeria, these concepts of user involvement is also applicable and Interview-based user involvement technique seem to be the more appropriate method. Further research on the combination of these concepts/techniques for end user involvement should be considered or rather the creation of an advanced technique/concept for <b>gathering</b> <b>end</b> user needs and requirements for an excellent usable system in developing countries with respect to their limiting factors as mentioned in this thesis...|$|E
5000|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809) Harrison {{purchased}} an estimated 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²) of land, now a part of present-day Illinois and Indiana, from the Miami. The Shawnee, who {{were not included in the}} negotiations, inhabited the western tract of land that the Miami ceded to the federal government sold were angered by its terms, but Harrison refused to rescind the treaty. In August 1810 Harrison and the Shawnee leader Tecumseh met at Grouseland to discuss the continued conflict. Tecumseh bitterly complained about the land ceded to the federal government. Speaking through an interpreter, Tecumseh argued: [...] "The Great Spiirit has given them as common property to all the Indians, and that they could not, nor should not be sold without the sent of all." [...] The <b>gathering</b> <b>ended</b> without a resolution, as did a subsequent meeting in 1811. This disagreement escalated into an armed conflict, calledTecumseh's War. The final blow that destroyed the Indian confederacy took place at the Battle of the Thames in Ontario, Canada, where Tecumseh was killed in 1813.|$|R
