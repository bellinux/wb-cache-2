40|$|Abstract — Virtual physics environments are {{becoming}} increasingly popular as a teaching tool for high school level mechanical physics. While useful, these tools often offer a complex user interface, lacking the intuitive nature of the traditional whiteboard. Furthermore, the systems are often too advanced {{to be used by}} novice students for further experimentation. In this paper we describe a physics learning environment using multicolour sketch recognition techniques on digital whiteboards. The recognition system is based on a combination of Support Vector Machines and rule based methods. By assigning the various drawing modes to different physical <b>drawing</b> <b>pens,</b> we can resolve several ambiguities appearing in single pen sketching interfaces. Moreover, we argue that we can reduce the cognitive load of the user by exploiting the physical realisation of drawing modes in the form of <b>drawing</b> <b>pens,</b> instead of using textual descriptions of the modes on the screen. The system was tested using a constructive interaction method, with users completing a set task; first in a multi-pen drawing environment, and then for comparison purposes in a singlepen equivalent.

40|$|AbstractLet Π={u,d,r,l} be the chain-code picture {{alphabet}} {{such that}} u(d,r,l) denotes the graphics command {{to move the}} <b>drawing</b> <b>pen</b> up (down, right, left) in the 2 D Cartesian plane. It is known that the picture membership problem can be solved in polynomial time for each context-free language over {u,d,r} and is NP-complete for a so-called retreat-bounded regular (or reversal-bounded linear) language over Π. Imposing both retreat and reversal bounds on languages over Π results in the leftmove-bounded languages whose words describe pictures by making {{no more than a}} bounded number of left moves. The picture membership problem can be solved in polynomial time for each leftmove-bounded context-free language over Π and is NP-complete for a leftmove-unbounded (but retreat-bounded) linear language over {u,d,lr}. There exists a context-sensitive language over {u,d,r} (or {u,d,lr}) for which the picture membership problem is undecidable...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} graphic {{methods of}} presentation of ideas'in {{the creation of}} architectural forms'and evolution of these methods, determined by the implementations of information technology. Drawings have been the main medium of expression since Leonardo da Vinci to the present-day. Graphic communication has always been treated as a main design tool, both - at the ending stage of design and at the early design stage. Implementation of computers in design doe not change this situation. The entire design process proceeds in a traditional way. While searching for the idea we use hand sketches and, after this, technical drawings are draught on a plotter, which replaces a <b>drawing</b> <b>pen.</b> Using computers at the early design stages encounters serious difficulties. The main thesis {{of this paper is}} that hardware and software inadequacy is not the problem, the problem is in the inadequacy of the design methods. This problem is to be reconceived as what a person can do with a program, rather than what is the capacity of a program. Contemporary computer techniques allow us to put an equation mark between the searching for idea, visualisation and its realisation in virtual space. This paper presents Sketching by scanning - an experimental method of using computer hardware and software for stimulating of searching of architectural's form...|$|E
40|$|To {{combine the}} {{affordance}} {{of paper and}} computers, prior research has proposed numerous interactive paper systems that link specific paper document content to digital operations such as multimedia playback and proofreading. Yet, it remains unclear to what degree these systems bridge the inherent gap between paper and computers when compared to existing paper-only and computer-only interfaces. In particular, given the special properties of paper, such as limited dynamic feedback, how well does an average novice user learn to master an interactive paper system? What factors affect the user performance? And how does the paper interface work in a typical use scenario? To answer these questions, we conducted two empirical experiments on a generic pen-gesture-based command system, called PapierCraft [Liao, et al., 2008], for paper-based interfaces. With PapierCraft, people can select sections of printed documents and issue commands such as copy and paste, linking and in-text search. The first experiment focused on the user performance of <b>drawing</b> <b>pen</b> gestures on paper. It proves that users can learn the command system in about 30 minutes and achieve a performance comparable to a Table PC-based interface supporting the same gestures. The second experiment examined {{the application of the}} command system in active reading tasks. The results show promise for seamless integration of paper and computers in active reading for their combined affordance. In addition, our study reveals some key design issues, such as the pen form factor and feedback of gestures. This paper contributes to better understanding on pros and cons of paper and computers, and sheds light on the design of future interfaces for document interaction...|$|E
