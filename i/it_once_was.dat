Issues involving Taiwan, the Spratly Islands, and concerns of expanding Chinese influence, however, still encourage a degree of caution. Recent foreign policy has been mostly about economic relations with its Southeast Asian and Asia-Pacific neighbors.|$|E

5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} {{organized}} at Monte Ne under {{the sponsorship of}} the Benton County Baptist Association {{as a result of}} a series of revival meetings conducted there. The Monte Ne Baptist Church is still active. For a time in the summer of 1946, the Rogers Intermediate Girl Scouts held a camp at the Hotel Frances (old Hotel Monte Ne). Although it was not as active as <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> the old filling station and store in downtown Monte Ne continued to serve the local population.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{there were}} only 200 parrots in the wild, and in 1975 the {{population}} reached an absolute low of 13 individuals. Numbers then recovered, and in August 1989 there were an estimated minimum of 47 individuals. But on September 18, 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico inflicting heavy casualties on the remaining birds. In {{the aftermath of the}} hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals. In 2004, the wild population was 30–35 individuals, and the long-term trend appears to be stable albeit with some fluctuations. The current range of the species is , 0.2% of what <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
5|$|Expansion of the {{population}} and settlements in the county continued during the Tudor and more recent periods. Agriculture and coal mining expanded until the 18th century, although other industries declined during the industrial revolution. In modern times {{the population}} has grown, particularly in the seaside towns, notably Weston-super-Mare. Agriculture continues to be a major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture cider, although the acreage of apple orchards is less than <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E

5|$|The cattle {{industry}} continued to thrive though it gradually became less profitable. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various {{regions of the}} state. Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce between Texas {{and the rest of}} the U.S. ({{and the rest of the}} world) expanded. As with some other states before, the lumber industry quickly decimated the forests of Texas such that by the early 20th century the major of the forest population in Texas was gone (later conservation efforts restored some of it but never to the level <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was part}} of a cavalry force commanded by General Averell that pursued Confederate Generals McCausland and Bradley Johnson after the rebels burned the Pennsylvania community of Chambersburg. After multiple skirmishes and Confederate threats to burn more towns, McCausland's two brigades of cavalry were caught in Moorefield, West Virginia. In a surprise attack at dawn on August 6, 1864, Averell captured over 400 Confederates. This ruined General Early's cavalry, and it was never again the dominant force <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> In this battle, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was held in reserve while five other regiments attacked two rebel camps. Colonel Powell directed portions of the attack.|$|E
5|$|The volcano's {{observed}} {{history has}} mostly {{been one of}} effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the first Europeans on the island, Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, it is not as intense as <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.|$|E

5|$|Activision Publishing chief {{executive}} Mike Griffith, {{in response to}} questions about Activision's approach to the Guitar Hero market, noted that Guitar Hero continues to outsell the Rock Band series in both number of sales and revenue, with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on the market, and considered the market acceptance of the multiple games as validation for their model. Regardless, after releasing 25 different SKUs (between games and bundle packages) in 2009, Activision opted to reduce that number to 10 in 2010, recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable as <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> Activision later opted to put future development of the series on hold in early 2011 citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre, a move that many journalists attributed to Activision's earlier oversaturation.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from boxing, a decision forced on {{him by his}} ailing knee, Dyer focused on his theatre appearances. His voice though, was not as <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was,</b> and he strained to reach the higher notes of his range and bookings began to dry up. Dyer then refocussed on boxing, but this time as a manager. In the 1920s he moved to London, where he set himself up as a physical culture expert and ran a small stable of fighters. The three fighters training under him were Bristolians George Rose and Reggie Hobbs and most notably Bert Kirby from Birmingham. Kirby {{went on to become}} the British flyweight champion when he took the title from Jackie Brown in 1930. Dyer also ran a gym for gentleman on the Strand, which was used by fighters such as Bantamweight champion Teddy Baldock and American Packey McFarland who Dyer faced when the two men were boxing instructors in the US Army. The gym was later demolished to make way for a new hotel and Dyer was forced to find a new location.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the river}} reaches the {{outskirts}} of Hull, its course {{is marked by a}} series of bridges, most of which open to allow boats to pass. There are swing bridges, lift bridges and bascule bridges, and the river becomes part of the Port of Hull. The river, which is the dividing line between West and East Hull, bisects the city's industrial area. The bridges can cause traffic delays during high tides, though river traffic is less than <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> The Beverley and Barmston Drain rejoins the river above Scott Street Bridge. Below North Bridge, an unused dry dock on the west bank marks the former entrance to Queens Dock. Below Drypool Bridge, a muddy basin on the east bank was once the entrance to Drypool Basin and Victoria Dock. The river reaches its confluence with the Humber estuary in the centre of Kingston upon Hull. At its mouth, a tidal barrier has been constructed to prevent tidal surges from entering the river. In the past, these had regularly flooded the town and the flat countryside to the north.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota is {{relatively}} notable for {{its lack of}} large urban centers. Sioux Falls, the largest city in the state, only ranks as the 152nd largest in the country, and the state's third-largest city, Aberdeen, {{has a population of}} less than 25,000. However, because the population in many rural areas has decreased over the last 50 years, and many cities in the state have grown at a rapid pace; the population has become more concentrated and less rural than <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was.</b> According to 2007 census estimates, the three most populous counties in the state, Minnehaha, Pennington, and Lincoln, were home to 38.8% of South Dakotans, while in 1910, those counties held only 9.3% of the population.|$|E
5|$|Thedas is a {{world in}} which race and class combine to {{determine}} social class. Elves are often viewed as second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are treated with respect. Mages, on the other hand, are cloistered by the Chantry: they have access to the Fade, the unconscious realm that is the home of spirits, and a single lapse in vigilance could cause them to be possessed by demons. Apostate mages, who live outside the Chantry's control, are considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them by any means necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what <b>it</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.|$|E
