40|$|AbstractAn <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> a graph {{in which}} {{the number of new}} cases of an {{outbreak}} disease is plotted against time. Epidemic curves are ordinarily constructed after the disease outbreak is over. However, a good estimate of the epidemic curve early in an outbreak would be invaluable to health care officials. Currently, techniques for predicting the severity of an outbreak are very limited. As far as predicting the number of future cases, ordinarily epidemiologists simply make an educated guess as to how many people might become affected. We develop a model for estimating an epidemic curve early in an outbreak, and we show results of experiments testing its accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the infection curve of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) using the back projection method {{and to assess}} the effectiveness of interventions. Design: Statistical method. Data: The daily reported number of SARS and interventions taken by Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) up to 24 June 2003 are used. Method: To use a back projection technique to construct the infection curve of SARS in Hong Kong. The estimated <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> studied to identify the major events and to assess the effectiveness of interventions {{over the course of the}} epidemic. Results: The SARS infection curve in Hong Kong is constructed for the period 1 March 2003 to 24 June 2003. Some interventions seem to be effective while others apparently have little or no effect. The infections among the medical and health workers are high. Conclusions: Quarantine of the close contacts of confirmed and suspected SARS cases seems to be the most effective intervention against spread of SARS in the community. Thorough disinfection of the infected area against environmental hazards is helpful. Infections within hospitals can be reduced by better isolation measures and protective equipments. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract To better {{describe}} the epidemiology of influenza at local level, {{the time course of}} pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) 2009 {{in the city}} of Hong Kong was reconstructed from notification data after decomposition procedure and time series analysis. GIS (geographic information system) methodology was incorporated for assessing spatial variation. Between May and September 2009, a total of 24415 cases were successfully geocoded, out of 25473 (95. 8 %) reports in the original dataset. The reconstructed <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> <b>was</b> characterized by a small initial peak, a nadir followed by rapid rise to the ultimate plateau. The full course of the epidemic had lasted for about 6 months. Despite the small geographic area of only 1000 Km 2, distinctive spatial variation was observed in the configuration of the curves across 6 geographic regions. With the relatively uniform physical and climatic environment within Hong Kong, the temporo-spatial variability of influenza spread could only be explained by the heterogeneous population structure and mobility patterns. Our study illustrated how an <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> could <b>be</b> reconstructed using regularly collected surveillance data, which would be useful in informing intervention at local levels. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Real-time {{forecasting}} of epidemics, {{especially those}} {{based on a}} likelihood-based approach, is understudied. This study aimed to develop a simple method {{that can be used}} for the real-time epidemic forecasting. Methods A discrete time stochastic model, accounting for demographic stochasticity and conditional measurement, was developed and applied as a case study to the weekly incidence of pandemic influenza (H 1 N 1 - 2009) in Japan. By imposing a branching process approximation and by assuming the linear growth of cases within each reporting interval, the <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> <b>is</b> predicted using only two parameters. The uncertainty bounds of the forecasts are computed using chains of conditional offspring distributions. Results The quality of the forecasts made before the epidemic peak appears largely to depend on obtaining valid parameter estimates. The forecasts of both weekly incidence and final epidemic size greatly improved at and after the epidemic peak with all the observed data points falling within the uncertainty bounds. Conclusions Real-time forecasting using the discrete time stochastic model with its simple computation of the uncertainty bounds was successful. Because of the simplistic model structure, the proposed model has the potential to additionally account for various types of heterogeneity, time-dependent transmission dynamics and epidemiological details.

WNV mosquito cases in seven months (April-October) of the six years (2002 – 2007) were collected in Indianapolis, USA. <b>Epidemic</b> <b>curves</b> <b>were</b> plotted to identify the temporal outbreaks of WNV. Spatial-temporal analysis and k-mean cluster analysis were further applied to determine the high-risk areas. Finally, the relationship between environmental variables and WNV outbreaks were examined by using Discriminant Analysis. Results The results show that the WNV <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> reached its peak in August for all years in the study area except in 2007, where the peak was reached in July. WNV dissemination started from the central longitudinal corridor of the city and spread out to the east and west. Different years and seasons had different high-risk areas, but the southwest and southeast corners show the highest risk for WNV infection due to their high percentages of agriculture and water sources. Conclusion Major environmental factors contributing to the outbreak of WNV in Indianapolis were the percentages of agriculture and water, total length of streams, and total size of wetlands. This study provides important information for urban public health prevention and management. It also contributes to the optimization of mosquito control and arrangement of future sampling efforts. </p...|$|R

All individuals participating in the campaign had infections confirmed by laboratory analysis, allowing for the identification of asymptomatic cases and those with an unreported date of fever onset.

Our model also indicates that the infection was more widespread within the population on the reported epidemic start date. We show that the exclusion of asymptomatic cases and cases with undocumented onset dates can lead to an underestimation of the reproduction number which, in turn, could negatively impact control strategies implemented by public health authorities.

Data on Influenza Like Illness (ILI) provided by CDC was used to validate the capability of IPAS system, with plans to expand to other illnesses in the future. This paper presents the ILI prediction modeling results as well as IPAS system features...|$|R

Health workers reported an increased number of diarrhea cases at Haibatpur village on June 17, 2012. This outbreak was investigated with the following objectives: to confirm the existence of diarrhea outbreak, {{to find out the}} risk factors, and propose control measures. Cases were listed; spot map and <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> <b>were</b> drawn. Attack rate was calculated by age and sex and risk factors were found out by calculating odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Rectal swabs were taken and water specimens were collected for laboratory test. Forty-one cases of patients were identified with overall attack rate (AR) was 5 % (41 / 780). AR among men was higher 6 % (25 / 404) than women. There was no death. V. cholerae 01 Eltor Ogawa was isolated from one (1 / 4) stool specimen. Spot map showed cases clustered around two ponds which were contaminated with coliform organisms. The underground water was a bit saline in nature. Using pond water for preparation of fermented rice (Panta Bhat) (OR 4. 73, 95 % CI 1. 69 – 13. 51), washing utensil in pond water (OR 7. 31, 95 % CI 1. 77 – 42. 29) were associated with cholera outbreak. Health education was done to villagers. Disinfection of two ponds with bleaching powder was done. We proposed supplying of safe drinking water and repairing defective deep tube well to village. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: A large {{epidemic}} of cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae, serotype Ogawa, has been ongoing in Yemen, 2017. To {{improve the situation}} awareness, the present study aimed to forecast the cholera epidemic, explicitly addressing the reporting delay and ascertainment bias. Methods: Using weekly incidence of suspected cases, updated as a revised <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> every week, the reporting delay was explicitly incorporated into the estimation model. Using the weekly case fatality risk as calculated by the World Health Organization, ascertainment bias was adjusted, enabling us to parameterize the family of logistic curves (i. e., logistic and generalized logistic models) for describing the unbiased incidence in 2017. Results: The cumulative incidence {{at the end of}} the epidemic, was estimated at 790, 778 (95 % CI: 700, 495, 914, 442) cases and 767, 029 (95 % CI: 690, 877, 871, 671) cases, respectively, by using logistic and generalized logistic models. It was also estimated that we have just passed through the epidemic peak by week 26, 2017. From week 27 onwards, the weekly incidence was predicted to decrease. Conclusions: Cholera epidemic in Yemen, 2017 was predicted to soon start to decrease. If the weekly incidence is reported in the up-to-the-minute manner and updated in later weeks, not a single data point but the entire <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> must <b>be</b> precisely updated...|$|R
40|$|We used {{geographic}} information systems {{to characterize the}} dynamic change in spatial distribution of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Beijing, People’s Republic of China. The seasonal variation in its incidence was observed by creating an <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve.</b> HFRS <b>was</b> associated with developed land, orchards, and rice paddies. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne disease caused by hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae), is characterized by fever, acute renal dysfunction, and hemorrhage manifestations. Various rodent species are natural hosts and serve as sources of infection (1). Humans usually acquire hantavirus infection by contact with or inhalation of aerosols or excreta from infected rodents (2, 3). In the People’s Republic of China, HFRS is caused mainly by 2 types of hantaviruses, Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), {{each of which has}} coevolved with a distinct rodent host. HTNV is associated with Apodemus agrarius, whereas SEOV, which causes a less severe form of HFRS, is associated with Rattus norvegicus. Although HFRS infection has long been recognized in many places throughout mainland China, HFRS was first reported in metropolitan Beijing in 1997. Sinc...|$|R
40|$|Undiagnosed infections {{accounted}} for the hidden proportion of HIV cases that have escaped from public health surveillance. To assess the population risk of HIV transmission, we estimated the undiagnosed interval of each known infection for constructing the HIV incidence curves. We used modified back-calculation methods to estimate the seroconversion year for each diagnosed patient attending {{any one of the}} 3 HIV specialist clinics in Hong Kong. Three approaches were used, depending on the adequacy of CD 4 data: (A) estimating one's pre-treatment CD 4 depletion rate in multilevel model;(B) projecting one's seroconversion year by referencing seroconverters' CD 4 depletion rate; or (C) projecting from the distribution of estimated undiagnosed intervals in (B). Factors associated with long undiagnosed interval (> 2 years) were examined in univariate analyses. <b>Epidemic</b> <b>curves</b> constructed from estimated seroconversion data were evaluated by modes of transmission. Between 1991 and 2010, a total of 3695 adult HIV patients were diagnosed. The undiagnosed intervals were derived from method (A) (28 %), (B) (61 %) and (C) (11 %) respectively. The intervals ranged from 0 to 10 years, and were shortened from 2001. Heterosexual infection, female, Chinese and age > 64 at diagnosis were associated with long undiagnosed interval. Overall, the peaks of the new incidence <b>curves</b> <b>were</b> reached 4 - 6 years ahead of reported diagnoses, while their contours varied by mode of transmission. Characteristically, the epidemic growth of heterosexual male and female declined after 1998 with slight rebound in 2004 - 2006, but that of MSM continued to rise after 1998. By determining the time of seroconversion, HIV <b>epidemic</b> <b>curves</b> could <b>be</b> reconstructed from clinical data to better illustrate the trends of new infections. With the increasing coverage of antiretroviral therapy, the undiagnosed interval can add to the measures for assessing HIV transmission risk in the population...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} two sequential {{outbreaks of}} measles in seven villages of Kangra, {{to confirm the}} diagnosis and to formulate recommendations for prevention and control. Methods: We defined a case of measles as occurrence of fever with rash in a child aged six months to 17 years during the period 3 rd September to 23 rd November 2006. We collected information on age, sex, residence, date of onset, symptoms, signs, treatment taken, traveling history and vaccination status. We described the outbreak by time, place and person. We estimated vaccine coverage and efficacy in the affected villages. We confirmed diagnosis clinically, serologically and through genotyping of the virus. Results: We identified 69 cases. Overall attack rates ranged between 4. 2 % and 6 %. All case patients were between 6 years to 11 years of age. Age-specific attack rate in double outbreaks ranged in between 1. 7 % and 21. 6 %, the highest being in the age range 11 - 17 years. No deaths or complications <b>were</b> reported. The <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> <b>was</b> suggestive of typical propagated pattern. The first outbreak imported virus after an interschool game competition (relative risk, 6. 44 %; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 81 - 10. 91); followed by the second outbreak, in which people exchanged foods in the festival in one infected village of the first outbreak (relative risk, 5. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 90 - 14. 77; P <. 001). The calculated immunization coverage (93 %) coincided nearly with administrative claims. The vaccine efficacies were estimated to be 85 % and 81 % {{in the first and}} second outbreaks respectively. Eleven of the 16 case patients were tested for measles IgM antibodies, while two nasopharyngeal swabs were positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and are genotyped D 4 measles strain. Vitamin A supplementations were only given in four villages. Conclusion: Measles outbreaks were confirmed in high-immunization-coverage areas. We recommended (i) second dose opportunity for measles in Himachal Pradesh and (ii) vitamin A supplementation to all the case patients...|$|R
40|$|Background Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a {{zoonotic}} arbovirosis {{for which}} the primary hosts are domestic livestock (cattle, sheep and goats). RVF was first described in South Africa in 1950 – 1951. Mechanisms for short and long distance transmission have been hypothesised, {{but there is little}} supporting evidence. Here we describe RVF occurrence and spatial distribution in South Africa in 2008 – 11, and investigate the presence of a contagious process in order to generate hypotheses on the different mechanisms of transmission. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 658 cases were extracted from World Animal Health Information Database. Descriptive statistics, <b>epidemic</b> <b>curves</b> and maps <b>were</b> produced. The space-time K-function was used to test for evidence of space-time interaction. Five RVF outbreak waves (one in 2008, two in 2009, one in 2010 and one in 2011) of varying duration, location and size were reported. About 70...|$|R
40|$|When an {{outbreak}} of an infectious disease occurs, public health officials {{need to understand the}} dynamics of disease transmission in order to launch an effective response. Two quantities that are often used to describe transmission are the basic reproductive number and the distribution of the serial interval. The basic reproductive number, R 0, is the average number of secondary cases a primary case will infect, assuming a completely susceptible population. The serial interval (SI) provides a measure of temporality, and is defined as the time between symptom onset between a primary case and its secondary case. Investigators typically collect outbreak data {{in the form of an}} <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> that displays the number of cases by each day (or other time scale) of the outbreak. Occasionally the <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> data <b>is</b> more expansive and includes demographic or other information. A contact trace sample may also be collected, which is based on a sample of the cases that have their contact patterns traced to determine the timing and sequence of transmission. In addition, numerous large scale social mixing surveys have been administered in recent years to collect information about contact patterns and infection rates among different age groups. These are readily available and are sometimes used to account for population heterogeneity. In this dissertation, we modify the methods presented in White and Pagano (2008) to account for additional data beyond the <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve</b> to estimate R 0 and SI. We present two approaches that incorporate these data through the use of a Bayesian framework. First, we consider informing the prior distribution of the SI with contact trace data and examine implications of combining data that are in conflict. The second approach extends the first approach to account for heterogeneity in the estimation of R 0. We derive a modification to the White and Pagano likelihood function and utilize social mixing surveys to inform the prior distributions of R 0. Both approaches are assessed through a simulation study and are compared to alternative approaches, and are applied to real outbreak data from the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and Singapore, and the influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009 pdm outbreak in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Background: Influenza causes annual {{epidemics}} {{and often}} results in extensive outbreaks in closed communities. To minimize transmission, a range of interventions have been suggested. For these to be effective, an accurate and timely diagnosis of influenza is required. This is confirmed by a positive laboratory test result in an individual whose symptoms are consistent with a predefined clinical case definition. However, the utility of these clinical case definitions and laboratory testing in mass gathering outbreaks remains unknown. Methods and Results: An influenza outbreak was identified during World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney. From the data collected on pilgrims presenting to a single clinic, a Markov model was developed and validated against the actual <b>epidemic</b> <b>curve.</b> Simulations <b>were</b> performed to examine the utility of different clinical case definitions and laboratory testing strategies for containment of influenza outbreaks. Clinical case definitions {{were found to have}} the greatest impact on averting further cases with no added benefit when combined with any laboratory test. Although nucleic acid testing (NAT) demonstrated higher utility than indirect immunofluorescence antigen or on-site point-of-care testing, this effect was lost when laboratory NAT turnaround times was included. The main benefit of laboratory confirmation was limited to identification of true influenza cases amenable to interventions such as antiviral therapy. Conclusions: Continuous re-evaluation of case definitions and laboratory testing strategies are essential for effectiv...|$|R
