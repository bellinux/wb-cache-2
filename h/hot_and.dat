5|$|All cacti {{have some}} adaptations to promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> dry environments (i.e. they are xerophytes), {{but the first}} ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, where water conservation is less important.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle {{stated in}} the History of Animals that all beings were {{arranged}} in a fixed scale of perfection, reflected in their form (eidos). They stretched from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the scala naturae or great chain of being. His system had eleven grades, arranged according to the potentiality of each being, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals gave birth to warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. The system was based on Aristotle's interpretation of the four elements in his On Generation and Corruption: Fire (<b>hot</b> <b>and</b> dry); Air (<b>hot</b> <b>and</b> wet); Water (cold and wet); and Earth (cold and dry). These are arranged from the most energetic to the least, so the warm, wet young raised in a womb with a placenta were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds. However, Aristotle is careful never to insist that a group fits perfectly in the scale; he knows animals have many combinations of attributes, and that placements are approximate.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires {{is located}} in the humid {{subtropical}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). Due to the maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, its climate is temperate with extreme temperatures (both <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> cold) being rare. Thus, cold air coming directly from the south are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and warmer than winds from the southwest (which are not moderated by it).|$|E
5|$|Deserts, both <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> cold, {{play a part}} in moderating the Earth's temperature. This {{is because}} they reflect more of the {{incoming}} light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the sea.|$|E

5|$|Lawton {{lies in a}} dry {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with frequent variations in weather daily, except during the constantly <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> dry summer months. Frequent strong winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help to lessen the hotter weather. Northerly winds during the winter can occasionally intensify cold periods.|$|E
5|$|Magnesium-poor adakites {{have been}} found at Monte Burney. Fueguino {{volcanic}} rocks also include adakites but these are richer in magnesium. These adakitic magmas reflect the subduction of a relatively <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> young Antarctic Plate. In the case of Monte Burney, these magmas then underwent some fractionation during ascent, as it was retarded by the tectonic regimen, which is somewhat compressive.|$|E
