Sliding {{friction and}} wear tests {{were carried out}} in a special tribometer assembled on CA 6140 turning lathe to investigate the friction and wear morphology between hydrogenated titanium alloys and WC-Co cemented carbides.

Cluster-I consisted of a low <b>friction</b> <b>area</b> in which the DLC film was effective, while cluster-II consisted of a high <b>friction</b> <b>area</b> in which the lubricating effect of the DLC film was lost. The friction durability of the films was evaluated by statistical cluster analysis. Extremely thin FCVA-DLC films exhibited an excellent wear resistance at room temperature, but their friction durability was decreased at high temperatures. In contrast, the durability of the P-CVD-DLC films was increased at high temperatures when compared with that observed at room temperature. This inverse dependence on temperature corresponded to the nano-friction results obtained by atomic force microscopy. The decrease in the friction durability of the FCVA-DLC films at high temperatures, was caused by a complex effect of temperature and friction. The tribochemical reaction produced by the P-CVD-DLC films reduced their friction coefficient, increasing their durability at high temperatures...|$|E

The forces that hinder the relative displacement of the mortise and tenon are gradually arising. When the mentioned surfaces are in contact, they start to transfer the occurred normal stress and tangential stress between the mortise and tenon. The interaction conditions of the joint during the pulling-out of the tenon from the mortise are complicated and parts of the contact surface pairs (CSP) can be clearly seen from Fig.  2 b. The Ι type CSP (CSP-Ι) is the most direct contact surface, which represents the <b>friction</b> <b>area</b> between the transverse section of the mortise and the tangential section of the tenon. CSP-ΙΙ, another contact surface existing in the joint area, represents the <b>friction</b> <b>area</b> between the transverse section of the beam and the tangential section of the column.

For A 20 H and thick Z-tetraol-coated disks, the disk surface partially protrudes, and the phase lag (tan⁡δ) increases with friction. This result is consistent with replenishment of the lubricant upon tip sliding. For the D- 4 OH-coated disk, the tan⁡δ value decreases with tip sliding, similar to {{the case for the}} unlubricated disk. The durability of the lubricant-coated magnetic disks was then evaluated by load increase and decrease friction tests. The friction force of the unlubricated disk rapidly increases after approximately 30 reciprocating cycles, regardless of the load. The lubrication state can be estimated by mapping the dependence of friction coefficient on the reciprocating cycle number and load. The friction coefficient can be classified into one of four areas. The lowest <b>friction</b> <b>area</b> constitutes fluid lubrication. The second area constitutes the transition to mixed lubrication. The third area constitutes boundary lubrication.

Analiza polazi od Reynoldsove diferencijalne jednadžbe za podmazivanje u koju je ugrađena poprečna hrapavost trake. U proračunu se uzima u obzir i visina maziva na traci te njezin utjecaj na visinu maziva na ulaznom presjeku zone deformacije. Istraživanja su pokazala da poprečna hrapavost ima dvojak utjecaj na visinu maziva na ulaznome presjeku zone deformacije. Za malu hrapavost trake visina mazivoga sloja ima tendenciju laganoga opadanja u odnosu na nominalnu visinu (kada se proces opisuje glatkoćom površina) da bi dalje s porastom hrapavosti debljina mazivoga sloja rasla.

In {{the paper}} the {{influence}} of transversal roughness of the strip on dressing processes with lubricants is analyzed. The analysis begins with Reynolds differential equation for lubrication, in which transversal roughness of the strip is incorporated. In the estimation, the height of lubricant on the strip is taken into account, {{as well as its}} influence on the height of lubricant at the inlet section of the deformation zone. The research has shown that transversal roughness has a twofold influence on the height of lubricant at the inlet section of the deformation zone. If roughness is small of the strip the height of lubricating layer has a tendency of slight decreasing related to the nominal height (when the process is described by smoothness of surfaces) but with an increase of roughness, the thickness of lubricating layer has a tendency to increase. The nominal height of lubricant is considered to be the case of changing the concave surface into the convex one, which seems to look straight as if the process is described by smoothness of surfaces. Lubricating layer modeling in the <b>friction</b> <b>area</b> on insufficiently lubricated surfaces was also performed.
