500|$|The direct {{impetus for}} the lyrics was an {{encounter}} with IRA supporters in New York City. As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> to keep my voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and he thought I was going to get us killed." ...|$|E

In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless." [...] Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, [...] "I often upset him because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes." [...] Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, [...] "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her." [...] He was not a diligent student of the piano: [...] "My mother <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> to practise, but what ten-year-old wants {{to play the piano}} when he could be out playing football?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{part because}} of public {{misunderstanding}} surrounding gothic aesthetics, people in the goth subculture sometimes suffer prejudice, discrimination, and intolerance. As {{is the case with}} members of various other subcultures and alternative lifestyles, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident. Actress Christina Hendricks talked of being bullied as a goth in school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: [...] "Kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so I never felt pretty. I just always felt awkward". Prejudice moves people into circles of bonding where they share these similar experiences and are accepted. Young goths have to define themselves and learn beauty is an aspect of cultural relativism.|$|E
2500|$|The Egypt Independent {{reported}} that police forces dragged a protester, stripped him naked, {{beat him up}} with batons, {{and took him to}} a security truck. The incident sparked criticism against the administration of Morsi for tolerating the security force's excessive use of force. The presidency said it [...] "was pained by the shocking footage of some policemen treating a protester in a manner that does not accord with human dignity and human rights." [...] State television {{reported that}} the 48-year-old beaten man, from a police hospital and without a lawyer present, said that the police had in fact saved him from thieving protesters. The man's daughter, who says she was present {{at the scene of the}} attack, said that her father is simply [...] "afraid to talk", while his nephew said [...] "he is lying because there is a lot of pressure on him." [...] In new twist, Hamada Saber finally retracted his earlier testimony: [...] "I told [...] today that [...] shot me in the leg, beat me and dragged me," [...] he said. [...] "When I resisted, they tore off my shirt. After I resisted some more, they tore off my pants and underpants. They <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> to stand up and I kept telling them I was injured". [...] "Now my family has disowned me; my wife and kids won't talk to me.

5000|$|Originally from Okinawa, Japan, Caroline Lufkin {{graduated}} from the Berklee School of Music in Boston in 2003. After graduating, she moved to Tokyo and began working on an album. Before signing with her current label, she {{had been working on}} an album in the Japanese music industry where she was being groomed to be a Japanese pop singer. However, she left because of differening in views on her music stating that [...] "they <b>kept</b> on <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> to change things and I didn't want to change them... They were trying to make the music super-pop, and I couldn't quite deal with it." [...] She made ripples across the Japanese pop music scene when she famously walked away from a lucrative major label contract that virtually guaranteed the same kind of bright-light super-stardom that had made her sister Olivia a household name in Tokyo.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking in an {{interview}} about signing the confession, Anthony Steel said: [...] I was young and I'd never had experience of being in custody or anything like that. That pressure builds up on you so much and there's only so much you can take, so to ease that pressure you do something {{to get them off}} your back and that's what I did. They <b>kept</b> intimidating <b>me,</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> what I did that day, and I think I ended up believing what they were <b>telling</b> <b>me.</b> They were saying 'We know you've done it. We've got the proof, we've got the evidence'. I think that, because the case had been going on that long, they were out to get somebody to get it off their books, to put somebody inside. It didn't matter who it was as long as it fitted in some way or they could make it fit in some way and they could put that person inside.|$|R
40|$|No {{matter what}} {{questions}} I asked my first thesis advisor, the response {{always seemed to}} be the same. At the end of an hour or so the blackboard would contain the same few symbols: an “A”, a “B”, maybe even a “C ” if he were feeling particularly effusive. Always there were arrows, some flowing from letter to letter, others curving back on themselves. They indicated con-nections, functions, influences. In spite of my detailed and specific questions, (“Should this really be a minus sign? How does this equation follow from the one above?”) in the end, I knew that his answer would be the same; shaking his head, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> that my worries were just “details ” and then slowly, patiently leading me back to an explanation of symbols and arrows. I kept asking him about all the different trees, he <b>kept</b> trying to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about the forest. Seeing the forest for the trees, that’s how science makes progress and mathematics is no exception. Many, many examples get worked out (the details) and from this a theory slowly emerges, unifying the known example...|$|R
2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly <b>kept</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
