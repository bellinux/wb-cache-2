5|$|In January 1934 the Black Hawks {{were on a}} train back to Chicago when Gardiner felt {{an intense}} pain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> that spread {{to the rest of}} his body, notably his kidneys. When {{questioned}} by Tommy Gorman about his issue, Gardiner lied to Gorman and insisted it was only a minor headache. However, when Gardiner woke up on the train in the morning, he had trouble seeing, as black spots obscured his vision. This was Gardiner's first uremic convulsion.|$|E
5|$|Millburn (Rafe Spall) is a {{biologist}} {{who is a}} part of the Prometheus expedition. After awakening, he tries to become friends with Fifield (who rejects him). Millburn joins the initial expedition to the Engineers' artificial structure concealing the Juggernaut, tagging along with Fifield after he is upset by the number of corpses. Separated from the rest of the expedition, they are stranded in the ship. Millburn and Fifield enter the room containing the thawed black liquid and encounter the Hammerpedes. When Millburn tries to pet one it attacks him, breaking his arm and jumping down his throat. When the crew of the Prometheus returns the next day, they find Millburn's body with the Hammerpede still <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E

5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E

After playing cards at Countess Batthyány's {{on the evening of}} 20 April he {{returned to}} his bed at the Stadtpalais. When his servants arrived to wake him the next morning, 21 April 1736, they found Prince Eugene dead after choking from phlegm <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> presumably after suffering from pneumonia. Eugene's heart was buried with those of others of his family in Turin. His remains were carried in a long procession to St. Stephen's Cathedral, where the body was interred in the Kreuzkapelle.|$|E
25|$|The NCIS {{report said}} that the detainees had rags in their throats.

Because of the gravity of the events, the NCIS said the guards were expected to wait for NCIS investigators to give their statements (this is standard operating procedure (SOP) when criminal actions are possible). The NCIS report notes that numerous guards, detainees and medical personnel attested to seeing the deceased being transferred from the cellblock to the infirmary. Video records of the cellblock (which did not show the interiors of the cells) did not reveal anything amiss.|$|E

He tied it to his saddle and it bit the middle finger {{of his right hand}} and wouldn't let go. A ranch hand pried open the lizard's mouth with a pocketknife, cut open his finger to stimulate bleeding, and then tied saddle strings around his finger and wrist. They summoned Dr. John C.

In accordance with the New Jersey State Constitution, New Jersey Senate President Richard Codey assumed the position of acting governor for the short period from [...] April 12 until May 7, 2007. In 2005, voters had approved {{an amendment to the}} state constitution to provide for a lieutenant governor who would succeed the governor {{in the event of a}} vacancy or assume gubernatorial duties in the event of incapacitation, but that position would not be filled until 2010.|$|E
500|$|Raymond {{took the}} war in Europe seriously enough to {{incorporate}} it into his strips, with Flash returning to Earth in the Spring of 1941. Jungle Jim found himself {{involved in the conflict}} too, fighting in the U.S. Army. Raymond was becoming [...] "restive about doing his duty", a restlessness increased by the knowledge that four of his five brothers were already enlisted. [...] In February 1944, Raymond left King Features and his work on the Sunday Flash Gordon/Jungle Jim pages to join the US Marines, commissioned as a captain and serving in the public-relations arm. Raymond is quoted as stating [...] "I just had to get into this fight...

Rolling Stone critic Charles Young noted that the song could have easily been a joke, but was not since Joey [...] "really puts his guts into these antiquated but beautiful lyrics and pulls it off." [...] "I Wanna Be Sedated" [...] was written by Joey while in the hospital where he was treated for burns {{on his face and}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> The injury was the result of an exploding kettle full of boiling water which served to treat sinuses.

The momentum of the attack subsided. As he {{was taken from the}} field, Longstreet urged Lee to press the attack. Instead, Lee delayed further movement until units could be realigned, giving the Union defenders adequate time to reorganize. The subsequent attack was a failure. Alexander called the removal of Longstreet the critical juncture of the battle: [...] "I have always believed that, but for Longstreet's fall, the panic which was fairly underway in Hancock's [...] Corps would have been extended & have resulted in Grant's being forced to retreat back across the Rapidan." ...|$|E

Edward claimed that he subsequently dug the chest up again. Murrell's personal effects were treated as souvenirs, and several were treated as though they retained magical and supernatural associations for many years after his death. Murrell's [...] "trick" [...] telescope was sold by his son for half-a-guinea; the purchaser was allegedly found dead shortly after with half-a-guinea lodged <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> resulting in claims that the telescope itself brought bad luck onto anyone who possessed it. In 1960, Maple commented that Murrell's whalebone umbrella had been owned by a local undertaker until fairly recently, while he also noted that Murrell's carved chest was in the possession of a woman who lived at Southend-on-Sea.|$|E

500|$|Gates {{involved}} {{himself in}} bettering Port Arthur after losing Tennessee Coal and Iron.

[...] He still had control of the Texas Company and was able to successfully battle Rockefeller's Standard Oil, who would have liked to take over his company's land. In 1909, he was taking his usual summer holiday in Europe when members of the Republican party from the Eastern District of Texas nominated him for Congress. He wired the convention to refuse the nomination, saying that he preferred to participate through his financial contributions. Gates had purchased an animal show and a stable of performing horses with the idea of creating a circus for himself and Port Arthur, when in early 1911, he found a growth <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> The growth was malignant and there were times Gates was hardly able to speak.|$|E
500|$|In early 1950, when.he was 55, Kimball, who {{had never}} smoked or used tobacco, began {{experiencing}} persistent hoarseness and after a physical examination, he underwent a biopsy of a white spot <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> The biopsy caused some brief voice impairment and indicated that Kimball had a throat infection but not cancer. In late 1956, Kimball's hoarseness returned, coupled with occasional bleeding {{in the back of}} his throat. Kimball's physician sent him to New York City to meet with Dr. Hayes Martin (18921977), an expert on cancers of the head and neck. [...] Martin performed another biopsy, which indicated [...] "borderline malignancy," [...] and in early 1957, Martin recommended immediate surgery. Kimball had neglected to seek approval from church president David O. McKay regarding his 1957 biopsy. At the time, the biopsy itself could cause permanent vocal damage. He felt that as an apostle, he should have sought McKay's approval before he underwent surgical procedures that could render him incapable of fulfilling apostolic duties.|$|E

[...] The horse was assigned the number three post position {{in a field of}} ten horses, and was the morning line odds-on favorite at 3–5. Followers noted that Secretariat had also run the 1973 Preakness Stakes from the number three post. The Thursday before the race, California Chrome was observed coughing after his morning gallop, prompting speculation about his health. He had a small blister <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> which he also had prior to the Kentucky Derby, both times treated with a glycerine throat wash.
