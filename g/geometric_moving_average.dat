30|$|The {{elementary}} algorithms use {{simple and}} intuitive concepts. They have many industrial applications, in particular, {{in the quality}} control field. One can cite the Shewart control charts algorithm that was first introduced by Walter Shewhart [16] in 1924. This technique has found many applications in {{improving the quality of}} manufacturing processes [17]. A more efficient method, called ‘the <b>geometric</b> <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> control charts’ algorithm, was proposed later by Roberts in 1965 [18]. This algorithm is also known as the ‘exponentially weighted moving average’ (EWMA) algorithm. Its key idea is to give different weights to the values of the observed process, to detect the change point: the recent values must be given more importance. Another solution presented in the ‘finite moving average’ (FMA) is to ignore very old observations by using a finite set of weights. The filtered derivative algorithm is another elementary algorithm introduced by Basseville and Gasnier [19] in 1981, based on the gradient techniques. It is widely used in the context of image edge detection.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 In {{production}} processes, {{there are}} two types of variations that affect production quality - - variations produced by chance causes and variations produced by assignable causes. One of the main instruments in quality control used to control quality by distinguishing between variations produced by chance causes and a real process change is the control chart. Each type of control chart has advantages and disadvantages in a specified situation. For example, some control charts fail to detect small shifts, while the others are ineffective to detect large shifts in process mean. In this study, three types of control charts, namely, X[bar], cumulative sum, and <b>geometric</b> <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> control charts were compared on an economic basis. A simulation model was developed to simulate the control chart functions in a typical production process. The simulation was executed in BASIC on an IBM PC/XT. Before comparison, each control chart was matched so that all the control charts have the same characteristics when the process operates in-control for a certain period of time. The effects of the type of control chart, sample size, sampling interval, and the magnitude of shift in process mean on profit per hour were observed and analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results show that, in general, the cumulative sum control chart has advantage over the other two types of control charts when shift of small magnitude of about 0. 5 σ is present. X[bar]-control chart is ineffective to detect small shifts; however, its effectiveness increases sharply as the magnitude of shift increases to values of 1. 5 σ or beyond. <b>Geometric</b> <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> control chart gives best results at intermediate shift levels of about l. 0 σ. Of the three sample sizes (3, 4 and 5) used in this study, sample size of five yields the highest profit per hour. However, too large a sample size may result in a decrease of profit per hour if the testing causes the destruction of items and the cost of sampling per item is very high. Small sampling interval of one hour yields the highest profit per hour among three sampling intervals (1, 2 and 4 hours) used in this study. Too small sampling interval could yield lower profit per hour if the increased cost of more frequent sampling, more investigations caused by false alarms, and more frequent shut down of the production process exceeds the savings from early detection of the shift, particularly, when the cost of sampling, the cost of searching for an assignable cause, and the income per hour of production are very high...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} optimal {{adaptive}} controller {{that is used}} to regulate the chemical process of wood ash stabilization (WAS). The model parameters of the time-varying process dynamics are estimated using recursive least squares (RLS). At each batch an auto-tuning sequence produced with the controller disabled is carried through in order to obtain a good estimate of the process dynamics. After the auto-tuning sequence is completed, a generalized predictive controller is enabled to control the WAS process. The control objective is to regulate the normalized effective power Pe(t) to the level Pe crit that represents the critical rate of useful work being performed by the three-phase asynchronous machine used for the stirrer drive. Hence, Pecrit also represents the desired mixture viscosity. If more water is added to the stabilization process after Pecrit has been reached, one will obtain a mixture useless for granular material. To cope with this problem, change detection is used to reach the desired level Pecrit without any pre-determined set-point. Two methods are evaluated; a probing strategy and the <b>geometric</b> <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> test, both adequate for successful implementation.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a theory for multi-scale representation of temporal data. Assuming that a real-time vision system should represent the incoming data at di erent time scales, an additional causality constraint arises compared to traditional scale-space theory|we can only use what {{has occurred in}} the past for computing representations at coarser time scales. Based on a previously developed scale-space theory in terms of noncreation of local maxima with increasing scale, a complete classi cation is given of the scale-space kernels that satisfy this property of non-creation of structure and respect the time direction as causal. It is shown that the cases of continuous and discrete time are inherently di erent. For continuous time, there is no non-trivial time-causal semi-group structure. Hence, the time-scale parameter must be discretized, {{and the only way to}} construct a linear multi-time-scale representation is by (cascade) convolution with truncated exponential functions having (possibly) di erent time constants. For discrete time, there is a canonical semi-group structure allowing for a continuous temporal scale parameter. It gives rise to a Poisson-type temporal scale-space. In addition, <b>geometric</b> <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> kernels and time-delayed generalized binomial kernels satisfy temporal causality and allow for highly e cient implementations. It is shown that temporal derivatives and derivative approximations can be obtained directly as linear combinations of the temporal channels in the multi-time-scale representation. Hence, to maintain a representation of temporal derivatives at multiple time scales, there is no need for other time bu ers than the temporal channels in the multi-time-scale representation. The framework presented constitutes a useful basis for expressing a large class of algorithms for computer vision, image processing and coding. ...|$|E
30|$|Detection of {{structural}} changes from an operational {{process is a}} major goal in machinery monitoring which enables to solve many practical problems ranging from early fault detection, safety protection {{as well as other}} process control problems. Existing works are mainly based on a retrospective analysis of a data stream composed of numerical condition monitoring (CM) variables, such as vibration, sound, power consumption. The basic idea of a standard retrospective change detection mainly relies on estimating the logarithm of the likelihood ratio between two distributions [1, 2]. This kind of strategy argues that the detection of a change can be converted into the detection of the parameter difference between the two distributions before and after this change point. As a consequence, the retrospective change detection aims to estimate this parameter difference of distributions based upon likelihood ratio statistics. Change decision can be made by performing a null hypothesis testing with a threshold. Many effective tools for this goal such as the cumulative sum metric (CUSUM) [3 – 6], <b>geometric</b> <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> (GMA) [7, 8] and the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) [9 – 12] have been widely used. For example, Willersrud et al. [12] developed the GLRT to make efficient downhole drilling washout detection with the multivariate t-distribution; Reñones et al. [6] used the CUSUM analysis for multi-tooth machine tool fault detection. Although these methods have been experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness in various fields, due to the requirement of data after change point, a large detection delay is an essential limitation of these methods for real applications [13]. On the other hand, real-time change detection aims to detect changes as soon as possible when a change occurs, this requirement is crucial in many real-life scenarios such as security monitoring [14, 15], health care [16, 17], automated factory [18, 19] as well as machine operation monitoring studied in this paper. In operation of real-time change detection, at each time when a datum is input, it evaluates what extent the input datum {{is likely to be a}} change-point by a certain type of measuring score [20] which does not need any input data after change time. The real-time approaches have succeeded in solving many practical applications (e.g., wind turbine condition monitoring [21], driver vigilance monitoring [22]), and thus are promising [23].|$|E
