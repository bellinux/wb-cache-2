50|$|Diana was <b>damaged</b> {{near her}} <b>waterline</b> during {{attack by the}} Imperial Japanese Navy on Port Arthur {{on the morning of}} 9 February 1904, by the cruiser {{squadron}} commanded by Admiral Dewa Shigeto, but was repaired in a few days. She fired eight 152-mm and 100-mm shots at Admiral Dewa’s cruisers.|$|R
50|$|On 17 February 1782 the Héros fought at {{the battle}} of Sadras off the coast of Coromandel, attachking the centre of the British {{formation}} and seriously <b>damaging</b> below the <b>waterline</b> Edward Hughes' flagship, the 74 gun HMS Superb. Héros {{and the rest of the}} squadron then called at Pondichéry and Porto-Novo to disembark general Duchemin's troops (21 February to 23 March 1782).|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} hours of 8 May 2005 Kaawa was en route to Mwanza in Tanzania when she was {{involved}} in a collision with , which was en route to Port Bell in Uganda.

50|$|In {{support of}} this conclusion, the report says that {{witnesses}} had reported seeing flashes of light or sounds of an explosion, {{as well as that}} the US Navy analysis of the wreck concluded that a torpedo containing 250 kilograms of explosives had collided with Cheonan six to nine meters below the <b>waterline.</b> <b>Damage</b> to the hull supported this conclusion, while inconsistent with what would be expected if the ship had run aground or had been hit with a missile.|$|R
50|$|In 2004 the {{ownership}} of the Norwegian Dream was transferred to NCL's parent company Star Cruises, in preparation for possible sale or transfer to the Star Cruises fleet. On 10 December 2007, the Norwegian Dream {{was involved in a}} further collision with a barge while leaving the port of Montevideo, Uruguay. The collision caused some <b>damage</b> above the <b>waterline</b> that {{did not appear to be}} serious. The collision caused several cars and five containers to fall off the barge, which closed the port for some time.|$|R
5000|$|At 19:16 on 13 June 1917, the {{steamship}} [...] {{was standing}} out of New York Harbor {{in a thick}} fog and collided with Amphitrite, suffering <b>damage</b> below the <b>waterline.</b> Attempting to clear, Manchuria scraped the guardship's bow, and her propeller strut fouled her cable, holding her fast for 20 minutes. Manchuria lowered her boats and abandoned ship; two section patrol boats and a motor sailer stood by and took life boats in tow. Ultimately, Manchuria was towed and beached off Tompkinsville, while Amphitrite continued her net-tending duties.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} hours of 8 May 2005 she was {{involved}} in a collision with [...] Kabalega was en route to Port Bell in Uganda while Kaawa was sailing in the opposite direction towards Mwanza in Tanzania. Kaawa damaged her bow and Kabalega was <b>damaged</b> below the <b>waterline.</b> Kaawa managed to return to port but a few hours after the collision Kabalega sank in 150 ft of water about 8 nmi km southeast of the Ssese Islands and about 50 nmi km from the Kuye Islands.|$|R
40|$|Damage to the {{concrete}} surface can be observed at the waterline of hydraulic structures in fresh water bodies in cold climates. Gradual deterioration of {{the concrete}} surface leads to exposure of coarse aggregate. Superficial <b>damage</b> at the <b>waterline</b> is commonly assumed {{to be caused by}} drifting ice floes. However, deterioration of concrete at the waterline may also involve leaching and frost action. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate if leaching of calcium compounds changes the surface properties of concrete in such an extent that the scaling resistance is reduced. Specimens with water to cement ratio 0. 62 and 0. 54 were submerged in deionised water at + 20 °C and pH 4 ± 0. 1 in order to accelerate leaching of calcium compounds. The scaling resistance of concrete was assessed according to the Swedish test method SS 13 72 44. The results show that the scaling resistance of concrete is reduced if calcium compounds have been leached out from the surface. The results also show that the longer the time of leaching, the greater the reduction in scaling resistance. Superficial <b>damage</b> at the <b>waterline</b> of hydraulic structures in fresh water bodies in cold climates is most likely caused by interaction between leaching, frost action and abrasion...|$|R

On the 23rd, she was rammed and <b>damaged</b> above the <b>waterline</b> by [...] Repairs were completed quickly at Brest, and she continued her work without further interruption until the end of the war. During that period, she made several attacks on submarines, most notably against UB-55 on 18 March 1918 and U-86 on 1 July, but she failed to sink any.|$|R
5|$|After {{exiting the}} Fijian {{archipelago}} of islands, Cyclone Gene moved towards the west across the South Pacific, towards Vanuatu, and was predicted {{to affect the}} archipelago between January 31 and February 2. However, during January 31, the system started to re-curve towards the southeast {{and as a result}} did not make landfall on the island, but Gene's outerbands produced gale force winds and heavy rain on various southern Vanuatuan islands for about 12 hours. However the system only caused no deaths and severe damage to Futuna island, while sparing other nearby islands. On Futuna Island, Gene caused damages to buildings, Plants used for weaving and generating income, trails, native and non native homes, waterlines, food gardens, food producing plants, crops, and other critical structures and littered footpaths with fallen trees and debris. As a result of <b>damages</b> to <b>waterlines</b> from falling debris, flooding and contaminated drinking water were reported in some villages with pipes openly leaking. After an aerial survey found that more than 70% of garden crops had been damaged by Gene, the Vanuatu Government declared Futuna island a disaster zone.|$|R
5|$|Within six minutes, Sōryū and Kaga were ablaze from stem to stern, as fires {{spread through}} the ships.

All three carriers remained temporarily afloat, as none had suffered <b>damage</b> below the <b>waterline,</b> other than the rudder damage to Akagi caused by the near miss close astern. Despite initial hopes that Akagi could be saved or at least towed back to Japan, all three carriers were eventually abandoned and scuttled.|$|R
40|$|The {{major part}} of the Swedish hydro power {{development}} took place between 1945 and 1975. At that point of time, significant progress had been made regarding the use of high quality concrete for hydraulic structures. In spite of the progress made, deterioration of concrete due to freezing and thawing is still frequent. Superficial <b>damage</b> at the <b>waterline</b> and spalling of concrete far below the water level on the upstream face of concrete dams have been observed. Knowledge about the deterioration processes is important in order to improve the efficiency of maintenance of hydro power plants. Results obtained from two experimental studies of frost damage mechanisms are presented in this paper...|$|R
50|$|The attack {{had to be}} {{made with}} {{absolute}} precision: the Gneisenau was moored only some 500 yd away from a mole in Brest's inner harbour. For the attack to be effective, Campbell would have to time the release to drop the torpedo close {{to the side of the}} mole. That Campbell managed to launch his torpedo accurately is testament to his courage and determination. The ship was severely <b>damaged</b> below the <b>waterline</b> and was obliged to return to the dock whence she had come only the day before; she was put out of action for six months, lessening the threat to Allied shipping crossing the Atlantic.|$|R

5|$|Gromoboi {{suffered}} 87 {{dead and}} 170 wounded; {{far more than}} Rossias 44 dead and 156 wounded. This was attributable to Rossias captain's policy of ordering the gun crews for his quick-firing guns on the engaged side to lie down and those on the unengaged side to go below, {{in contrast to the}} Gromoboi keeping her light guns manned at all times. Gromoboi was hit fifteen times on the starboard side of her hull and seven times on her port side, plus other hits in her funnels, boats and decks. She also suffered a fire caused by the ignition of excess propellant charges. Despite this number of hits, she was not badly <b>damaged</b> because her <b>waterline</b> belt was not penetrated.

50|$|During Operation Kikusui I, the 1st raider fleet, {{consisting}} of the battleship Yamato, the light cruiser Yahagi, and 8 destroyers, {{under the command of}} admiral Seiichi Itō, left for Okinawa to support ground defense operations there, but were repulsed by over 300 carrier aircraft belonging to Admiral Mitscher's Task Force 58 at Bou-no-Misaki, between Kyushu and the Ryukyu Islands, on 7 April; this came to be known in Japan as the Naval Battle of Bou-no-Misaki. The Imperial Japanese Navy lost the battleship Yamato, the light cruiser Yahagi, and 4 destroyers. The Japanese military continued air attacks between 8 and 11 April, and on 11 April the aircraft carrier Enterprise and the battleship Missouri were damages by kamikaze aircraft, and the aircraft carrier Essex took hull <b>damage</b> below the <b>waterline.</b>|$|R

The aim of the tests was to establish the limiting value of KG at which capsize occurred, to compare the area ratio, stability range and intercept angle in this condition with values predicted by a conventional stability analysis, and thus assess whether the stability criteria provide a satisfactory measure of the unit's ability to resist capsize. Tests were performed on the model in the intact condition, after major <b>waterline</b> <b>damage</b> in corner and side compartments, and after internal flooding...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the loss}} of Empress of Ireland did not attract {{the same level of}} {{attention}} as that of the sinking of Titanic two years earlier, the disaster did lead to a change in the design of ships' bows. The sinking of Empress of Ireland proved that the reverse slanting prow, so common at the time, was deadly {{in the event of a}} ship-to-ship collision because it caused massive <b>damage</b> below the <b>waterline.</b> The bow of Storstad struck Empress of Ireland like a [...] "chisel into tin". As a result of the disaster, naval designers began to employ the raked bow with the top of the prow forward. This ensured that the energy of any collision would be minimised beneath the surface and only the parts of the bow above the waterline would be affected.|$|R
40|$|Climatic {{conditions}} {{during the}} winter in countries situated in the north can be considered severe. This {{is especially true for}} hydraulic structures, such as hydro power structures, dams, harbours, canals and some bridge foundations. Freezing of concrete in contact with unfrozen fresh water may have a considerable impact on the deterioration process of concrete. This paper presents results obtained in experimental investigations based on observations of superficial and internal damage to concrete in hydraulic structures in Sweden. It was shown that superficial <b>damage</b> at the <b>waterline</b> is caused by interactions between leaching, frost action and abrasion. Further, the results indicate that internal damage to some thin concrete dams has been due to formation of macroscopic ice lenses causing spalling of concrete. Knowledge about degradation mechanisms and how they interact is crucial {{in order to be able}} to perform durable repairs...|$|R
50|$|Wakeful was {{selected}} to support Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of allied troops from Dunkirk, on 26 May 1940. On 27 May 1940 Wakeful embarked 631 Allied troops. While returning them to Dover Wakeful came under air attack and received minor <b>damage</b> below the <b>waterline.</b> Despite the near miss Wakeful returned to Dunkirk to continue the evacuation, embarking 640 Allied troops on 28 May 1940. While carrying this out Wakeful was torpedoed by the German E-Boat S-30. The destroyer was struck by two torpedoes, one hitting the forward boiler room. Casualties were heavy, {{only one of the}} 640 Allied troops - Mr Stanley Patrick of the Royal Army Service Corps - and 25 of Wakefuls crew survived. A number of ships stopped to pick up the survivors, but one of these, the destroyer , was then in turn sunk by a German U-Boat.|$|R
50|$|While the {{collision}} caused only superficial <b>damage</b> above the <b>waterline,</b> consisting mainly of broken railings and deck plates, {{the bow of}} Topdalsfjord had created a large hole in Cedarvilles hull below the waterline, and within minutes of {{the collision}} a slight list to the port had developed. The captain of Cedarville ordered water to be pumped into the starboard ballast tanks to counteract the list, and intended to try to run the ship aground {{to prevent it from}} sinking. As the ship moved towards land, however, the weight of the water within the hull forced the bow down, and the ship began listing to starboard, eventually rolling over before sinking. Most survivors of the collision, in which ten out of the 35 aboard died, were picked up by the German freighter MV Weissenburg, and subsequently transferred to the US Coast Guard cutter Mackinaw.|$|R
5000|$|Preserver {{underwent}} a major refit in 2005, after {{the ship was}} plagued by electrical problems. However, electrical problems remained unresolved for both ships in the class. In 2010 while refueling she spilled several cubic metres of fuel in Halifax harbour. The spill, which comprised [...] of diesel oil, {{was caused by a}} faulty drainage pipe that had not been properly inspected following a 2010 refit. The spill was contained by the navy before causing damage to the harbour itself. On 4 November 2011, after returning from sea trials, the ship smashed into a dock in Halifax harbour, suffering <b>damage</b> above the <b>waterline</b> on the starboard bow. The commanding officer of the ship was later removed from his post {{as a result of the}} crash. The cost of the repairs to the damage sustained during the incident was $497,442.|$|R
