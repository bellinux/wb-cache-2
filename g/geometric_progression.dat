25|$|A logical {{scheme is}} to produce {{resistors}} {{in a range of}} values which increase in a <b>geometric</b> <b>progression,</b> so that each value is greater than its predecessor by a fixed multiplier or percentage, chosen to match the tolerance of the range. For example, for a tolerance of ±20% it makes sense to have each resistor about 1.5 times its predecessor, covering a decade in 6 values. In practice the factor used is 1.4678, giving values of 1.47, 2.15, 3.16, 4.64, 6.81, 10 for the 1–10-decade (a decade is a range increasing by a factor of 10; 0.1–1 and 10–100 are other examples); these are rounded in practice to 1.5, 2.2, 3.3, 4.7, 6.8, 10; followed, by 15, 22, 33, … and preceded by … 0.47, 0.68, 1. This scheme has been adopted as the E48 series of the IEC 60063 preferred number values. There are also E12, E24, E48, E96 and E192 series for components of progressively finer resolution, with 12, 24, 96, and 192 different values within each decade. The actual values used are in the IEC 60063 lists of preferred numbers.|$|E
25|$|Matrix schemes use {{the same}} {{fraudulent}} non-sustainable system as a pyramid; here, the participants pay to join a waiting list for a desirable product, which {{only a fraction of}} them can ever receive. Since matrix schemes follow the same laws of <b>geometric</b> <b>progression</b> as pyramids, they are subsequently as doomed to collapse. Such schemes operate as a queue, where the person at head of the queue receives an item such as a television, games console, digital camcorder, etc. when a certain number of new people join the end of the queue. For example, ten joiners may be required for the person at the front to receive their item and leave the queue. Each joiner is required to buy an expensive but potentially worthless item, such as an e-book, for their position in the queue. The scheme organizer profits because the income from joiners far exceeds the cost of sending out the item to the person at the front. Organizers can further profit by starting a scheme with a queue with shill names that must be cleared out before genuine people get to the front. The scheme collapses when no more people are willing to join the queue. Schemes may not reveal, or may attempt to exaggerate, a prospective joiner's queue position, a condition that essentially means the scheme is a lottery. Some countries have ruled that matrix schemes are illegal on that basis.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} looking for subsets of the natural numbers which contain no 3 -term {{arithmetic}} progressions has a rich history. Roth's theorem famously shows that any such subset cannot have positive upper density. In contrast, Rankin in 1960 suggested looking at subsets without three-term <b>geometric</b> <b>progressions,</b> and constructed such a subset with density about 0. 719. More recently, several authors have found upper bounds for the upper density of such sets. We significantly improve upon these bounds, and demonstrate a method of constructing sets with a greater upper density than Rankin's set. This construction is optimal {{in the sense that}} our method gives a way of effectively computing the greatest possible upper density of a geometric-progression-free set. We also show that <b>geometric</b> <b>progressions</b> in Z/nZ behave more like Roth's theorem in that one cannot take any fixed positive proportion of the integers modulo a sufficiently large value of n while avoiding <b>geometric</b> <b>progressions.</b> Comment: 16 page...|$|R

40|$|A {{problem of}} recent {{interest}} {{has been to}} study how large subsets of the natural numbers can be while avoiding 3 -term <b>geometric</b> <b>progressions.</b> Building on recent progress on this problem, we consider the analogous problem over quadratic number fields. We first construct high-density subsets of the algebraic integers of an imaginary quadratic number field that avoid 3 -term <b>geometric</b> <b>progressions.</b> When unique factorization fails or over a real quadratic number field, we instead look at subsets of ideals of the ring of integers. Our approach here is to construct sets "greedily," a generalization of the greedy set of rational integers considered by Rankin. We then describe the densities of these sets in terms of values of the Dedekind zeta function. Next, we consider geometric-progression-free sets with large upper density. We generalize an argument by Riddell to obtain upper bounds for the upper density of geometric-progression-free subsets, and construct sets avoiding <b>geometric</b> <b>progressions</b> with high upper density to obtain lower bounds for the supremum of the upper density of all such subsets. Both arguments depend critically on the elements with small norm in the ring of integers.
