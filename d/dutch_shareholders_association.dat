The SSA advocates a stewardship logic in a field where one more recent logic is the shareholder wealth maximization. By studying educational programs, seminars, policy texts of the SSA and how the SSA and other shareholder vote at the annual general meeting we demonstrate how competing logics lead to different decisions about the company’s proposal to pay dividends. The paper meets calls for cross level research in institutional theory and contributes with a study on how field level logics influence decisions at the micro-level, concluding that institutionalized views of the public company influence interpretations of accounting and that the stewardship logic makes that apparently beneficial proposals such as generous dividends are rejected...|$|R

40|$|Shareholder {{activism}} is {{an emerging}} phenomenon globally {{in the corporate}} governance discourse. The major purpose {{of this research was}} to explore the nature, form and extent of shareholder activism as a corporate governance mechanism in Zimbabwe public listed companies. The research was driven by the little body of knowledge regarding shareholder activism in the Zimbabwe corporate governance environment. Existing literature was reviewed on the subject of shareholder activism particularly its history, the regulatory framework that governs shareholder activism, motivations and drivers to shareholder activism, shareholder activism and its relationship and impact to corporate governance and the agency dilemma and the strategies that can be employed to enhance shareholder activism. The research used a qualitative methodology guided by the phenomenology research philosophy and the research design was a case study. The sample consisted of 21 participants comprising of directors, company secretaries, market analyst, majority and minority shareholders, the regulator of capital markets and the media. In the research primary and secondary sources of data were used. Primary data was collected through in-depth interviews using an interview guide and non-participant observations. The research findings revealed {{that there are a number}} of factors that have hindered vibrant and effective shareholder activism in Zimbabwe listed companies and has resulted in shareholder apathy and lack of compliance to corporate governance standards. These factors include lack of an enabling legal framework that promotes shareholder activism, a board culture that is not receptive to activism especially during annual general meetings and underdeveloped capital and financial markets that do not generate much interest in shareholder activism by activist. Further the study revealed that lack of a Code specifically of Corporate Governance for companies listed on the Stock Exchange in Zimbabwe, lack of an effective <b>shareholder</b> <b>association</b> and weak internal corporate governance structures hindered effective shareholder participation. The study recommended that the regulatory framework should be reviewed so as to enhance shareholder participation, formulating a Code of Corporate Governance specifically for listed companies that promote shareholder participation, formulating a <b>shareholder</b> <b>association</b> that protects and advances the interest of minority shareholders, management to strengthen their internal governance structures such as annual general meetings so as to promote an environment of shareholder activism. The study objectives were met...|$|R
25|$|These as well {{as other}} deals placed Pickens at the center of {{controversy}} during the 1980s. His celebrity rose so quickly after the Gulf Oil takeover bid that Time magazine put Pickens on the cover for the March 1985 issue. He briefly considered running for president in the 1988 elections. During this period, he was often characterized as a corporate raider and greenmailer. This {{is due to the fact}} that many of his deals were not completed, although Pickens and the shareholders he represented received substantial profits through the eventual sale of their stock as a result. His later takeover targets included Newmont Mining, a New York-based firm, Diamond Shamrock, and Koito Mfg., Ltd., a Japanese auto-parts manufacturer, making substantial gains in the process. He was also involved in the creation of the United <b>Shareholders</b> <b>Association</b> (USA), which from 1986–1993 attempted to influence the governance of several large companies. After nearly two years of periodic hearing and debate, in July 1998 the Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4–1 to approve a one-share, one-vote rule, a primary USA objective.|$|R

Afterwards, Bendall persuaded him to become chairman of the club. Kartz would go on to have a good working relationship with manager Ron Saunders, until a transfer dispute over Mick Ferguson and Peter Withe meant that he would resign as chairman, arguing that harmony between chairman and manager was vital. He was replaced by Bendall, and became vice-chairman for the next two seasons, in which Villa won the First Division title and the European Cup. He left the board in 1983. His legacy at Villa is supported by the youth scouting network set up with Tommy Docherty, that brought Brian Little and Gordon Cowans to the club, and helping the club purchase Bodymoor Heath, which still remains their training base.|$|R
