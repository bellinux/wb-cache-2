He had an idea that we should never get out of that river unless we were written out of it in a formal Memorandum; and the more we laboured at navigating the rafts, the more he ordered us not to touch them at our peril, and the more he sat and roared <b>for</b> <b>stationery.</b>|$|R
40|$|This book {{provides}} in-depth {{coverage of}} transformer-based design techniques that enable CMOS oscillators and frequency dividers to achieve state-of-the-art performance.   Design, optimization, and measured performance of oscillators and frequency <b>dividers</b> <b>for</b> different applications {{are discussed in}} detail, focusing on not only ultra-low supply voltage but also ultra-wide frequency tuning range and locking range.   This book will be an invaluable reference for anyone working or interested in CMOS radio-frequency or mm-Wave integrated circuits and systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an ultra-low-voltage (ULV) transformer-coupled (TC) frequency divider. On-chip transformers are used to cross-couple two regenerative <b>dividers</b> <b>for</b> quadrature-phase generation while achieving low-voltage, low-power and wideband operation. Implemented in a standard 0. 13 -μm CMOS process, the ULV-TC divider measures an input operation range of 19. 2 % from 22. 6 GHz to 27. 4 GHz and an IQ sideband rejection of 41 dB while consuming a minimum 6. 8 mW from a 0. 55 V power supply. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R
50|$|The folding room screens {{were found}} in China in the 7th century where they were mainly used by royalty. They were very heavy and ornate, and were not moved around.

European travelers developed {{their own version of}} Asian screen dividers using wood, leather, silk, mirrors and decoupage. Folding room dividers are now used in dwellings, hospitals, schools, restaurants, corporate offices and convention centers.|$|R

40|$|A {{division}} algorithm {{in which}} the quotient-digit selection is performed by rounding the shifted residual in carry-save form is presented. To allow {{the use of this}} simple function, the divisor (and dividend) is prescaled to a range close to one. The implementation presented results in a fast iteration because of the use of carry-save forms and suitable recodings. The execution time is calculated and several convenient values of the radix are selected. Comparison with other <b>dividers</b> <b>for</b> radices 2 ^ 9 to 2 ^ 18 is performed using the same assumption...|$|R
