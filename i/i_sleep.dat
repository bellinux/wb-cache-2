It received positive reviews from both The Guardian and The Independent newspapers. It was funded by Arts Council England, National Lottery and a long list of other Brighton and Hove based businesses.|$|E

Prost had their test driver Stéphane Sarrazin ready to replace Alesi should the latter had suffered a relapse. Alesi said he felt ready to race again: [...] "It took a few days before I really started to recover, but now <b>I</b> <b>sleep</b> and feel much better".|$|E

500|$|The story {{continues}} with the Stranger traveling south. In the song [...] "Denver," [...] the character {{falls in love}} with a woman he meets in a bar in town. One of the lines from [...] "Blue Rock Montana" [...] is repeated, with a variation: [...] "And they danced with a smile on their faces". The following song, [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>Sleep</b> in Your Arms?", shows the desire of the Stranger for redemption and love. Next is [...] "Remember Me", where he announces that his vows to his deceased wife are broken and he is free to love. The story ends with [...] "Hands on the Wheel", which depicts the Stranger as an old man who is accompanied by a child, presumably his grandson, and his new love. The song marks the end of the sorrow of the Stranger, and his redemption years later. The album ends with the instrumental song [...] "Bandera".|$|E

500|$|During {{his return}} to Austin after a ski trip in Colorado, Nelson was {{inspired}} by his then-wife, Connie Koepke, to write a western concept album. Koepke suggested the inclusion of Arthur [...] "Guitar Boogie" [...] Smith's [...] "Tale of the Red Headed Stranger", which Nelson sang during his radio shows on KCNC in Fort Worth and previously, to his children at bedtime. Nelson decided to write a complete story that included details of events prior to the ones described in the song. As he spontaneously composed the songs, Koepke wrote down the lyrics. With his original writings, Nelson included on the story, Fred Rose's [...] "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain", Wolfe Gilbert's [...] "Down Yonder", Juventino Rosas' [...] "O'er the Waves", Hank Cochran's [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>Sleep</b> in Your Arms?", Eddy Arnold's [...] "I Couldn't Believe it Was True", and Billy Callery's [...] "Hands on the Wheel". When he arrived in Austin, Nelson recorded a demo of the songs on a tape recorder accompanied with his guitar at his ranch in Fitzhugh Road.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} on the website Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] is an alternative metal and gothic metal song, set in common time and performed in moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It is written in the key of F# minor and Lee's vocals for the song range from the musical note of A#3 to G5. According to IGN's Ed Thompson, Lee sings the lines [...] "It's true we're all a little insane/But it's so clear now that I'm unchained", with her [...] "haunting vocals". Some critics found dark lyrics like [...] "I dream in darkness, <b>I</b> <b>sleep</b> to die, erase the silence, erase my life, our burning ashes darken the day, a world of nothingness, blow me away" [...] accompanied with [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section. A writer for the website Sputnikmusic found similarities between the songs on Fallen and [...] "Sweet Sacrifice". The main theme for the song is getting over from an abusive relationship. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian concluded that Lee sings the lines [...] "You know you live to break me" [...] and [...] "Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes?" [...] to Evanescence's past guitarist Ben Moody. That sentiment was echoed by Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, {{who said that the}} lyrics [...] "One day I'm gonna forget your name/And one sweet day, you're gonna drown in my lost pain" [...] are aimed at Moody.|$|E

2500|$|The normal EEG also varies {{depending}} on state. The EEG is used along with other measurements (EOG, EMG) to define sleep stages in polysomnography. Stage <b>I</b> <b>sleep</b> (equivalent to drowsiness in some systems) appears on the EEG as drop-out of the posterior basic rhythm. There can {{be an increase in}} theta frequencies. Santamaria and Chiappa cataloged a number of the variety of patterns associated with drowsiness. Stage II sleep is characterized by sleep spindles – transient runs of rhythmic activity in the 12–14nbsp&Hz range (sometimes referred to as the [...] "sigma" [...] band) that have a frontal-central maximum. Most of the activity in Stage II is in the 3–6nbsp&Hz range. Stage III and IV sleep are defined by the presence of delta frequencies and are often referred to collectively as [...] "slow-wave sleep". Stages I–IV comprise non-REM (or [...] "NREM") sleep. The EEG in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep appears somewhat similar to the awake EEG.|$|E

Hearing Sylvia's confession, an enraged Nanavati wanted to shoot himself, but was calmed down by Sylvia, who {{told him that he}} was not to be blamed and there was no reason that he should shoot himself. Since Sylvia did not tell him whether Prem intended to marry her, Nanavati sought to find it out for himself. When Nanavati met Prem at the latter's bedroom, Prem had just come out of the bath dressed only in a white towel; an angry Nanavati swore at Prem and proceeded to ask him if he intended to marry Sylvia and look after his children. Prem replied, [...] "Will I marry every woman <b>I</b> <b>sleep</b> with?", which further enraged Nanavati. Seeing Nanavati go for the gun, enclosed in a brown packet, Prem too went for it and in the ensuing scuffle, Prem's hand caused the gun to go off and instantly kill him.|$|E
