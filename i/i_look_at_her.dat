2500|$|Although Dorothy and Ezra {{planned to}} honeymoon in Spain that September, the {{outbreak}} of World War I forced them to postpone. Instead they lived with W.B. Yeats at Stone Cottage for the winter, where Pound worked on proofs for the second issue of BLAST magazine. Of Dorothy, Yeats wrote, [...] "she looks as if her face were made out of Dresden china. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in perpetual wonder. It {{is hard to believe}} she is real; yet she spends all her daylight hours drawing the most monstrous cubist pictures." [...] Poet Iris Barry, writing in the 1930s about the Pounds during this period, describes Dorothy as, [...] "With [...] came Mrs. Pound, carrying herself delicately with the air, always of a young Victorian lady out skating, and a profile as clear and lovely as that as a porcelain Kuan-yin".|$|E
60|$|Never a word says Mrs. Henry; nor did <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> I scarce knew why.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{think that}} when I first knew her {{it seemed to me}} that my whole life wouldn't be enough to [...] . And now when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her!</b> She did it all. I must have been mad. I was mad. Every time <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> I {{remember}} my madness. It frightens me. [...] . And when I think that of all my life, of all my past, of all my future, of my intelligence, of my work, there is nothing left but she, the cause of my ruin, and you whom I have mortally offended [...] ." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} face, observant of her work, {{she raised}} her mild clear eyes, and saw that <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> blankly. As yet her meaning {{was hidden}} from me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> inquiringly; {{but already}} with a foreknowledge of her meaning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did I {{find her}} {{standing}} {{there like a}} goddess who had just stepped out of her cloud? Why did <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her?</b> Before I knew where I was, the harm was done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! you heroine,' said Lucy, 'you don't {{know how}} often I have told of your doughty deeds! Ay, look at her, {{she is the}} robber-baffler; though now <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> I don't quite believe it myself.' ...|$|E
60|$|My lady stops me again, before I go any further, by {{laughing}} {{exactly in}} her old way and waving the feather of her pen at me. That action on her part, calls to my mind as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> hand with the rings on it--Well! I won't! To be sure it will come in, in its own place. But it's always strange to me, noticing the quiet hand, and noticing it (as I have done, you know, so many times) a-fondling children and grandchildren asleep, to think that when blood and honour were up--there! I won't! not at present!--Scratch it out.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> troubled, puzzled, but burning <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{praise of}} Captain Jack.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{finding no}} words {{to express my}} astonishment at this perspicacity.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> questioningly, and {{she spoke}} {{again in a}} low voice.|$|R
6000|$|The shoes I {{had chosen}} were good sound Bowaters, and as I trudged on my spirits rose high. I breathed in deep {{draughts}} {{of the sweet}} September air. Thomasina of Bedlam had been [...] "summoned to tourney." [...] "The wide world's end.... No journey!" [...] In sober fact, it was a sorry little wretch of a young female, scarcely more than a girl, that went panting along in the dust and stones, scrambling into cover of ditch and hedge at every sound or sight of life. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> now, and smile. Poor thing; it needed at any rate a pinch of [...] "courage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In morning I get to Lake Linderman. I {{walk all}} night and am much tired. I cook breakfast, I eat, then I sleep on the beach three hours. I wake up. It is ten o'clock. Snow is falling. There is wind, much wind that blows fair. Also, there {{is a woman who}} sits in the snow alongside. She is white woman, she is young, very pretty, maybe she is twenty years old, maybe twenty-five years old. She look at me. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She is very tired. She is no dance-woman. I see that right away. She is good woman, and she is very tired.|$|E
60|$|Lady Bracknell. [Sitting down again.] A moment, Mr. Worthing. A {{hundred and}} thirty {{thousand}} pounds! And in the Funds! Miss Cardew {{seems to me a}} most attractive young lady, now that <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Few girls of the present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last, and improve with time. We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces. [To Cecily.] Come over here, dear. [Cecily goes across.] Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it. But we can soon alter all that. A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of time. I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after three months her own husband did not know her.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{astonished}} as she {{had been}} astonished when she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> a moment. “What has he read to you?” I crudely enquired.|$|R
60|$|I waited--feeling awe, but no fear. My {{heart was}} all hers as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What can I say? I do {{not want}} the woman, yet have I given my word that for one {{thousand}} dollars she can come. I am surprised. Maybe she make fun, too, so I say, 'Let me see thousand dollars.' And that woman, that young woman, all alone on the trail, there in the snow, she take out one thousand dollars, in greenbacks, and she put them in my hand. I look at money, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> What can I say? I say, 'No, my canoe very small. There is no room for outfit.' She laugh. She says, 'I am great traveller. This is my outfit.' She kick one small pack in the snow. It is two fur robes, canvas outside, some woman's clothes inside. I pick it up. Maybe thirty-five pounds. I am surprised. She take it away from me. She says, 'Come, let us start.' She carries pack into canoe. What can I say? I put my blankets into canoe. We start.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} have been a fiddler, and I'm a pedler of tar-roofing! And Zilla--Oh, I don't want to squeal, but {{you know as well as}} I do about how inspiring a wife she is.... Typical {{instance}} last evening: We went to the movies. There was a big crowd waiting in the lobby, us at the tail-end. She began to push right through it with her 'Sir, how dare you?' manner--Honestly, sometimes when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and see how she's always so made up and stinking of perfume and looking for trouble and kind of always yelping, 'I tell yuh I'm a lady, damn yuh!'--why, I want to kill her! Well, she keeps elbowing through the crowd, me after her, feeling good and ashamed, till she's almost up to the velvet rope and ready to be the next let in. But there was a little squirt of a man there--probably been waiting half an hour--I kind of admired the little cuss--and he turns on Zilla and says, perfectly polite, 'Madam, why are you trying to push past me?' And she simply--God, I was so ashamed!--she rips out at him, 'You're no gentleman,' and she drags me into it and hollers, 'Paul, this person insulted me!' and the poor skate he got ready to fight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Frankly, I'm worried," [...] said Mrs. Maturin. [...] "At {{first she}} seemed to be getting along beautifully. I read to her, a little every day, and it was {{wonderful}} how she responded to it. I'll tell you about that I've got so much to tell you! Young Dr. Trent is puzzled, too, it seems there are symptoms in the case for which he cannot account. Some three weeks ago he asked me what I made out of her, and I can't make anything--that's the trouble, except that she seems pathetically grateful, and that I've grown absurdly fond of her. But she isn't improving as fast as she should, and Dr. Trent doesn't know whether or not to suspect functional complications. Her constitution seems excellent, her vitality unusual. Trent's impressed by her, he inclines to the theory that she has something on her mind, and if this is so she should get rid of it, tell it to somebody--in short, tell it to me. I know she's fond of me, but she's so maddeningly self-contained, and at moments when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> she baffles me, she makes me feel like an atom. Twenty times at least I've almost screwed up my courage to ask her, {{but when it comes to}} the point, I simply can't do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} calm {{face and}} lovely eyes I forgot everything. In a moment, I was over head and ears in love again, and conscious of nothing else. [...] "Ida," [...] <b>I</b> cried, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> steadily, [...] "Ida!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in surprise. Her {{face was}} stained with tears. Her voice shook with nervousness.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Her's is {{the beauty}} {{to which a}} touch of sadness adds a charm.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{night we}} make camp at Windy Arm. Woman sit by fire and eat supper. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She is pretty. She fix hair. There is much hair, {{and it is}} brown, also {{sometimes}} it is like gold in the firelight, when she turn her head, so, and flashes come from it like golden fire. The eyes are large and brown, sometimes warm like a candle behind a curtain, sometimes very hard and bright like broken ice when sun shines upon it. When she smile--how can I say?--when she smile I know white man like to kiss her, just like that, when she smile. She never do hard work. Her hands are soft, like baby's hand. She is soft all over, like baby. She is not thin, but round like baby; her arm, her leg, her muscles, all soft and round like baby. Her waist is small, and when she stand up, when she walk, or move her head or arm, it is--I {{do not know the}} word--but it is nice to look at, like--maybe I say she is built on lines like the lines of a good canoe, just like that, and when she move she is like the movement of the good canoe sliding through still water or leaping through water when it is white and fast and angry. It is very good to see.|$|E
6000|$|I {{could not}} help {{laughing}} at the resemblance, and mentioning it to my friend. He broke, as was his wont, into a fond eulogium of his sire, wished he could be like him--worked himself up into another state of excitement, in which he averred [...] "that if his father wanted him to marry, he would marry that instant. And why not Rosey? She is a dear little thing. Or why not that splendid Miss Sherrick? What ahead!--a regular Titian! I {{was looking at the}} difference of their colour at Uncle Honeyman's that day of the dejeuner. The shadows in Rosey's face, sir, are all pearly-tinted. You ought to paint her in milk, sir!" [...] cries the enthusiast. [...] "Have you ever remarked the grey round her eyes, and the sort of purple bloom of her cheek? Rubens could have done the colour: but I don't somehow like to think of a young lady and that sensuous old Peter Paul in company. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> like a little wild-flower in a field--like a little child at play, sir. Pretty little tender nursling! If I see her passing in the street, I feel as if I would like some fellow to be rude to her, that I might have the pleasure of knocking him down. She is like a little songbird, sir,--a tremulous, fluttering little linnet that you would take into your hand, pavidam quaerentem matrem, and smooth its little plumes, and let it perch on your finger and sing. The Sherrick creates quite a different sentiment--the Sherrick is splendid, stately, sleepy----" ...|$|E
60|$|Why can't one sit still? Here in Sicily {{it is so}} pleasant: {{the sunny}} Ionian sea, the {{changing}} jewel of Calabria, like a fire-opal moved in the light; Italy and the panorama of Christmas clouds, night with the dog-star laying a long, luminous gleam across the sea, as if baying at us, Orion marching above; how the dog-star Sirius looks at one, looks at one! he is the hound of heaven, green, glamorous and fierce!--and then oh regal evening star, hung westward flaring over the jagged dark precipices of tall Sicily: then Etna, that wicked witch, resting her thick white snow under heaven, and slowly, slowly rolling her orange-coloured smoke. They called her the Pillar of Heaven, the Greeks. It seems wrong at first, for she trails up in a long, magical, flexible line from the sea's edge to her blunt cone, and does not seem tall. She seems rather low, under heaven. But as one knows her better, oh awe and wizardy! Remote under heaven, aloof, so near, yet never with us. The painters try to paint her, and the photographers to photograph her, in vain. Because why? Because the near ridges, with their olives and white houses, these are with us. Because the river-bed, and Naxos under the lemon groves, Greek Naxos deep under dark-leaved, many-fruited lemon groves, Etna's skirts and skirt-bottoms, these still are our world, our own world. Even the high villages among the oaks, on Etna. But Etna herself, Etna of the snow and secret changing winds, she is beyond a crystal wall. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> low, white, witch-like under heaven, slowly rolling her orange smoke and giving sometimes a breath of rose-red flame, then I must look away from earth, into the ether, into the low empyrean. And there, in that remote region, Etna is alone. If you would see her, you must slowly take off your eyes from the world and go a naked seer to the strange chamber of the empyrean. Pedestal of heaven! The Greeks {{had a sense of}} the magic truth of things. Thank goodness one still knows enough about them to find one's kinship at last. There are so many photographs, there are so infinitely many water-colour drawings and oil paintings which purport to render Etna. But pedestal of heaven! You must cross the invisible border. Between the foreground, which is our own, and Etna, pivot of winds in lower heaven, there is a dividing line. You must change your state of mind. A metempsychosis. It is no use thinking you can see and behold Etna and the foreground both at once. Never. One or the other. Foreground and a transcribed Etna. Or Etna, pedestal of heaven.|$|E
60|$|She gave a sigh, {{and pretended}} to <b>look</b> bored. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> pained <b>at</b> heart and wondering.|$|R
6000|$|... “C’est comique, eh!” she {{interrupted}} {{herself to}} comment in a melancholy tone. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sympathetically {{and she went}} on: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> closely, {{and tried}} her {{with one of}} our signals. She responded, and I made sure of her.|$|R
5000|$|Stephanie Zacharek {{wrote in}} 2006 [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> pictures, I see not {{a gift for}} {{capturing}} whatever life is there, but a desire to confirm her own suspicions about humanity's dullness, stupidity and ugliness." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Dorothy and Ezra {{planned to}} honeymoon in Spain that September, the {{outbreak}} of World War I forced them to postpone. Instead they lived with W.B.

Of Dorothy, Yeats wrote, [...] "she looks as if her face were made out of Dresden china. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in perpetual wonder.

5000|$|After a 4-year {{absence from}} the {{recording}} studio, Lucien returned to debut Endless is Love for Shanachie. The spiritual warmth and romantic grace that have always been Jon's trademarks are even more powerful and profound permeating the songs and enveloping the listener in a mood best described as peaceful intensity on this release. A few months after his 17-year-old daughter Dalila perished on Flight 800 in July 1996, Jon went into the studio and began recording Endless Is Love. His music has always been his sanctuary. [...] "My daughter doesn't want me sitting around being unhappy. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and we communicate. We make music. The music is a special force." [...] And Lucien's message hasn't wavered since his earliest days. [...] "I hope to heal people who are sad and spiritually dead, because even though I don't pray in the music, the spirit is still there." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> white, drawn face, and {{it seemed}} to me I might carry her yet. I spluttered for words.|$|R
60|$|She was {{standing}} in thought, a doubtful expression on her face. But as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> she shook her head.|$|R
60|$|Again terror {{took hold}} of me, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> for <b>I</b> {{did not know what}} to say or ask.|$|R
