5|$|Mick {{encounters}} two vampires who {{are looking}} for Coraline. Once they leave, Mick visits his vampire friend Josef, who tells him that one of them was Lance (Jason Butler Harner), a rich and powerful vampire. Mick finds Coraline at a storage facility working on a compound for the vampire cure. Coraline explains that during the French Revolution there were seven siblings of royal blood who were vampires, two of whom were Lance and Coraline. She then uses the compound to cure Mick's vampirism, although Lance arrives and takes her away. Mick enjoys life as a human, although the cure is only temporary. Beth's boss at BuzzWire is killed, and a new assistant district attorney named Benjamin Talbot (Eric Winter) investigates the murder. Mick and Beth discuss the problems of having a romantic relationship, and although they end up kissing, Mick tells her he needs time to <b>figure</b> <b>things</b> <b>out.</b> Photos of Mick getting hit by a vehicle find their way into the hands of Talbot. Mick and Beth decide to start a romantic relationship, and go to a restaurant for their first date. When Beth quits her job at BuzzWire and becomes unemployed, Talbot offers her a job as a civilian investigator. Talbot receives a list of names of all the vampires in the area, including Mick, from an unknown source. Beth tells Mick that she cannot continue to date him because of their vampire-human situation, but Mick says that he loves her and they kiss.|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club {{also thought}} that Hawkins was the {{reasoning}} {{for the second}} episode's name. Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall observed that the episode came from Michael's perspective. According to Sepinwall, [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend" [...] showed Hannah and Rex {{together for the first}} time in the flashback shortly before the crash. He opined that the only people who currently watch the series are [...] "the ones who can quickly identify the red filter from the green filter and <b>figure</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> accordingly". Maggie Furlong from The Huffington Post thought that [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend" [...] "surfaces some serious issues for Britten" [...] that has only been [...] "cryptically referenced" [...] previously.|$|E

5000|$|Parker {{remained}} at WBAL-TV {{until his retirement}} in 1994. [...] Reflecting on his varied roles in the early pioneering years of commercial television, Parker recalled in 2008 that when he started at WAAM in 1951, earning $45 per week, [...] "We just <b>figured</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> as we went along. In six months, you did everything. I could run a control board, or put on a cooking show".|$|R

500|$|Criss {{discussed}} his personal connection with Blaine {{in an interview}} with Vanity Fair. He explained that he grew up among the [...] "gay community", being with theater performers, so was raised without a concept of sexuality being an issue. Criss stated that, although he identifies as straight, [...] "it really doesn't come into play with me in this role. As an actor, your objective is always to play the scene. And this in case, he happens to be a gay teen." [...] Talk show host and media personality Ellen DeGeneres deemed Blaine [...] "a very confident gay teen, which is something you don't see much on television." [...] However, Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times assessed that [...] "despite the image he projects, he, too, is just a kid trying to <b>figure</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> as he goes along." [...] Criss feels that Blaine's confidence is an important aspect of his character, as it is rare for gay teenagers on television to be so [...] "sure of themselves." [...] He hopes that [...] "all the kids struggling with this issue can look to a guy like Blaine and feel [...] by his confidence." ...|$|E
500|$|Moffat {{found it}} {{interesting}} that the Doctor regularly experienced time out of order and was used to a whole different kind of causality. He believed that the Doctor would attempt to cheat and break his own rules to save the universe from collapsing. The time travel used in the episode {{is compatible with the}} theory of time travel. As the episode features many [...] "time-jumps" [...] when the Doctor travels back to do things seen in the opening credits, Moffat decided to make it less complicated by allowing the audience to <b>figure</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> before they occurred. He did this by calling attention to the future-Doctor in the opening scenes by having him wearing a fez and holding a mop, and as the viewers saw the Doctor later acquire these items they would begin to connect the events. Moffat mentioned the fez to fellow executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis; they both were worried that Smith would become too attached to the hat and want to incorporate it into his costume, but Moffat assured him that he was planning on destroying the fez. Wenger later stated that Smith was [...] "one {{of the few people who}} can pull off a fez".|$|E
2500|$|According to Hellman, Eastman's {{script was}} used almost exactly as written with {{no need for}} any rewrites. However, Hellman felt {{the first part of}} the script had too much expository {{material}} involving Gashade's trip through the desert as he returned to the mining camp, so Hellman simply deleted it, noting that [...] "Exposition, by its very nature, is artificial." [...] After discarding the material, Hellman began shooting at approximately [...] "Page 10" [...] of the screenplay. He felt the story was [...] "perfectly simple" [...] and didn't need any additional information to help the audience <b>figure</b> <b>things</b> <b>out.</b> Nonetheless, Corman insisted on Hellman inserting a certain amount of exposition that Corman hoped would help explain the story. Corman felt that if mention was made three times during the course of the film that Gashade had a brother, audiences would not be confused by the climactic sequence. Hellman reluctantly agreed.|$|E
50|$|In the Icelandic landscape, sheep {{often get}} lost {{and it has}} {{historically}} been the dog's job to find them and return them to the herd. They are, therefore, used to working {{on their own and}} to <b>figuring</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> for themselves, so owners have to beware lest they learn things they should not. As a watch dog, their main task was to alert the inhabitants when somebody was coming, so these dogs tend to bark a lot when they see people approaching.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{people were}} intimidated by Mucking's excavator, Mrs. Margaret U. Jones, B.A., as she signed herself, but I saw {{her as a}} role model, a strong, dedicated, no-nonsense woman of great {{professional}} skill, with a very complex and important project. I felt that earning Margaret's trust was a real honor. It was only years later, when I {{read some of the}} Mucking publications, that I learned that she had never managed anything of that scope before, and was, by her own admission, <b>figuring</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> as she went along. She did a splendid job.|$|R

Adopting your last supposition, for the sake of argument, I'm interested to know what inhabitant of sleepy old Millville you suspect." ...|$|E
50|$|So it is {{not just}} that early {{childhood}} education teachers like children to play because children learn when playing, but that the children themselves want to affiliate in play with each other.

5000|$|Reznik {{said the}} single is [...] "kind of a cynical track {{about a very}} casual {{relationship}} where you just want something more."

50|$|The {{device is}} not {{introduced}} into the plot or the dialogue, but is something peripheral; however made obvious (hence the name) by a particular camera shot or background music.An example of this device is a camera close-up in a horror movie that suggests information like danger from an unlocked door. A literal flashing arrow {{was used in the}} 1981 film Student Bodies to mock this clichéd use. The use of flashing arrows and that particular joke were both mentioned in Everything Bad Is Good for You, where the authors says works that have little use of this and require <b>figuring</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> yourself have a more deductive viewer base.|$|R

Curt Wagner of RedEye has stated, [...] "Based on the first four episodes of the new season, I'd say Jordan has <b>figured</b> <b>things</b> <b>out.</b> The Borgias still overflows with delicious intrigues, sex and deadly politics, but it now has an energy and constant forward momentum the first season lacked." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter has stated, [...] "Borgias retains the intrigue and conniving family politics that made season one such a pleasure ride, but it all has more snap now, with Jordan spinning the plates with aplomb." ...|$|R

25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of <b>figured</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|R

We had a better schedule. When we did Invade, we would track for six hours and then go out and party and grill. Then we would wake up, record whatever, then repeat. I think it’s funny because it shows it has that feel to it, to me at least. When we did Elite, we were like, okay, schedule. We’ll go to the gym at 8 in the morning with Josh, then go eat breakfast, then we would start tracking at 10. Then go to 8 o’clock the evening.

Muscular and {{a little on the}} dumb side; Louie is prone to getting drunk in bars, chasing after girls, and brawling when he should be {{studying}} his magic. As a result, he tends to use brute force instead of magic, much to the chagrin of his companions (for example, on his first adventure, Louie lost his temper when a troop of goblins clubbed him on the head and then broke his wand when he used it to club them back). Despite his shortcomings as a wizard, Louie possesses a strong sense of justice and is unfailingly loyal to those he considers his friends. Louies stupidity mostly results as a lack of planning and forethought, hes actually a lot smarter than he usually appears to be, often <b>figuring</b> <b>things</b> <b>out</b> that others overlook.
