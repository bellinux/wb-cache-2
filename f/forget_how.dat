And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Alphonse's soul was sealed in a flying squirrel instead of armor {{as a result}} of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover their bodies. To match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit of armor to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa tends to make sketches of his human form so that she would not <b>forget</b> <b>how</b> to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey across the country to help people is meant to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that she does it because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people.|$|E

Jake Rickun, {{a writer for the}} Badger Herald, panned Reclassified. In his review, he described [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] as an ironic statement, [...] "but it’s on 'Heavy Crown,' in a candid moment of irony, where Azalea is most telling.

At the same time, radical government elements led by Thomas Jefferson had all but declared their support for U.S. aid to the beleaguered French First Republic (then {{at war with the}} United Kingdom).

[...] James then moved to Sydney especially for the role. Speaking of working on the serial James stated: [...] "Working on a series like this [...] is the best training you can get, I look at it like an apprenticeship and never <b>forget</b> <b>how</b> lucky I am."

500|$|The {{published}} work, Abraham Lincoln: A History, alternates {{parts in}} which Lincoln is at center [...] with discussions of contextual matters, such as legislative events or battles. The first serial installment, published in November 1886, received positive reviews.

Despite a price of $50, {{and the fact that}} {{a good part of the}} work had been serialized, five thousand copies were quickly sold. The books helped forge the modern view of Lincoln as great war leader, against competing narratives that gave more credit to subordinates such as Seward. According to historian Joshua Zeitz, [...] "it is easy to <b>forget</b> <b>how</b> widely underrated Lincoln the president and Lincoln the man were at the time of his death and how successful Hay and Nicolay were in elevating his place in the nation's collective historical memory." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} chorus, a new scene of Rihanna is introduced, with Rihanna meeting with her friends, having arrived at her destination, where they eat in {{restaurant}} and {{walk down the}} street. During the bridge, as Rihanna sings about the difficulties of getting over a failed relationship, scenes of Rihanna partying and talking to her ex-boyfriend on her phone are depicted, which results in her agreeing to meet him as she sings [...] "Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it/I won't <b>forget</b> <b>how</b> you do it, my sweet baby/This is where the game ends now/But somehow wanna believe you and me/We can figure it out", as she decides that their relationship is worth salvaging. During the final chorus, the singer is shown intimately dancing and partying with her boyfriend, whilst other scenes from the video are intercut. The video ends with a close-up shot of Rihanna against a white backdrop; when the song's audio finishes, the singer turns {{her head to the}} side and looks into the distance, as the camera pans away.|$|E

[...] I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." [...] He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. [...] O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated [...] "they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York, too. [...] But never in Boston. [...] I'll never <b>forget</b> <b>how</b> my teammates there took care of me — men like Johnny Bucyk, Doug Mohns, Charlie Burns and Don McKenney. [...] They accepted me totally.

In the story, told in a non-lineal manner, she portrayed Cristina Peck, a grief-stricken woman living a suburban {{life after the}} killing {{of her husband and}} two children by Jack Jordan (Benicio del Toro), who started a relationship with the critically ill academic mathematician Paul Rivers (Sean Penn). She said of the nomination, [...] "It's far beyond what I ever dreamed for – that would have been too far fetched". She also was nominated for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, as well as many other nominations and acclaim. The New York Times praised her: [...] "Because Ms. Watts reinvents herself with each performance, it's easy to <b>forget</b> <b>how</b> brilliant she is. She has a boldness that comes from a lack of overemphasis, something actresses sometimes do to keep up with Mr. Penn". The San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Watts is riveting, but she's much better in scenes of extreme emotion than in those requiring subtlety." ...|$|E

We wanted to try to avoid the classical witch with the long nose stirring the pot. I really wanted them to be...dangerous, fast – they’re stronger than Hansel and Gretel...It’s a good basis for a villain." [...] He recalled that [...] "the most fun was finding their look and sound. For the main witches, we found one animal to represent all of them, like Muriel is a wolf. It just helped us find the witches. In some ways, it feels like they're the spawn of the dark places of nature. It should feel animalistic." [...] Asked if he was worried about [...] "this perception that it might be interpreted as sexist", Wirkola said, [...] "For me, that’s a classical villain from hundreds and hundreds of years ago. Yeah, I never worried about that, to be honest." [...] He added, [...] "People <b>forget</b> <b>how</b> truly dark and twisted those stories are. [...] talks about a witch burning alive in an oven, screaming and scratching." [...] Ulrich Zeidler's concept art for some of the witches was released on the Internet.|$|E

Not wishing {{to become involved in}} matters, the Doctor instructs Strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of Clara's memories with just a touch. Before they can do so, they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group. The Doctor realises that Clara's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting. Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory, she will <b>forget</b> <b>how</b> to deal with the snowmen. The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS. Clara follows him and knocks on the door, but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers. Clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain Latimer. She learns that Latimer's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead. Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess' body is the only thing still frozen around them. She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny, who takes her to see Vastra. Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help. Clara chooses the word [...] "Pond", which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest.|$|E
