5000|$|The {{most common}} wall {{covering}} for residential use and generally the most economical is prepasted vinyl coated paper, commonly called [...] "strippable" [...] {{which can be}} misleading. Cloth backed vinyl is fairly common and durable. Lighter vinyls are easier to handle and hang. Paper backed vinyls are generally more expensive, significantly more difficult to hang, {{and can be found}} in wider untrimmed widths. Foil wallpaper generally has paper backing and can (exceptionally) be up to 36 inches wide, and be very difficult to handle and hang. Textile wallpapers include silks, linens, <b>grass</b> <b>cloths,</b> strings, rattan, and actual impressed leaves. There are acoustical wall carpets to reduce sound. Customized wallcoverings are available at high prices and most often have minimum roll orders.|$|R

The works were originally driven by water power, but in 1803 the works was provided with a 12 horse-power steam engine.

Figures similar to the dragon lantern (龍燈) used during Lantern Festival were described in the Song Dynasty work Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital, where figures of dragon mounted for display were constructed out of <b>grass</b> and <b>cloth</b> and inside which numerous candle lights may be placed. Such dragon lanterns may also be carried and paraded by performers in the street during the Lantern festival at nighttime. [...] A wide variety of dragon dances have developed in various regions in China, for example, the Fenghua Cloth Dragon (奉化布龙) from Zhejiang was made with bamboo frame and covered with cloth, and {{is said to have}} been developed in the 1200s. A form of dragon dance from Tongliang County (铜梁龙舞), which originated as snake totem worship, began during the Ming Dynasty and became popular in the Qing Dynasty. In the modern era, the government of People's Republic of China adapted and promoted various traditional folk dances, which contributed to the popularity of the current form of the dragon dance now found widely in China as well as Chinese communities around the world.|$|R
50|$|Between 1859 and 1862 three explosions {{claimed a}} dozen {{lives at the}} Ballincollig Mills. The first of these explosions {{took place in the}} dusting house on a Saturday in August 1859.

Early in the morning the pure gunpowder was removed between 30 and 40 barrels were brought alongside the barge-boat and 20-year-old John Corcoran looked after the barge-horse. The dusting house workers were William Looney, the foreman; Timothy Lyons and James Merrick. As the unloading proceeded, a sudden explosion demolished the dusting house and the adjoining press house; a buttress wall of stone and earth which separated the two timber buildings was also levelled. The five men were killed instantly and the huge crater left by the explosion was soon filled with canal water. Three of the bodies were recovered and brought to a nearby shed; a search commenced for the others.A more melancholy sight then this could not be imagined, surrounded as if it were relatives of the deceased, bewailing their fate with loud and incessant lamentations; but it was horrible in the extreme to see from time to time persons coming in, bringing in, wrapped in <b>grass</b> or <b>cloth,</b> a blackened cinder that was once a hand, a foot, or other portions of one of the dead men.

Biographical Note: Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic) in 1896, Norbert Troller served as a soldier in World War I, {{spending}} time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1981. updatedDoris RauchDigital imag...|$|E
50|$|A {{long time}} ago, the sky {{frequently}} fell {{down onto the}} earth. A young girl named Wa Shuang {{decided to make a}} big umbrella to prop the sky up. As she prepared the cloth, she left it under a pear tree. Pear blossoms then landed on the white cloth, which caused bees to come pollinate the flowers, leaving their wax on the cloth {{in the shape of the}} flowers. The secretions from the indigo <b>grass</b> underneath the <b>cloth</b> made the white cloth turn blue. When Wa Shuang returned she quickly took the cloth to the river to wash it clean. The blue color, however, would not wash out, even when using boiling water. Only the areas with the beeswax remained white, causing the blue canvas to be covered with the white flowers. Wa Shuang was overjoyed and used this cloth as an umbrella to prop up the sky. The blue canvas of this umbrella became the blue sky and the white flowers became heavenly bodies. Afterwards, Wa Shuang used this method to make batik art and taught it to the other girls in the village...|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{cloth and}} foliage {{effects can be}} very {{calculation}} intensive, and therefore they are notvery common in mobile games. Using effects that are both visually appealing and light onperformance could greatly improve the look of mobile games that usually don’t have effects likethese. I chose to limit {{the scope of the}} project to these cases. ● Cloth or foliage blowing in the wind● Foliage reacting to touch, like a player walking through it● Cloth or foliage reacting to bulletsIs it possible to, instead of using expensive physics calculations to simulate these effects, justapproximate the ‘look’ of it but still base it on reality?ResultIt is helpful to start with a look at physics even when writing simplified, non-physical effects. Byknowing exactly what causes the look you are after it’s much easier to mimic. I discovered thatmaterial stiffness is the most important property to define how a branch, some <b>grass</b> or somehanging <b>cloth</b> reacts to external forces. I decided to go with a shader based solution for all three effects, because of the performancebenefits over joints and vertex simulations. The wind shader is a common technique using sinewaves to make an offset to the vertex positions before drawing to the screen. The shader forfoliage reacting to touch builds on this by supplying it with a player position and movementvelocity. This is then used to make additional changes depending on how far away the player is. The shader reacting to bullets is very similar, but instead of player position it is supplied withbullet positions along the shooting vector. The vertices are the displaced by how close they areto this position creating an effect of the cloth stretching and then falling back in the direction ofthe shot. The first two effects worked out well, with good performance and a natural look. The shootingeffect though needs further improvement to be used in a game. Overall I believe shader trickslike these can be very useful in mobile games that want some extra detail but can’t afford vertexsimulation. Validerat; 20160701 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

Wallpaper and other flexible coverings offer a wide variety of color, patterns and textures, It is possible to find a paper to go with any style of furnishings, formal or informal, in a wide price range. Some patterns are coordinated with fabric. There are fabrics made especially for wall coverings which come with a paper backing. <b>Grass</b> <b>cloth</b> is an example.
