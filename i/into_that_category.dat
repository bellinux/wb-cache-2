25|$|In {{the case}} where {{parallel}} epochs defined in history were available, elaborate {{efforts were made to}} align European and Near Eastern sequences with the datable chronology of Ancient Egypt and other known civilizations. The resulting grand sequence was also spot checked by evidence of calculateable solar or other astronomical events. These methods are only available for the relatively short term of recorded history. Most prehistory does not fall <b>into</b> <b>that</b> <b>category.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{representative}} democracies, it may {{not benefit}} incumbents to conduct fair elections. A study showed that incumbents who rig elections stay in office 2.5 times as long as those who permit fair elections. Democracies in countries with high per capita income {{have been found to}} be less prone to violence, but in countries with low incomes the tendency is the reverse. Election misconduct is more likely in countries with low per capita incomes, small populations, rich in natural resources, and a lack of institutional checks and balances. Sub-Saharan countries, as well as Afghanistan, all tend to fall <b>into</b> <b>that</b> <b>category.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines {{gave the}} film a Grade A rating, {{making it one}} of only two films to qualify <b>into</b> <b>that</b> <b>category</b> at that point, and the only film to qualify in 2004. This rating gave Santa Santita a 100percent rebate on {{amusement}} taxes, and is only awarded to films that the Board feels can [...] "revitalize the moribund industry". The movie represented the Philippines at the Asiaticafilmediale festival in Italy, and was also shown at the Sine! Sine! Film Fest in San Francisco. It was a finalist in the Catholic Mass Media Awards, and represented the Philippines at the Bangkok International Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|As of 2009, {{new members}} can be {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players, builders or on-ice officials. The builders' category includes coaches, general managers, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game. The category for on-ice officials was added in 1961 and a [...] "veteran player" [...] category was established in 1988. The purpose of the category was to [...] "provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players". Eleven players were inducted <b>into</b> <b>that</b> <b>category,</b> but in 2000, the Board of Directors eliminated it; the players who had been inducted under this category were merged into the player category.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{agreed to}} Carter's request without asking {{the rest of}} the band, and when {{informed}} of the idea, the other members gave only tacit approval. They briefly considered playing an impromptu concert in the city, with Bono suggesting that they perform in the bunker where Carter and his friends hid during the siege. He said, [...] "even if all we get is some extra attention for Bosnia on MTV, that's something". The idea fell through when it was pointed out that the logistics of transporting their equipment into the city were impossible, as the only way into Sarajevo was on a United Nations plane. Manager Paul McGuinness realized that even if the band managed to organize a concert, it would endanger their lives and those of the audience and the Zoo TV crew. As he explained, [...] "U2's effort to discuss any humanitarian issue have sometimes been accompanied by a false instinct that U2 is also obliged to resolve that issue. Going to Sarajevo seems to me to fall <b>into</b> <b>that</b> <b>category.</b> I think it would endanger the people we go with, endanger the tour, and endanger the band." [...] Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. feared that the move would look like a publicity stunt.|$|E

The formula of making good music in your genre will give any artist more longevity was actually pioneered by Gucci. He showed artists that he could drop relevant music without an album, tour and make money and get big checks for features.

2500|$|... "The {{songs that}} I sing don't fall <b>into</b> <b>that</b> <b>category,</b> so I don't {{think about it}} at all. But I believe that music does {{influence}} people. It's a universal thing. Everybody listens to music and knows about it. I think that the lyrics can {{have a lot to}} do with influencing whoever you're singing to. I think that as far as children are concerned, parents should have control over what they listen to. If they don't want them to listen to records that are very sexual or explicit or outrageous, they should have control over that situation. As for adults, they're going to buy whatever kind of music they want to hear, so if they buy music with explicit lyrics, they must like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some legal {{scholars}} {{have questioned the}} legal reasoning of Marshall's opinion. They argue that Marshall selectively quoted the Judiciary Act of 1789, interpreting it to grant the Supreme Court the power to hear writs of mandamus on original jurisdiction. These scholars {{argue that there is}} little connection between the notion of original jurisdiction and the Supreme Court, and note that the Act seems to affirm the Court's power to exercise only appellate jurisdiction. Furthermore, {{it has been argued that}} the Supreme Court should have been able to issue the writ on original jurisdiction based on the fact that Article III of the Constitution granted it the right to review on original jurisdiction [...] "all cases affecting ... public ministers and consuls", and that James Madison, Secretary of State at the time and defendant of the suit, should have fallen <b>into</b> <b>that</b> <b>category</b> of a [...] "public minister [...] consul".|$|E
60|$|Edward Cossey did {{not come}} {{away from the scene}} of his {{engagement}} in a very happy or triumphant tone of mind. Ida's bitter words stung like whips, and he understood, and she clearly meant he should understand, that it was only in consideration of the money advanced that she had consented to become his wife. Now, however satisfactory it is to be rich enough to purchase your heart's desire in this fashion, it is not altogether soothing to the pride of a nineteenth-century man to be continually haunted by the thought that he is a buyer in the market and nothing but a buyer. Of course, he saw clearly enough that there was an object in all this--he saw that Ida, by making obvious her dislike, wished to disgust him with his bargain, and escape from an alliance of which the prospect was hateful to her. But {{he had no intention of}} being so easily discouraged. In the first place his passion for the woman was as a devouring flame, eating ever at his heart. In that at any rate he was sincere; he did love her so far as his nature was capable of love, or at any rate he had the keenest desire to make her his wife. A delicate-minded man would probably have shrunken from forcing himself upon a woman under parallel circumstances; but Edward Cossey did not happen to fall <b>into</b> <b>that</b> <b>category.</b> As a matter of fact such men are not as common as they might be.|$|E

Titles like Maus (Spiegelman, 1986) and Persepolis (Satrapi, 2004) have become staples in the stacks for their academic relevance and accessible style of delivering information through visually striking art. While some libraries have comprehensive collections and budgets to support them, {{many do not}} and thus have a collection that lacks cohesion and scope. The Brandeis University collection fell <b>into</b> <b>that</b> latter <b>category,</b> and we aimed to correct that.
