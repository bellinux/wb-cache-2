60|$|It was the general-in-chief. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{but said}} nothing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{a hopeless}} {{expression}} upon his vacuous, good-natured, scrubby little face.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> stupidly for a moment. Then {{he laughed}} in a silly, {{crackling}} fashion.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{stopped and}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It {{was like being}} at an aquarium.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Then a sudden flash of intelligence lit up his features.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is stolid {{without being}} stupid," [...] she explained. [...] "He is entirely self-centered. I smile at him, and he waits patiently until I have {{finished}} {{to get on}} with our business. I have said quite nice things to him and <b>he</b> has <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> without change of expression, absolutely without pleasure or emotion of any sort." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{for a long}} moment, {{speechless}} in his utter amazement. Then {{he swallowed}} hard.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> speechlessly for a moment, and then, out {{of sheer}} impotency, turned to go.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I {{suppose the}} question, {{led up to}} by no {{previous}} remark, was unusual.|$|E
60|$|When {{the king}} first {{expressed}} his wish to me, I made known to him my utter abhorrence of the measure, and worked myself {{into such a}} state of excitement, that <b>he</b> absolutely <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in amazement. It evidently surpassed his majesty’s comprehension how any sober-minded and sensible individual could entertain the least possible objection to so beautifying an operation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we'll follow," [...] says Nick, {{beginning}} to pace again. Suddenly, at a {{cry from the}} widow, <b>he</b> stopped and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> a light in his eye like a point of steel. His hand slipped to his waist.|$|R
6000|$|He {{tried to}} meet my gaze. [...] "No!" [...] he said suddenly, and turning went {{bounding}} away from me through the undergrowth. Then <b>he</b> turned and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again. His eyes shone brightly out of the dusk under the trees.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{without the}} {{slightest}} movement. I held his eyes with mine. I spoke very slowly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> piteously. The noble sentiments which I had {{inherited}} from Doctor Pratolungo, completely bewildered Mr. Oscar Dubourg.|$|E
60|$|Stroeve {{was silent}} again, and <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with his mouth}} open and his round blue eyes {{starting}} out of his head.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} I {{could not speak}} to him, and, {{encumbered}} with baby, dish, spoon, and children, <b>he</b> could only <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a sudden brightening of the altered face that made it full of welcome before a word was uttered.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I don't {{think he was}} aware that the story of the midnight arrest had been ferreted out by an English journalist and given to the world. When I explained this to him he muttered contemptuously, [...] "It may have been altogether a lie." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was sorry}} I said that last, but it whipped out before I knew. I {{could see it}} took {{the wind out of}} his sails, and <b>he</b> stood and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with his brow drawn up. Then I suppose he made up his mind he must {{get to the bottom of}} this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] she replied; [...] "a perfect stranger. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in {{the most}} impertinent manner. Does he belong to this place?" ...|$|E
60|$|I nodded. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for {{a moment}} with an astonishment to which I was wholly indifferent. He {{did not seem to}} know just how to act.|$|E
60|$|Ill as I was, I forgot my sufferings {{the moment}} I looked at him. Wild and haggard, <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with bloodshot eyes {{like a man}} demented.|$|E
60|$|I placed my rapier on {{the table}} and waited for him to speak. Instead, however, <b>he</b> {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for some moments, and when at last he did break the silence, it was to burst into a laugh that poured from his throat in rich, mellow peals, as he lay back in his chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep them," [...] he said, and {{snatched}} at a yawn. <b>He</b> stood up, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for a moment, and smiled. [...] "You {{have had two}} eventful days," [...] said he. [...] "I should advise some sleep. I'm glad it's all clear. Good-night." [...] He thought me over for a moment, then went out by the inner door.|$|R
40|$|Nicky is {{standing}} over {{there by the}} edge of the field looking at something. He 2 ̆ 7 s the one that killed Caspar. He and his friend Rocco. We can 2 ̆ 7 t prove it though, since no one actually saw them, and we never found Caspar 2 ̆ 7 s body. He doesn’t notice me right away, then he does, and I watch the way his body suddenly goes on alert. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for a moment, and even though he 2 ̆ 7 s still fifty feet away, I can see his eyes. He starts coming toward me, and I stop where I am on the gravel road to see what he will do. As he gets closer, he slows his pace and starts crouching down, his eyes still fixed on me. It 2 ̆ 7 s as if he 2 ̆ 7 s in slow motion, one leg slowly going out in front of the other. By the time he reaches me his stomach is practically scraping the ground, and his ears are pulled back. It 2 ̆ 7 s what they do if they think you 2 ̆ 7 re more powerful than they are and they don 2 ̆ 7 t want a fight...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{will replace}} Don John in Flanders?" [...] I asked him quietly. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "He {{is useful to}} you there. Use him, Sire, to your own ends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How long?" [...] said he, {{taking his}} black pipe from his mouth, and {{dropping}} his jaw as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I'm not a going back. I've come for good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Vincent Cawdor," [...] she continued, [...] "came in alone. He {{looked just}} as {{objectionable}} as ever, and <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> till I nearly threw my wine glass at him." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{stopped and}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I felt all that foolish {{incapacity}} an Englishman feels on such occasions. I met {{his eyes for}} a moment, and then stared out of the window. For a long space we kept silence. When at last I looked at him he was sitting back in his corner, his arms folded and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles.|$|R
6000|$|... "No hand--just {{an empty}} sleeve. Lord! I thought, that's a deformity! Got a cork arm, I suppose, {{and has taken}} it off. Then, I thought, there's {{something}} odd in that. What the devil keeps that sleeve up and open, if there's nothing in it? There was nothing in it, I tell you. Nothing down it, {{right down to the}} joint. I could see right down it to the elbow, and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of the cloth. 'Good God!' I said. Then <b>he</b> stopped. <b>Stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with those black goggles of his, and then at his sleeve." ...|$|R
60|$|He went on gazing in {{a vacant}} {{way at the}} water below, an ineffectual patrician smile playing feebly round {{the corners of his}} mouth meanwhile. Then <b>he</b> turned and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as I lay back in my deck-chair. For a minute he looked me over as if I were a horse for sale. When he had {{finished}} inspecting me, he beckoned to somebody at the far end of the quarter-deck.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> nasty for a moment, {{and then}} ’e ses: [...] "You ain’t seen any young lady hanging about ’ere, I suppose, Bill? A tall young lady {{with a blue}} hat trimmed with red roses?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if I {{had struck}} him--as {{he might have}} stared, rather, at a child who had struck him, {{undecided}} whether to strike back for the child's good, or to be amused and smile.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as if this}} {{announcement}} of his would have crushed me to the earth, but I smiled at him in my turn, and looked him up and down, with a twirl of my moustache.|$|E
60|$|I lighted a candle, {{folded the}} note and sealed it, {{addressed}} it to Mrs. Clive, and opening the latticed door I stepped out. Walking along the gallery until I {{came to the}} rear {{part of the house}} which faced towards the out-buildings, I spied three figures prone on the grass under a pecan tree that shaded the kitchen roof. One of these figures was Benjy, and he was taking his siesta. I descended quietly from the gallery, and making my way to him, touched him on the shoulder. <b>He</b> awoke and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with white eyes.|$|R
60|$|As I {{stand at}} the street corner, I don't see {{as many as four}} people at once going to church, though I see as many as four churches with their {{steeples}} clamouring for people. I choose my church, and go up the flight of steps to the great entrance in the tower. A mouldy tower within, and like a neglected washhouse. A rope comes through the beamed roof, and a man in the corner pulls it and clashes the bell--a whity-brown man, whose clothes were once black- -a man with flue on him, and cobweb. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> wondering how I come there, and I <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> him, wondering how he comes there. Through a screen of wood and glass, I peep into the dim church. About twenty people are discernible, waiting to begin. Christening would seem to have faded out of this church long ago, for the font has the dust of desuetude thick upon it, and its wooden cover (shaped like an old-fashioned tureen-cover) looks as if it wouldn't come off, upon requirement. I perceive the altar to be rickety and the Commandments damp. Entering after this survey, I jostle the clergyman in his canonicals, who is entering too from a dark lane behind a pew of state with curtains, where nobody sits. The pew is ornamented with four blue wands, once carried by four somebodys, I suppose, before somebody else, but which there is nobody now to hold or receive honour from. I open the door of a family pew, and shut myself in; if I could occupy twenty family pews at once I might have them. The clerk, a brisk young man (how does HE come here?), glances <b>at</b> <b>me</b> knowingly, as who should say, 'You have done it now; you must stop.' Organ plays. Organ-loft is in a small gallery across the church; gallery congregation, two girls. I wonder within myself what will happen when we are required to sing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me see!" [...] {{said the}} witch, putting her {{forefinger}} to her lips, {{with a little}} frown, and then stretching out the finger with decision. [...] "Short--just above my shoulder--crying to make himself tall by turning up his mustache and keeping his beard long--a glass in his right eye {{to give him an}} air of distinction--a strong opinion about his waistcoat, but uncertain and trimming about the weather, on which he will try to draw <b>me</b> out. <b>He</b> will <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> all the while, and the glass in his eye will cause him to make horrible faces, especially when he smiles in a flattering way. I shall cast down my eyes in consequence, and he will perceive that I am not indifferent to his attentions. I shall dream that night that I am looking at the extraordinary face of a magnified insect--and the next morning he will make an offer of his hand; the sequel as before." ...|$|R
