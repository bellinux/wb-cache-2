From 2010 to 2015, eels entering the Belgian Meuse River (n = 1357; total length, 231 – 755 mm) were caught in fish passes, tagged with a pit-tag and released. Their upstream movements were tracked during the next six consecutive years, using three <b>detection</b> <b>stations</b> installed in vertical-slot fish passes of the Meuse and its Ourthe tributary. Among the 1357 eels tagged, 27. 6 % (n = 374 individuals) were detected at {{one or more of}} the three upstream <b>detection</b> <b>stations.</b> Only 6. 6 % (n = 89) of tagged eels were detected at the two subsequent stations. In this last group, most of the detected eels continued to move upstream through the Meuse rather than leaving it for the Ourthe. Water temperature > 13 °C, river flow 24 – 226 m 3 /s, dark time 00 : 00 – 05 : 00 h and the spring–summer seasons were the most important cues for upstream migration. Temperatures and flows at detection did not differ between size classes of ascending eels, while the detection period was earlier and daily speed was faster in large (> 450 mm) eels. However, small (300 mm) eels moved further upstream at slow speeds because they alternated between short periods of movement and long stationary periods. This behaviour suggests the existence of a few nomad individuals and probably more home range dwellers in the entering population. Small eels were better suited to colonise upper rivers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Alarm systems detect {{avalanche}} flows, mud-flows or {{the opening}} of cracks in rock walls and automatically close roads and railway lines with traffic lights in case a dangerous event occurs. Eight new detecting systems have been built in Switzerland during {{the last five years}} using technology similar to that used in the Swiss avalanche and natural disaster warning system, IMIS, that consists now of more than 120 remote stations throughout the Swiss Alps. The alarm systems protect two narrow gauge railway lines and four access roads. To detect avalanche flow, three different types of sensors are used in combination: a medium range Doppler radar to detect avalanches already uphill from the <b>detection</b> <b>station,</b> force measurements in steel cables tied across the avalanche track equipped with vertical detecting cables reaching into the dense flow cross section, and geophones to measure vibrations in cables or seismic signals caused by avalanches. Crack openings are measured with special extensometers, mudflow, sediment- and boulder flow using a combined acoustic, force and vibration sensor. All systems are solar powered and radio controlled. Alarm conditions are transmitted as a specially coded short message from the detecting systems to the traffic light control systems. In several cases the traffic light systems are also solar powered. All systems are connected to control centres by radio- phone links. As well as the causes of alarms, system performance is continuously self checked and indicated at the control centres. These setups, based on Campbell loggers, guarantee very high reliability. So far the systems never failed to close traffic lines in cases of avalanches or mud-flows that blocked the road or track. 1...|$|E

Lightning detection systems use a hybrid location method of direction finding (DF) and the time difference of arrival (TOA). The stations use four localization algorithms, including two-station mixing, three-station mixing, four-station mixing and two-station amplitude. Among them, the four-station method has the highest positioning accuracy, i. e., close to 50  %. The statistical results show that lightning occurrences in China have increased, especially negative cloud-to-ground (−CG) flashes because positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) flashes account for only 5. 1  % of the total. In china, most of lightning currents range are in the − 60  ~ + 60  kA, Lightning current between − 10  ~ + 10  kA only accounted for small proportion of 0. 6  %. The average intensity of positive flashes is 64. 2  kA, the average intensity of negative flashes is − 40. 28  kA.

40|$|A {{new concept}} for a CDS has been {{developed}} under a Phase I ARPA funded program; it uses gamma resonance absorption (GRA) to detect certain illegal drugs that may be transported in man-portable containers. A high detection probability for heroin and cocaine is possible with a device that is also searching for explosives. Elemental detection of both N and Cl is utilized, and with tomography, a 3 D density image of the elements is generated. Total density image is also developed. These two together may be used with considerable confidence in determining if heroin or cocaine {{is present in the}} interrogated containers in a small quantity (1 kg). The CDS employs a high current ({ge} 10 mA) DC accelerator that produces a beam of 1. 75 or 1. 89 MeV protons. These protons impact a target with coatings of {sup 13 }C and {sup 34 }S. Depending on the coating, the resultant resonant gamma rays are preferentially absorbed in either {sup 14 }N or {sup 35 }Cl. The resonant gammas come off the target in a conical fan at 80. 7 {degree} for N and 82 {degree} for Cl; a common array of segmented BGO detectors is used over an arc of 53 {degree} to provide input to an imaging subsystem. The tomography makes use of rotation and vertical translation of a baggage carousel holding typically 18 average sized bags for batch processing of the contents. The single proton accelerator and target can supply multiple detection stations with the appropriate gammas, a feature that may lead to very high throughput potential approaching 2000 bags/hr.

40|$|DR 2002 / 08 Departament d'EIO - Research Supported by PRIME European ProjectReal-time {{models for}} {{estimating}} incident probabilities (EIP models) are innovative methods for predicting the potential occurrence of incidents {{and improving the}} effectiveness of incident management policies devoted to increasing road safety. EIP models imbedded in traffic management systems {{can lead to the}} development of control strategies for reducing the likelihood of incidents before they occur. This paper presents and discusses the design, implementation and off-line testing of an EIP model in the PRIME (Prediction of Congestion and Incidents in Real Time for Intelligent Incident Management and Emergency Traffic Management) Project of the “Information Societies Technology Programme” of the EU. A statistically-oriented approach based on Generalized Linear Regression models with polytomous responses is developed: geometry, traffic and weather conditions are taken as explanatory variables at a road section level and a binary variable related to incident occurrence or otherwise for the prevailing conditions is taken as a response variable on the first level of decision. Once the probability of a generic incident has been predicted, the lower level models in the selected hierarchical approach will predict the probabilities of incidents in a set of categories defined at a design level. The EIP model has been incorporated in the AIMSUN microscopic simulation environment (developed by TSS). AIMSUN is able to emulate a traffic management system, since it simulates traffic evolution including the replication of observed incidents and incorporates different modules of incident and traffic management {{in such a way that}} the impact of traffic management strategies can be evaluated by simulation.
