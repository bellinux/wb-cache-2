5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E
25|$|In telecommunications, lambda {{indicates}} the wavelength in a wavelength-division multiplexing optical communications system. This {{is actually a}} form of the long-established concept of <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing.|$|E
25|$|COFDM {{stands for}} Coded {{orthogonal}} <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing. It differs from OFDM because in COFDM, {{forward error correction}} {{is applied to the}} signal before transmission. This is done to overcome errors. COFDM and OFDM are sometimes used as synonyms.|$|E
25|$|The term wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} {{is commonly}} applied to an optical carrier, which is typically described by its wavelength, whereas <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing typically applies to a radio carrier {{which is more}} often described by frequency. This is purely convention because wavelength and frequency communicate the same information.|$|E
25|$|Orthogonal <b>frequency-division</b> {{multiplexing}} (OFDM) is {{a method}} of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies. OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital communication, used in applications such as digital television and audio broadcasting, DSL Internet access, wireless networks, powerline networks, and 4G mobile communications.|$|E
25|$|Satellite {{navigation}} {{systems such}} as GPS and GLONASS. All current systems use LFSR outputs to generate {{some or all of}} their ranging codes (as the chipping code for CDMA or DSSS) or to modulate the carrier without data (like GPSL2CL ranging code). GLONASS also uses <b>frequency-division</b> multiple access combined with DSSS.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} techniques {{make the}} receivers very complex, {{and therefore they}} are typically combined with Orthogonal <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing (OFDM) or with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) modulation, where the problems created by a multi-path channel are handled efficiently. The IEEE 802.16e standard incorporates MIMO-OFDMA. The IEEE 802.11n standard, released in October 2009, recommends MIMO-OFDM.|$|E
500|$|The {{first volume}} {{production}} of mechanical filters was undertaken by Collins Radio Company {{starting in the}} 1950s. These were originally designed for telephone <b>frequency-division</b> multiplex applications where there is commercial advantage in using high quality filters. Precision and steepness of the transition band leads to a reduced width of guard band, which in turn leads {{to the ability to}} squeeze more telephone channels into the same cable. [...] This same feature is useful in radio transmitters for much the same reason. [...] Mechanical filters quickly also found popularity in VHF/UHF radio intermediate frequency (IF) stages of the high end radio sets (military, marine, amateur radio and the like) manufactured by Collins. [...] They were favoured in the radio application because they could achieve much higher Q-factors than the equivalent LC filter. [...] High Q allows filters to be designed which have high selectivity, important for distinguishing adjacent radio channels in receivers. [...] They also had an advantage in stability over both LC filters and monolithic crystal filters. The most popular design for radio applications was torsional resonators because radio IF typically lies in the 100 to 500kHz band.|$|E
2500|$|In {{orthogonal}} <b>frequency-division</b> {{multiple access}} (OFDMA), <b>frequency-division</b> multiple access {{is achieved by}} assigning different OFDM sub-channels to different users. OFDMA supports differentiated quality of service by assigning different number of sub-carriers to different users {{in a similar fashion}} as in CDMA, and thus complex packet scheduling or Media Access Control schemes can be avoided. OFDMA is used in: ...|$|E
2500|$|Campbell's work on loading coils {{provided}} the theoretical basis for his subsequent work on filters which {{proved to be}} so important for <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing. [...] The cut-off phenomena of loading coils, an undesirable side-effect, can be exploited to produce a desirable filter frequency response.|$|E
2500|$|SSB {{was also}} used over long {{distance}} telephone lines, {{as part of a}} technique known as <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing (FDM). FDM was pioneered by telephone companies in the 1930s. This enabled many voice channels to be sent down a single physical circuit, for example in L-carrier. [...] SSB allowed channels to be spaced (usually) just 4,000Hz apart, while offering a speech bandwidth of nominally 3003,400Hz.|$|E
2500|$|OFDM is a <b>frequency-division</b> {{multiplexing}} (FDM) scheme used as {{a digital}} multi-carrier modulation method. [...] A large number of closely spaced orthogonal sub-carrier signals are used to carry data [...] on several parallel data streams or channels. Each sub-carrier is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme (such as quadrature amplitude modulation or phase-shift keying) at a low symbol rate, maintaining total data rates similar to conventional single-carrier modulation schemes in the same bandwidth.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{scheme is}} {{orthogonal}} <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing (OFDM), {{which refers to}} the use, by a single transmitter, {{of a set of}} frequency multiplexed signals with the exact minimum frequency spacing needed to make them orthogonal so that they do not interfere with each other. [...] Well known examples include (a, g, and n) versions of 802.11 Wi-Fi; WiMAX; ITU-T G.hn, DVB-T, the terrestrial digital TV broadcast system used in most of the world outside North America; and DMT (Discrete Multi Tone), the standard form of ADSL.|$|E

50|$|Two-way radios can be {{designed}} as full-duplex systems, transmitting on one frequency and receiving on another; this is also called <b>frequency-division</b> duplex. <b>Frequency-division</b> duplex systems can extend their range by using sets of simple repeater stations because the communications transmitted on any single frequency always travel in the same direction.|$|E
50|$|Orthogonal <b>frequency-division</b> {{multiplexing}} (OFDM), {{which is}} used in both the ITU Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) and IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN standards, has some of {{its roots in the}} Packet Ensemble Protocol.

50|$|Carrier systems {{typically}} transmit multiple {{channels of}} communication simultaneously over the shared medium using various forms of multiplexing. Prominent multiplexing methods of the carrier signal are time-division multiplexing (TDM) and <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing (FDM). A cable television system {{is an example of}} <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing. Many television programs are carried simultaneously on the same coaxial cable by sending each at a different frequency. Multiple layers of multiplexing may ultimately be performed upon a given input signal. For example, in the public switched telephone network, many telephone calls are sent over shared trunk lines by time-division multiplexing. For long distance calls several of these channels may be sent over a communications satellite link by <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing. At a given receiving node, specific channels may be demultiplexed individually.|$|E
50|$|The <b>frequency-division</b> {{multiple}} access (FDMA) channel-access scheme {{is based on}} the <b>frequency-division</b> multiplexing (FDM) scheme, which provides different frequency bands to different data-streams. In the FDMA case, the data streams are allocated to different nodes or devices. An example of FDMA systems were the first-generation (1G) cell-phone systems, where each phone call was assigned to a specific uplink frequency channel, and another downlink frequency channel. Each message signal (each phone call) is modulated on a specific carrier frequency.|$|E
5000|$|... === <b>Frequency-division</b> {{duplexing}} === <b>Frequency-division</b> duplexing (FDD) {{means that}} the transmitter and receiver operate at different carrier frequencies. The term is frequently used in ham radio operation, where an operator is attempting to contact a repeater station.

This mode of operation is referred to as duplex mode or offset mode.|$|E
