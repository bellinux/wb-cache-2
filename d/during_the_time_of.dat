40|$|Why do banks squeeze their lending activity? is an oft-repeated {{question}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> financial crisis. This {{study examines}} an emerging economy’s banking system {{and contributes to}} the evolving body of literature on the topic by providing answers as to what causes the sluggish bank credit <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> recession. By employing cointegration technique, the study shows that bank credit has a significant positive relationship with the borrowing activity of the banks and on the contrary, inverse relationship with investment activity <b>during</b> <b>the</b> financial crisis. Accordingly, we suggest that banks could increase their lending by increasing the borrowings rapidly either from the Central Banks or from Government supported long term lending institutions during recessionary periods. ...|$|R

5|$|As it {{has been}} since the {{creation}} of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed to be registered.
