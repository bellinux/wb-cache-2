40|$|Graduation date: 1970 This {{study was}} an {{evaluation}} of fabric serviceability and consumer acceptance of polypropylene blend knits. A review of literature indicates a trend toward polypropylene blend fabrics for wearing apparel, specifically for knits. The purpose of the research was to compare two experimental <b>double</b> <b>knit</b> fabrics, a 50 percent Creslan/Herculon blend and a 50 percent rayon/Herculon blend. The <b>double</b> <b>knit</b> blends, constructed of a French pique stitch, were developed into pre-school boys' golf-style shirts. Fabric serviceability was tested through ten weeks of actual wear by seven nursery school boys, and in the textile laboratory for abrasion resistance, wrinkle recovery and for actual thickness. Consumer acceptance was subjectively evaluated by {{the parents of the}} boys, a panel of Oregon State University Clothing and Textiles faculty members, the nursery school supervisor, and the writer. The results of this study indicated that consumers will accept and purchase polypropylene blend shirts on the assumptions that the fabric will 1) provide superior serviceability, 2) resist stains and wrinkles, 3) return to original appearance with limited care, 4) be obtainable {{in a wide range of}} bright colors, and 5) be within a competitive price range to shirts of comparable style and fabric. Laboratory tests correlated with natural wear testing indicating both knit blends will pill, will not absorb moisture, will be colorfast, and will increase in thickness when exposed to a fluff drying cycle. The serviceability of the Creslan/Herculon blend was evaluated as being superior to the rayon/Herculon <b>double</b> <b>knit</b> for abrasion and wrinkle resistance...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike other {{multicolour}} techniques (including Fair Isle, slip-stitch colour, and <b>double</b> <b>knitting),</b> {{there is}} only one [...] "active" [...] colour on any given stitch, and yarn is not carried across the back of the work; when a colour changes on a given row, the old yarn is left hanging. This means that any intarsia piece is topologically several disjoint columns of colour; a simple blue circle on a white background involves one column of blue and two of whiteâone for the left and one for the right. Intarsia is most often worked flat, rather than in the round. However, it is possible to knit intarsia in circular knitting using particular techniques.|$|R
2500|$|Weft-knit fabrics {{may also}} be knit with {{multiple}} yarns, usually to produce interesting color patterns. [...] The two most common approaches are intarsia and stranded colorwork.

Another knitwear development involved varying the lines of the classic T-shirt so that it could be extended into dress-length versions, long or short sleeves, and other variations, including, by 1960, a sequined long evening version by Kasper for Arnold & Fox. In the 1960s, American sportswear depended on very simple shapes, often made in vivid colours and bold, geometric prints (such as those by Gernreich and Donald Brooks).|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse and model the effect of {{knitting}} parameters on the thermal resistance of Cotton/Polyester <b>double</b> layer interlock <b>knitted</b> fabrics. Fabric samples of areal densities ranging from 310 - 495 g/m 2 were knitted using yarns of three different cotton/polyester blends, each of two different linear densities by systematically varying knitting loop lengths for achieving different cover factors. It was found that by changing the polyester content in the inner and outer fabric layer from 40 to 65 % in the <b>double</b> layer <b>knitted</b> fabric has statistically significant effect on the fabric thermal resistance. Fabric thermal resistance increased with increase in relative specific heat of outer fabric layer, yarn linear density, loop length and fabric thickness while decrease in fabric areal density.

40|$|In {{the false}} twist {{texturing}} process a moving threadline {{is subjected to}} temporary twist while heat is applied to part of the twist zone. The purpose of the process is to heat set the twist deformation so that after cooling and twist removal, the filaments will seek {{to return to their}} set helically crimped paths. This crimping action leads to bulk and/or stretch development such as is encountered in <b>double</b> <b>knit</b> suitings and/or stretch hosiery. During processing, the entire twisted threadline is under constant tension and torque, but is not at constant temperature, since part of it is intentionally heated to effect the setting process. The threadline is thus divided into three contiguous zones, all under the same stress field but each with different mechanical properties. The threadline tension is a result o...|$|R
25|$|The next {{process is}} to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to {{strengthen}} the resulting slubbing such {{that it can be}} wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for <b>double</b> <b>knitting</b> yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
50|$|Some {{time after}} Foale and Tuffin dissolved, Foale {{decided to move}} into knitwear. Hand knit was {{important}} at this time and everybody was knitting sweaters with pictures on them, or Arran and Fairisle styles. These garments were two-dimensional, flat shapes, more or less like a âTâ shape, and Foale wanted to create timeless designs {{with the emphasis on}} perfect detail. She soon realised that there was a market for the designs she was creating and so was launched Foale Ltd. In 1985 Marion Foale produced a knitting pattern book which was designed to be simple, with the most desirable, easy patterns for people to knit at home, using four ply and <b>double</b> <b>knitting.</b> She then moved into knitting three-dimensionally, making garments that were tailored and shaped just like a jacket. In 1987, Foale opened a shop in Hinde Street, near Marylebone High Street.|$|R
50|$|Jersey is a {{knit fabric}} used {{predominantly}} for clothing manufacture. It was originally made of wool, {{but is now}} made of wool, cotton, and synthetic fibres. Since medieval times Jersey, Channel Islands, where the material was first produced, had been an important exporter of knitted goods and the fabric in wool from Jersey became well known. The fabric {{can be a very}} stretchy single knitting, usually light-weight, jersey with one flat side and one piled side. When made with a lightweight yarn, this is the fabric most often used to make T-shirts. Or it can be a <b>double</b> <b>knitted</b> jersey (interlock jersey), with less stretch, that creates a heavier fabric of two single jerseys knitted together to leave the two flat sides on the outsides of the fabric, with the piles in the middle. Jersey is considered to be an excellent fabric for draped garments, such as dresses, and women's tops.|$|R
50|$|The third needle type {{consists}} of circular needles, which are long, flexible double-pointed needles. The two tapered ends (typically 5 in long) are rigid and straight, allowing for easy knitting; however, the two ends are {{connected by a}} flexible strand (usually nylon) that allows the two ends to be brought together. Circular needles are typically 24-60 inches long, and are usually used singly or in pairs; again, {{the width of the}} knitted piece may be significantly longer than the length of the circular needle. Special kits are available that allow circular needles of various lengths and diameters to be made as needed; rigid ends of various diameters may be screwed into strands of various lengths. The ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of <b>double</b> <b>knitting.</b> Circular needles may be used for flat or circular knitting.|$|R
