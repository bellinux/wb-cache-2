40|$|It is {{well known}} that one needs an {{external}} source of energy to provide voltage amplification. Because of this, conventional circuit elements such as resistors, inductors or capacitors cannot provide amplification all by themselves. Here, we demonstrate that a ferroelectric can cause a differential amplification without needing such an external energy source. As the ferroelectric switches from one polarization state to the other, a transfer of energy takes place from the ferroelectric to the dielectric, determined by the ratio of their capacitances, which, in turn, leads to the differential amplification. {This amplification is very different in nature from conventional inductor-capacitor based circuits where an oscillatory amplification can be observed. The demonstration of <b>differential</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>amplification</b> from completely passive capacitor elements only, has fundamental ramifications for next generation electronics...|$|E

50|$|The charge-transfer {{amplifier}} (CTA) is {{an electronic}} amplifier circuit. Also known as transconveyance amplifiers, CTAs amplify electronic signals by dynamically conveying charge between capacitive nodes {{in proportion to}} the size of a <b>differential</b> input <b>voltage.</b> By appropriately selecting the relative node capacitances, <b>voltage</b> <b>amplification</b> occurs by the charge-voltage relationship of capacitors. CTAs are clocked, or sampling, amplifiers. They consume zero static power and can be designed to consume (theoretically) arbitrarily low dynamic power, proportional to the size of input signals being sampled. CMOS technology is most commonly used for implementation. CTAs were introduced in memory circuits in the 1970s, and more recently have been applied in multi-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). They are also used in dynamic voltage comparator circuits.|$|R
