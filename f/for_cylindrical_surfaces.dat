40|$|Because we, surveyors, {{architects and}} archaeologists, {{are used to}} {{describing}} objects in planar projections (planimetry, elevation), most orthophoto software {{have been designed to}} change a quasi-central projection into a true orthographic projection. This kind of projection is not really suitable <b>for</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surfaces.</b> To enable the complete study of rotund tower surfaces, a specific process has been designed. The idea is to use the nearest cylinder as the surface of projection. Thanks to a motorised reflectorless total station, an accurate 3 D point cloud is scanned. These points are used to calculate the best cylinder of projection (vertical axis co-ordinates, radius) and interpolated to produce a digital model of the real surface. For each digital image, the photogrammetric equations are calculated, derived from control points identified on the photo. It's then easy to link the orthophoto cylindrical co-ordinates to the pixel co-ordinates of the image to rectify it. The rectified images are gathered to produce a general view of the surface, as if the tower were unwrapped on the sheet. It's now possible to undertake an accurate analysis of cylindrical monuments: stone arrangements, distribution of windows, doors or chimneys. Any orthographic view can be produced automatically by choosing a direction of projection. The digital model can be used to get geometrical data: accuracy of the tower building, shifting of the centre between different floors. This method has already been used for several surveys: the antique tower in the Laudun oppidum, in the south of France, and the towers of the Blandy-les-Tours castle, near Paris...|$|E
40|$|Semianalytical {{expressions}} {{are developed}} for creeping flame spread parallel to a fuel cylinder axis so that spread rates measured or predicted for flat surfaces {{over the same}} material can be directly used <b>for</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Two phenomena are identified that cause an increased flame spread rate in the cylin-drical over the flat surface geometry: (1) increased heat transfer from the gas phase and (2) faster tem-perature increase of the solid phase. Analytical expressions from approximate solution to a conserved scalar equation are developed for the flame spread rate by simplifying the flowfield using an Oseen approximation for the opposing flow. The spread rate expression for the fuel cylinder is L Lsy s 4 4 q c (T T) V L 1 C(L /R) E /ln 1 C L er(T T) s s v o f sy g o FL g v o 2 R Ro o in which the terms containing the constant C account for the enhanced gas-to-surface heat transfer because of the cylindrical curvature, and those containing Lsy, the heated layer depth in the solid, account for {{a reduction in the}} solid volume preheated in the cylindrical compared to the flat geometry. The expression is tuned by comparison with complete numerical solutions to the flame spread problem from which the flame energy EFL is determined from the flat surface geometry and the constant C chosen from heat transfer correlations. Results compare favorably with numerical solutions for cylindrical spread in forced and natural flows and microgravity and with experiments on downward flame spread on cylindrical rods in normal gravity and microgravity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this work, laser forming of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surfaces</b> with {{arbitrary}} {{radius of}} curvature is investigated experimentally and numerically. For laser forming of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surfaces</b> with arbitrary {{radius of curvature}}, a new and comprehensive method is proposed in this paper. This method contains simple linear irradiating lines and using an analytical method, required process parameters for laser forming of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surface</b> with a specific radius of curvature is proposed. In this method, laser output power, laser scanning speed and laser beam diameter are selected based on laser machine and process limitations.

40|$|In this paper, {{a system}} which {{constructs}} a mosaic image of the tunnel surface with little distortion is presented. The tunnel surface is typically composed of a roughly <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surface</b> and protuberant regions containing objects such as pipes, pans and tunnel ridges. Since the true surface is neither planar nor quadric, existing mosaicing methods, which assume either homography or quadratic motion models, suffer from distortion. The proposed system obtains a sparse 3 D model of the tunnel by multi-view reconstruction. Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is applied in order to separate image features lying on the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surface</b> {{from those of the}} non-surface. The reconstructed 3 D points are reprojected into images to retrieve the priors given by the SVM classifier <b>for</b> accurate <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surface</b> estimation. The final mosaic image is obtained by flattening the estimated textured surface onto a plane.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis we extend the null field {{approach}} (in the literature also {{often referred to}} as "the T matrix method" or "the extended boundary condition method") to some new multiple scattering problems involving infinite <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surfaces</b> and a bounded obstacle. The first case considered is the scattering of acoustic waves by a bounded obstacle outside an infinite cylinder of constant cross section. The incident wave is chosen as a plane wave and we apply sound-hard boundary conditions. An elastic infinite circular cylinder with an embedded obstacle is the configuration investigated next. Here the boundary conditions are those of vanishing surface tractions and both the case of guided modes and when the cylinder is excited by a point force, applied perpendicularly to its surface, are considered. This geometry is then further extended by adding an additional <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surface,</b> thus yielding a cylindrical pipe with an embedded obstacle. Also in this case we apply vanishing surface traction to the boundaries involved and we excite the pipe by applying a point force on its outer <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surface.</b> In all cases the scattered field is obtained as an expression containing the transition matrix for the obstacle, the reflection matrices <b>for</b> the participating <b>cylindrical</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the transformation function between the cylindrical and spherical basis functions and, for the cases when it is utilized in the derivation, the translation function <b>for</b> the <b>cylindrical</b> waves.
