5|$|The {{original}} {{composition of}} the coins was sterling (0.925) silver. In common with all British silver coins, the <b>fineness</b> was reduced to 0.500 in 1921. In 1947 silver was removed from all circulating British coinage in favour of cupronickel, but as it was felt to be inappropriate to strike Maundy coins in base metal, their <b>fineness</b> was restored to 0.925. On Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, the pound sterling became decimalised, with 100 new pence instead of 20 shillings of 12 pence (240 pence) in a pound. No change was made {{to the design of}} the Maundy pieces, and all Maundy pieces, both pre- and post-Decimal Day, are by law deemed denominated in new pence, more than doubling the face value of the pre-1971 pieces. The Maundy pieces continue to use the original obverse design for Queen Elizabeth II by Mary Gillick, although the bust of the Queen on other British coins has been repeatedly replaced as she ages. At the time of decimalisation, the Royal Mint Advisory Commission recommended the retention out of affection for the Gillick design; this was accepted by the Queen.|$|E

5|$|To fly {{non-stop}} {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean, Concorde required the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft. This {{was achieved by}} a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds, a slender fuselage with high <b>fineness</b> ratio, and a complex wing shape for a high lift-to-drag ratio. This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity, and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1956, initial {{designs were}} {{presented}} by the two companies. Zip fuel was {{to be used in}} the afterburners to improve range by 10 to 15 percent over conventional fuel. Both designs featured huge wing tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a supersonic dash to the target. The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing, which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for supersonic speeds. Both became trapezoidal wings after ejection, at that time the highest performance planform known. They also featured flush cockpits to maintain the highest <b>fineness</b> ratio possible in spite of its effects on visibility.|$|E

Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the <b>fineness</b> of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and {{the effect on the}} magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.|$|E

5|$|Under the Mint Act of 1792, the largest-denomination coin was {{the gold}} eagle, or ten-dollar piece. Also struck were a half eagle ($5) and quarter eagle ($2.50). Bullion flowed {{out of the}} United States for {{economic}} reasons {{for much of the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries. The eagle's size made it convenient for use in international transactions, and, faced with the likelihood that most being struck were exported, the Director of the Mint Elias Boudinot ended its production in 1804. In 1838, coinage resumed after Congress revised the weight and <b>fineness</b> of American gold coins. The new eagle was struck to a design by Christian Gobrecht, {{who was one of the}} Mint's engravers.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shooting}} thalers were cantonal pieces, minted by {{the sovereign}} cantons of Switzerland. All of these pieces, {{as well as}} the 1855 Solothurn issue, were strictly legal tender. Nineteenth-century Confederation shooting thaler issues were minted to legal <b>fineness,</b> and were thus allowed to bear the denomination of five francs. Beginning in 1865, Switzerland {{became a member of the}} Latin Monetary Union. Shooting thalers were not included in the mintages authorized by the Union. Therefore, these issues are commonly considered semi-medallic, though they could circulate due to their size and weight being the same as that of the regular five franc issues. This series of shooting thalers, following the standards of the Latin Monetary Union, began in 1855 with the Solothurn issue and ended in 1885 with the Bern issue. In 1927, the Monetary Union ceased to exist. Mintage began on a new series of shooting thalers in 1934 in honor of the shooting festival in Fribourg, and another design was issued in 1939 for the Lucerne festival. The 1934 issue was the last official shooting thaler that matched the circulating counterpart in both diameter and weight. The 1939 issues were not the same size and weight as their circulating counterparts, but both issues were redeemable only at the shooting festival or participating businesses. Production of shooting thalers was cut short with the outbreak of World War II. In 1984, a new series of shooting thalers began mintage, due largely to the efforts of California-based coin dealer Richard Nelson. These issues, like those minted in 1934 and 1939, are not minted to legal <b>fineness</b> and are not considered legal tender.|$|E
5|$|Coinage {{began on}} the first United States silver dollar, known as the Flowing Hair dollar, in 1794 {{following}} the construction and staffing of the Philadelphia Mint. The Coinage Act of 1792 called for the silver coinage to be struck in an alloy consisting of 89.2% silver and 10.8% copper. However, Mint officials were reluctant to strike coins with the unusual <b>fineness,</b> so {{it was decided to}} strike them in an unauthorized alloy of 90% silver instead. This caused depositors of silver to lose money when their metal was coined. During the second year of production of the Flowing Hair dollar, it was decided that the denomination would be redesigned. It is unknown what prompted this change or who suggested it, though numismatic historian R.W. Julian speculates that Henry William de Saussure, who was named Director of the Mint on July 9, 1795, may have suggested it, as he had stated a redesign of the American coinage as one of his goals before taking office. It is also possible that the Flowing Hair design was discontinued owing to much public disapproval.|$|E

40|$|Analyses of 71 Roman provincial silver coins of the Julio-Claudian {{emperors}} (27 BC–AD 68) minted at Caesarea in Cappadocia and Antioch and Tyre in Syria {{are discussed}} in this paper. The <b>finenesses</b> of the alloys are presented and it is proposed {{that there was a}} logical relationship between the standards used for Caesarea and Antioch. Trace element profiles and selected lead isotope analyses help to characterize the products of the different mints, and also demonstrate that one particular issue of coinage, normally attributed to a mint in Syria, was probably produced at Caesarea in Cappadocia. During this period minting of silver at Tyre was discontinued and trace elements suggest that some of the later Antiochene coinage may have been produced from recycled Tyrian silver...|$|R
5|$|Spreckels {{was already}} in {{correspondence}} with American authorities; in January 1883, the Director of the United States Mint, Horatio Burchard, had written to him explaining the laws under which the Mint could strike coins for foreign governments, and that although the coins could be struck at the San Francisco Mint, the dies for the coinage {{would have to be}} prepared at Philadelphia. He asked for sketches from Spreckels, who provided an obverse showing a full-face portrait of the king; this was submitted to Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber in Philadelphia, who rejected it as impractical. Barber recommended the king be shown in profile, and a suitable photograph was sent to him for use in preparing models of the proposed coins. Once the Mint received Spreckels' commission as agent, Acting Director Robert E. Preston wrote noting that the authorization called for 12 cent pieces, but that the Hawaiian law had called for coins identical in size, weight, and <b>fineness</b> to US coins, and there was no such denomination struck by the US Mint. He asked if ten-cent pieces were desired instead, but no answer was immediately forthcoming, and Barber finished preliminary designs, including the 12 cent piece.|$|E
5|$|The person {{chosen to}} fill the {{position}} was statesman and former congressman Elias Boudinot. Upon assuming his duties at the Mint on October 28, Boudinot was informed of the silver standard {{that had been used}} since the first official silver coins were struck. He immediately ordered that this practice be ceased and that coinage would begin in the 89.2% <b>fineness</b> approved by the Coinage Act of 1792. The total production of 1795 dollars (including both the Flowing Hair and Draped Bust types) totalled 203,033. It is estimated that approximately 42,000 dollars were struck bearing the Draped Bust design. Boudinot soon ordered that production of minor denominations be increased. Later, assayer Albian Cox died suddenly from a stroke in his home on November 27, 1795, leaving the vital post of assayer vacant. This, together with Boudinot's increased focus on smaller denominations, as well as a lull in private bullion deposits (the fledgling Mint's only source of bullion), caused a decrease in silver dollar production in 1796. The total mintage for 1796 was 79,920, which amounts to an approximate 62% reduction from the previous year's total.|$|E

Their reinforcing effect was determined in {{dynamic mechanical analysis}} (DMA) in flexure. DMA served also to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg). Shape memory properties were derived from quasiunconstrained flexural tests performed near to the Tg of the ELO and its biocomposites.

The shape memory parameters were moderate or low. They were affected by both textile content and type...|$|R
5|$|Because {{pure silver}} is very soft, most silver used for these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with <b>finenesses</b> of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|R

The use of FFA produces mortars with good strength and low porosity. The resistance to carbonation of mortar improves with partial replacement of FFA in comparison with the normal coarse fly ash. The use of FFA results in a strong and dense mortar which is due to better dispersion and filling effect as well as an increase in the pozzolanic reaction...|$|R

Acrylic fibres with <b>finenesses</b> of 7. 69, 10. 99 and 16. 48 dtex were selected and then blended at 10 different percentages of blend ratios using the semi-worsted spinning system, and finally 10 two-fold pile yarn samples were produced. In addition typical cut-pile carpet samples with a constant pile density level of 15 pile/cm 2 and pile height of 13 mm were produced by the face to face method. Then the compression behaviour of the carpet samples was evaluated under a constant compression stress of 40. 89 kPa using an Instron tensile tester. The cut-pile carpet compression properties were evaluated using different compression parameters including the energy of compression WC, the decompression energy W′C, the resilience of carpet compression RC and relative compressibility EMC.
