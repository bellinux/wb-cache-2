The first variable is the non-residents’ <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> and the second variable is nominal exchange rate.

Based on {{quarterly}} {{data for the}} period 1985 to 2012, this study analyses the effect of Foreign <b>Portfolio</b> <b>Investment</b> on {{the growth of the}} South African economy. In order to support the country’s economic growth, South Africa needs foreign capital in the form of foreign capital flows and these include both foreign direct <b>investment</b> and foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment.</b> Given the low national savings rate in South Africa, foreign portfolio inflows {{play an important role in}} the sustenance of higher levels of investment and growth. The study employed the Johansen Cointegration technique to analyse the long-run relationship and the Vector Error Correction Model for the short-term interaction between variables. The long-run results illustrated that there is a negative relationship between Gross Domestic Product and foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment.</b> However in the short run the results indicate a positive relationship between foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> and gross domestic product. These results are supported by the Granger causality test which shows that foreign <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> Granger causes Gross domestic product.

40|$|Investors {{significantly}} overweight domestic {{assets in}} their portfolios. This behavior which is commonly called “home bias” contradicts the prescriptions of portfolio theory. This thesis explores potential {{reasons for the}} “home bias” by examining {{the characteristics of the}} investing and the target countries and features of the interaction between them. A common theme of the four essays is a focus on the importance of information about foreign markets in explaining the share of these markets in investors’ portfolios. The results indicate that the size of the equity ownership in another country strongly relates to the distance to the financial capital of that country, and to trade in goods with and direct investments (FDI) to that country. The first essay empirically investigates the relationship between trade in real goods and <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> Overall, the evidence indicates a substantial role for trade in reducing the information cost relating to <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> The second essay examines the implications of the launch of the European Monetary Union (EMU) on international <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> The evidence on the allocation of Finnish international <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments</b> is more consistent with an information-based than a diversification motive explanation. The third essay employs new data for a large number of countries and further explores the role of trade on international <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> The results indicate that trade provides important information especially on firms in countries in which the corporate governance structure and the information environment of firms generate less reliable information.

40|$|For many, {{transnational}} {{capital is}} one of the most important driving forces of economic globalization; yet, we know little about what determines cross-border <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> In addition to recent economic literature's focus on information asymmetries as one key determinant of cross-border investment, this study brings in a political aspect to the field of international trade in assets. The `race to the bottom' thesis connects domestic economic policies to investment decisions and argues that capital is more likely to move towards economies characterized by economic liberalism; political institutions are also relevant for <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments,</b> because democratic institutions often provide more credible protection against predatory practices. In this study, I model bilateral <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments</b> as a function of economic policies, political institutions, and levels of transparency of sending and receiving countries as well as important international connections. Empirical findings indicate the importance of transparency to attract <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> Moreover, transnational <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments</b> are only sensitive to some fiscal policy indictors and only within the OECD countries. Therefore, for non-OECD countries, there is still 'room to move' in maneuvering different aspects of fiscal policies. Finally, I find that investors care about the nature of political institutions as democratic institutions tend to be associated with higher levels of <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> inflows. This is good news for developing countries that have undergone or are in the process of democratization. In addition to democratizing for peace, increased foreign capital further incentivizes a progression towards democratization. ...|$|R
