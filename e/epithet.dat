5|$|An animal <b>epithet</b> {{is a name}} used {{to label}} a person or group, by {{association}} with some perceived quality of an animal. Epithets may be formulated as similes, explicitly comparing people with the named animal, or as metaphors, directly naming people as animals. Animal epithets may be pejorative, readily giving offence, and they are sometimes used in political campaigns. One English <b>epithet,</b> lamb, is always used positively.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific {{name of a}} plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific <b>epithet.</b> The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific <b>epithet</b> in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the study of {{axiological}} possibilities of political <b>epithets.</b> In political discourse, <b>epithets</b> serve not only as a means of assessment, but they also help to manipulate public consciousness. Most political <b>epithets</b> have negative connotation. The list of political <b>epithets</b> is widening because new evaluative word combinations appear in each historical period and are associated with the politics and political leaders of this or that time...|$|R
40|$|Homophobic <b>epithets</b> {{have become}} commonly-used insults among adolescents. However, {{evidence}} {{suggests that there are}} differences in how these homophobic <b>epithets</b> are evaluated based on beliefs held by the observer, and by the context in which they are used. In order to examine this, Italian high school students were asked to rate the offensiveness of homophic <b>epithets,</b> as well as to consider how they or others would react to homophobic <b>epithets</b> across various situations. Homophobic beliefs and beliefs about the social acceptability of homophobic <b>epithets</b> were also examined. It was found that greater perceived social acceptability of homophobic <b>epithets</b> was related to dismissive reactions to their use, whereas homophobic beliefs were predictive of negative emotional reactions, but in varying ways depending on the specific context. The results indicate that homophobic <b>epithets</b> may not always be perceived as homophobic by adolescents, and that attempts to alter the social acceptability of these insults may be an effective manner of reducing their use...|$|R

The <b>epithets</b> on the thrones are single perpendicular lines down either side of the front seat. There are prenomens and nomens of the king.|$|R
50|$|In Greek, the Homeric <b>epithets</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} recognized. The article “L’Épithète Traditionnelle dans Homère and les Formules et la Métrique d’Homère” by Milman Parry argues for Homer's use of formulaic <b>epithets</b> in the Greek epics. These <b>epithets</b> are arguably used formulaically {{much like the}} makurakotoba. Examples of Homeric epithets: swift-footed Achilles, crafty Aegisthus, wily Odysseus (or Odysseus of many wiles).|$|R
40|$|The paper titled Attitudinal <b>Epithets</b> in a Children Science Book: a Functional Grammar Analysis {{analyzes}} Attitudinal <b>Epithets</b> occurrences in a children’s {{book that}} intends to explain some scientific phenomena on ‘bugs’. Since Attitudinal <b>Epithets</b> {{are used by}} speakers or writers in making personal or subjective comments over a phenomenon, they do not normally occur in writings with scientific genre. This paper reveals one of the children’s science books used as supplementary resources for Science and English lessons {{in one of the}} Private Primary Schools in Bandung city, Indonesia. The analysis is conducted by means of descriptive qualitative methods. The findings provide analytical description over the Attitudinal <b>Epithet’s</b> lexical variants that occur in the data; the intensification of Attitudinal Epithets; the scientific, cultural, or other facts in the text preceding or following the Attitudinal <b>Epithets,</b> or outside the text (contextually) to which the speaker directs his personal comment; and the semantic interpretation (including the polarity – negative or positive) towards the Attitudinal <b>Epithets.</b> </p...|$|R
