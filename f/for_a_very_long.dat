5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note}} that one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} {{can also be}} found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropics. The first discovered was Vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase {{in the case of the}} smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time and was only solved recently. With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.|$|E

NASC recently came third in their moors league division which is an achievement for the club as they have not finished that high <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time. Hambleton Seals Water Polo are a newly formed team which aims to attract local children to a quite small, yet fun sport.|$|E
60|$|Comparing {{the sexes}} again, {{we might say}} that the female mind reaches {{perfection}} in childhood, long before the physical change from a generalised to a specialised form; whereas the male retains a generalised form {{to the end of}} life and never ceases to advance mentally. The reason is obvious. There is no need for continued progression in women, and Nature, like the grand old economist she is, or can be when she likes, matures the mind quickly in one case and slowly in the other; so slowly that he, the young male, goes crawling on all fours as it were, a long distance after his little flying sister--slowly because he has very far to go and must keep on <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time.|$|R

5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with his name on it. Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create a paradox that will destroy {{the building and the}} Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump off the roof.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{threw himself}} into Parliamentary work, begrudging the times when {{he was unable to}} attend debates and {{spending}} much time on committee work. When Austen Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the continued coalition government led by the Liberal Prime Minister, Lloyd George, tried to recruit him to serve on an additional committee, Neville Chamberlain informed his half-brother that he could only serve if it met between midnight and 7:30am. Chamberlain took time to assure the future of the Birmingham Savings Bank, and Parliament passed an act which removed onerous restrictions from the bank. In March 1920, he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health by Bonar Law on behalf of the Prime Minister, but was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George despite Bonar Law's warnings that Chamberlain, now past fifty, might never be offered another chance to serve in government, as Lloyd George was likely to remain premier <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time. Chamberlain was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership, and when Bonar Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Strict secrecy {{surrounded}} the fortress <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time, {{and there were}} several attempts made by foreign powers to gain knowledge of various kinds of information. One early possible attempt at espionage were the Russian sawfilers who travelled through Sweden, mostly in Norrland during {{the last years of}} the 19th century and the years leading up to World War I. A large part of the Swedish population believed that the sawfilers, no more than 300 in total in Sweden, were spies hired by the Okhrana, the Russian secret police. Some sources are of the belief that the sawfilers were never sent out on specific missions but instead acted as unknowing spies, only having contact with the Okhrana who interrogated them regarding their experiences when they returned to Russia. Other sources claim {{that at least some of}} the sawfilers that the Okhrana found most useful were educated in the art of espionage, and were in fact given specific missions, as well as being paid 300 rouble per season for their work. Another form of this kind of legal espionage is believed to have been conducted by the German Wandervogel movement during the late interwar period.|$|E

50|$|Much like PETN, ETN {{is known}} <b>for</b> having <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> shelf life. Studies that {{directly}} observed the crystalline structure saw {{no signs of}} decomposition {{after four years of}} storage at room temperature. ETN has a melting point of 61 °C, compared to PETN which has a melting point of 141.3 °C. Recent studies of ETN decomposition suggested a unimolecular rate-limiting step in which the O-NO2 bond is cleaved and begins the decomposition sequence.|$|R
