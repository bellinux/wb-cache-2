40|$|Detection of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> on <b>a</b> bicycle is an {{important}} research subject in an advanced safety vehicle driving system to decrease traffic accidents. The Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature has been proposed as useful feature for detecting <b>a</b> standing <b>human</b> in various kinds of background. So, many researchers use currently the HOG feature to detect <b>a</b> <b>human.</b> Detecting <b>a</b> <b>human</b> on <b>a</b> bicycle is more difficult than detecting <b>a</b> standing <b>human,</b> because {{the appearance of a}} bicycle can change dramatically according to viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a method of detecting <b>a</b> <b>human</b> on <b>a</b> bicycle using HOG feature and RealAdaBoost algorithm. When detecting <b>a</b> <b>human</b> on <b>a</b> bicycle, occlusion is a cause of decreasing detection efficiency. Occlusion is a serious problem in car vision research, because there are often occlusion in real transportation environment. In such a case, the proposed method predicts the next position of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> on <b>a</b> bicycle using a tracking strategy. Experimental results and their evaluation show satisfactory performance of the proposed method...|$|R

5|$|The main {{dramatic}} {{thrust of}} the early series is Lister's desire to return home to Earth, although the crew's ownership of an unlimited time-space travel drive in series seven was to partly negate this intention. As their journey begins, the not-so-intrepid crew encounters such phenomena as time distortions, faster-than-light travel, mutant diseases and strange lifeforms that had developed in the intervening millions of years. During the second series, the group encounter the service mechanoid Kryten, rescuing him from a long-since crashed vessel. Initially, Kryten only appeared in one episode of series two, but {{by the beginning of}} series three he had become a regular character. At the end of series five, Red Dwarf itself is stolen by persons unknown, forcing the crew to travel in the smaller Starbug craft for two series, with the side-effect that they lose contact with Holly. In series seven, Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter ego from a parallel universe, Ace Rimmer, whose name has become a long-standing legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension. Shortly afterwards, the crew encounters a parallel version of themselves from a universe in which Kristine Kochanski, Lister's long-term love interest, had been put into stasis {{at the time of the}} leak and so became the last remaining <b>human.</b> <b>A</b> complicated series of events leaves Kochanski stranded in the series' main universe, where she is forced to join the crew. At the end of series seven, we learn that Kryten's service nanobots, which had abandoned him years earlier, were behind the theft of the Red Dwarf at the end of series five.|$|E

25|$|Another study (Chen & Li, 2001) sequenced 53 non-repetitive, intergenic DNA {{segments}} from a <b>human,</b> <b>a</b> chimpanzee, a gorilla, and orangutan.

When three species are fairly closely {{related to each other}} (like human, chimpanzee and gorilla), the trees obtained from DNA sequence data may not be congruent with the tree that represents the speciation (species tree).|$|E

The sitcom was an instant hit, with subsequent series being moved to other BBC channels and the show being granted a Christmas special. Another example is Being <b>Human,</b> <b>a</b> drama in which a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf share a flat, which has become a success and heralded several new series.

25|$|The {{term was}} coined in 2003 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford. The {{most common type}} of CAPTCHA was first invented in 1997 by two groups working in parallel: (1) Mark D. Lillibridge, Martin Abadi, Krishna Bharat, and Andrei Z. Broder; and (2) Eran Reshef, Gili Raanan and Eilon Solan. This form of CAPTCHA {{requires}} that the user type the letters of a distorted image, sometimes with the addition of an obscured sequence of letters or digits that appears on the screen. Because the test is administered by a computer, in contrast to the standard Turing test that is administered by a <b>human,</b> <b>a</b> CAPTCHA is sometimes described as a reverse Turing test.|$|E

Even in the Kurukshetra war, while he was the general, he tried his best to keep the war low key by minimizing confrontation between the two camps. Even as he fell he tried to use the opportunity to persuade both camps to put an end to the war. Bhishma was a complete <b>human,</b> <b>a</b> complete warrior and a complete teacher (acharya), hence he was known as Bhishmacharya.|$|E

500|$|Despite many {{explicit}} {{allusions to}} several world religions, Ingrid Reichel {{states that the}} novel is a book for “readers with humor, for reasoners (…), for darwinists, on no account for creationists, {{to a lesser extent}} for people of faith, but rather for atheists, … and fundamentalists drop out entirely”. Another aspect is identified by Karin Gayer when pinpointing the parallel evolution of the patriarchal hierarchy in the narrated society and the alluded social matriarchy, the first resembling chimpanzee communities and the second representing those of bonobos. In addition, she points out the strength of the women characters. She declares {{that at the time of}} the Australopithecus, neither chimpanzees nor bonobos existed, but [...] "the author is not interested in paleoanthropologic precisenesses—he is interested in mirroring our society, in exposing human behavior". She compares Costello with the alpha of a community of chimpanzees and a classical manager, and Akshaya with bonobo females and a modern-day career woman. With regard to these underlying comparisons, Gayer says, [...] "On another level we are struck by the permanent notional commingling of the simian and the <b>human,</b> <b>a</b> composition which leaves us pensive and asks the legitimate question where we, who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense, should finally classify man." ...|$|E
5000|$|Design {{elements}} should {{match in}} <b>human</b> realism. <b>A</b> robot may look uncanny when human and nonhuman elements are mixed.

For a robot to give a more positive impression, its degree of human realism in appearance should also match its degree of human realism in behavior. If an animated character looks more human than its movement, this gives <b>a</b> negative impression. <b>Human</b> neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance and motion kinematics are important.|$|R
