What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E

I was only hinting early on, but then I tell it like it is. It's like, now that I have your attention, I have a few things to tell you." ...|$|E

500|$|Cliff White of NME {{called the}} album [...] "almost a voyeur's delight", {{and was not}} {{favorable}} of Gaye's sensual themes, stating [...] "Although getting down, getting mellow, and getting it on are paramount considerations {{in the privacy of}} my own home, I don't particularly want to be party to someone else's night life. Not on record anyway... Like peeking through the windows of the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I find it a mite frustrating." [...] White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as [...] "all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out", and calling I Want You [...] "simply the explorative aftermath of Let's Get It On. The sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating [...] "was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasn't nearly as fun as I had {{hoped it would}} be. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> {{you were going to}} bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, {{it would have been nice}} to give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like nothing else in the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The odd thing is that it was left in there. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{originally}} {{set to be}} {{filmed in}} Jakarta, permission to film in Indonesia was denied, so {{the bulk of the}} film was shot in the Philippines. Death threats against Weir and Gibson from Muslims who believed the film would be anti-Islam forced the production to move to Australia. Gibson downplayed the death threats, saying, [...] "It wasn't really that bad. We got a lot of death threats to be sure, but I just assumed that when there are so many, it must mean nothing is really going to happen. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> they meant to kill us, why send a note?" ...|$|E

So you're finished. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and– whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up– then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|From April to August 2011, RT ran {{a half-hour}} primetime show Adam vs. the Man, hosted by former Iraq War Marine veteran and {{high-profile}} anti-war activist Adam Kokesh. David Weigel writes that Kokesh defended RT's [...] "propaganda" [...] function, saying [...] "We're {{putting out the}} truth {{that no one else}} wants to say. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> you want {{to put it in the}} worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit." [...] The conservative media watchdog Accuracy in Media criticized Kokesh's appearance on RT, writing RT uses Americans like Kokesh to make propaganda points.|$|E
2500|$|On D-Day, Donovan {{was on one}} of {{the ships}} that took part in the Normandy landing. Going ashore, he and his {{commander}} of covert operations in Europe, Colonel David Bruce, were shot at by a German plane, then moved on toward the American front lines and encountered German machine-gun fire. As they lay on the ground, Bruce later recalled, Donovan said, [...] "David, we mustn't be captured. We know too much." [...] Donovan said that he had two suicide pills, but then discovered he didn't. [...] "I must shoot first," [...] Donovan said. Bruce replied, [...] "Yes, sir, but can we do much against machine guns with our pistols?"

2500|$|He was a {{guest on}} The Howard Stern Show on April 10, 2008; {{when he was asked}} if he would direct Ghostbusters III and cast Howard, he said [...] "Do you know how many times I get asked if I want to do Ghostbusters III? Looking at my career so far, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> you just looked at my two films, I would make the most boring Ghostbusters movie. It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." [...] Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also {{revealed}} that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of Son of the Beach (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of Baywatch), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for Thank You for Smoking at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Buffett {{described}} {{the health care}} reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage. Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs. Buffett thinks health care costs should head towards 13 to 14% of GDP. (Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the CMS actuary has projected health care costs will reach almost 20% of GDP by 2020.) Buffett said [...] "If you want the very best, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> you want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).|$|E
2500|$|The win {{attracted}} further {{attention on}} social media because Gun Runner ran the final half mile with a horseshoe caught in his tail: a shoe from Cautious Giant flew loose just as Gun Runner was starting his move. [...] "We watched the tape repeatedly, repeatedly," [...] said Asmussen, [...] "and if you never seen anything before, just wait around. Can you believe that? <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> we tried to throw one and stick in one's tail as he was standing, still we'd go 0-for-1,000 – let alone at a run, let alone Gun Runner, let alone in the Whitney – and it stayed. [...] how fast he was going , it was held out from him. When he slowed down to walk, then it came into him. We were obviously unaware of it until {{he came back to}} the winner's circle, but not a nick on him. I mean, there's still nails in it." [...] The race improved Gun Runner's rating to 127 in the World's Best Racehorse Rankings August update, maintaining his third place ranking worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Meena Kumari {{agreed to}} all terms, but with passing time she kept {{breaking}} them. It is said Kumari felt oppressed by the feudal attitude and high-handed behavior that Kamal Amrohi brought to their relationship. Kamal Amrohi's lavish productions Daera and Pakeezah, and his Kamalistan studios (1958) were mostly financed by Kumari's earnings. Meena Kumari was watched over. Kamal Amrohi had issued strict instructions and had deployed assistant Baqar Ali {{to prevent any}} other man from meeting Meena Kumari on the sets. In 1972 Kamal Amrohi told Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) [...] "I didn't mean it like that. These were just ground rules. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> she returned home at 7 instead of 6:30 it was acceptable for me. I just wanted her to appreciate that besides having responsibilities to her career, she had responsibilities to her home and husband". Amrohi further {{said that he was}} prepared to overlook Meena bending his conditions, but he would have loved it if she herself confessed when such bendings took place. [...] "It really pained me to learn of these incidents from outside sources".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 Beat the Blizzard webzine's article, {{the writer}} Jan Lindsø states that [...] "any metal fans {{are of the}} opinion that Christians should 'not be allowed' to use the black metal {{aesthetics}} musically since they do not inherit this evil and perhaps misantropic [...] trait that many people say is necessary in order to be convincing as black metal musicians". Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> {{you want to be a}} Christian, be it with all you've got, and if you want to be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing at all to do in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Real Thing, Faith No More {{developed}} somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour. Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his [...] "style" [...] in the [...] "Epic" [...] music video. He told Kerrang! magazine [...] "My drummer says he’s gonna kidnap , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he’ll be forced to find a style of his own". In a separate interview, he clarified his comment, remarking [...] "I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?.'" [...] Roddy Bottum responded by saying [...] "To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and i'd like to think they're doing it... like as a favour". Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that [...] "It just kind of {{came out of the}} blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> he's gonna talk about me in interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me. Maybe one day we'll have a breakoff, just breakdance." ...|$|E
