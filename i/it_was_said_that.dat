25|$|Folk {{beliefs that}} cats can cause strange {{phenomena}} {{are not limited}} to Japan. For example, in Jinhua, Zhejiang, in China, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> a cat, after having been raised for three years by humans, would then start bewitching them. Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> cats with white tails are especially good at this, there arose the custom of refraining from raising white cats. Since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> their ability to bewitch humans comes from taking in the spiritual energy of the moon, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> when a cat looks up at the moon, whether its tail has been cut or not, <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> killed on the spot.|$|R

5|$|James II's statue {{has stood}} in several {{locations}} {{since it was}} first erected. It originally stood in the Palace of Whitehall's Pebble Court, where it was installed on New Year's Day, 1686. It was situated behind the Banqueting House and faced the river, a position which attracted much satirical comment after James' flight from London during the Glorious Revolution of 1688; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the statue's location indicated his method of escape.|$|E

5|$|According to the Samyutta Nikaya, Koṇḍañña {{retired to}} {{the banks of the}} Mandakini Lake in the Chaddanta forest, said to be the abode of the paccekabuddhas. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the 8000 {{elephants}} in the forest took turns to catering for his needs. Koṇḍañña only left once, to farewell Gautama Buddha. Koṇḍañña kissed the Buddha's feet and stroked them with his hands. He advised his disciples not to mourn him before returning to the forest to pass away the following morning. He was cremated on a large sandalwood pyre which was constructed {{with the help of the}} elephants, and the ceremony was presided over by Anuruddha, one of the ten chief disciples and five hundred other monks. The ashes were later taken to Veluvana, where they were enshrined in a silver stupa.|$|E
5|$|From July 1943, the 29th Infantry Division was {{commanded}} by Major General Charles H. Gerhardt.

5|$|Middle Anglia as a {{political}} entity may have been created by Penda {{as an expression of}} Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously there seem to {{have been a number of}} small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda's establishment of Peada as a subking there may have marked their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to Shropshire and Herefordshire, along Mercia's western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian domination at this time. Here a king called Merewalh ruled over the Magonsaete; in later centuries <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered it likely that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian domination.|$|E
5|$|The {{composite}} bow {{was adopted}} throughout the Arab world, {{even though some}} Bedu tribesmen in the Hijaz retained the use of simple self bows. Persian designs were used after the conquest of the Sassanid Empire, and Turkish-type bows were widely used after the Turkic expansions. Roughly speaking, Arabs favoured slightly shorter siyahs and broader limbs than the Indo-Persian designs. Sometimes the protective cover on the back was painted with Arab calligraphy or geometric patterns. No design was standardized over the vast area of the Arab conquests. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the best Arab composite bows were manufactured in Damascus, Syria.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} policy of reconciliation continued: in January 1984 the land reform introduced by Taraki and Amin was drastically modified, {{the limits of}} landholdings were increased to win the support of middle class peasants, the literacy programme was continued, and concessions to women were made. In 1985 the Loya Jirga was reconvened. The 1985 Loya Jirga {{was followed by a}} tribal jirga in September. In 1986 Abdul Rahim Hatef, a non-PDPA member, was elected to the NFF chairmanship. During the 1985–86 elections <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> 60 percent of the elected officials were non-PDPA members. By the end of Karmal's rule, several non-PDPA members had high-level government positions.|$|E

5|$|This holding {{was based}} upon the well-understood {{governmental}} policy of encouraging the Indian to forgo his wandering habits and adopt those of civilized life; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> to hold that by so doing he acquired no possessory rights to the lands occupied, to which the government would accord protection, would be contrary to the whole spirit of the traditional American policy toward these dependent wards of the nation. The fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E
5|$|Albion's main club badge {{dates back}} to the late 1880s, when club {{secretary}} Tom Smith suggested that a throstle (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge. Since then, the club badge has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club's move to the Hawthorns. The throstle was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, the Throstles. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979, an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns, and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body {{was found to be}} in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E
5|$|Once Brannan had {{returned}} to his sister's home, he renewed his religious convictions in the LDS church and was called by the apostle Wilford Woodruff to serve a local mission in Ohio. Before being called as a missionary he had married Harriet ("Hattie") Hatch and they were expecting their first child. His mission ended earlier than expected when he caught malaria and had to return home for his health. Once he had sufficiently recovered he was again called to help the church, but this time as a printer in Connecticut working alongside the apostle William Smith. While waiting in Connecticut {{to meet up with}} Smith, Brannan fell in love with Ann Eliza Corwin whose mother took care of the visitors in the local boarding house. Brannan planned to marry her and separate from his first wife.
