5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E

40|$|Two {{components}} of outward currents were investigated under voltage clamp conditions in Tenebrio muscle fibres.
