5|$|No, if we {{make this}} screen machine that you are asking for, it will spoil <b>everything.</b> <b>We</b> are making these peep show {{machines}} and selling {{a lot of them}} at a good profit. If we put out a screen machine there will be a use for maybe about ten of them in the whole United States. With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.|$|E
5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E
25|$|<b>Everything</b> <b>we</b> do, {{we believe}} in {{challenging}} the conventional, {{we believe in}} thinking differently. The way we challenge the conventional is by making something which is original, innovative and precisely what a user needs. We just happened to make a great cricket app.|$|E
50|$|They said <b>everything</b> that <b>we</b> did say.|$|R
30|$|To this end, pulling <b>everything</b> together, <b>we</b> {{obtain the}} desired result.|$|R
5000|$|English: Call <b>Everything</b> That <b>We</b> (You and I) Are 'Rock n' Roll ...|$|R
25|$|To me {{the ideal}} film— which I've never succeeded in making— {{would be as}} though the reel were behind one's eyes and you were {{projecting}} it yourself, seeing what you wish to see. This {{has a great deal}} in common with thought processes... That's why I think the camera is an eye as well as a mind. <b>Everything</b> <b>we</b> do with the camera has physiological and mental significance.|$|E
25|$|Passion {{is closely}} aligned with faith in Kierkegaard's thought. Faith as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in a transcendent world, even though <b>{{everything}}</b> <b>we</b> can know intellectually speaks against it. To {{live and die}} for a belief, to stake everything one has {{and is in the}} belief in something that has a higher meaning than anything in the world—this is belief and passion at their highest.|$|E
25|$|Further, it is {{superfluous}} {{to suppose}} that what can {{be accounted for by}} a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore {{there is no need to}} suppose God's existence.|$|E
60|$|We {{returned}} to the others and told them <b>everything</b> that <b>we</b> had learned from Shadrach.|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{the scores}} is written <b>everything</b> what <b>we</b> have to know, without adding or {{removing}} anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{absolutely}} {{refuse to}} believe us! Notwithstanding <b>everything</b> that <b>we</b> have put before them, the Channel Squadron has sailed for Kiel." ...|$|R
25|$|Miyagawa’s {{works are}} known for their themes of {{exploring}} memory and finding identity. She said once in an interview, “I believe <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> know about ourselves is entirely based on memory—history, science, art, religion are all constructs of human memory.” Her plays are often written in fluid time and space, rather than in a traditional linear timeline. Many of her works draw from Japanese literature and art forms for inspiration and also employ characters that are ghosts. Her works have explored a variety of issues, such as the interactions between Eastern and Western cultures, feminism, drug addiction, and the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|Richard Dawkins {{outlines}} in The Selfish Gene (1976) {{that humans}} are machines made of genes and genes are the grounding for <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> do. The gene-centric view outlines that natural selection, evolution and all behaviour must {{be traced back to}} the survival of competing genes as an extension of Darwin’s theory being the survival of competing individuals. The main goal of individuals, coming from the instinct of our genes, is to reproduce and thrive, where thriving involves protection, conquering competition and future growth. Therefore, everything that we do relates to thriving in our environment above competition, including the way we consume as a form of survival in our environment when simply purchasing the basic physiological needs of food, water and warmth. We also consume to thrive above others, for example in conspicuous consumption where a luxury car represents money and high social status and the application of makeup makes the person and their genes seem more attractive and worthy of passing to offspring.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said:The clan in China {{is responsible for}} the individuals and in collecting from the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have been surprised to hear that this was criticised.|$|E
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah! we {{women should}} forgive <b>everything,</b> shouldn't <b>we,</b> dear Mrs. Arbuthnot? I {{am sure you}} agree with me in that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, {{there is}} nothing, Mr. Thorndyke. It is {{marvelous}} to us {{coming in here}} and finding <b>everything</b> that <b>we</b> can possibly want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} you cannot come to me,' he remarked; 'I {{would have shown}} you {{everybody}} and <b>everything.</b> But <b>we</b> shall meet often.' ...|$|R
500|$|Lyrical {{themes in}} the song include love, life, and belief. Lead singer Bart Millard {{intended}} the song {{to refer to the}} birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus in each verse. Guitarist Mike Scheuchzer said the song is [...] "a picture of the change we want to see in our own lives. Without love like this, <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> do, <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> are, is in vain." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It had {{a massive}} chorus, an {{instantly}} memorable melody and lyric, {{and was a}} natural transition from the B.o.B and Travie McCoy songs ... it didn’t sound like anything else on the radio. It had <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> could want in a first single for Bruno." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Billboard {{included}} the video for [...] "Wannabe" [...] in {{their list of}} the Top Ten Most Iconic Girl Group Music Videos of All Time, noting: [...] "They were basically unknown to U.S. audiences when the video for debut single 'Wannabe' -- a riotous, one-shot stroll through the Girls gleefully messing up some posh U.K. soiree -- premiered, {{but by the end}} of the four-minute clip, we knew absolutely <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> needed to know about the Spice Girls. You get the individual personalities of all five members, the infectious togetherness of the group at large, and most importantly, the sense that they were coming to absolutely blast through American pop music and mess up <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> previously thought we knew." ...|$|E
60|$|For, my friends, {{with the}} Bible as with <b>everything</b> else, <b>we</b> must hear {{both sides of}} the question, lest we {{understand}} neither side.|$|R
5000|$|Bejoy Nambiar wrote [...] "The horrific {{description}} of the Peshawar attack just makes you question <b>everything</b> that <b>we</b> feel is right with the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll know <b>everything</b> before <b>we</b> go to bed, Dick," [...] {{answered}} his brother. [...] "I don't believe Uncle Randolph would telegraph unless {{the news was}} good." ...|$|R
500|$|... "My {{passion for}} music has always {{inspired}} my designs. This year {{we have really}} put music {{in the forefront of}} <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> do. Britney represents the spirit of Tommy Jeans and of youth today. I cannot think of a better way to continue this exciting year by sponsoring one of today's hottest, young recording artists".|$|E
500|$|By 2002, Hill {{had shut}} down her {{non-profit}} Refugee Project. She said, [...] "I had {{a nonprofit organization}} and I had to shut all that down. You know, smiling with big checks, obligatory things, not having things come from a place of passion. That's slavery. <b>Everything</b> <b>we</b> do should {{be a result of}} our gratitude for what God has done for us. It should be passionate." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevens {{spends a}} lot of time {{preparing}} for each game, and always tries to add a few new wrinkles specific to that game's opponent. Sports Illustrated calls Stevens an expert [...] "on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents' weaknesses." [...] Former player Ronald Nored agrees: [...] "We know <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> need to about our opponents, all their tendencies are broken down" [...] ahead of time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{is it the}} Thompsons? That {{simplifies}} it--sets <b>everything</b> right. <b>We</b> can fix {{it without}} spoiling your arrangements, my child. You've got your heart set on--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please be sober, Mark, {{and tell}} me all about it. Was she glad? Did she say she would? And is <b>everything</b> as <b>we</b> would have it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Zane, I had {{a letter}} from my uncle to you," [...] replied Jim; [...] "but the Indians took that and <b>everything</b> else <b>we</b> had with us." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{casting the}} role of Inspector William Armstrong, Fincher said he thought of Anthony Edwards because [...] "I knew I needed the most decent person I could find, because {{he would be the}} balance of the movie. In a weird way, this movie wouldn't exist without Bill Armstrong. <b>Everything</b> <b>we</b> know about the Zodiac case, we know because of his notes. So in casting the part, I wanted to get someone who is totally reliable." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stop" [...] was shot on 27 January 1998 in Ireland, and was {{directed}} by James Byrne. About the concept, Melanie Brown commented: [...] "There wasn't a storyboard for this video—it was more trial and error. It wasn't planned {{down to the last}} detail and was quite a free-for-all. It's like <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> do—complete chaos! [...] And we all want to get our bit in, so the director {{has to be able to}} encompass us all, plus put his ideas on top of it, and make it all flow.|$|E
500|$|For if our Trade may be taxed, why not our Lands? Why not the Produce of our Lands & <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> possess or {{make use}} of? This we {{apprehend}} annihilates our Charter Right to govern & tax ourselves. It strikes at our British privileges, which {{as we have}} never forfeited them, we hold in common with our Fellow Subjects who are Natives of Britain. If Taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of tributary Slaves? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is your bathroom," [...] Mr. Haines said, {{pointing}} to an adjoining room. [...] "I {{think you will}} find <b>everything</b> ready. <b>We</b> dine in half an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ruth {{has told}} me <b>everything,</b> father. <b>We</b> can clear Ronald Mervyn {{as soon as we}} like." [...] And Mary Armstrong threw her arms round her father's neck.|$|R
50|$|Putting <b>everything</b> together, <b>we</b> get {{our final}} bound on the {{expectation}} of theaverage error probability:Thus, {{as long as we}} choose , there exists a code with vanishing error probability.|$|R
