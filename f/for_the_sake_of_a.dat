5|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} reviewed by critics, but {{contained within the}} reviews were often criticism on {{the execution of the}} story and plot. A review in the The Moving Picture World was positive to the moral lesson the film asserted and found the acting to be satisfactory. Walton of the The Moving Picture News criticized the type of film as invoking sudden and unnatural changes in character <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> moral lesson. The child's influence and ability to bring sense to her father was seen as cheap theatrics, but ended with the assertion that the film was not second rate for employing such theatrics. The New York Dramatic Mirror was positive, but said that the scene upon which the little girl follows her father was not believable because she was unaware of her father's intentions to kill himself. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

By the terms of the Treaty of Ryswick the boundaries and outposts of New France, New England, and New York remained substantially unchanged. In Newfoundland and Hudson's Bay French influence now predominated but William III, who had made the interests of the Bay Company a cause of war in North America, was not prepared to hazard his European policy for the sake of their pursuit. The Iroquois Five Nations, abandoned by their English allies, were obliged to open separate negotiations, and by the treaty of 1701 they agreed to remain neutral in any future Anglo-French war.|$|E
25|$|The {{nucleation}} reaction {{can start}} with any heterogeneous surface, such as rock salt, but Mentos {{have been found to}} work better than most. Tonya Coffey, a physicist at Appalachian State University, found that the aspartame in diet drinks lowers the surface tension in the water and causes a bigger reaction, but that caffeine does not accelerate the process. It has also been shown that a wide variety of beverage additives such as sugars, citric acid, and natural flavors can also enhance fountain heights. In some cases, dissolved solids that increase the surface tension of water (such as sugars) also increase fountain heights. These results suggest that additives serve to enhance geyser heights not by decreasing surface tension, but rather by decreasing bubble coalescence. Decreased bubble coalescence leads to smaller bubble sizes and greater foaming ability in water. Thus, the geyser reaction will still work even using sugared drinks, but diet is commonly used both <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger geyser as well as to avoid having to clean up a sugary soda mess.|$|E
25|$|Life {{in his own}} monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard {{himself was}} partly responsible. He took a sort of {{malicious}} pleasure in irritating the monks. As if <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> joke, he cited Bede {{to prove that the}} believed founder of the monastery of St Denis, Dionysius the Areopagite had been Bishop of Corinth, while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot Hilduin that he had been Bishop of Athens. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution, Abelard {{wrote a letter to the}} Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica and St. Jerome, according to whom Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France (which had Denis as its patron saint); life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard, and he was finally allowed to leave.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{at the end}} of January, he {{performed}} with his Wonder Horses for several weeks on the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Circuit at the New York Hippodrome. His 15-minute presentation was far above the average horse act, but did not begin to compare with John Aggee's equines that had appeared previously in the same setting at the Hippodrome. The two acts were different. Joyce's presentation was the typical circus offering of the kind where the animals followed set routines. It opened with a high school turn with various types of 1 and 2 steps to music with Joyce in the saddle. Then Jack dismounted and put his black steed through a ritual where it knelt and ran between 2 cannons in the ring. Carrying flags it jumped over the cannons and fired them. Later in the engagement, Joyce, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smoother presentation, replaced this part of the act with a riding turn. Next, the drollery of an English comic brought forth mild laughter. Cossack trick riding with various unique feats scored well as the horse and rider raced around the ring. Following came 6 showy equines with royal plumes and glittering harness. They did a nice drill which ended with their marching {{on the rim of the}} ring curb. The horses were somewhat hesitant in their movements and notably nervous, probably as a result of experiencing the very rough ocean crossing just two weeks earlier.|$|E

Its central theme is on women and their plight in society, as exemplified by Manju and her relationships.

One, her college mate, left her to marry someone else <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> job; {{and the second is}} Mano, the son of a Christian priest, who used her to satisfy his lust and then trivialised their relationship by calling her [...] "sister" [...] in front of her parents.

Conversations related to matters like the status of women in contemporary (1978) times and the nature of humankind are frequently seen in the film.|$|E
