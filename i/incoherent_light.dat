25|$|The {{critical}} {{detail of}} stimulated emission {{is that the}} induced photon has the same frequency and phase as the incident photon. In other words, the two photons are coherent. It is this property that allows optical amplification, {{and the production of}} a laser system. During the operation of a laser, all three light-matter interactions described above are taking place. Initially, atoms are energized from the ground state to the excited state by a process called pumping, described below. Some of these atoms decay via spontaneous emission, releasing <b>incoherent</b> <b>light</b> as photons of frequency, ν. These photons are fed back into the laser medium, usually by an optical resonator. Some of these photons are absorbed by the atoms in the ground state, and the photons are lost to the laser process. However, some photons cause stimulated emission in excited-state atoms, releasing another coherent photon. In effect, this results in optical amplification.|$|E

40|$|Monochromatic {{coherent}} light traversing a disordered photonic medium evolves into a random field whose statistics are {{dictated by the}} disorder level. Here we demonstrate experimentally that light statistics can be deterministically tuned in certain disordered lattices, even when the disorder level is held fixed, by controllably breaking the excitation symmetry of the lattice modes. We exploit a lattice endowed with disorder-immune chiral symmetry in which the eigenmodes come in skew-symmetric pairs. If a single lattice site is excited, a "photonic thermalization gap" emerges: the realm of sub-thermal light statistics is inaccessible regardless of the disorder level. However, by exciting two sites with a variable relative phase, as in a traditional two-path interferometer, the chiral symmetry is judiciously broken and interferometric control over the light statistics is exercised, spanning sub-thermal and super-thermal regimes.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} new {{geometry}} of clad-pumped fiber amplifier/laser that includes {{at least one}} doped core which guides the signal wave {{and at least one}} clad region that guides the incoherent pump. Our proposed geometry enables the <b>incoherent</b> diode pump <b>light</b> to be efficiently absorbed by the doped glass core over very short lengths on the order of a few to tens of centimeters. The transparent cladding is realized as a narrow slab with refractive index higher than that of the core. The slab is designed to effectively capture all of the <b>incoherent</b> pump <b>light</b> and is tapered to force the highly-moded <b>incoherent</b> guided <b>light</b> into the strongly absorbing core. Modes of this composite waveguide structure are analysed in this paper. Criteria are established in terms of the refractive indices of the core, slab and cladding that ensure efficient absorption of the pump light in the core while ensuring that only a single or few lowest order signal modes can propagate in the amplifying core. Numerical simulations with the Beam Propagation Method and a modal expansion technique confirm that a significant enhancement of the absorption efficiency of the pump in the core can be realized by tapering the slab waveguide. Assuming a local absorption rate of 10 cm − 1 of the intensity of the pump in a core of radius 4. 3 µ and a realistic multimode diode pump distributed over a 100 µ aperture, an absorption efficiency of 94 % can be realized over an amplfier length of 2 cm. The geometry is scalable to longer lengths and multiple incoherent diode-pumped slab claddings...|$|R

50|$|Filament {{formation}} and propagation {{may also be}} observed in photopolymer systems. Such systems display a Kerr-like optical nonlinearity via photoreactive-based increases in the refractive index. The filaments form {{as a result of}} the self-trapping of individual beams, or modulation instability of a wide-area light profile. Filament propagation has been observed in several photo-polymerizable systems, including organo-siloxane, acrylics, epoxy and copolymers with epoxies, and polymer blends. The locations of filament {{formation and}} propagation may be controlled by modulating the spatial profile of the input light field. Such photo-reactive systems are able to produce filaments from spatially and temporally <b>incoherent</b> <b>light,</b> because the slow reaction responds to the time-average intensity of the optical field, whereby femto-second fluctuations wash out. This is similar to photo-refractive media with non-instantaneous responses, which enable filament propagation with incoherent or partially <b>incoherent</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
