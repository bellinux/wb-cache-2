5|$|In South Korea, Additives allowed include Milk- related {{additives}} such as Milk, Milk Powder, Milk Cream, Casein, Thickening Agents like Arabic Gum, Pectin and Sweeteners such as Acesulfame K, Erythritol, Xylitol etc. Designated {{uses and}} tolerance levels of each additive are established on a product-by-product basis {{regulated by the}} Korea Ministry of Food & Drug Safety (MFDS) and may <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> international regulations.|$|E
5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} organisms have electron transport chains that <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, {{plants have}} alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol {{rather than in}} the mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.|$|E
5|$|Pumice {{found at}} Tell el Dab'a in Egypt {{that matches the}} {{composition}} of the Thera eruption has been dated to 1540 BCE, closer to the traditionally-accepted date of Thera's eruption.

5|$|Selenium, and {{possibly}} boron, silicon, arsenic and tellurium, plus the organogen elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals, as they fall outside the halogens and noble gases. The first {{five of these}} (Se; B, Si, As, Te) <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> organogens: none are universally required for life; arsenic is notoriously poisonous; and tellurium hydride is a fairly strong, rather than weak, acidic hydride.|$|E
5|$|The ARF {{is often}} {{accused of having}} a present {{strategy}} that does not <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> one used {{during the time of}} the Ottoman Empire. Its tactics are viewed as still being aimed at convincing Western governments and diplomatic circles to sponsor the party's demands.|$|E
5|$|The dish is {{typically}} prepared by rolling shucked oysters in bacon and baking {{them in an}} oven. Modern variations of angels on horseback include skewering and frying. Serving can vary widely to taste on either skewers or breads, with additional accompaniments or condiments. Angels on horseback <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> similar, fruit-based, devils on horseback, but the dishes' names are sometimes erroneously considered synonyms.|$|E

5|$|The easiest {{species to}} confuse with the Carolina wren is Bewick's wren, which differs in being smaller {{but with a}} longer tail, grayer-brown above and whiter below. The Carolina and white-browed wrens <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> house wren in being larger, with a decidedly longer bill and hind toe; their culmen has a notch behind the tip.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} of defects in crystals {{is described by}} the point groups. They <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> space groups describing the {{symmetry of}} crystals by absence of translations, and thus are much fewer in number. In diamond, only defects of the following symmetries have been observed thus far: tetrahedral (Td), tetragonal (D2d), trigonal (D3d,C3v), rhombic (C2v), monoclinic (C2h, C1h, C2) and triclinic (C1 or CS).|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{origin of}} the ash is evidenced by its distinctive mineralogy–the ash was deposited directly upon the water, so its angular quartz grains <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> clastic sediments rounded through the erosion process that carries them to the sea. As the volcanic ash settled to the bottom, it was admixed with these terrigenous components, producing a distinctive lithology in the sedimentary rock.|$|E

5|$|The winning {{of heavy}} metals from their ores {{is a complex}} {{function}} of ore type, the chemical properties of the metals involved, and the economics of various extraction methods.

5|$|Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) {{are typical}} data-link {{protocols}} for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> former protocols {{in that they}} are simpler, e.g., they omit features such as quality of service guarantees, and offer collision prevention. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.|$|E
5|$|All banksias have {{developed}} proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to}} the nutrient poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The plant develop masses of fine lateral roots that form a mat-like structure underneath the soil surface, and enable it to extract nutrients as efficiently possible out of the soil. A study of three co-occurring species in banksia woodland in southwestern Australia—Banksia menziesii, B. attenuata and B. ilicifolia—found that all three develop fresh roots in September after winter rainfall, and that the bacteria populations associated with the root systems of B. menziesii <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other two, and that they also change depending on the age of the roots.|$|E

5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation {{is based}} upon Cochrane's {{doctoral}} thesis, completed at the London School of Economics (LSE) {{under the supervision of}} Cécile Fabre, with Paul Kelly acting as an advisor. The thesis was examined by Anne Phillips and Albert Weale, the former of whom suggested the title which was used for the book. The arguments in the book <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> arguments in the thesis, however, and in preparing the manuscript for publication, Cochrane drew upon the advice of a number of academics, especially Robert Garner.|$|E
5|$|As {{the leader}} of the NCP, the largest party in parliament, Jyrki Katainen was tasked with forming a new {{coalition}} government. He said that the result of the election supported a coalition consisting of the three largest parties, i.e. the National Coalition, the Social Democratic Party and the True Finns. The most problematic question was believed to be the EU bailout policy, where the True Finns most <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other parties. Formal negotiations on government formation started after 24 April and the Kiviniemi government submitted its resignation on 29 April, starting to serve as a caretaker government until a new one was formed.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Each of these elements has one valence electron in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns1), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements. Ununennium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lighter alkali metals in some properties.|$|E
