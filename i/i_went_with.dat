500|$|Conversely, The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Myles McNutt {{gave the}} episode a C- rating and criticized the episode's lack of complexity. He wrote that, [...] "I would argue, though, that [...] {{part of the}} show’s problem right now" [...] and noted that Tate's performance was expanded [...] "little ... beyond her initial appearance last season." [...] In a review for the subsequent episode, [...] "After Hours", however, McNutt acknowledged that, [...] "If I'm being honest with , last week's probably should have been above a 'C-,' but <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> my gut and have to stand by that decision." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron Thor had {{previously}} worked with Spielberg on Hook, and initially auditioned {{for the role}} of Malcolm, before trying out {{for the role of}} Dodgson. Thor said about casting, [...] "It just said 'shaving-cream can' in the script, so I spent endless time in a drug store to find the most photogenic. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> Barbasol, which ended up in the movie. I was so broke that I took the can home after the audition to use it." [...] Laura Dern was Spielberg's first choice for the role of Ellie Sattler. Spielberg chose to cast Wayne Knight after seeing his acting performance in Basic Instinct, saying, [...] "I waited for the credits to roll and wrote his name down".|$|E

500|$|The team gained {{international}} prominence {{after signing}} Laurent Jalabert before 2001, following his many {{years with the}} Spanish ONCE team of Manolo Saiz. Jalabert said that, [...] "I wanted to retire with a French team, but nobody gave me a good offer, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> CSC instead". At the time, CSC {{was sponsored by the}} French bike manufacturer Look, which is associated with Jalabert. The team also signed American Tyler Hamilton, formerly of U.S. Postal. The 2001 season was a breakthrough with Jalabert's win of the King of the Mountains competition and a stage on Bastille Day at the Tour de France. The season ended with Jalabert winning the 2001 Clásica de San Sebastián.|$|E
500|$|Affeldt {{was signed}} to a oneyear deal by the Cincinnati Reds on January 23, 2008, {{to compete for}} {{a spot in the}} {{starting}} rotation. He said of signing and competing to start, [...] "My heart skipped a beat when they offered that deal. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> my heart there." [...] However, he was placed in the bullpen, where he stayed for the entire year. He won his first game as a Red when the Reds beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 65 on April 2. He made the three hundredth appearance of his career on May 2 in a 20 loss to the Atlanta Braves. His only other decision of the year came on September 3 when he was the losing pitcher in a 65 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.|$|E
500|$|Paolini {{chose to}} have Eragon mature {{throughout}} the book because, [...] "for one thing, it's one of the archetypal fantasy elements". He thought Eragon's growth and maturation {{throughout the book}} [...] "sort of mirrored my own growing abilities {{as a writer and}} as a person, too. So it was a very personal choice for that book." [...] Eragon's dragon, Saphira, was imagined as [...] "the perfect friend" [...] by Paolini. He decided to go in a more [...] "human direction" [...] with her because she is raised away from her own species, in [...] "close mental contact" [...] with a human. [...] "I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, if you will, in its own society, but I haven't had a chance to explore that. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic, the alien, of her race." [...] Paolini made Saphira the [...] "best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud." [...] Saphira's blue tinted vision was in turn inspired by Paolini's own color-blindness.|$|E

Professional wrestlers Andrew [...] "Test" [...] Martin and Oleg [...] "Vladimir Kozlov" [...] Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women.

[...] Zombie is also quoted as saying [...] "I was getting very {{conceptual}} in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!'

500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to have}} been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: [...] "One reason <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew {{that we were going to}} be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984. The music was developed early in the recording sessions for The Joshua Tree. The Edge said, [...] "We were jamming with Brian [...] He was playing keyboards ... we just got this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost highlife, although it's not African at all ... the sound was for me at that time a very elaborate one. I would never have dreamt of using a sound like that before then, but it just felt right, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Bono recorded his vocals in a single take, as {{he felt that he}} could not sing the lyrics a second time. The Edge used a Bond Electraglide guitar to play a solo with a [...] "heavy fuzz" [...] sound {{at the end of the}} song. Three musicians from Toronto—Dick, Paul and Adele Armin—recorded string pieces for the song in Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario. In a six-hour phone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of producer Daniel Lanois, the Armins used [...] "sophisticated 'electro-acoustic' string instrument" [...] they developed called Raads to record a piece created for the song. Dick Armin said, [...] " [...] were interested in using strings, but not in the conventional style of sweetening. They didn't want a 19th-century group playing behind them." [...] Bono found the song so emotional, he was unable to listen to it after it had been recorded.|$|E
