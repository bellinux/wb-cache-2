40|$|The {{effects of}} storage {{conditions}} on some physico-chemical and microbiological qualities of <b>fresh</b> <b>okra</b> were determined and compared. <b>Fresh</b> <b>okra</b> fruits were stored in open plates and sealed polyethylene {{bags in the}} refrigerator (F 1, F 2), on the shelf in the laboratory (S 1, S 2) and in the open sun (O 1, O 2) respectively {{for a period of}} nine (9) days. The moisture content, viscosity, microbiological composition and sensory properties of the stored fruits were determined on a daily basis during the period of storage. The moisture content and viscosity decreased during storage from 92. 00 % and 700 cP in <b>fresh</b> <b>okra</b> to 35. 50 % and 100 cP in okra stored in open plates in the sun (O 2), respectively. On the other hand, bacterial count increased from 2. 27 x 104 CFU/mL in <b>fresh</b> <b>okra</b> to 2. 72 x 105 CFU/mL in okra stored in polyethylene bag in the sun (O 2), while okra stored in open plates on the shelf (S 1) had the highest mould count of 9. 0 x 104 CFU/mL. Okra stored in polyethylene bag in the refrigerator (F 2) had the highest moisture content of 84. 50 %, viscosity of 440 cP and the lowest bacterial and mould counts of 1. 15 x 104 and 4. 0 x 103 CFU/mL, respectively. Mean sensory scores in respect of colour, smell, texture and general acceptability showed that samples stored in the refrigerator scored higher in all attributes and had higher acceptability {{at the end of the}} storage period, which compared favourably with <b>fresh</b> <b>okra</b> fruits...|$|E
40|$|Amylolytic {{inhibition}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} potential strategies in controlling hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic subjects. Okra, a popular vegetable, contains an appreciable medicinal value. In Asia, vigorous cooking vegetables cause loss of some bioactive properties of immense health benefit. This paper describes whether cooking of okra affects its reported carbohydrase inhibitory action. Methanolic extract of fresh and cooked okra was assayed for total phenolic content, α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The phenolic content and inhibitory activity were reduced on cooking but were not completely destroyed even after 10 min of baking at 180 °C. The inhibition was of competitive type against mammalian α-glucosidase and of mixed type against mammalian α-amylase. The results indicated okra pods to be a potential anti-hyperglycemic agent even if eaten after cooking. The total phenolic content (146. 36 ± 0. 12 mg% GAE) and in vitro IC 50 value (86 ± 0. 98 µg) suggest that regular intake of 100 g <b>fresh</b> <b>okra</b> as salad can vitally help maintain blood sugar level of a moderate type 2 diabetic subject...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} various row spacing on the yield and yield {{components}} of okra with groundnut were {{conducted at the}} training and research farm of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri. Yield and yield components of the crops in the various row spacing, monetary value of <b>fresh</b> <b>okra</b> fruits and dry groundnut pods were determined. The efficacy of the inter-cropping on weed suppression was evaluated. Okra plant height showed that R 30 (30 x 50 cm) was highly significant than the other treatments in the experiment. Treatment R 90 (90 x 50 cm) and R 75 (75 x 50 cm) had significantly higher number of branches (p=> 0. 05). The results show that productive nodes increased with increasing row spacing, R 90 had 77 %, while R 75 and R 60 had 69 and 66 %, respectively. This actually affected crop yield. However, R 75, R 60 and R 90 had the highest fruit yield and {{were significantly higher than}} R 30 and R 45 at p> 0. 05. Conversely, R 30 and R 45 suppressed weeds better but had low fruit yield compared to R 75, R 60 and R 9 d. The yield of groundnut showed that R 60 and R 75 had the highest yield although it was not significantly different from R 90.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Traditional Asian and African {{medicine}} use immature okra fruits (Abelmoschus esculentus) as mucilaginous food {{to combat}} gastritis. Its effectiveness {{is due to}} polysaccharides that inhibit the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to stomach tissue. The present study investigates the antiadhesive effect in mechanistic detail. METHODOLOGY: A standardized aqueous <b>fresh</b> extract (<b>Okra</b> FE) from immature okra fruits was used for a quantitative in vitro adhesion assay with FITC-labled H. pylori J 99, 2 clinical isolates, AGS cells, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Bacterial adhesins affected by FE were pinpointed using a dot-blot overlay assay with immobilized Lewis(b), sialyl-Lewis(a), H- 1, laminin, and fibronectin. (125) I-radiolabeled Okra FE polymer served for binding studies to different H. pylori strains and interaction experiments with BabA and SabA. Iron nanoparticles with different coatings were used to investigate {{the influence of the}} charge-dependence of an interaction on the H. pylori surface. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Okra FE dose-dependently (0. 2 to 2 mg/mL) inhibited H. pylori binding to AGS cells. FE inhibited the adhesive binding of membrane proteins BabA, SabA, and HpA to its specific ligands. Radiolabeled compounds from FE bound non-specifically to different strains of H. pylori, as well as to BabA/SabA deficient mutants, indicating an interaction with a still-unknown membrane structure {{in the vicinity of the}} adhesins. The binding depended on the charge of the inhibitors. Okra FE did not lead to subsequent feedback regulation or increased expression of adhesins or virulence factors. CONCLUSION: Non-specific interactions between high molecular compounds from okra fruits and the H. pylori surface lead to strong antiadhesive effects...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the most suitable irrigation frequency and amount in okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L) production grown under irrigation condition. The research {{was carried out in}} a suitable water application method as demonstrated in a sprinkler irrigation system that was established in irrigation research field with a view to determining yield variation and water use efficiency of okra under different irrigation frequencies and amount. Irrigation quantities were based on crop evapotranspiration (ETcrop) of the crop (okra) determined at different stages of growth through lysimeter research that was conducted in National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization (NCAM), Ilorin, Nigeria. Analysis of the irrigation evaluations carried out indicated that the yield of <b>fresh</b> fruit of <b>okra</b> was significantly higher under low frequency than high irrigation frequency. A significantly reduction in yield was actualized with additional irrigation amount and increase in frequency. It was also estimated that water use efficiency of okra increased to appreciable percentage under low frequency of irrigation. The reduction in water use efficiency under high irrigation frequency as compared to low irrigation frequency resulted primarily from decrease in fresh fruit yield...|$|R

The proximate composition <b>fresh</b> <b>okra</b> was moisture 87. 5 %, ash 0. 89 %, total solid 18 %, vitamin-C 11. 1 mg/ 100 g. According to the processing method, the compositions of developed pickles were different. The {{range of moisture content}} varied from 59. 28 % to 69. 20 % for pickle in sugar, oil and combination of both. Since sugar and salt were used, resulting losses in moisture content were observed in all the samples. Vitamin-C content was decreased or lost by oxidation and heat following first-order kinetics which states that concentration has exponential relationship with time. The microbiological studies revealed that total viable counts (bacteria) were high in pickles which was processed in sugar and low which was processed in oil and oil-sugar mixed, respectively. The acceptability of processed pickles was organoleptically evaluated by the panelists using 1 - 9 hedonic scale assigned marks for colour, flavour, texture and overall acceptability. The test score indicated that among three samples, the pickle which was processed in sugar and oil mixed (sample- 3) was the most acceptable. Storage studies were carried out for up to six months at room temperature (27 ºC- 33 ºC) at an interval of 1 month up to first 2 months and at an interval of 2 months for the consecutive 4 months. The result showed that moisture content decreased slightly with time. All the pickles became softer with the passing of time...|$|E

The indiscriminate, large-scale and non-selective uses of pesticides produce adverse effects like resistance and resurgence of mite pests. Specific acaricide/acaro-insecticides are available in the market and being used for the control of mite pests on several crops. Some commonly used acaricides including propargite of recent origin alongwith and without sticker were evaluated under laboratory condition for their ovicidal action against which can be taken advantage in the management of spider mite in okra under agroclimatic condition of Varanasi region. The acaricides tested under laboratory condition for their ovicidal action were propargite 57 EC, ethion 50 EC, propargite 57 EC + sticker (Dhanuvit) and sulphur 80 % WP each at three different concentrations including untreated control (Table 1).

The experiment was a factorial experiment consisted of saw dust ash applied at the rates of 0, 5 and 10 t/ha and poultry droppings applied at the rates of 0, 5 and 10 t/ha. The treatments were {{laid out in a}} randomized complete block design and replicated four times. Results showed that plots amended with 10 t/ha PD + 10 t/ha SDA significantly reduced soil bulk density from 1. 37 – 1. 07 g/cm 3, increased soil total porosity from 48. 4 – 59. 7 % and the percentage of soil weight that is water (soil gravimetric moisture content) was increased by 68. 4 %. There were significant improvements on soil chemical properties with plots amended with 10 t/ha PD + 10 t/ha SDA recording the highest values on soil organic carbon, soil total nitrogen and exchangeable bases. Plots amended with 10 t/ha PD + 10 t/ha SDA significantly increased soil carbon stock by 24 % and soil nitrogen stock by 49. 5 % more than other treatments. There was significant increase in the growth of okra when compared to the un-amended soil with application of 10 t/ha PD + 10 t/ha SDA increasing the <b>fresh</b> <b>okra</b> pod yield by 78. 5 %. Significant positive correlation existed between SCS and organic carbon (r = 0. 6128), exchangeable Mg (r= 0. 5035), total nitrogen (r = 0. 6167) and soil pH (r = 0. 5221). SNS correlated positively with organic carbon (r = 0. 5834), total nitrogen (r= 0. 6101) and soil pH (r = 5150). Therefore applications of these agro-wastes are effective in improving soil properties, increasing soil carbon and nitrogen stock. From the results of the work, application of 10 t/ha PD + 10 t/ha SDA which was the treatment combination that improved soil properties and growth performances of okra than other treatments studied is hereby recommended for soil carbon and nitrogen stock improvement and okra production in the region...|$|E

The four types of green manure plants include Jack bean, Cowpea, Green gram, and Giant sensitive plant. The experiment consisted of five treatments, i. e., T 1 (Control), T 2 (Jack bean), T 3 (Cowpea), T 4 (Green gram) and T 5 (Giant sensitive plant). The experiment was laid in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with four replications. The results showed that Roi-Et soil series (Oxic Paleustults) contained some considerable mean values of organic matter (1. 64 - 1. 66 %) but soil available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium were relatively low, particularly potassium. Green manures of the four legume plants slightly improved soil property of the Roi-Et soil series (tested {{at the end of the}} experimental period). The most effective green manure on stem diameter, bushy diameter, leaf numbers plant - 1 and leaf area of the fifth leaf of the okra plants, in most cases, was found with Jack bean and Cowpea ranked the second. However, in most cases, Cowpea gave a similar effect as that of Green gram and Giant sensitive plant. Pod length and weight pod - 1, pod diameter and edible fresh pod yields (5, 941. 86 kg ha - 1) were highest with Jack bean green manure treatment (T 2), whilst the rest, in most cases, were similar. Green manure treatments gave highly significant effect on total soluble solids of pods over the control treatment, whilst total acidity, fibre and pectin contents were unaffected by green manure treatments.

40|$|Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) is a {{traditional}} crop commercially cultivated {{in many parts of}} the world. <b>Fresh</b> <b>okra</b> has a high nutritional value and grows very quickly with high temperatures, which lends its production to more tropical areas. This study was implemented to evaluate different varieties of okra and determine the optimum density for production in Massachusetts. Two experiments were carried out between May and September of 2009 and 2010 at the UMass Research Farm in South Deerfield, MA. For the variety trial in 2009 : Annie Oakley, Baby Bubba, Cajun Delight, Chifre de Veado, Clemson Spineless, Millionaire, North 2 ̆ 6 South and Santa Cruz 47. The immature pods were harvested when reached 70 mm in length (size desired by the market in the USA) and in another plot for Chifre de Veado and Santa Cruz 47 the pods were harvested when reached 100 mm (market in Brazil). The density trial was set in a randomized complete block design with seven different plant spacings (7. 5, 15. 0, 22. 5, 30. 0, 38. 5, 45. 0 and 52. 5 cm) in double row of plants of Cajun Delight. The pods were harvested three times a week, counted and weighted. Analyses of variance were performed by SAS, and means were compared using Duncan’s new multiple range test (P = 0. 05) and orthogonal polynomial comparisons. In 2010, Santa Cruz 47 harvested based on Brazilian market size had the best performance over the season with the yield of 17. 86 ton. ha- 1 and similar statistic results comparing to North and South (15. 99 ton. ha- 1) and Annie Oakley (15. 24 ton. ha- 1). The differences among the plant spacings in 2010, were represented by a quadratic relationship, where the greater plant spacing for yield was ‘ 52. 5 cm’ with the total yield of 14. 91 ton. ha- 1. Both trials in 2009 were negatively affected by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium spp., which, combined with the cold and wet weather, became very aggressive, especially in the end of the season.

40|$|Investigation was {{conducted}} into the production, processing, marketing and utilization of okra in Egbedore Local Government of Osun state, Nigeria. Data was collected {{through the use}} of well-structured questionnaire and field observations from 100 okra farmers using simple random sampling technique. The data collected was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results show that {{the mean age of the}} respondents was 57. 56 years with a standard deviation of 9. 28 years. All the respondents are males and married. Women do not own personal okra farms but they do work with their husband on the family farms and mostly involved independently at the processing, preservation and marketing levels more than at the production level. About 49. 0 % of the respondents did not have any formal education while 51. 0 % were literates who have access to intermediate farm technology. The mean years of okra production experience is 16. 91 years and the mean okra farm size is 3. 64 acres with standard deviation of 2. 58 acres. All the respondents practiced mixed cropping where other crops such as yam, banana, pineapples, cassava and others were planted with okra. Land preparation for okra production includes land clearing, ploughing, harrowing and heaping or ridging. About 80. 0 % of the okra farmers used cutlass and hoe regularly, which might have been responsible for okra production at subsistence or small-scale level. Only 20. 0 % of the okra farmers employed use of tractor. Majority of the farmers hired labour to supplement family labour. The mean persons day of family labour was 6. 03 and that of hired labour was 1. 25 persons day. Processing and preservation are carried out using traditional techniques of slicing, sun drying and grinding (using mortar and pestle). Sliced and dried okra are stored in gourd, basket and clay-pots. <b>Fresh</b> <b>okra</b> are put in basket lined with leave for maximum of three days during which it is marketed on retail and wholesale basis. Okra is consumed fresh and dried mostly to make draw soup by 81. 0 % of the respondents. Positive and significant relationships existed between socioeconomic characteristics of respondents investigated and total yield of okra produced. The r-value for variable related to land preparation and operation are low, between r = 0. 234 and r = 0. 470. The r-value of variables related to farm size and output (yield) are very high between r = 0. 550 and r = 0. 922, which spelt out a situation tending towards a perfect relationship. There is also sharp difference in the r-value of farm size for okra (0. 922) and farm size for other crops (0. 550). It therefore means that okra yield depends on the size of the farm...|$|E
