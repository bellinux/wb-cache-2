500|$|McEwan {{has been}} open about the autobiographical {{elements}} in the book, and has called it [...] "a muted and distorted autobiography" [...] and [...] "a muted, or transmuted, memoir {{of myself as a}} young writer." [...] There are, however, significant differences between author and character. Haley is both an academic and a writer of fiction, while McEwan has been a professional author for his entire career. The intelligence agency plot is also completely fictional; there was never a scheme such as the one described in the book run by MI5. As McEwan says himself, [...] "unfortunately a beautiful woman never came <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and offered me a stipend." ...|$|E
500|$|Drake was {{featured}} in full-page interviews in the pop press. In July, Melody Maker referred to the album as [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "interesting", though NME wrote in October that there was [...] "not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining". It received radio plays from the BBC's more progressive disc-jockeys such as John Peel and Bob Harris. Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve, which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions. In an interview his sister Gabrielle said: [...] "He was very secretive. I knew he was making an album but I didn't know what stage of completion it was at until he walked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and said, 'There you are.' He threw it onto the bed and walked out!" ...|$|E
2500|$|While Mary found {{participation}} in the artistic avant-garde exhilarating, she unfortunately was sadly lacking in talent. She wrote in her diary: [...] "When I come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and see my work lying around, my sense of my own futility overwhelms me. After so much work, that is all I can do." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Fareway {{had been}} gone two years or more, and I had {{forgotten}} him, when he one day walked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> as I was sitting at my books.|$|R

2500|$|Biographer Robertson-Lorant's cites [...] "Lizzie's adventurous {{spirit and}} {{abundant}} energy," [...] and {{she suggests that}} [...] "her pluck and good humor might have been what attracted Melville to her, and vice versa." [...] An example of such good humor appears in a letter about her not yet used to being married: [...] "It seems sometimes exactly as if I were here for a visit. The illusion is quite dispelled however when Herman stalks <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> without even the ceremony of knocking, bringing me perhaps a button to sew on, or some equally romantic occupation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his success}} on the pro tour, Wetch couldn't make enough money on tournament purses alone. He said in a 1999 interview: [...] "Back in 1996, I thought this game was going somewhere. We were on TV, we were making pretty good money. I was {{proud to be a}} pool player back then ... I'm just going to put more effort and time <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room....</b> The bottom line is, you gotta make money to survive. I don't want to be another statistic." [...] Today Wetch lives in Eagan, Minnesota, not far from his pool room.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980 Cavett {{experienced}} what he {{characterized as}} his [...] "biggest depressive episode". While {{on board a}} Concorde before take off, Cavett broke out into a sweat and became agitated. After he {{was removed from the}} plane, Cavett was taken to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, where he later underwent electroconvulsive therapy. Regarding this method of treatment, Cavett is quoted as saying, [...] "In my case, ECT was miraculous. My wife was dubious, but when she came <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> afterward, I sat up and said, 'Look who's back among the living.' It was like a magic wand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there are}} black cats," [...] he went on; [...] "they're {{said to be}} lucky. Why, {{there never was a}} blacker cat than the one that {{followed}} me <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> in Bolsover Street the very first night I took them." ...|$|R

60|$|It {{was on the}} Sunday {{evening that}} I saw him again. He was shown up <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> about nine o'clock at night, with {{the air of a}} man who is bothered and out of sorts. His hand, as I shook it, was hot and dry.|$|R

60|$|I am {{consequently}} fortified <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> and {{am afraid}} {{to go out to}} look at him. Love from all.|$|E
6000|$|... "This man has {{not only}} written to me, but has {{absolutely}} forced his way <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> when I was dressing for dinner; and absolutely had the impudence {{to tell me that}} if I did not honour some bill which he holds for eight hundred pounds he would proceed against me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' replied John, {{colouring}} rather; 'a chair. The idea of {{a stranger}} coming <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> at half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and taking a pudding! Having taken a chair, Tom, a chair--amazed me by opening the conversation thus: [...] "I believe you are acquainted, sir, with Mr Thomas Pinch?" ...|$|R

60|$|It {{was only}} {{three days after the}} event which I have {{described}} when Lord Rufton burst hurriedly <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was useless}} to ask. What did I {{know about him}} or his thoughts? I locked myself <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "So it was. They broke <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> in {{the dead}} of night, when I was in bed, fast asleep, and took the case away. When the morning came, {{everybody}} rushed <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> and I was so frightened that I did not know what I was doing. How would your daughter bear it, if two men cut away the locks and got into her bedroom when she was asleep? You don't think about that at all." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{those last}} words the miserable {{creature}} alluded to her only child, {{a little girl}} (an infant, I should say), who had passed her first year's birthday by a few months. The farewell interview was to {{take place on the}} mother's last evening on earth; and the child was now brought <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> in charge of her nurse.|$|R
6000|$|This {{was all the}} establishment. When we {{went down}} stairs again, Wemmick led me <b>into</b> <b>my</b> guardian's <b>room,</b> and said, [...] "This you've seen already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{that very}} easily, you know," [...] he explained. [...] "I just slip <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> in the Rue Jolivet, change {{myself into a}} snuffy and hunchback violin-maker, and {{walk out of the}} house under the noses of the spies. In the nearest wine-shop my English friends, in various disguises, are all ready to my hand: half a dozen of them are never far from where I am in case they may be wanted." ...|$|R
60|$|Next morning I {{was awakened}} by Higgs limping <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> in some weird sleeping-suit that he had {{contrived}} {{with the help of}} Quick.|$|E
60|$|Dead leaves blew <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> And alighted upon my bed, And a tree {{declared}} to the gloom Its sorrow {{that they were}} shed.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Poor little creature!' {{said the}} field-mouse, {{for she was}} a kind-hearted old thing at the bottom. 'Come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> warm <b>room</b> and have some dinner with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{know that}} I am being {{followed}} about, {{and if she}} could get <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> it is quite as {{easy for them to}} do so. They may have been there, and I dare say that if I had entered unsuspectingly, and Dan Prince {{had anything to do with}} it, I shouldn't have had much chance. It amused me to see all my drawers turned out and my papers disturbed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On recollection, Drill," [...] said Borroughcliffe, {{in a tone}} {{from which}} all dictatorial sounds were banished, [...] "show the gentleman <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own <b>room,</b> and see him {{properly}} supplied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{shook hands}} on the threshold, peered <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> under his raised arm. [...] "Sleep well. And to-morrow we must do {{something}} practical--practical. [...] ." ...|$|E
60|$|One morning, Mrs. Bretton, coming {{promptly}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> desired me {{to open my}} {{drawers and}} show her my dresses; which I did, without a word.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{my way of}} {{thinking}} that was not so difficult as climbing <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and almost killing me, or stealing the powder from Capt. Boggs' room." ...|$|E

6000|$|Banghurst, at least, was {{beginning}} to understand the case. [...] "Come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> little <b>room</b> in the green pavilion," [...] he said. [...] "It's quite cool there." [...] He took Filmer by the arm.|$|R
