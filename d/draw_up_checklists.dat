40|$|The {{use of the}} {{methodology}} “Road Safety Review” in the road safety analysis has been spread for a long time. These methodologies are used to analyze in detail the different components of the streets and to see which are the elements that affect adversely the road safety. <b>Checklists</b> are <b>drawn</b> <b>up</b> in form of technical questionnaire and classified by topic, each in turn divided by sub-topic. It’s clear that topics to be considered depend on the element to be analyzed, whether it is an arc or a node. Indeed, checklists are divided in two main macro areas, one for the arcs analysis {{and the other for}} the nodes analysis. In this way, it is possible to study in detail each part of the road network and identify the most critical areas. It is important to carry out on-visits in any arc and node, as well as to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> the <b>checklists.</b> Once completed, a large number of data is available, but they are often difficult to be read. In this study, we wanted to develop a management system checklist more fluid and functional, whose main goal is to have an immediate overview of the network situation under consideration. The summary procedure can be resumed through the <b>drawing</b> <b>up</b> of the <b>checklist</b> with the answers “yes”, “no”, “in part”, “n. a”, giving to each answer a score - according to its influence on the road safety; calculating a weighted average for each subcategory and finally, for each category. The result of this analysis is then managed on a GIS platform and represented in graphics. In this way, it is possible to have in real time an overview of the entire network under consideration. In this way, {{it will be possible to}} create a more efficient and manageable use of the checklists...|$|R

40|$|Group. This is an {{informal}} {{group of individuals}} in research institutes and academic departments involved in the measurement of dietary intake and in research into appropriate methodology for such measurement. We value {{the quality of the}} editing in many journals which publish articles on nutrition. There are many occasions, however, when because of differences in editorial practice, it is difficult to make an informed interpretation of the results which are presented. We are therefore proposing that a consistent standard of editing of articles on nutrition be widely adopted. To that end, we have <b>drawn</b> <b>up</b> a <b>checklist</b> of the information which we believe to be necessary if a dietary assessment method is to be adequately described. Without this information, the results of many dietary studies cannot be properly evaluated. The checklist is being published in 1993 (see below). We suggest that authors consult the checklist prior to submitting papers for publication, {{in order to ensure that}} their dietary methods are fully described. We would also recommend that where questionnaires are used, authors include in full any questionnaires used (even if much reduced in size) as an Appendix, or give a reference if it has already been published. If publication is not practicable, we suggest that the authors be required to submit a copy of any questionnaire used for purposes of peer review. Yours etc...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this book}} is to analyse and {{evaluate}} the problems that may arise from ideology-driven shifts in the translation process {{as a result of}} gender differences. The issue of ideology is linked to that of language and power and this link legitimates a linguistic analysis. Recent research in the field of sociolinguistics and related fields has shown that women and men speak differently. The hypothesis in this book is that if they speak differently, then they are also likely to translate differently and possibly for the same ideological reasons. The book is divided into two parts. Part I offers a theoretical background, <b>draws</b> <b>up</b> an analytic <b>checklist</b> of linguistic tools to be employed in the comparative analyses, and states the main hypothesis of this investigation. In Part II four empirical analyses are carried out in order to test this hypothesis within the methodological framework set out in Part I.

40|$|Safe and {{credible}} speed limits; A strategic exploration In a previous publication entitled Safe, what is safe, SWOV designated speed control {{as one of}} the five main points of a policy aimed at achieving a significant reduction of the number of traffic casualties. SWOV proposed striving for a situation in which, within 10 years, all motor vehicle drivers obeyed the then applying speed limits. Seen from this position, this report presents a strategic vision of the short term and medium term (driving) speed policy in the Netherlands. Road safety is the most important line of approach of this report. However, speed also directly influences a) the environment through its emission and noise, and b) the accessibility through journey duration and chance of congestion. These influences are briefly described. The report deals mainly with cars, but the ideas can also influence vans and lorries. An overview of speed policy up until now shows that speed control has largely been achieved by laws (speed limits), infrastructural measures, and enforcement. Especially {{during the second half of}} the 1990 s, a strong impulse was obtained from Sustainably-Safe and the start of regional enforcement projects. At the same time, the speed limits were still being massively exceeded. On average, nearly half the car drivers exceed the speed limit. In other words, it is extremely unlikely that a 'more of the same' approach will result in the targets formulated by SWOV being achieved. Linked to the Sustainably-Safe points of departure and starting out from the current rigid system of speed limits, this report then describes the elements to, in the short term, drastically reduce the percentage of offenders. The key concepts in this are safe limits, credible limits, and information about the limits. We recommend, using yet to be <b>drawn</b> <b>up</b> <b>checklists,</b> that road authorities examine: 1) if the current speed limits are safe, given the circumstances and traffic composition, i. e. that it is almost impossible that a crash will result in severe injury; 2) if the current speed limits are credible, i. e. they and their limit transitions fit how the road looks; and 3) if the driver has sufficient information about the current local limit. The limit or the road layout will have to be adapted where necessary. All this can be done within a few years. The rationale is that, depending on the road type, this will result in a compliance of 70 - 90 %. `Credible' enforcement will remain necessary for those continuing to drive too fast. At the same time, it is essential to work on a further dynamic making of the limits. Dynamic limits benefit the safety as well as the credibility of the limits. After all, dynamic limits make it easier to allow for up to the minute weather and traffic circumstances. We also have to further work on the development of ISA. Our initial thoughts have to be an ISA that is informative and warns, so that the drivers are continuously aware of the limit...|$|R
