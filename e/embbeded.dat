They are a common approach to the computing of quantum mechanical groundstates, and serve as models for population dynamics and as physical pictures for biological evolution. On a computer the efficiency of this simulation method is limited by the approach to the infinitesimal time step, which is necessary to perform alternating diffusion and branching steps. In this paper, a method is described, which eliminates the infinitesimal time step for a certain class of branching processes, if the process of interest can be ``embedded'' into another process, which is solvable by other analytic and/or numerical methods.

This irreversible brain disorder is characterized by neural loss and the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. The aim of the present study was the analysis of the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) background activity from AD patients and elderly control subjects. MEG recordings from 36 AD patients and 26 controls were analyzed by means of six entropy and complexity measures: Shannon spectral entropy (SSE), approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), Higuchi’s fractal dimension (HFD), Maragos and Sun’s fractal dimension (MSFD), and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). SSE is an irregularity estimator in terms of the flatness of the spectrum, whereas ApEn and SampEn are <b>embbeding</b> entropies that quantify the signal regularity. The complexity measures HFD and MSFD were applied to MEG signals to estimate their fractal dimension. Finally, LZC measures the number of different substrings and the rate of their recurrence along the original time series. Our results show that MEG recordings are less complex and more regular in AD patients than in control subjects. Significant differences between both groups were found in several brain regions using all these methods, with the exception of MSFD (p-value < 0. 05, Welch’s t-test with Bonferroni’s correction). Using receiver operating characteristic curves with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, the highest accuracy was achieved with SSE: 77. 42 %.

As devices has more functions, keypad become more complex. Demand for intuitive interface and recent improvement of sensor and <b>embbedded</b> system technology enable gesture-based interface for mobile device. There are some research interests in gesture recognition with mobile device that contains accelerometer and gyroscope. More atention has also been paid to gesture recognition with an accelerometer only, due to the relatively bulky size and high price of a gyroscope. Isolated gesture recognition {{is a kind of}} gesture recognition problem, which is to recognize single gesture from given data. It reqires a kind of pre-processing step to identify block of data involving single gesture before recognition process, whereas continuous gesture recognition system does not. This thesis has three main contribution on accelerometer based gesture recognition. First, we suggested an accelerometer based isolated gesture recognition system. Gravity acceleration components are removed form 3 -d acceleration signals. Then,blocks of acceleration signals, involving single gesture, are extracted. Extracted blocks are applied to gesture model, to calculate likelihoods. Likelihoods for each gesture models are adjusted by corresponding weights. Weighted values of likelihood are finally used to determine a gesture model that best matches the input data in the recognition system. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to model each gesture. In contrast other HMM-based approach, we use continuous LR HMMs and modified recognition criterion istead of discrete ergodic HMMs and maximu likelihood criterion. Second, we proposed an accelerometer based continuous gesture recognition system. Our HMMs-based isolated gesture recognition system can be exteneded continuous gesture recognition system by merging each HMMs to one huge HMM. This approach can be seen as 2 -layered HMMs, the 1 st-layer modeled the transition between gesture models, and 2 nd-layer modeled each gesture. Maximum likelihood criterion, used in isolated gesture recognition system, {{can not be used to}} predict newly incoming acceleration signals in continuous gesture recognition system. Instead of the criterion, ？？-based approach is used to predict test data. Finally, we suggest pseudo velocity signals, which is transformed from acceleratioin signals, for improvement of discriminative power. If we transform acceleration signals to other signals which represent velocity, including direction and speed of motion, it will be helpful to recognize the gesture. Accumulation of acceleration signals can be used for approximation of velocity signals. But in this case, noise of acceleration signals is also accumulated. As noise level of acceleration signal is high, due to lack of rotation information and imperfect gravity component removal, noise level of estimated velocity is extrimly high. We adapt template based approach, which is free from noise accumulation...|$|R

We next quantize the xp Hamiltonian, adding an interaction term that depends on two wave functions associated to the classical boundaries in phase space. The general model is solved exactly, obtaining a continuum spectrum with discrete bound states <b>embbeded</b> in it.

A spectral realization of the Riemann zeros is achieved exploiting the symmetry of the model under the exchange of position and momenta which {{is related to the}} duality symmetry of the zeta function.

We find potentials for which the resonances converge asymptotically toward the average position of the Riemann zeros. These potentials realize, at the quantum level, the semiclassical regularization of H = x p proposed by Berry and Keating. Furthermore, a linear superposition of them, obtained by the action of integer dilations, yields a Jost function whose real part vanishes at the Riemann zeros and whose imaginary part resembles the one of the zeta function. Our results suggest the existence of a quantum mechanical model where the Riemann zeros would make a point like spectrum <b>embbeded</b> in the continuum.

This study investigated the feasibility of implementing graphene into the cement matrix for improving its compressive and tensile or flexural strength. In addition, graphene coating was also investigated for protecting reinforcement steel bars in concrete from corrosion. Within the framework of this study, three main tests were conducted: compressive tests and tensile test on specimens of cement paste and mortar containing graphene, and half-cell potential test on corrosion initiation of steel bars coated with graphene and <b>embbeded</b> in cement mortar.

In this work we investigate the dynamical properties of transport of packages (informations) between sources and previously defined destinations, considering different models of spatially <b>embbeded</b> networks such as lattice and Kleinberg. More precisely, we study a second-order continuous phase transition from a phase of free transport to a congestion phase, when the packages are accumulated in certain regions of the network. By means of a Finite Size Scaling, we describe this phase transition characterizing its critical exponents. For 1 D and 2 D lattice networks, we observe that the critical parameter $p_c$ scales with exponents approximately $- 1 $ and $- 0. 5 $ with respect to the system size. In the case of Kleinberg newtorks where shortcuts between two nodes $i$ and $j$ are added to the network according to a probability distibution given by $P(r_ {ij}) sim r_{ij}^{-alpha}$, we show that the best scenario occurs when $alpha = d$, where $d$ is the dimention of the topology structure. In this regime, package traffic were shown to be more resilient to the increase of number of packages in the network.
