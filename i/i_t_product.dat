As a result market is no longer enjoying healthy profit margin as before and currently sustains at a fierce environment. UK IT retail market is at its mature stage, it will not be an easy task to penetrate the UK IT retail market without well preparation. 	Nintaus is an uprising <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> Company from China which commits itself to both <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> distribution and retail industry since 1997. Apart from the business operation in China, Nintaus also supplies parts and semi-finished <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>products</b> not only countries in Asia, but also to America, UK, France, Germany and Italy. Recently, Nintaus is looking forward to downstream its business from distribution to IT retail industry in UK. 	After working in the IT retail industry for the past few years, it is the researchers humble opinion that the needs of good inventory internal control system is extremely crucial in determining a firms survival in the abovementioned industry. Not only the Inventory Internal Control System functions as a tool to safeguard shareholders assets, it also lays a solid foundation for a company whilst attaining its goals. Thus, this research is carried out to critically identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the UKs IT retail industry through various areas such as stock purchase, stock sales and warehouse stock control. Whilst comparing and examining the effectiveness of the current position of Nintaus's system with the UK IT retail industry, this research also attempts to formulate the appropriate strategies to address the problems that the company may encounter.

40|$|There {{are many}} factors which can become {{obstacles}} against the stable supply of mineral　resources,and unstable supply causes serious disruptions {{in both the}} economy and industry. In Information Technology (IT) industries, some rare metals used as high function materials are immediately needed for import. For instance，small condensers for mobile phones or laptop personal computers require powdered tantalum. Recently, this powdered tantalum is in short supply as the demand for <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>products</b> increases rapidly. This shortage causes a steep rise in price and the market shifts to speculation. Shortages are the most serious problem in Japan, worse than high prices, because we consume 20 - 25 % of the world's products, that is, lack of resources affects not only the economy but also technology. Since supply conditions for each metal are different, {{it is impossible to}} simply discuss the reason why shortages occur. For the base metals that {{have a long history of}} use like copper, iron, lead and zinc, it is relatively easy to clarify their market mechanism, while for most rare metals it is difficult to discuss the relation between supply and demand. In the IT industry, munition industry or space development, new materials are continuously developed from many rare metals, and market mechanisms are always changed by these new materials. In such conditions, the gap in environmental safeguards among countries becomes a serious problem because it highlights the difference of ability in price competition. Developed countries generally load more expenses than developing countries for environmental safeguards, therefore, developing countries have more advantages than developed countries. As a result, many metal mines in developed countries must be closed, and maldistribution of rare metals becomes worse; price manipulation would be easier by monopoly or oligopoly. On the other hand, developing countries make global environmental problems worse because of their resource extractions. In this paper, the basic conditions for a stable supply are considered first, and then shortages, which are caused by environmental problems, is considered...|$|R

This study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} intrathecal (<b>i.</b> <b>t.)</b> infusion of a metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR 1) antisense oligonucleotide, concomitant with chronic morphine treatment, on the development of tolerance to morphine's antinociceptive effects. All rats received chronic (6 day) s. c. administration of morphine to induce opioid tolerance. Additionally, rats were treated with either mGluR 1 antisense (AS), missense (MIS) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) by <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> infusion via chronically implanted <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> catheters connected to osmotic mini-pumps. The effects of acute <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> or s. c. morphine on tail-flick latencies were assessed prior to and following chronic s. c. morphine treatment for all chronic <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> infusion groups. mGluR 1 protein level in the spinal cord was determined by Western blot analysis for all treatments, assessing the efficiency of knock-down with AS treatment. Acute <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> morphine dose-dependently produced antinociception in the tail-flick test in naïve rats. Systemic morphine-treated rats administered <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> ACSF or MIS developed tolerance to <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> morphine. Chronic <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> infusion with mGluR 1 AS significantly reduced the development of tolerance to <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> morphine. In contrast to <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> morphine, tolerance developed to the antinociceptive effects of s. c. morphine, in all <b>i.</b> <b>t.</b> infusion groups, including the mGluR 1 AS group. The spinal mGluR 1 protein level was dramatically decreased after mGluR 1 AS infusion when compared to control animals (naïve and ACSF-treated animals). These findings suggest that the spinal mGluR 1 is involved in the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine. Selective blockade of mGluR 1 may be beneficial in preventing the development of opioid analgesic tolerance...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture-(EAc-) induced antinociception (EAA) at different currents and frequencies in rat spinal cord. We found that naloxone (0. 05 [*]μg <b>i.</b> <b>t.)</b> blocked EAA at different frequencies. Naltrindole (0. 05 [*]μg <b>i.</b> <b>t.)</b> blocked EAA on the 7 th day after EAc of 100 [*]Hz. 5, 7 -Dihydroxytryptamine (100 [*]μg <b>i.</b> <b>t.)</b> significantly inhibited EAA at different frequencies on the 7 th day after EAc.

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the Singapore Government {{embarked}} on a drive to develop Singapore as a Ã�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Boston of the EastÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â� in a bid to attract regional students and international universities to set up campuses in the country. The primary objective of this report is to provide a general overview into the impact of <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> on private education providers in Singapore. Despite the widespread availability of <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> infrastructure in Singapore and the various schemes promoting <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> provided by the Government, a closer look needs to be taken at the real impact and influence of <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> investments on the private schools. The premise of this research is based on the ongoing debate posed by the purported <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> paradox on <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> investmentsÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â� potential for impact on firm performance and in particularly, in relation to firm output. Using three Singapore private schools as case-studies, we will attempt to investigate the various impacts of <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> investments on the schools. However, the study will be reflection of only the tip of the ice-berg as there are almost one thousand registered private schools in Singapore, each with varying levels of academic programs and with varying organizational structures. This report looks in-depth at three of the most common distinct types of private education providers in Singapore; The first is an SME-type private school which provides up to bachelorÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�s degree program in Design, the second is a Government-Linked Company type which provides overseas Masters in Business Administration (MBA) programs, and the last is a Publicly-listed type of private school which also offers MBA programs, although rare, such schools seem to represent a growing trend. This study makes use of conventional private education measures such as student enrolment numbers, administrative costs as well as teaching quality and customer satisfaction to conduct the study. It explores the returns which these schools had enjoyed {{as a result of their}} investments into <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> and looks at some of the factors which had contributed to the results. The results of the study revealed that the investments in <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> were driven by different factors and <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> played similar yet different roles for each school. Whilst <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> did indeed show a propensity to increase revenue and improve customer experience, <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> did not necessarily lead to a lowering of operational costs and the implementation of Ã�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�irrelevantÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â� <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> can backfire, leading to customer dissatisfaction...|$|R
