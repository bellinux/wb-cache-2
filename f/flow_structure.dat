The {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) <b>flow</b> <b>structures</b> and suspended-load {{sediment transport}} {{processes in the}} dam area of the Three Gorges Project (TGP) with large water depth were simulated by a 3 -D mathematical model.

Strong 3 -D features of <b>flow</b> <b>structures</b> {{can be found in}} the dam area, the secondary currents are significant. The suspended-load sediment concentration reduced much faster in wider valley areas, where deposits accumulated. Due to impact of secondary currents, the maximum concentration of suspended-load occurs at the convex side while the minimum at the concave side.

This paper highlights the unique capabilities of an Acoustic Doppler Velocity Profiler (ADVP) for the experimental investigation of coherent <b>flow</b> <b>structures.</b> Contrary to most commercial velocity meters that measure point-by-point, the ADVP simultaneously measures the quasi-instantaneous velocity vector along an entire profile. This allows to obtain detailed spatial-temporal flow information, and by adopting Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis even to visualize flow planes. Whereas most available data on coherent <b>flow</b> <b>structures</b> were obtained in straight uniform flow, this paper illustrates ADVP-measurements of two kinds of coherent <b>flow</b> <b>structures</b> in open-channel bends, where the highly three-dimensional flow is characterized by the existence of cross-stream circulation (helical flow). The first kind concerns the turbulent bulk-oscillation of the pattern of cross-stream circulation cells, whereas the second concerns turbulent coherent structures associated with the bursting process. 1...|$|R
40|$|Gravel bed rivers have complex, porous, and {{irregular}} surfaces, {{characterized by a}} range of morphological forms. These topographical <b>structures</b> determine the <b>flow</b> <b>structures</b> that develop over the river bed, primarily by the shedding of vortices in the downstream wake of protruding clasts.

Effects of the jet-to-crossflow momentum ratio on various fundamental mechanisms dictating the intricate flow phenomena, including <b>flow</b> <b>structures,</b> turbulent characters and frequency behaviors, have been studied. The complex <b>flow</b> <b>structures</b> and the relevant flow features are discussed to exhibit the evolution of shock structures, vortical structures and jet shear layers.

The standard case of cross-flow over a bare tube, i. e. no surface extension, is also tested as a benchmark. Experiments are conducted in a wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers of 4000 and 16000. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used for flow visualization on two different perpendicular planes. To characterize {{the size of the}} <b>flow</b> <b>structures</b> downstream of the tube, for each of the aforementioned case, two-point correlation, as a statistical analysis tool, has been used. It has been observed that by decreasing the Reynolds number, the <b>flow</b> <b>structures</b> are further stretched in streamwise direction for both bare and finned-tube cases. This is, however, more pronounced with the former. Interestingly, with a foam-wrapped tube the sizes of the <b>flow</b> <b>structures</b> are found to be independent of the Reynolds number.
