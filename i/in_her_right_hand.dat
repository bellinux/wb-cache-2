5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E
5|$|India's first {{records of}} {{smallpox}} {{can be found}} in a medical book that dates back to A.D. 400. This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox. India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess Shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted. Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims. Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease. Some Indian women, in an attempt to ward off Shitala, placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes.|$|E
5|$|Whilst wool {{remained}} {{an important part}} of the town's economy into the 19th (and even 20th) centuries, other industries were established in the town. A bell-foundry started in 1684 by William Cockey grew to be a major producer of components for the developing gas industry and employer of 800 people. The J W Singer brass foundry and bronze-casting works, was a major employer and produced bronze statues. John Webb Singer was born in Frome and established his art metal work foundry in 1851. They made brass ornaments for local churches and became known through the Oxford Movement within the Church of England which led to increasing demand for church ornaments. In addition to church ornaments the firm developed the facilities and expertise to create large statues. One of the first statues cast was a copy of General Gordon riding a camel. The firm was also responsible for the bronze statue of Boudica with her daughters in her war chariot (furnished with scythes after the Persian fashion), which was commissioned by Prince Albert and executed by Thomas Thornycroft. It was not cast in bronze until 1902, 17 years after Thornycrofts death, and now stands next to Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament, London. The statue of Lady Justice on the dome above the Old Bailey was executed by the British sculptor, F. W. Pomeroy and cast by Singers. She holds a sword <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and a pair of weighing scales in her left. The statue is popularly supposed to show blind Justice; however, the figure is not blindfolded. The statue of Alfred the Great at Winchester was a further commission. The statues from Singers have also been exported around the world. Printing was another major industry, with the Butler and Tanner printworks being set up in the middle of the century. Brewing was also a source of employment.|$|E
50|$|Iconography: Rides on a lioness and {{has eight}} hands. She holds a kamandalu, Dhanush, Bada and Kamal <b>in</b> <b>Her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>Her</b> left hands hold Amrit Kalash(pot of nectar), japa mala(prayer beads), Gada and Chakra - in that order.|$|R
50|$|Mysterious girl {{assigned}} to the Team Leviathan. Receives preferential treatment in UCAT Japan and those who know her true story are very few, like Ooshiro Kazuo. She has lost her memory, so she does not remember where she came from or her own parents, so she joins the Leviathan Road to find information about her past. However, the clues are very scarce as besides her name, she only has a men's ring <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand's</b> middle finger {{and the memory of}} the Silent Night song.|$|R
500|$|The temple {{contains}} the earliest {{representation of a}} six-armed Mahishamardini (Durga) image, shown inside a gavaksha frame from the chest upward with a headdress, karna kundala (ornament), mala (garland) and kankana (anklet). Durga is seen holding a sword in the upper left hand while in the upper <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> she is seen pressing {{the face of the}} demon buffalo. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> left middle hand, she is seen piercing the neck of the demon with a trishula (trident), while <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lower left hand she holds a pointed weapon. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> middle <b>hand</b> she holds Khetaka while <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lower <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> she holds a bow. A similar image of Durga is found in the Vaital temple, which is a famous Shakta center.|$|R
25|$|Cassiopeia {{has been}} {{variously}} portrayed throughout her {{history as a}} constellation. In Persia, she was drawn by al-Sufi as a queen holding a staff with a crescent moon <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> wearing a crown, {{as well as a}} two-humped camel. In France, she was portrayed as having a marble throne and a palm leaf in her left hand, holding her robe <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> This depiction is from Augustin Royer's 1679 atlas.|$|E

The statue of the Virgin of Belém, also referred to as Nossa Senhora de Bom Successo (Our Lady of Good Success), Nossa Senhora das Uvas (Our Lady of the Grapes) or the Virgem da Boa Viagem (Virgin of Safe Homecoming) is depicted holding a child <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and a bunch of grapes in her left.|$|E

She has four arms. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> two <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> she carries a mango {{and in the}} other a branch of a mango tree. <b>In</b> one of <b>her</b> left hands, she carries a rein {{and in the other}} she has her two sons, Priyankara and Shubhankara.|$|R
50|$|As reconstructed, the {{completed}} statues are pastiches of two Roman marbles, {{one for the}} head {{and the other for}} the body. Athena wears an unusual, cross-slung aegis decorated with the Gorgon's head. She is bare-headed, without shield, holding <b>her</b> helmet out <b>in</b> <b>her</b> extended <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> and with <b>her</b> left grasping her spear {{near the top of the}} shaft.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} interpretations for the orb Mary is holding <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> It {{is tempting to}} construe it as the globus cruciger of the Holy Roman Empire. However, a globus cruciger is not attested {{as part of the}} Holy Roman regalia until the coronation of Conrad II in 1024, and besides in the habitual depiction of the globus cruciger the orb is always shown held by the full hand and all fingers, not just three.|$|E
25|$|A provincial, {{though not}} crude, small (7.5cm high) Roman bronze of a seated Epona, {{flanked by a}} small mare and stallion, found in England, is conserved in the British Museum. Lying on her lap and on the patera raised <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> are disproportionately large ears of grain; ears of grain also {{protrude}} from the mouths of the ponies, whose heads are turned towards the goddess. On her left arm she holds a yoke, which curves up above her shoulder, an attribute unique to this bronze statuette.|$|E
25|$|The obverse design {{features}} a rendition of Augustus Saint-Gaudens' full length figure of Lady Liberty with flowing hair, holding a torch <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and an olive branch in her left, with the Capitol {{building in the}} left background. The design is taken from the $20 Saint-Gaudens gold coin which was commissioned by Theodore Roosevelt to create coins like the ancient Greek and Roman coins. The reverse design, by sculptor Miley Busiek, features a male eagle carrying an olive branch flying above a nest containing a female eagle and her hatchlings.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{full-length}} bronze female figures, {{one on each}} side, flank the pedestal's base. Each {{figure is}} seated and wears classical robes. [...] "Justice", the figure on the proper left, has long, braided hair. Her proper left arm is raised to shoulder height; she holds a sword <b>in</b> <b>her</b> proper <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> The figure of [...] "History", on the proper right, holds a tablet on her lap with her proper left hand and a writing tool <b>in</b> <b>her</b> proper <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>Her</b> hair is knotted {{at the back of}} her head.

It is executed in Baveno granite from quarries at Lake Maggiore, Italy, and was chosen for its structural excellence and color. The granite used in the monument was the first of its kind to be imported into the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The statue {{depicts a}} {{kneeling}} woman and {{rests on a}} granite pedestal and concrete base.

50|$|Iconography: She {{rides the}} bull, just like Goddess Shailputri. She has four arms, holding a Trishul <b>in</b> one of <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> and depicts the Abhayamudra {{with the other}} <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> She carries a Damaru in one left hand and depicts the Varadamudra <b>in</b> <b>her</b> other left hand.|$|R
25|$|Mary is {{depicted}} {{sitting on a}} stool, with a slightly oversized Christ child figure sitting on her lap. She wears a tight, long-sleeved tunic and a cloak (palla) drawn over her shoulders. On her head she wears a veil, the ends of which are covered by the cloak. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> she holds aloft a globe with her thumb and two fingers, while her left hand supports the infant in her lap. The Christ figure himself wears a pontifical gown and presses a book against his breast with his left hand.|$|E
25|$|The letter shown <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> {{contains}} a demand from David {{for her to}} choose between fidelity to her husband or obedience to her king, and is an anecdotal catalyst for her introspection. In representing this moment, Rembrandt extrapolated from the biblical text, which treated Bathsheba incidentally while focusing on David's sinfulness. As a result, her expression is profound enough to suggest not only her sense of resignation, but the broader narrative as well. As a conception of the nude figure suffused with complexity of thought, Bathsheba at Her Bath is nearly unique in art.|$|E
25|$|Danseuse au café is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 146.1 x 114.3cm (57.5 x 45 in). As the title indicates the painting represents a woman dancing in a café. She is {{shown on the}} right half of the canvas wearing an elaborate gown and holding <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> a bouquet of flowers. In the café scene, four others, two women and two men, can be observed on {{the left of the}} painting, three of whom are seated in front of a table upon which various items are placed (including beverages), and one of whom is placed seemingly in the background (upper left).|$|E
5000|$|Garfield's inaugural {{ball was}} hosted {{the night of}} the inauguration in the Smithsonian Institution's Arts and Industries Building, {{completed}} earlier that year. The centerpiece of the celebration was a large [...] "Statue of America" [...] in the museum's rotunda, who held an electric light <b>in</b> <b>her</b> raised <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> The music at the event was directed by conductor John Philip Sousa, and performed by the Germania Orchestra of Philadelphia and the U.S. Marine Band.|$|R
50|$|Iconography: Goddess Chandraghanta mounts the tigress. She {{wears the}} {{semi-circular}} moon(Chandra) {{on her forehead}}. The half-moon on her forehead looks like the bell(Ghanta) and hence, Her name. She is depicted with ten hands. Goddess Chandraghanta carries Trishul, Gada, sword and kamandalu <b>in</b> <b>Her</b> four left hands and keeps the fifth left hand in Varadamudra. She carries a lotus flower, arrow, Dhanush and Japa Mala <b>in</b> <b>Her</b> four <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> and keeps the fifth <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> in Abhaya Mudra.|$|R
50|$|Mangala Temple was {{constructed}} in the 19th century CE and is located in Village Patia in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha. The enshrined deity is the four-armed Mangala. The deity holds a conch <b>in</b> <b>her</b> upper <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and a wheel <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lower left hand. The upper left hand of the deity assumes the varadamudra, while <b>her</b> lower <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> assumes the abhayamudra. The deity stands on a pedestal. The temple {{is located in the}} Harijan sahi (a residential ward restricted to Harijans) of Patia, whose residents maintain it.|$|R
25|$|On {{the left}} half of Metzinger's L'Oiseau Bleu, holding <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> a yellow fan (éventail) is a sitting nude who {{in her left}} hand holds a mirror into which she gazes. In {{the rest of the}} scene, various items and divers {{elements}} are placed, including in the upper center (practically at the highest point of the painting) the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, located at the summit of the butte Montmartre, the highest point of the city. This popular monument is just up the hill from where Metzinger lived and worked (Rue Lamarck) prior to his move to Meudon around 1912. It is also a short distance from Le Bateau-Lavoir, widely known as the birthplace of Cubism.|$|E
25|$|Femme à l'Éventail is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 90.7 x 64.2cm (35.75 x 25.25 in). As the title indicates, the painting represents a woman holding a fan. She {{is shown in}} half-length sitting on {{what appears to be}} a green bench. She is wearing an elaborate gown with a Polka dot pattern consisting of an array of blue-filled circles, and holds <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> a folded fan. The left hand of the woman holds a paper that bares the artists signature (lower left). She wears a hat with feathers or plumes of fashionable dressed Parisian women. She is placed in an outdoor setting with buildings, windows and green shutters in the 'background'. The work is similar stylistically with another work exhibited at the same Salon d'Automne, Dancer in a café (Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo New York).|$|E
25|$|The {{subjects}} of later paintings impersonating Circe {{have a history}} of sexual experience behind them, starting with “Mary Spencer in the character of Circe” by William Caddick, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter George Stubbs. A portrait of “Mrs Nesbitt as Circe” by Joshua Reynolds followed in 1781. Though this lady’s past was ambiguous, she had connections with those in power and was used by the Government as a secret agent. In the painting she is seated sideways, wearing a white, loose-fitting dress, with a wand <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and a gilded goblet near her left. A monkey is crouching above her in the branches of a tree and a panther fraternizes with the kitten on her knee. While the painting undoubtedly alludes to her reputation, it also places itself within the tradition of dressing up in character.|$|E
50|$|This {{shrine of}} Goddess Sarala of Jhankada {{is one of}} the most spiritually {{elevated}} expression of Shaktism from time immemorial. The heavenly abode of the Goddess is existent in the village of Sarala (Kanakapur) of the Jagatsinghpur district, located on the eastern coast of India. It is believed that Goddess Sarala is a synthesis of divine figure of Durga and Matangi.Three idols of Goddess are there in the sanctum sanctorum of the main temple. The main idol, carved out of stone is of eight-armed keeping right feet on the lion in Mahisha Mardini posture. As per the main priest (Puja Panda), the dhruva/main idol of Goddess is stationary (Achalanti Mula Vigraha) and she holds Sword (Khadga), Trident (Trishul), Manuscript (Pustak) and Lute or Veena <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> and Disk (pattisha), Bow (Karmuka), Bell (Ghanta) and the head of Buffalo Demon (Mahishasura) left hands. Some scholars associate Devi as Matangi mahavidya.The second idol of Maa is four-armed, holding Shankha, Chakra, Varada and abhaya mudra, and the third idol is two-armed, made out of eight precious metals (Ashtadhatu). These idols of Maa are taken out of temple in different ceremonial occasions and known as movable idols (Chalanti Bigraha).|$|R

50|$|Kalabhairavi Temple {{is located}} (Location Lat- 20°21’ 40", Long- 85° 50’ 77", Elev- 76 ft) within the Jaleswar Siva Temple Precinct, Kalarahanga. The {{enshrined}} deity is a four armed Chamunda sitting over a dead body. The deity holds a khatuanga <b>in</b> <b>her</b> upper <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> a snake in upper left hand, a severed head in lower {{left hand and}} the lower <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> is broken. The deity is crowned with jatamukuta and wearing a garland of skull. The whole image rests over a pedestal measuring 0.50 metres in height.|$|R
25|$|Athena {{is shown}} to have an aegis diagonally across her peplos in the sculpture. The aegis has a {{miniature}} Gorgon's head on it along with a border of snakes. Its small dimensions make it {{to be more like}} a marker of Athena’s identity than an actual piece of armament. The diagonal positioning of the aegis is seen to give Athena a swaying motion — some say in order to have the viewer’s eye look towards what Athena was holding <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> There is a hole in the palm of the right hand and the right thumb indicating that Athena was originally holding an item, but that item's identity it is not certain. Some suggest it might have been an owl or the representation of victory, Nike. It is also thought that Athena may have held in her left hand a spear or a shield.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} slab, BM 536, {{the battle is}} evenly balanced, one Amazon and one Greek having the better of the {{fighting}} {{in a pair of}} duels. On the following slab, BM 533, appears the first casualty, BM 533:1, an Amazon probably holding the handle of an axe <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> as she collapses. Her helmet lies on the ground to her right side. The dress of the dying Amazon here, an overgirt peplos and mantle, distinguishes her from the other Amazon warriors who wear the more typical chitoniskos. The axe and helmet identify her as a combatant, and the peplos therefore must indicate that {{she is one of the}} three Amazonian queens who take part in the battle. As a queen and the first casualty she must be Melanippe, and the Greek who kills her must be Telamon. Telamon, BM 533:2, stands adjacent to his victim but now has tumed his spear to another.|$|E
25|$|Mother and {{daughter}} both wear long white sundresses. The elegant presentation, {{which also includes}} a straw hat for each and a parasol for the mother, {{is typical of the}} fashion of the time, around 1910. The 19-year-old Maria has a simple floor-length dress that emphasizes her slender silhouette. At the neck the dress is finished with a stand-up collar. The tight-fitting sleeves contrast {{with the rest of the}} dress, and are of a more transparent white cloth, through which shines the skin. Of similar fabric is an panel of cloth mounted below the chest on a large ring. The sea wind blows the cloth into arabesques behind the daughter. Under the dress appears a brown leather shoe; on its side reflections emphasize the smooth surface. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> Maria holds a yellow straw hat with a wide, sweeping brim, decorated with purple colored flowers and a turquoise bow. She has pinned her brown hair into a knot, so that her face comes into its own.|$|E

30|$|A 10 -year-old girl {{underwent}} {{application of}} a humeral lengthening frame of <b>her</b> <b>right</b> humerus to correct severe humeral shortening gradually. The shortening was secondary to osteomyelitis of the right proximal humerus aged 10  weeks. This had left her with a 10 -cm discrepancy between the lengths of {{the right and left}} humeri, resulting in significant functional difficulties. The lengthening frame was applied with the elbow extended without any intra-operative complications. <b>In</b> recovery, <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> was warm and well perfused with full sensation and movement of the wrist and small hand joints. On the first post-operative day, however, she complained of severe burning pain <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>right</b> arm and <b>hand</b> requiring significant opiates for relief and a pain team review. Examination revealed evidence of a partial right radial nerve palsy; weakness of right wrist extension, an inability to extend the fingers and diminished sensation on the dorsum of the first webspace. She displayed evidence of hyperalgesia with an exaggerated response to pin-prick on the dorsum of the first webspace. There was no mechanical allodynia. All other hand and wrist movements and sensation were intact.|$|R
50|$|In the Indirect Method of {{application}} an intermediary is employed, {{and the patient}} is not directly examined. The intermediary, for example, directs a laser pointer held <b>in</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> at the appropriate acupuncture point, for example, atop the patient's head, {{while at the same}} time the diagnostician performs the test on the left hand of the intermediary.|$|R
