The EMB generates the accurate clamping force commanded by a driver through an independent motor control at each wheel instead of using existing mechanical components. In general, an EMB undergoes parameter variation and a backdrivability problem. For this reason, the cascade control strategy (e. g., force-position cascade control structure) is proposed and the disturbance observer is employed to enhance control robustness against model variations. Additionally, this paper proposed the clamping force estimation method for a sensor-less control, i. e., the clamping force observer (CFO).

The actual EMB system shows stick-slip friction of mechanical parts which is difficult to model and apply to design of controller. This research is focused on exquisitely describing this stick-slip friction. In order to do this, the experiment about EMB is proceeded in the open loop system with the motor current command and data from the experiment is used for identification of model parameters during stiction. Then, parameters during slip is estimated in the closed loop system. Finally, developed friction model of EMB is proposed and it is utilized for design of feed-forward controller.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} the design of {{intelligent}} actuator logic for <b>Electro-Mechanical</b> <b>Brake</b> (EMB) system using fuzzy control. Previous studies simplified EMB system as a linear system or removed coulomb friction and backlash for the convenience of calculation. However, nonlinear components such as coulomb friction and backlash should be considered because the inherent nonlinearity in the high operating speed of EMB system is critical. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt full Brake by Wire (BBW) model of EMB system. Unlike Electro-Hydraulic Brake (EHB) system, EMB has no hydraulic back-up system, and is operated totally by electric and electro-mechanical components. Therefore, safety is the {{one of the most important}} problems in designing an EMB system. To control the EMB system, we developed fuzzy logic controller, which is effective in a complex and nonlinear system. MATLAB SIMULINK is used to provide the verification of the control performance. Simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy logic controller forces the EMB actuator to follow the command input precisely. This study will be a base of further research, whose purpose is to develop an intelligent actuator logic using adaptive fuzzy control for EMB system in noise and disturbance.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} estimating clamp force in an <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>brake</b> (EMB) for an automotive brake-by-wire (BBW) system. A clamp force sensor is typically used in EMB designs {{and the elimination of}} this component is strongly demanded due to implementation difficulties and cost issues. The motivation behind this thesis is to make developmental inroads into the deficiencies provided by previous attempts to estimate clamp force. Previous attempts have deficiencies for high speed braking applications as well as handling thermally dependent parameter variations. A dynamic stiffness model to estimate clamp force is developed that relies on the actuator resolver sensor and two additional temperature sensors. Previous attempts to estimate clamp force have been stiffness based and have not been capable of successfully modelling parameter variations in response to heating. This thesis introduces new developments on how to model stiffness parameter variations under the influence of heating. Two temperature sensors are required to be employed in this new approach. These additional sensors will not have a considerable impact towards the cost savings created by omitting a clamp force sensor. A torque balance model to estimate clamp force is also developed that relies on the actuator resolver sensor and actuator motor current sensors. A training strategy is used for the dynamic stiffness and torque balance models to estimate clamp force so that wear dependent parameters can be adapted. The two independent models to estimate clamp force are fused using various sensor fusion algorithms to give improved estimates of clamp force. A maximum-likelihood estimator is used to optimize the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of estimation. This is followed by implementing a Kalman filter to estimate clamp force in an EMB. The dynamic stiffness model is used as the state space equation in the Kalman filter, whilst the torque balance model is used to give measurement updates. Experimental verification showed that the Kalman filter was more accurate than the maximum-likelihood estimator as expected, however the Kalman filter required more computational burden. A RMSE of 0. 5 kN was attained for the Kalman filter and 0. 56 kN for the maximum-likelihood estimator...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{theories}} underlying {{control engineering}} and real-time systems engineering use idealized models that mutually abstract from central {{aspects of the}} other discipline. Control theory usually assumes jitter-free sampling and negligible (constant) input-output latencies, disregarding complex real-world timing effects. Real-time systems theory uses abstract performance models that neglect the functional behavior and derives worst-case situations with limited expressiveness for control functions, e. g., in physically dominated automotive systems. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates state-of-the art timing models into functional analysis. We combine physical, control and timing models by representing them as a network of hybrid automata. Closed-loop properties can then be verified on this hybrid automata network by using standard model checkers for hybrid systems. Since the computational complexity is critical for model checking, we discuss abstract models of timing behavior that seem particularly suited {{for this type of}} analysis.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{parking brake}} {{is one of}} the most important safety subsystems in a vehicle. Its main function is to hold a vehicle in position when parks on a flat or slope road. A typical problem of the mechanical parking brake system is that it requires a driver to apply sufficient or sometimes high pulling force to keep the vehicle stationary at any road slopes. Insufficient pulling force may cause the vehicle to move away or known as rollaway phenomenon. In order to overcome such an issue, an <b>electro-mechanical</b> parking <b>brake</b> (EMPB) is proposed and developed. The EMPB system is then tested using in-house parking brake test bench. It is found that the EMPB takes within 0. 6 s to fully engage and within 0. 5 s to disengage the system, respectively at 11. 3 degrees of the road slope.

Regenerative brakes still need to be supported by conventional friction brakes because of failures occurrence, fully-charged battery conditions, and unexpected variations of the tire-road friction coefficient. In order to achieve a smooth coordinated action between the regenerative and the conventional friction brakes, the brake linings coefficient of friction (BLCF) needs to be monitored. The main contribution of this work lies on the estimation of the BLCF using a tire-model-less approach. In particular, two different observer designs are proposed and compared. Whereas the proposed approach does not rely on any fixed tire modelization, the state estimation is robust against variations in the road friction characteristics and tire uncertainties caused by inflating pressure variations, wear, and aging. The functionality of the developed observers is tested in IPG CarMaker® by employing an experimentally validated EV, equipped with four onboard motors and an EHB system. Braking events are simulated at different deceleration levels on both dry and wet surfaces. Finally, the compensation function against variations in the BLCF is implemented in the EHB controller to achieve constant deceleration levels.
