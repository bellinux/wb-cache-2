40|$|Summary Although {{the concept}} of aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> has quickly gained {{prominence}} among aid donors as well as aid recipients, relatively {{little is known about}} its impact on trade-related performance. We use data on a large subset of developing countries for recent years to examine the extent to which various types of aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> have helped recipient countries' trade performance. We find that aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> facilitation reduces the costs of <b>trading.</b> Moreover aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> has an overall positive and significant impact on exports. This effect is entirely driven by aid to economic infrastructure, while the other main category of aid <b>for</b> <b>trade,</b> aid to productive capacity, has no discernible effect on exports. Its strong positive association with exports at the sectoral level is due to an allocation skewed toward already well performing sectors. aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> aid effectiveness trade cost of trading exports...|$|R

They also had extra third and fifth round picks from the Houston Oilers, as part of the 1978 trade for the Buccaneers' first overall pick. They received a third-round pick from the Baltimore Colts in return for running back Dan Hardeman. The Buccaneers' own third-round pick went to the Miami Dolphins as NFL-ordered compensation for signing Randy Crowder. Defensive end Council Rudolph was traded to the Dolphins in return for an eighth-round pick. Other picks were traded as follows: round 4 to the Detroit Lions for Rockne Freitas, round 5 to the Seattle Seahawks, round six to Oakland for Rik Bonness, round seven to the Washington Redskins for Frank Grant, round eight to the New York Jets for Darrell Austin, and round ten to the San Francisco 49ers for Jim Obradovich.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch bid {{to control}} {{southeast}} Asia's spice trade hinged on two principal strategies: the first: {{the first was}} to directly attack Iberian assets in the region, including Portugal's stronghold at Malacca and Spanish shipping between Manila and Acapulco; the second was to forge alliances with local rulers and offer protection in exchange <b>for</b> <b>trading</b> concessions. An important alliance was consolidated in 1603 when Dutch East India Company ships joined forces with the Sultanate of Johor to capture the Santa Catarina, a Portuguese carrack transiting the Singapore Straits. The vessel's pillaged cargo was later sold in Europe for approximately 3.5million florins, equivalent to half the Dutch East India Company's paid capital and double that of the British East India Company. Soon after this triumph, possibly in 1605, Dutch officers presented the Seri Rambai to Johor's sultan.|$|E

Mieszko provided for all their equipment and needs, even military pay for their children regardless of their gender, from the moment they were born. This force was supported by a much greater number of foot fighters. Numerous armaments were found in the Piast gords, many of them of foreign, e.g. Frankish or Scandinavian origin. Mercenaries from these regions, as well as German and Norman knights, constituted a significant element of Mieszko's elite fighting guard.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{effectiveness}} of aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> in promoting trade – both exports and imports – and conditions which tend to make it most effective. The review provides abundant {{evidence to suggest that}} aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> is indeed broadly correlated with increases in <b>trade.</b> Aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> works best when it is focused on reducing the costs of trading through improvements in infrastructure, trade facilitation, trade-related public institutions (such as customs, standards administration, and export promotion), and polices (including eliminating policy barriers to competition). Aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> – in varying forms – directed to low income countries is particularly helpful in promoting trade. Analysis in this chapter suggests that aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> destined to low and lower-middle income countries is likely to have a high pay-off. Typically, one dollar invested in aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> is associated with an increase of nearly USD 8 of exports from all developing countries – while one dollar of aid <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> to International Development Association (IDA) -eligible poorest countries amounted to US 20 in new exports and to USD 9 for all low and lower-middle income countries...|$|R

5|$|The {{national}} French standard until 1799 {{was based}} on a famous artefact called the , which probably dates back to {{the second half of the}} 15th century. It is an elaborate set of nesting weight pieces, with a total metric weight of 12.238kg. The set is now shown in the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris. The total nominal value of the set is 50 marcs de Troyes or marcs de Paris, a mark being 8ounces. The ounce poids de marc had therefore a metric equivalent of 30.59g. The poids de marc was used as a national French standard <b>for</b> <b>trading,</b> for gold, silver and jewels, and for weighing medicine. It was also used in international communications between scientists. In the time before the French Revolution, the civil pound also played the role of the apothecaries' pound in the French apothecaries' system, which otherwise remained a standard system of the Romance (24 grains per scruple) type.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations <b>for</b> <b>trading</b> of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E
