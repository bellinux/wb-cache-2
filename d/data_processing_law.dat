Securities markets are, in essence, a form of <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Consequently, Moore’s <b>law</b> has driven important changes in those markets over the past forty years.

The effectiveness of regulatory changes, such as the lowering of brokerage commissions and the reduction in bid ask spreads, depended on reduced <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> costs, that is on Moore's Law. Deregulation of brokerage commissions could not have reduced rates by as much as it did if we had not had decreasing costs of <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> The reduction in bid ask spreads which followed decimalization of securities quotes depended on improved <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Continued reductions in <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> costs will require a new regulatory approach.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{entitled}} “Role of Police Institution for Advocacy-Malpractice in Yogyakarta”. A policeman {{as the one}} who upholds the law has a strategic position in preventing any advocacymalpractice actions. A malpractice is a wrong-doing, neglect of duty as the dishonest use of a position of trust for personal gain which goes against the proper regulation and ethical codes of his/her profession. The constraints faced by Police Institution to handle this problem are the facts that an advocate is a person who knows law well and expert in it so s/he knows how to break the law easier than those who are not. The problem is the content of material law in the context of authentication. Role of civil society is also important in preventing these advocacy malpractice actions. Research method for this thesis was using juridical-normative law which was a research that stressed the study of and <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> on <b>law</b> aspects by scrutinizing advocacy ethical codes and the regulations on advocacy matters. This research needed primary data as the main data and the secondary ones as the supporting data. Analysis method of this thesis was a qualitative analysis. This method was conducted sistematically by performing inductive reasoning procedures within the starting point of actual events based on actual regulations and experts’ judgements. Result of this research shows that Police Institution and Policemen should be cooperated with the civil society in preventing advocay-malpractice actions. And as the suggestion, any citizens are to report to Police Institution whenever the actions are met or even, when they become the victim of the malpractice actions. ...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a new distributed <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> model based on automata where <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> is modeled as state transformations. This approach falls within a category of declarative concurrent paradigms which are fundamentally different than imperative approaches in that communication and function order are not explicitly modeled. This allows an abstraction of concurrency and thus suited for distributed systems. Automata give us a way to formally describe <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> independent from underlying processes while also providing routing information to route data based on its current state in a P 2 P fashion around networks of distributed processing nodes. Through an implementation, named Pumpkin, of the model we capture the automata schema and routing table into a <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> protocol and show how globally distributed resources can be brought together in a collaborative way to form a <b>processing</b> plane where <b>data</b> objects are self-routable on the plane...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the status of electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services and/or functions in the public schools of Indiana. To provide additional insight to the organizational structure of a <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center, four existing regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers serving a group of school districts in adjoining states through a centrally located computer facility were examined. The procedures used in collecting and analyzing the data for the study included the following: (1) appropriate data gathering instruments were designed, (2) a questionnaire accompanied by a cover letter explaining the {{purpose of the}} study was mailed to each superintendent of all school corporations in Indiana, (3) a personal interview was conducted with the administrative personnel directly responsible for the operation of each of the four selected regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers, (3) <b>data</b> obtained from the questionnaire and the personal interview were compiled, tabulated, analyzed, and presented, and (4) the findings, conclusions and recommendations for further study were presented. The superintendents were asked to respond to the question, "Do you presently utilize <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> (computer and punch card) equipment in any part of the operation and/or administration of your school district?" Those school administrators responding "YES" were then asked to indicate those services and functions which were accomplished in their school corporation, to indicate the method of obtaining <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services and to indicate methods. All of the superintendents were asked to indicate their future plans for the use of <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services in their local school corporation(s). The systematic analysis of the procedures necessary for implementing educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to a group of school districts in adjoining states included the following elements: (1) background information, (2) objectives, (3) historical development, (4) equipment, (5) personnel, (6) services and/or functions, (7) orientation procedures, (8) advantages of a central computer facility, (9) disadvantages of a central computer facility, and (10) future plans. The findings indicated the following major general conclusions to be appropriate the level of their satisfaction with both services. There has been only limited development toward the organization of educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> systems throughout the state of Indiana. This situation lends itself to collective exploration by interested school administrators toward cooperative arrangements of obtaining <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services, regardless of the size of the school district. Qualified and competent personnel must be responsible for the operation of the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center. The director of the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center should be totally familiar with all facets of school administration so that he may use electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to facilitate the instructional program. A central computer facility organized to provide electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to a group of school districts is capable of supporting the more sophisticated computer equipment at a reduction in cost, provided the equipment is operating at a near capacity work load. It is possible for a group of school districts to benefit from the developmental experience of existing <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers. The amount of time once considered necessary to progress from feasibility of operation to full-scale implementation has been greatly reduced by administrators' capitalizing on the systematic developments of existing regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers. School districts involved in <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> can benefit from the efforts of an administrative officer whose function is to systematically analyze administrative operations. This individual is referred to as a systems analyst or operations analyst. Teleprocessing has great potential for providing electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to school districts regardless of size. Teleprocessing provides school administrators with direct access to sophisticated electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> equipment and computer programs which have been successfully developed and implemented in other school districts. The Indiana Department of Education should assume the leadership in establishing regional service centers throughout Indiana to provide comprehensive educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to local school districts.
