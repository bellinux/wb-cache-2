[...] Clicking on the Contents tab opens the table of contents, in which users can click on headings to see the topics. [...] Often, headings are marked with icons that look like small books and the topics have icons that look like pages. Double-clicking on a topic (or clicking on a topic then clicking Display) opens that topic. Clicking on the <b>Index</b> <b>tab</b> opens the index, which has a typing field and an alphabetical keyword list. Typing in the typing field automatically scrolls the list of keywords to the closest match. [...] Double-clicking on a keyword (or clicking on a keyword then clicking Display) displays the topic associated with that keyword (if only one) or brings {{up a list of}} all topics associated with it. [...] The index is important in helping users locate information. [...] Sometimes Help files also have a Find tab, which lets the user search for any word used in the text of the file, not just for keywords.|$|E

25|$|The {{sections}} {{should be}} distinguished {{by means of}} <b>tab</b> <b>indexes</b> marked according to the classifications. Where detailed overhead accounts are kept for each department, it may be well to furnish additional <b>tab</b> <b>indexes</b> within this section marked with the departments of the plant so that the overhead accounts of one department may be readily distinguished from those of another. With these classification charts Nicholson & Rohrbach (1919) presented their idea's, which {{became known as the}} definition of cost centres.|$|R
50|$|The tub file was a {{technique}} {{used in the}} punched card era to speed generation of data files. Multiple copies of frequently used cards were prepunched and stored in trays with <b>index</b> <b>tabs</b> between card sets, arranged so that cards {{would be easy to}} find. For example, a wholesaler might have a tub file with cards for frequent customers and for each inventory item. Instead of keypunching a set of cards for each purchase order, a clerk would pull out a customer card and then a card for each item that customer ordered. The resulting deck could then be run through a tabulating machine to produce an invoice. This technique was an early form of random access memory and was the initial inspiration for the invention of the hard disk at IBM's San Jose Laboratory, what eventually became the IBM 305 RAMAC.|$|R
50|$|In computing, the tabbing {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} to navigate between focusable elements (such as hyperlinks and form controls) within a structured document or user interface (such as HTML) with the tab key of a computer keyboard. Usually, pressing Tab will focus on the next element, while pressing Shift + Tab will focus on the previous element. The order of focusing can be determined implicitly (based on physical order) or explicitly (based on <b>tab</b> <b>index).</b> In general, <b>tabbing</b> is cyclical, not linear, meaning that the tabbing will cycle to the first/last element when it moves away from the last/first element.|$|R
5000|$|Pentax {{has one of}} {{the widest}} range of lenses {{available}} for a medium format camera. The first generation of lenses available had a standard multi-coating and were named [...] "Super-Takumar." [...] After the release of the improved 7-layer coating, they were labeled with a [...] "Takumar Super-Multi-Coated" [...] engraving. Later lenses would abandon the Takumar branding in favor of Pentax SMC. Most of the lenses are [...] "Auto-Aperture" [...] type to allow for the brightest viewing and focusing of the lens for composition of the subject. The lens also has an aperture tab that couples to the indexed sliding ring found under the mount ring of the body. In turn the ring has a chain connected and running up into the finder bay and linked to a tab under spring tension. Operation of the aperture ring would operate the ring and feed the chain back and forth to move an <b>indexing</b> <b>tab.</b> This was only utilized by the TTL-Meter Prism and was not needed for any other finder available. The exceptions for [...] "Auto-Aperture" [...] or aperture linkage are: The 75mm Shift due to the manner that the base must slide out of direct alignment to the forward elements that the linkages for the Auto-Aperture is not possible. The 120mm Soft Focus due to its dual aperture system. The 600mm & 800mm due to their [...] "Rach and Pinion" [...] focus that {{it is not possible to}} have linkages to the Auto-Aperture. The 1000mm being a catadioptric lens that it is not possible to have an aperture.|$|R
50|$|Diagram X {{summarizes}} the information entered on {{different kinds of}} cost sheets and the method of posting and checking the data they contain, and diagram XI shows in concrete form the cost summarizing records described all of Nicholson & Rohrbach (1919). The authors noted, that the distribution record, {{may be used for}} all summary purposes. The sheets of each summary may be classified in sections in a loose-leaf binder, each section being kept separate by means of <b>tab</b> <b>indexes,</b> thus providing a means for ready reference. The folios of each section should be numbered for posting purposes.|$|R
50|$|For a Web page to be {{accessible}} all important semantics about the page's functionality must be available so that assistive technology can understand and process {{the content and}} adapt it for the user. However, as content {{becomes more and more}} complex, the standard HTML tags and attributes become inadequate in providing semantic reliably. Modern Web applications often apply scripts to elements to control their functionality and to enable them to act as a control or other dynamic component. These custom components or widgets do not provide a way to convey semantic information to the user agent.WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a specification published by the World Wide Web Consortium that specifies how to increase the accessibility of dynamic content and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript and related technologies.ARIA enables accessibility by enabling the author to provide all the semantics to fully describe its supported behaviour. It also allows each element to expose its current states and properties and its relationships between other elements. Accessibility problems with the focus and <b>tab</b> <b>index</b> are also corrected.|$|R
40|$|This {{photographic}} identification guide covers {{more than}} 530 {{species of birds}} that regularly occur in the western half of North America. It is slightly larger than most field guides, including the popular National Geographic Society 2 ̆ 7 s Field Guide to the Birds of North America, which is continental in coverage. Nonetheless, it is small and sturdy enough to conveniently carry in a jacket pocket or backpack. The field guide begins with a short section {{on how to use}} the book; the bulk of the book consists of species accounts. Each species account occurs on one page (a few species are jointly covered) and includes one to four color photographs (ranging in size from 3. 5 X 5. 0 cm to 7. 5 X 10. 0 em), a species description, a distribution map, and brief notes on feeding, nesting, behavior, habitat, vocalizations, and population trends. All birds in the pictures are oriented in the same direction to simplify comparisons. Species descriptions are brief and emphasize key features with boldface type. Symbols are provided for species that use bird feeders or nest boxes. Interspersed among the individual accounts are several 2 ̆ 2 learning pages 2 ̆ 2 for the more challenging bird groups, including hawks (in flight), shorebirds, gulls, flycatchers, warblers, and sparrows. A glossary, photograph credits, and a general index complete the book. A color <b>tab</b> <b>index</b> and an alphabetical index provide quick access to general bird groups...|$|R
