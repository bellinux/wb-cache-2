One day after his {{commitment}} with the club, on 7 August 2012, he made his debut in an 1–4 home defeat against St. Pölten, where he <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> score his first goal. Throughout the season he appeared in 33 matches ending up being the club's second league goalscorer with 10 goals.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to capture}} weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were {{conducted}} on trains carrying equipment to the front, {{as well as on}} guardhouses and gendarmerie posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> capture several German armored vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The airmen of 9./JG28 spent {{a couple}} of {{relaxing}} months in Bucharest, outside the close scrutiny of Berlin. Graf <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> play football when a Luftwaffe team played against Cyclope Bucharesti at the Bucharest Sports Arena before 30,000 spectators. During its time in Romania, the unit was witness to a major earthquake in November and an abortive civil war in January.|$|E

5|$|The Frenchmen {{were caught}} off guard and five were killed, with three seriously wounded. The mutineers managed to win over a few more tirailleurs from the 5th and 6th {{companies}} of the battalion, and <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> raise {{the flag of the}} VNQDĐ on top of one of the buildings. They managed to capture the armoury and proclaimed victory. The leaders of the uprising sent a patrol into the centre of the town to exhort the populace to join the insurrection, falsely claiming that they had already eliminated the entire French officer corps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier {{punctured}} {{after only a}} few kilometers. The rest of the cyclists quickly sped away from him, and Trousselier had to follow them alone for 200km. A few kilometers before Bordeaux, Trousselier caught up with the rest, and <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.|$|E
5|$|After the {{southern}} campaign, the Commonwealth {{had to deal}} with a threat from the north, as the armistice, ending the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629) was expiring. The majority of Polish nobles preferred to solve the problem through negotiations, unwilling to pay taxes for a new war, provided that Sweden was open to negotiations and concessions (in particular, to retreat from the occupied Polish coastal territories). Władysław himself was hoping for a war, which could yield some more significant territorial gains, and <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> gather a sizeable army, with navy elements, near the disputed territories. Sweden, weakened by involvement in the Thirty Years' War, was however open to a peaceful solution. Władysław could not go against the decision of the Sejm and Senate, and agreed to support the treaty. Thus both sides agreed to sign the Armistice of Stuhmsdorf (Sztumska Wieś) on 12 September 1635, favourable to the Commonwealth, which regained the Prussian territories, and called for a reduction of the Swedish tolls on the maritime trade.|$|E
50|$|All three {{eventually}} make it {{back home}} to their right time and place, Sulu <b>even</b> <b>managing</b> <b>to</b> leave a literal mark on history with a carved message on a durable rock.|$|R
25|$|Protests from Rutland and Herefordshire failed, {{although}} Rutland {{was able}} to secure its treatment as a single district despite not <b>even</b> <b>managing</b> <b>to</b> meet the stated minimum population of 40,000 for districts.|$|R
50|$|Following his death, Shashanka was {{succeeded by}} his son, Manava, who ruled the kingdom for eight months. However Gauda was soon divided amongst Harsha and Bhaskarvarmana of Kamroop, the latter <b>even</b> <b>managing</b> <b>to</b> conquer Karnasuvarna.|$|R
5|$|Despite her 50 guns, Centurions {{armament}} {{left her}} vulnerable as most were carronades, short-range heavy cannon that were useless {{in the face}} of the long-range gunnery from Marengo. Centurion consequently suffered severe damage and by 13:15 had been holed, with her rigging wrecked and her anchor cable shot through, which caused her to slowly drift away from the shore, out of control. Seeing that his opponent was disabled, Linois decided not to press the attack and issued orders for his squadron, accompanied by their prize, to sail away. Lind gradually regained control of his ship and <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> raise some sail in pursuit, but the French were too far ahead. After some final parting shots, Centurion anchored as her crew set about repairing the damage. Linois remained within sight for the rest of the day, but showed no sign of renewing the action; he disappeared on the north-east horizon at dusk.|$|E
25|$|Deportivo Italia <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{participate}} in the Copa Libertadores six times (1964, 1966, 1967, 1969, 1971 and 1972).|$|E
25|$|In 1692, a Venetian fleet under Domenico Mocenigo {{attacked}} Crete {{and laid}} siege to its capital Candia, {{while at the}} same time the Christians of the island rose up against the Ottomans. Despite this, the attempt to retake Crete failed. The Ottomans <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> take the Venetian fortress on the island of Gramvousa by treason.|$|E

25|$|The {{world champions}} {{went out of}} the Cup without <b>even</b> <b>managing</b> <b>to</b> score a goal and earned the {{unwanted}} record of the worst World Cup performance by a defending champion (in 1934 Uruguay refused to defend the title).|$|R
25|$|Lévesque and {{his party}} won a {{landslide}} victory at the 1976 election, with Lévesque finally re-entering the Assembly as the member for Taillon. His party assumed power with 41.1 per cent {{of the popular vote}} and 71 seats out of 110, and <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> unseat Bourassa in his own riding. Lévesque became Premier of Quebec ten days later.|$|E
25|$|After leaving WCW, Reed {{went to the}} United States Wrestling Association {{where he}} once again started feuding with {{longtime}} opponent the Junkyard Dog. Reed <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> beat JYD for the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship on October 12, 1992. Reed only held the title for a week before he lost it to Todd Champion. Reed left the promotion before 1992 ended.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to governmental investigation, {{relatives of the}} Turkish citizens killed in the raid had conducted an unceasing campaign to find Israeli officials guilty of these fatalities. Even following the Israeli official apology and Turkish agreement to refrain from legal action against Israeli officials, the families of IHH activists kept pursuing their case and <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> get {{the support of the}} government of the Comoros in referring the case to the ICC.|$|E
50|$|Later in the year, Sam Aylward {{is sent to}} lead a {{group of}} Mackenzie archers to aid the Bearkillers' raid against a Protectorate castle. They are {{successful}} and <b>even</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> force the surrender of a second castle.|$|R

25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I {{could think of}} nothing other than to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|E
25|$|Bangladeshi {{conventional}} forces attacked border outposts. Kamalpur, Belonia and the Battle of Boyra {{are a few}} examples. 90 out of 370 BOPs fell to Bengali forces. Guerrilla attacks intensified, as did Pakistani and Razakar reprisals on civilian populations. Pakistani forces were reinforced by eight battalions from West Pakistan. The Bangladeshi independence fighters <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> temporarily capture airstrips at Lalmonirhat and Shalutikar. Both of these were used for flying in supplies and arms from India. Pakistan sent another five battalions from West Pakistan as reinforcements.|$|E
25|$|In {{the valleys}} of the empire, {{irrigation}} farming was used. Dams diverted water from natural springs to the fields. This allowed for more regular harvests because {{the prosperity of}} an irrigated field was not dependent upon the rain. Irrigation systems had been in place long before the Aztecs. However, they built canal systems that were longer and more elaborate than any previous irrigation systems. They <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> divert {{a large portion of}} the Cuauhtitlan River to provide irrigation to large a areas. The network of canals was very complex and intricate.|$|E
5000|$|Of all the staff, Sue hates Caroline the most. Her initial {{approaches}} are vaguely sexual, <b>even</b> <b>managing</b> <b>to</b> kiss {{her during the}} housewarming party.

5|$|During the Gulf War of 1991, the {{air superiority}} of the {{coalition}} forces {{was so great that}} the majority of Iraqi Su-25s did not <b>even</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> get airborne. On 25 January 1991, seven Iraqi Air Force Su-25s fled from Iraq and landed in Iran.|$|R
5000|$|As {{opposed to}} the band's earlier output, guitars were absent from Echogenetic.

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1777, Philippe Charles Tronson du Coudray, a French {{artillery}} expert, arrived from France. Congress appointed him a major general and inspector general of ordnance, and Washington assigned him the task of strengthening Philadelphia's river defenses. His aristocratic airs soon irritated people. He began to quarrel with another French military engineer, Louis Lebègue Duportail, about how the defenses were to be prepared and <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> anger Gilbert Motier, marquis de La Fayette. To the relief of many, Coudray drowned on September 16 after he foolishly rode his horse onto a Schuylkill ferry and the animal leaped into the river.|$|E
25|$|In later Classical times, Sparta {{along with}} Athens, Thebes, and Persia {{had been the}} main powers {{fighting}} for supremacy against each other. As {{a result of the}} Peloponnesian War, Sparta, a traditionally continental culture, became a naval power. At the peak of its power Sparta subdued many of the key Greek states and <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> overpower the elite Athenian navy. By the end of the 5th century BC it stood out as a state which had defeated the Athenian Empire and had invaded the Persian provinces in Anatolia, a period which marks the Spartan Hegemony.|$|E

In the following two days, he repelled repeated French attacks and <b>even</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> take seven officers and 300nbsp&men as prisoner. On 16nbsp&June, he also freed a convoy of 36nbsp&Austrian officers and 500nbsp&men, when he ambushed their French captors at Kis-Szél. On 25nbsp&August 1809, {{he was awarded the}} Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E

5000|$|On his Four Season Farm in Harborside, Brooksville, Maine, he {{produces}} year-round vegetable crops, even under harsh winter conditions (for which he uses unheated and minimally heated greenhouses and polytunnels).
