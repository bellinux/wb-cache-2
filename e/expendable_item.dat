40|$|The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has {{developed}} a process by which to significantly reduce surface and near surface tritium contamination from various materials. The Oxidative Tritium Decontamination System (OTDS) reacts gaseous state ozone (accelerated by presence of catalyst), with tritium entrained/deposited {{on the surface of}} components (stainless steel, copper, plastics, ceramics, etc.), for the purpose of activity reduction by means of oxidation-reduction chemistry. In addition to removing surface and near surface tritium contamination from (high monetary value) components for reuse in non-tritium environments, the OTDS has the capability of removing tritium from the surfaces of <b>expendable</b> <b>items,</b> which can then be disposed of in a less expensive fashion. The OTDS can be operated in a batch mode by which up to approximately 40 pounds of tritium contaminated (<b>expendable)</b> <b>items</b> can be processed and decontaminated to levels permissible for free release (less than 1, 000 dpm/ 100 cm 2). This paper will discuss the OTDS process, the level of tritium surface contamination removed from various materials, and a technique for ''deep scrubbing'' tritium from subsurface layers...|$|R

50|$|Because {{they are}} {{subjected}} to constant stress cycles, up until the 1960s mainsprings generally broke from metal fatigue long before {{other parts of the}} timepiece. They were considered <b>expendable</b> <b>items.</b> This often happened {{at the end of the}} winding process, when the spring is wound as tightly as possible around the arbor, with no space between the coils. When manually winding, it is easy to reach this point unexpectedly and put excessive pressure on the spring. Another cause was temperature changes. If a watch was fully wound in the evening and the temperature dropped at night, without any slack between the coils the thermal contraction of the long spring could break it loose from its attachments at one end. In earlier times, watch repairers noted that changes in the weather brought in a rash of watches with broken mainsprings. Broken mainsprings were the largest cause of watch repairs until the 1960s. Since then, the improvements in spring metallurgy mentioned above have made broken mainsprings rare.|$|R

40|$|U. S. {{agricultural}} input suppliers face unique marketing challenges. Far many suppliers, large commercial farm enterprises have replaced traditional smaller farms {{as their primary}} customers and represent {{the majority of their}} sales revenues. The resultant marketing challenges can be overcome through the development of a strong brand or preference for sale locations (dealers). The problem is thus to understand the determinants of brand loyalty, the role of dealer loyalty, and to identify effective strategies for reaching loyal customers. This research assists agribusiness managers in addressing these important issues. ^ Data were obtained from the 2003 Commercial Producer Survey conducted by the Center for Food and Agricultural Business (CAB) at Purdue University. Over 2, 100 surveys were obtained from the questionnaire, which was delivered by mail or e-mail to, or conducted over the phone with, 14, 301 mid-size and commercial producers across the U. S. The survey collected information on producers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and preferences for branded expendable and capital input products. Information was also compiled on respondents 2 ̆ 7 loyalty to dealers and farm and farmer characteristics. The data were primarily analyzed with logit regression techniques. ^ Empirical evidence suggests that dealer, loyalty is an important predictor of brand loyalty for capital inputs. Results also imply that factors that directly impact dealer loyalty may indirectly impact brand loyalty. This is consistent with results found in the literature for the automobile market, which is similar to that for capital {{agricultural input}}s {{because of the presence of}} an established dealer system. ^ For both capital and <b>expendable</b> <b>items,</b> activities that associate the supplier with the brand are helpful for capturing dual loyalty, that is loyalty to the brand as well as to the dealer. Also, because dealer loyalty is found to be a determinant of brand loyalty, any positive changes made by dealers can ultimately impact brand loyalty. Strategies for loyalty should focus less on price and more on the value that can be obtained through product quality, service, and providing relevant information. ^ Demographics are less important for determining loyalty. Marketers should first assess what other factors are important to loyalty and subsequently determine if there is a link with demographics. ...|$|R

The main objectives of this research were to: (i) describe the production, social and economic factors that determine agricultural market structure in Argentina and the U. S.; (ii) compare and contrast the U. S. and Argentine producers to better understand behaviors and preferences for inputs, and (iii) to segment producers of each country, using cluster analysis, according to their buying behaviors for financial services, capital and expendable goods. ^ Data for the analyses come from the 2008 Large Commercial Producer Survey conducted by the Center of Food and Agribusiness at Purdue University, and a similar survey carried out by the Center for Food and Agribusiness at Austral University in Rosario, Argentina. A total of 561 U. S. and 506 producers observations were compared and contrasted. Cross tabulations and Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s Chi Square tests were carried-out to identify statistically significant differences across respondents within the country. T-tests analysis was done to identify differences across-countries. ^ Results showed that Argentines buying behaviors differ from U. S. producers in ways that reflect the uncertainties regarding the socioeconomic policies and the weak financing system in Argentina. The dynamic U. S. market place with strong government support and financial credit systems have contributed to producers financial stability and escalating demands for price, performance and service from their suppliers. Comparative results between countries proved differences between Argentine and U. S. producers regarding their future farm operating plans; Argentines are more likely to outsource services and knowledge than U. S. farmers. The one exception is the hiring of fertilizer services by U. S. farmers. Moreover, most of the respondents in both countries were the primary decision-makers with similar average educational levels. ^ The Argentine respondents showed higher loyalty to both product brands and local dealers than their U. S. counterparts. In addition, Argentines were willing to pay higher prices for better product performance than US producers. The latter looked for better prices of <b>expendable</b> <b>items</b> and would increase the use of generic products. U.

The Air Force currently spends about one-third of its annual budget on purchased goods and services. This offers the Air Force a large target in which to seek cost savings. Commercial firms have moved toward a commodity-council approach for purchasing in recent years, and the cost reductions realized have been impressive. Findings have shown that the increased leverage from commodity councils will optimize buying power for the Air Force, reduce duplication of effort, improve customer support, and minimize supply-chain costs through integration and collaboration. ?Commodity Council? is a term used to describe a cross-functional sourcing team designed to create a centralized purchasing strategy and establish centralized contracts for enterprise-wide requirements. The commodity council drives commonality and standardization and ensures the leveraging of purchasing volume. The key to this approach is to rely on market experts in the specific commodity category to make well informed, market-savvy decisions that fully meet all enterprise-wide requirements for a commodity. A ?commodity? is simply defined as a segmentable category of goods and/or services. Note, this definition does not imply an <b>expendable</b> or non-complex <b>item</b> (Hansen 1).

50|$|Perhaps Lee's {{greatest}} individual {{impact on}} modern small arms development came with his invention for a spring-loaded column-feed magazine system for centerfire cartridge rifles. The main {{advance of the}} Lee magazine was that it carried its cartridges in two columns, rather than the single column which {{was typical of the}} time. This allowed twice the ammunition to be carried without making the magazine any deeper. When fitted with a charger bridge, the Lee magazine could be quickly reloaded with either single cartridges, like a tubular-feed magazine (which was in vogue for military rifles in certain nations of that era), or with a charger (aka stripper clip) holding five rounds. These charger clips were similar to the Lee or Mannlicher en bloc clip systems, except that the rounds were stripped off of the charger into the magazine, rather than the whole unit of clip and cartridges being placed into the weapon, {{as was the case with}} en bloc clips. This was desirable, because the main drawbacks of the en bloc clip are that the weapon cannot be loaded without a clip, it cannot be used as a single-shot weapon, and you cannot top-off a partially full magazine; all shots must be fired before a new clip can be loaded (which is inconvenient when a soldier finds himself between actions with only one or two shots left and no way to reload). The charger system avoided all this, allowing ammunition to be carried in units of five and rapidly loaded like an en bloc clip, but also allowing it to be easily used without the clips (albeit with somewhat slower loading). Although the charger clip was invented in by Paul Mauser in 1889, for the Mauser M1889, it was quickly adapted to the new Lee-Metford, the first rifle using Lee's action and magazine design (the second being the famed Lee-Enfield). The Lee magazine was perfectly compatible with the charger device, unlike tube-magazine guns, and had other advantages over the Mauser-style, five-shot, single column magazine. The Lee magazine differed in holding the ammunition in two vertical columns, rather than a single stack, allowing for ten rounds to be carried in a magazine that was no deeper than that of the M1889 (although later Mauser rifles, such as the Gewehr 1898 were influenced by the Lee magazine; they retained the five-shot capacity and remained non-detachable, but they adopted double-columns, allowing the entire magazine to fit within the stock, rather than protruding below in front of the trigger guard, like in the M1889, Mosin-Nagant, Carcano, Mannlicher or other designs of that era). Having a magazine holding ten rounds which is loaded via five-round charger clips also allows the soldier to reload the magazine every time he fires 5 shots, just like he would with a five-round magazine, only with a five-round reserve at all times. With a five shot magazine, you have to wait until the gun is empty before reloading with another charger; in an Enfield, the only time you need to completely empty the magazine is in cases of emergency. The rest of the time you can use it as a five-shot rifle with a five-round reserve. This is one reason why the UK never adopted 10 round chargers to go with the 10 round magazines. Another benefit of the detachable magazine was that with the magazine detached, the rifle became a single-shot weapon, a feature seen as desirable by some countries for training purposes or for maintaining control over sometimes unreliable colonial or indigenous troops, many of which were hardly familiar with breech-loaders at all, let alone repeating firearms. It also allowed the rifle to be used as a single shot weapon during long range volley fire, with the full magazine set aside for when the enemy closed and rapid fire was needed (the later magazine cutoff device was intended for a similar purpose). The Lee magazine was also adaptable to a variety of cartridges and bolt systems regardless of bullet shape or cartridge length, whereas a non-detachable magazine (such as used on the Mauser Gewehr 98) had to be designed and fitted integrally with the rest of the gun; in order to deepen the magazine of a Mauser, one would have to redesign the entire action, as the magazine is machined integrally with the receiver; the capacity of a tube magazine is constrained by the length of the weapon. Because the cartridges were stored in a double column and the magazine wasn't integral to the rifle, the Lee magazine could be easily deepened to store additional cartridges in keeping with evolving small arms doctrine. Although no Lee rifle ever carried more than ten rounds, the design served as the basis for what later became the universal standard for military rifles, the detachable, sheet-metal box magazine. In combat, the detachable magazine theoretically allowed a soldier to carry loaded magazines, thus speeding reloading time, although this was never practiced until much later on. At the time Lee's magazine was introduced, rifle magazines were expensive to fabricate and could not be regarded as <b>expendable</b> <b>items.</b> Lee's idea of carrying additional loaded magazines was not seen as an advantage by most major military forces at the time, who preferred to issue the soldier with loose cartridges or charger clips; loading by inserting a full new magazine did little to speed up the loading process over a stripper clip, and added a great deal of cost (one or two stripper clips can be made at a fraction of the price), and a metal magazine also weighs a great deal more, adding to a soldier's ammunition load. With the exception of handguns, it wasn't until rifles with magazine capacities of 20 rounds or greater were invented that detachable magazines were regularly used to carry ammunition in (although many pistols and most submachine guns adopted detachable magazines at a very early date). While the costs of carrying full magazines were not thought to outweigh the benefits in a rifle with a 5 or 10-round magazine, the time it took to load a 20 round magazine with stripper clips was considered excessive, and militaries switched to rifles with double-column, detachable magazines in the Lee style. Although video games and movies regularly, and incorrectly, depict soldiers armed with Lee-Enfield rifles loading by inserting a new magazine; in reality, the Lee-Enfield rifle was always loaded by stripping two 5-round charger clips into the magazine, both in WW1 and WW2. The only exception was that soldiers were sometimes equipped with a single spare magazine, as it was feared that the primary magazine might be accidentally detached and lost, something that wasn't a risk on weapons without detachable magazines. Lee's detachable column-feed magazine system eventually became the pre-eminent design after WW2, and served as the basis for the box magazines used in all modern military small arms.|$|R
