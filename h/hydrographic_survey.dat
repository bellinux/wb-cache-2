The ship sailed up {{the west coast of}} the main island of the Spitsbergen group, and visited Adventfjorden and Smeerenburg in the north.

5|$|From 1851 to 1854 Henry Denham {{captain of}} HMS Herald, {{which was on}} a {{scientific}} expedition to the southwest Pacific (1852–1856), completed the island's first <b>hydrographic</b> <b>survey.</b> On board were three Scottish biologists, William Milne (a gardener-botanist from the Edinburgh Botanic Garden), John Macgillivray (naturalist) who collected fish and plant specimens, and Assistant Surgeon and zoologist Denis Macdonald. Together these men established much basic information on the geology, flora and fauna of the island.|$|E

This paper reviews what is involved with MSR, <b>hydrographic</b> <b>surveys</b> and military surveys before reaching the conclusion that trends in recent decades with technology, the utility of hydrographic data and State practice require that <b>hydrographic</b> <b>surveys</b> in the EEZ should be {{under the jurisdiction of the}} coastal State. Paradoxically the arguments for military surveys in the EEZ being outside the jurisdiction of the coastal State appear stronger than those applying to <b>hydrographic</b> <b>surveying.</b> The paper offers some guidelines related to the conduct of MSR and <b>hydrographic</b> <b>surveying</b> in the EEZ but is not able to do so with regard to military surveys.

5|$|As {{a student}} at the University of Edinburgh in 1827, Darwin learnt about marine {{invertebrates}} while assisting the investigations of the anatomist Robert Edmond Grant, and during his last year at the University of Cambridge in 1831, he had studied geology under Adam Sedgwick. So when he was unexpectedly offered a place on the Beagle expedition, as a gentleman naturalist he was well suited to FitzRoy's aim of having a companion able to examine geology on land while the ship's complement carried out its <b>hydrographic</b> <b>survey.</b> FitzRoy gave Darwin the first volume of Lyell's Principles of Geology before they left. On their first stop ashore at St Jago island in January 1832, Darwin saw geological formations which he explained using Lyell's uniformitarian concept that forces still in operation made land slowly rise or fall over immense periods of time, and thought that he could write his own book on geology. Lyell's first volume included a brief outline of the idea that atolls were based on volcanic craters, and the second volume, which was sent to Darwin during the voyage, gave more detail. Darwin received it in November 1832.|$|E

40|$|The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) {{has issued}} {{standards}} {{that provide the}} minimum requirements for different types of <b>hydrographic</b> <b>surveys</b> execution to collect data {{to be used to}} compile navigational charts. Such standards are usually updated {{from time to time to}} reflect new survey techniques and practices and must be achieved to assure both surface navigation safety and marine environment protection. <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>surveys</b> can be classified to four orders namely, special order, order 1 a, order 1 b, and order 2. The order of <b>hydrographic</b> <b>surveys</b> to use should be determined in accordance with the importance to the safety of navigation in the surveyed area. Typically, geodetic-grade dual-frequency GPS receivers are utilized for position determination during data collection in <b>hydrographic</b> <b>surveys.</b> However, with the evolution of high-sensitivity low-cost single-frequency receivers, it is very important to evaluate the performance of such receivers. This paper investigates the performance of low-cost single-frequency GPS receivers in <b>hydrographic</b> <b>surveying</b> applications. The main objective is to examine whether low-cost single-frequency receivers fulfil the IHO standards for <b>hydrographic</b> <b>surveys.</b> It is shown that the low-cost single-frequency receivers meet the IHO horizontal accuracy for all <b>hydrographic</b> <b>surveys</b> orders at any depth. However, the single-frequency receivers meet only order 2 requirements for vertical accuracy at depth more than or equal 100  m...|$|R
