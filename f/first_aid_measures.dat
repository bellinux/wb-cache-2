40|$|SummaryPurposeDespite recent {{advances}} {{in the management of}} epilepsy the efforts to assess knowledge, attitude and practice towards epilepsy are limited, particularly in the developing countries. To delineate the magnitude and scope of this problem, present study was conducted to assess the knowledge attitude and practice about epilepsy amongst schoolteachers in Northeast Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India. The basis of involving schoolteachers was their special role in Indian society with their larger interaction among the segment of population most affected by epilepsy. MethodsSimple self-administered questionnaires were sent to the schoolteachers of primary and secondary levels. The questionnaires contained 15 questions related to awareness and attitudes towards epilepsy with details of <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> management of seizures. ResultsWe found that 97 % of schoolteachers were aware of epilepsy with majority including it as a brain disease. A substantial proportion (38. 2 %) was uncertain about relation of epilepsy and insanity and 31. 7 % felt epileptics to be of below average intelligence. Only about half of them (55. 3 %) preferred their children to play with an epileptic. An overwhelming no was obvious about marriage with an epileptic (86. 8 %). Only 27. 8 % of the respondents had given any <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>measure</b> to a seizing patient with only 16. 3 % giving it properly. ConclusionDespite a great degree of awareness about epilepsy amongst schoolteachers in India negative and wrong attitudes still exist. Stress on proper <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>measure</b> to a seizing child needs greater emphasis to remove fright and fear amongst the public. Besides adequate management, public education to address existing biases and fear are equally important {{to improve the quality of}} life of epileptics...|$|R

The 2005 drowning rescue guidelines of the American Heart Association did not include citations of Heimlich's work, and warned against the use of the Heimlich maneuver for drowning rescue as unproven and dangerous, due to its risk of vomiting leading to aspiration.|$|R

40|$|Snake bite is an {{important}} medical problem {{in some areas of}} Papua New Guinea and appears to be most common in the Central Province and National Capital District. The overall incidence for Central Province is 215. 5 per 100, 000 population, but Kairuku subprovince has an incidence of 526 per 100, 000, which is amongst the highest in the world. The clinical pattern of envenoming also varies within the Province, suggesting that different species of snake may be responsible for bites in different areas. Most envenomed patients are bitten during daylight on the lower limb and are rarely able to describe the snake. The mortality rate in Central Province is 7. 9 per 100, 000; most patients die from ventilatory failure due to severe neurotoxicity.

40|$|Introduction: Irukandji syndrome, a {{potentially}} life-threatening condition {{that follows the}} sting of small carybdeid jellyfish, occurs along the northern Australian coastline from Broome, Western Australia {{in the west to}} Rockhampton, Queensland in the east. Much of this area is classified rural or remote. Because correct patient management is essential to avoid unnecessary fatality, and stings are relatively uncommon in any specific location, it was considered important to document current approaches to Irukandji syndrome management throughout coastal northern Australia, comparing urban and more rural health facilities, and to assess the availability of management guidelines for health staff. Methods: A telephone survey of the clinicians responsible for Irukandji syndrome patient management at 34 coastal northern Australian health facilities that might encounter this patient presentation was conducted during November and December 2003. Healthcare providers responsible for Irukandji syndrome management on the day of survey were interviewed using a structured, standardized questionnaire, which included a description of a hypothetical patient with Irukandji syndrome. This was used to stimulate a spontaneous description of the usual response of the particular health facility to such a patient presentation. Additional vignettes were used to investigate further specific aspects of patient management, including <b>first</b> <b>aid,</b> and pain and blood pressure management. Respondents were also asked about the existence of Irukandji treatment guidelines at their facility. Results: All 34 facilities contacted agreed to participate. Five health facilities were in urban centres with a population of 50 000 or greater, four were within 50 km of such centres, 20 were more remote and five facilities were on islands. Basic clinical monitoring (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) was generally adequately practised.

40|$|Background: The {{attitudes toward}} people with {{epilepsy}} {{are influenced by}} the degree of knowledge of the condition. The social problems encountered by school children with epilepsy as a result of negative attitude and beliefs are quite enormous. Objectives The study therefore looked at the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of teachers, who see a lot of epileptics, relate to them on a daily basis and have influence on them. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey, using a self-administered questionnaire obtained from the author of a similar study in the United States, was carried out among 269 school teachers randomly selected from various secondary schools in Osogbo, the Osun State capital in South-West Nigeria. The questionnaire included the scale of attitudes toward persons with epilepsy and knowledge about epilepsy as well as demographic and teaching experience survey among others. Results Despite the high level of education of the teachers ranging from Masters Degree to National Certificate in Education, there were significant deficits in terms of general knowledge about epilepsy (70 % of the respondents reported their general knowledge about epilepsy in {{the lower half of the}} scale). There was also poor knowledge of the <b>first</b> <b>aids</b> <b>measures</b> in the classrooms. Below one-third (29. 2 %) felt it was contagious and 40 % of respondents reported that sufferers should not be kept in regular classes. However, their attitudes toward epilepsy were generally positive. Conclusions and Recommendations: We concluded that teachers need to have health education courses on common disease conditions such as epilepsy that are prevalent in school age; this might help to reduce the prejudice and increase the acceptance of epileptic individuals in the classrooms. Also, generally public health campaigns should be encouraged in this field...|$|R

50|$|In October 2008 an inquest {{into the}} deaths of Wright and other {{personnel}} involved in the incident heard further details of the circumstances. A platoon commander had heard from American private security contractors that there were mines in the area, and passed that information on; however, the map used by the troops still showed it as being clear of hazards. The first soldier to trigger a mine was Corporal Stuart Hale. This was reported to (then) Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Tootal, commanding officer of 3 PARA at the time (since promoted to colonel). He requested a Blackhawk helicopter from the joint helicopter base in Kandahar, officers there were reluctant to send a helicopter {{because of the risk}} of further mines being present. When bomb-disposal officers told Tootal that it could take 12 hours to clear the mines, he decided to send a British Chinook to attempt a rescue. This helicopter was not equipped with a winch, so would have to touch down at least its two back wheels to pick the men up. Sergeant Stuart Pearson attempted to clear sufficient area for the helicopter to touchdown, but as he rejoined the rest of the platoon, he triggered a further mine, causing further casualties. The helicopter then arrived and touched down successfully, but the soldiers were now unwilling to risk further detonations, and refused to move toward it. As the helicopter took off again, Wright triggered a further mine, possibly because he, or some equipment, was moved by the downdraft or other effect of the helicopter. Three soldiers had lost legs, and four had other serious injuries. Wright, himself wounded in the arm, neck and chest crawled across the minefield to administer morphine and other <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>measures</b> to his comrades. Two Blackhawk helicopters finally arrived to extract the men, and Wright died in one of these en route to Camp Bastion. Tootal believes that the additional casualties could have been avoided if a Blackhawk had been despatched in the first instance.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{the level of}} lay knowledge of <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>measures</b> for epistaxis, and to determine the effectiveness of an ENT department policy of providing an advice sheet of <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>measures.</b> METHODS [...] 50 patients presenting with epistaxis were questioned on the accuracy and level of {{their knowledge of the}} four basic procedures used to combat a nose-bleed. The results were correlated with the source of referral, previous treatment, and advice. RESULTS [...] A large proportion of patients who had previously been treated for epistaxis by their general practitioners and other non-ENT trained medical or nursing staff were unable to recall being given any first aid advice. For those who remembered being given advice, very few described all the steps correctly. In contrast, patients who had previously been seen by the ENT staff scored full points in every aspect.
