40|$|Abstract. During {{its more}} than ten-year active life, {{numerous}} tests have been performed at LITHOS Laboratory for determining various physical mechanical properties on a significant variety of ornamental stones from Greece and abroad, {{in compliance with the}} applicable EN Standards. Given the somewhat evident similarity observed for the breaking mechanism on specimens during determination of the breaking load at <b>dowel</b> <b>hole</b> (EN 13364) and that of flexural strength under concentrated load (EN 12372), an attempt has been made to correlate the relevant results. The objective was to investigate the possibility of creating a potential practical tool for a first estimation of the breaking load at <b>dowel</b> <b>hole,</b> having performed only the much simpler flexural strength determination test. After the appropriate statics approach that has been developed for each test to simulate the relative breaking mechanisms followed by the specimens and the analysis of all the data available, it has been revealed that a linear relationship combining the breaking moments exerted on the specimens in both the aforementioned tests may be established. Taking into account the wide range and diversity of the types of ornamental stones employed, the correlation coefficient calculated for the linear equation describing this relationship is considered sufficient for serving the objective set for this experimental research work...|$|E

50|$|In a paper {{presented}} at the 2006 convention of the Historians of Netherlandish Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art conservator Mark S. Tucker observed that the wooden panels were unusually thin. Across the back of each, he found a horizontal line of <b>dowel</b> <b>holes</b> near the base, which strongly indicated a now-missing structural member. He compared this with similar joinery on the shutters of altarpieces, and theorized that the diptych represented two panels of a four-panel work - either the two-panelled left shutter of an altarpiece, or its center two panels. Based on pictorial style, Tucker argued that the large size of the human figures relative {{to the size of the}} panels was more in keeping with figures on the shutters of carved altarpieces than painted ones. He also noted that the shutters of carved altarpieces tend to de-emphasize the deep perspective commonly seen in painted altarpieces, which was consistent with the shallow pictorial space of the diptych.|$|R

H: 0. 46 m; D: 0. 11 mDescription: The site {{is located}} 6 km {{southeast}} of Aphrodisias at Kocadere atop a fairly level natural terrace, approximately 60 m square, above the left (west) {{bank of the}} seasonal Kocadere stream {{at the base of}} steep hills. A shallow mound, oriented eastâ€“west and almost rectangular, occupies the center of the site, and at the east end of the terrace (approximately 20 m from the mound) are traces of a fragmentary northâ€“south-oriented wall. Toward the south end of this wall, corresponding to the southeast corner of the walled-off complex, is a robber's pit, and scattered around it are cut-stone blocks, roof tiles, fragments of marble pavement, and a threshold block. The complex thus seems to comprise a walled precinct with a substantial building at the center and a number of subsidiary buildings roundabout. A dense layer of tile, brick, pithos, and pottery fragments blankets the site, and a number of agricultural processing blocks (D 173) may be associated with the production of olive oil. Pottery collected at the site dates the complex securely to the Late Roman period and shows that primary occupation ended by the seventh to eighth century but continued in some fashion into the Middle Byzantine period. ** An ambo platform confirms the presence of a church at the site; it and a fragment of a marble basin were found on the terrace south of the mound. The basin, broken on all sides except for the bottom, stood on a molded base. The ambo platform is a round slab, with two rectangular projections on opposite sides (W: 0. 74 m). The edges of the round central part are beveled, and the ends of the projections are unfinished or possibly broken. In each of the three preserved corners is a <b>dowel</b> <b>hole,</b> perhaps used to attach the platform to supporting colonettes or to the descending stairs. On the underside is a round recessed soffit, within which is carved a cross with enlarged termini in low relief (L: 0. 45 m; W: 0. 40 m). The arms of the cross are aligned with projections {{on the sides of the}} block. ** The church may be identified with the low mound at the center of the site, although no evidence of an apse is visible at the eastern end, which is buried under debris and scrub oak. No other contemporary settlements are nearby, but an earlier one is located farther up the hill toward the northwest; surface finds there indicate this other site was occupied only in the Early Imperial period. While the full extent of the Kocadere complex is unclear, its isolated location in the hilly countryside and organization around a central building are suggestive of a monastic settlement.

The outer walls (e-w 11. 55 m; n-s 8. 45 m) are preserved in up to four courses of large petit apareil masonry, with the largest stones in the lower courses (H: 0. 26 - 0. 32 m, W: 0. 56 - 0. 06 m, D: 0. 38 - 0. 45 m). The eastern end preserves elements of a tetrastyle faÃ§ade including: euthenteria blocks (H: 0. 30 m, L: 0. 43 - 0. 70 m, D: 0. 51 m) and stylobate blocks (H: 0. 24 m), atop which are the two central pedestals (top 0. 60 m square; shaft: 0. 55 m square) with a further step (H: 0. 24 m, D: 0. 30 m) between them. Architectural blocks atop {{the eastern end of}} the tomb include a smoothly finished Attic Ionic column base (diam. : 0. 525 m) that would fit atop the pedestals, and an architrave (L: 2. 40 m) the same length as the intercolumniation between the two pedestals. In the field boundaries nearby to the southeast are further blocks that could pertain to the structure including a monumental crowning molded block, a second architrave, a doorjamb, a fluted double capital, wall blocks with dowel holes and swallow-tail clamp cuttings, and fragments of monolithic columns. The one accessible vaulted underground chamber (n-s 6. 95 m, e-w 1. 89 m) is well preserved to the south and partially collapsed to the north, and cleared to within 2. 60 m of the vault. It is the antechamber to the primary burial chamber, and was accessed by a doorway (W: 0. 76 m) through {{the south end of the}} west wall. The main tomb chamber was reached through a central doorway (W: 0. 76 m) also in the west wall (Th: 0. 80 m); both openings have flat lintels. The regularly coursed petit appareil blocks are heavily mortared, and the mortar beds are occasionally scored. The lower half of the vault appears to be built from corbelled petit appareil blocks, while the upper half is a mass of heavily mortared rubble and radially placed flat stones. Three evenly spaced windows pierce the east wall of the antechamber. The openings (H: 0. 45 - 0. 54, W: 0. 38 - 0. 43 m, D: 1. 13 m) extend from the intrados of the vault up through a slit in the center of the rising face of the stair blocks in the east faÃ§ade. Also on the eastern wall are four small niches in the spaces between and below the widows; they are similar to put log holes, except that there are no corresponding holes in the western wall.

5000|$|Reamed {{holes are}} used to create holes of precise {{circularity}} and size, for example with tolerances of -0/+0.02 mm(.0008") This will allow the force fitting of locating dowel pins, which need not be otherwise retained in the body holding them.

This type of alignment is common in the joining of split crankcase halves such as are used in motorcycle motors and boxer type engines.
