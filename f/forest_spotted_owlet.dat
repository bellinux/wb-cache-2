50|$|Here, a high {{diversity}} of species of forest birds {{is the main}} attraction for ecotourism. About 155 species of birds are found including common grey hornbill, grey-fronted green pigeon, yellow backed sunbird, Malabar trogon, jungle babbler, <b>forest</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>owlet,</b> shama, great Indian black woodpecker, are found. Apart from this, {{there are a variety}} of insects, centipedes, millipedes and snails. There are about 121 species of spider including the largest species in Gujarat the giant wood spider.|$|E
50|$|Literature on {{historical}} records of birdlife {{of the region}} is very scanty. Forsyth's (1889) casual remarks indicated that several species like black-headed yellow bulbul (Pycnonotus melanicterus), painted spurfowl (Galloperdix lunulata), lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), and Indian golden-backed three-toed woodpecker (Dinopium javanense) which are now found only in small restricted areas were apparently quite common and widespread around late 19th century. The recent rediscovery of the <b>forest</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>owlet</b> (Heteroglaux blewitti), endemic to Central Indian Highlands after about 114 years (Rasmussen 1998), underscores the significance of more avifaunal studies in the region for conservation planning. The forests of central India are {{also one of the}} few known refuges for several globally threatened and restricted-range species like Malabar pied hornbill (Anthracoceros coronatus), spotted grey creeper (Salpornis spilonotus), white-bellied minivet (Pericrocotus erythropygius), Asian brown flycatcher (Muscicapa dauurica) and green munia (Amandava formosa) (Ali & Ripley, 1983). A recent survey on breeding birds of Central Indian Highlands by Wildlife Institute of India (Jayapal et al., 2005) has added several new breeding records and range-extensions like crested goshawk (Accipiter trivirgatus), Oriental scops owl (Otus sunia), spot-bellied eagle owl (Bubo nipalensis), drongo-cuckoo (Surniculus lugubris), ashy drongo (Dicrurus leucophaeus), and striated grassbird (Megalurus palustris).|$|E

40|$|To date, {{knowledge}} of {{persistent organic pollutant}} (POP) mediated oxidative stress responses in avian species is rather limited. We therefore investigated whether exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in two predatory bird species, namely black kite (Milvus migrans) and <b>spotted</b> <b>owlet</b> (Athene brama), was associated to activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR) and catalase (CAT), or expression of GPx and superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes. As part of this investigation, we evaluated whether feathers were suitable to reflect internal body burdens and their associated oxidative stress effects. p,p'-DDE was unanimously recorded with highest concentrations in feathers and blood of both species. In general, the non-significant associations reflect that feathers are not always a suitable indicator for internal body burdens of POPs, depending on the feather type {{and the age of}} the bird. The activity of GST and GR was significantly higher in <b>spotted</b> <b>owlet</b> whereas GPx and CAT was higher (albeit not significant) in <b>spotted</b> <b>owlet</b> and black kite respectively. In comparison, mRNA expression of GPx, SOD and Cu,ZnSOD was significantly higher in black kite. Regression analysis showed that the activity of GST and GR was significantly associated with p,p'-DDE in blood of <b>spotted</b> <b>owlet.</b> Similarly, activity of CAT and GR was significantly correlated with BDE- 100 in feathers of <b>spotted</b> <b>owlet.</b> In comparison, mRNA expression of SOD was found significantly associated with Sigma PBDEs in blood of <b>spotted</b> <b>owlet</b> as well as p,p'-DDE in feathers of black kite. Significant associations of various POPs with biological responses may suggest that POP exposure may be contributing to oxidative stress in the studied bird of prey species. This first investigation indicates the necessity for further research on cause-effect relationships between POP exposures and changes in general health of free ranging birds...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owlet</b> Athene brama is the commonest {{among the}} 62 species of owls of India {{and also a}} widely {{distributed}} bio-control agent of agricultural pests in India. We studied the roost site selection and diet composition of the Southern <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owlet</b> A. b. brama in the Cauvery Delta in southern India during 2007 - 08. The roost selection evaluated based on roost site characteristics observed from 22 roost sites revealed that the owlets preferred to roost closer to human habitation than in agricultural fields, with all the roosts found among trees. Albizia saman (Rain Tree) was {{the most commonly used}} roost tree species. Tree species with 20 - 30 m height and 1 - 3 m gbh were most preferred for roosting due to the presence of a greater number of branches. Roost species and size class selection appeared to depend on availability of suitable locations with better protection from weather and concealment to avoid disturbance from humans and other birds. Diet composition examined through analysis of 55 regurgitated pellets revealed that undigested food items from insects constituted the bulk of the owls diet (57 %) followed by mammals (rodents) (24. 4 %), reptiles (7. 8 %) and birds (7. 3 %). However, it is argued that mammals in the form of digestible parts could have contributed more to the diet of the owlet than any other taxa. Higher consumption of rodents and insects is discussed in the light of reducing agricultural pests; adequate roosting sites (mature trees) and creating awareness among the local community about the role of <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owlets</b> will improve their population and help control agricultural pests more effectively...|$|R

40|$|Biometric {{analysis}} {{helps in}} sex differentiation, understanding development and for studies of avian biology such as foraging ecology, evolutionary ecology, and survivorship. We suggest that biometry {{can also be}} a reliable, practical and inexpensive tool to determine the age of nestlings in the field by non-invasive methods. As an example we studied the biometry of wing, culmen, talon, tarsus and body mass of nestling southern Indian <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owlets</b> (Athene brama brama). Based on the growth pattern analysis using logistic growth model, discriminant analysis and CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) based decision tree, we show that biometry of nestling <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owlets</b> is an easy, reliable and inexpensive method to determine nestling age and to assess growth rate and relative nutritional status. These biometric parameters also allow us to predict their ability to initiate first flight from the nest site. This method is described {{here for the first time}} and we postulate that such charts can be devised for other avian species as well, so as to assist conservation biologists and bird rescuers...|$|R
40|$|The {{study on}} food {{habits of the}} <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owlet,</b> Athene brama (Temminck, 1821) in Tropical Forest Research Institute campus, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India was {{conducted}} in June 2011 to May 2012 by analyzing their regurgitated pellets.
