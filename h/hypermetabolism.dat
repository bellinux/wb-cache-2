5000|$|The {{condition}} usually {{results from}} infection, injury (accident, surgery), hypoperfusion and <b>hypermetabolism.</b> The primary cause triggers an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Sepsis {{is the most}} common cause. Sepsis may result in septic shock. In the absence of infection, a sepsis-like disorder is termed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Both SIRS and sepsis could ultimately progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. However, in one-third of the patients no primary focus can be found. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is well established as the final stage of a continuum: SIRS + infection [...] sepsis [...] severe sepsis [...] Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Currently, investigators are looking into genetic targets for possible gene therapy to prevent the progression to Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Some authors have conjectured that the inactivation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 would be appropriate targets in preventing sepsis and SIRS. These two genes are pro-inflammatory. However, they are essential components of a normal healthy immune response, so there is risk of increasing vulnerability to infection, which can also cause clinical deterioration.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{hippocampus}} in schizophrenia {{is characterized}} by both <b>hypermetabolism</b> and reduced size. It remains unknown whether these abnormalities are mechanistically linked. Here we addressed this question by using MRI tools that can map hippocampal metabolism and structure in patients and mouse models. In at-risk patients, <b>hypermetabolism</b> was found to begin in CA 1 and spread to the subiculum after psychosis onset. CA 1 <b>hypermetabolism</b> at baseline predicted hippocampal atrophy, which occurred during progression to psychosis, most prominently in similar regions. Next, we used ketamine to model conditions of acute psychosis in mice. Acute ketamine reproduced a similar regional pattern of <b>hypermetabolism,</b> while repeated exposure shifted the hippocampus to a hypermetabolic basal state with concurrent atrophy and pathology in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Parallel in vivo experiments using the glutamate-reducing drug LY 379268 and direct measurements of extracellular glutamate showed that glutamate drives both neuroimaging abnormalities. These findings show that hippocampal <b>hypermetabolism</b> leads to atrophy in psychotic disorder and suggest glutamate as a pathogenic driver. Video Abstrac...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a rapidly}} progressive {{disease of the}} nervous system involving both upper and lower motor neurons. The patterns of structural and metabolic brain alterations are still unclear. Several studies using anatomical MRI yielded a number of discrepancies in their results, and a few PET studies investigated the effect of ALS on cerebral glucose metabolism. The aim of this study was threefold: to highlight the patterns of grey matter (GM) atrophy, hypometabolism and <b>hypermetabolism</b> in patients with ALS, then to understand the neurobehavioral significance of <b>hypermetabolism</b> and, finally, to investigate the regional differences between the morphologic and functional changes in ALS patients, using a specially designed voxel-based method. Thirty-seven patients with ALS and 37 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals underwent both structural MRI and 18 [F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET examinations. PET data were corrected for partial volume effects. Structural and metabolic abnormalities were examined in ALS patients compared with control subjects using two-sample t tests in statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Then, we extracted the metabolic values of clusters presenting <b>hypermetabolism</b> to correlate with selected cognitive scores. Finally, GM atrophy and hypometabolism patterns were directly compared with a one-paired t test in SPM. RESULTS:We found GM atrophy as well as hypometabolism in motor and extra motor regions and <b>hypermetabolism</b> in medial temporal lobe and cerebellum. We observed negative correlations between the metabolism of the right and left parahippocampal gyri and episodic memory and between the metabolism of right temporal pole and cognitive theory of mind. GM atrophy predominated in the temporal pole, left hippocampus and right thalamus, while hypometabolism predominated in a single cluster in the left frontal superior medial cortex. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings provide direct evidence of regional variations in the hierarchy and relationships between GM atrophy and hypometabolism in ALS. Moreover, the 18 FDG-PET investigation suggests that cerebral <b>hypermetabolism</b> is deleterious to cognitive function in ALS...|$|E
40|$|IMPORTANCE: Brain {{hypometabolism}} {{is associated}} with the clinical consequences of the degenerative process, but little is known about regional <b>hypermetabolism,</b> sometimes observed in the brain of patients with clinically manifest Huntington disease (HD). Studying the role of regional <b>hypermetabolism</b> is needed to better understand its interaction with the motor symptoms of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between brain hypometabolism and <b>hypermetabolism</b> with motor scores of patients with early HD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study started in 2001, and analysis was completed in 2016. Sixty symptomatic patients with HD and 15 healthy age-matched control individuals underwent positron emission tomography to measure cerebral metabolism in this cross-sectional study. They also underwent the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale motor test, and 2 subscores were extracted: (1) a hyperkinetic score, combining dystonia and chorea, and (2) a hypokinetic score, combining bradykinesia and rigidity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Statistical parametric mapping software (SPM 5) was used to identify all hypo- and hypermetabolic regions in patients with HD relative to control individuals. Correlation analyses (P <. 001, uncorrected) between motor subscores and brain metabolic values were performed for regions with significant hypometabolism and <b>hypermetabolism.</b> RESULTS:k Among 60 patients with HD, 22 were women (36. 7 %), and the mean (SD) age was 44. 6 (7. 6) years. Of the 15 control individuals, 7 were women (46. 7 %), and the mean (SD) age was 42. 2 (7. 3) years. In statistical parametric mapping, striatal hypometabolism was significantly correlated with the severity of all motor scores. <b>Hypermetabolism</b> was negatively correlated only with hypokinetic scores in the cuneus (z score = 3. 95, P <. 001), the lingual gyrus (z score = 4. 31, P <. 001), and the crus I/II of the cerebellum (z score = 3. 77, P <. 001), a region connected to associative cortical areas. More severe motor scores were associated with higher metabolic values in the inferior parietal lobule, anterior cingulate, inferior temporal lobule, the dentate nucleus, and the cerebellar lobules IV/V, VI, and VIII bilaterally corresponding to the motor regions of the cerebellum (z score = 3. 96 and 3. 42 in right and left sides, respectively; P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Striatal hypometabolism {{is associated with}} clinical disease severity. Conversely, <b>hypermetabolism</b> is likely compensatory in regions where it is associated with decreasing motor scores. <b>Hypermetabolism</b> might be detrimental in other structures in which it is associated with more severe motor symptoms. In the cerebellum, both compensatory and detrimental contributions seem to occur. This study helps to better understand the motor clinical relevance of hypermetabolic brain regions in HD.

40|$|Purpose: There {{are a few}} {{case reports}} on {{asymmetric}} vocal cord uptake on FDG-PET in patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis, which could be a potential pitfall {{in the interpretation of}} FDG-PET images. We evaluated the metabolic activity of laryngeal muscles of patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis in comparison to normal controls during both speech and silence. Methods: Eleven patients with unilateral vocal cord palsy (thyroidectomy= 7, lung cancer= 1, others= 3) and 12 normal controls underwent FDG-PET with usual protocol. They were divided into two groups respectively; one group read books aloud for 20 minutes (phonation group) and the other kept silence (non-phonation groups) after FDG injection. Recent neck CT scan were co-registered with FDG-PET to produce PET-CT fusion images to elaborate small laryngeal muscles. Results: In patients with unilateral vocal cord palsy, contralateral non-paralyzed vocal cord showed <b>hypermetabolism</b> mainly on thyroarytenoid muscle, more intensely with phonation group (SUV= 5. 88 ± 2. 65) than with non-phonation group (SUV= 2. 30 ± 0. 39).
