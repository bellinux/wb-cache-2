The tachIOn products are PCIe cards that use <b>field-replaceable</b> modules containing single-level cell (SLC) flash components from, for example, Micron Technology, Samsung Electronics and Toshiba. They support inbuilt RAID and error correction features.|$|E

Note that service/warranty is typically focused solely on hardware and its internal firmware, as most software-related {{issues can be}} resolved by an end-user {{with the assistance of}} a technical support agent over the phone.|$|E
50|$|The VSP 8284XSQ is a fixed, compact {{form-factor}} Ethernet Switch {{that operates}} the Virtual Services Platform Operating System (VOSS), and provides eighty 1/10 Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ ports and four 40 Gigabit Ethernet QSFP+ ports. The VSP 8284XSQ supports high-availability AC power (1+1), <b>field-replaceable</b> fan trays, and front-to-back airflow.|$|E
50|$|Industrialization {{has seen}} the {{widespread}} growth of commercial manufacturing enterprises, such as the automotive industry, and later, the computer industry. The resulting complex systems have evolved modular support infrastructures, with the reliance on auto parts in the automotive industry, and replaceable computer modules known as <b>field-replaceable</b> units (FRUs).|$|E

It can be offered with <b>field-replaceable</b> blade liners from ceramic tiles or tungsten carbide. This fan may also be used in high-temperature applications.|$|E
5000|$|Most chassis-based Catalyst {{models have}} {{the concept of}} <b>field-replaceable</b> [...] "supervisor" [...] cards. These work by {{separating}} the line cards, chassis, and processing engine (mirroring most Cisco router designs). The chassis provides power and a high-speed backplane, the line cards provide interfaces to the network, and the processing engine moves packets, participates in routing protocols, etc. This gives several advantages: ...|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the type}} of grip used in the cable cars of San Francisco. The grip is {{attached}} to the lead truck of the car (or both trucks, in the case of double-ended cars), and is a <b>field-replaceable</b> unit. While there have also been side grips and even top grips, the sheer number of rope changes, crossings, and [...] "let-go" [...] curves make a bottom grip, i.e., one in which the jaws open directly downward, the most practical type of grip.|$|E
50|$|A <b>field-replaceable</b> unit (FRU) is {{a printed}} circuit board, part, or {{assembly}} that can be quickly and easily removed from a computer or other piece of electronic equipment, and replaced by the user or a technician without having to send the entire product or system to a repair facility. FRUs allow a technician lacking in-depth product knowledge to isolate faults and replace faulty components. The granularity of FRUs in a system impacts {{total cost of ownership}} and support, including the costs of stocking spare parts, where spares are deployed to meet repair time goals, how diagnostic tools are designed and implemented, levels of training for field personnel, whether end-users can do their own FRU replacement, etc.|$|E

These are <b>field-replaceable</b> heterodyne front-ends offering high sensitivities, 602 - 720 GHz frequency coverage, 4 - 12 GHz IF bandwidths, and high quasioptical efficiencies. Because the project will ultimately require 64 cartridges to fully populate the ALMA array, two key aspects of {{the design of the}} Band 9 cartridge have been to take advantage of commercial manufacturing capabilities and to simplify the assembly of the cartridge. Preliminary test results of the first (prototype) cartridge are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Wired test {{structures}} exhibit many unwanted dependencies: They typically use hierarchical and daisy-chained wiring, {{and they}} share interconnects and backplanes {{with the system}} under test. As a result, faults can easily lead to incomplete or erroneous test reports on properly working components. Wireless test structures do not have these shortcomings and, thus, allow for more accurate testing and diagnosing. Wireless communication further allows for non-intrusive testing that does not require any cabling or physical access to the system under test. We describe two prototype implementations: a wireless <b>field-replaceable</b> unit ID and a wireless version of the popular JTAG standard. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} irs, {{a program}} that combines partialorder planning with gde-style, model-based diagnosis to achieve an integrated approach to repair. Our system makes three contributions {{to the field of}} diagnosis. First, we provide a unified treatment of both information-gathering and state-altering actions via the uwl representation language. Second, we describe a way to use part-replacement operations (in addition to probes) to gather diagnostic information. Finally, we define a cost function for decision making that accounts for both the eventual need to repair broken parts and the dependence of costs on the device state. Introduction Although researchers have investigated model-based diagnosis for many years, only recently has attention turned to what should, perhaps, have been the central question all along: repair. When <b>field-replaceable</b> parts contain multiple components, focusing on determining the exact component responsible for faulty behavior can be counterproductive, since the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is a {{collaboration}} between Europe, North America, and Japan to build an aperture synthesis telescope with more than 50 12 -m antennas at 5000 m altitude in Chile. In its full configuration, ALMA will observe in 10 bands between 30 and 950 GHz, and will provide astronomers with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution at millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths. Band 9, covering 602 - 720 GHz, is the highest frequency band in the baseline ALMA project, and will thus offer the telescope's highest spatial resolutions. This paper describes {{the design of the}} Band 9 receiver cartridges for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). These are <b>field-replaceable</b> heterodyne front-ends offering high sensitivities, 602 - 720 GHz frequency coverage, 4 - 12 GHz IF bandwidths, and high quasioptical efficiencies. We specifically focus on the SIS mixer microwave design calculations that are based on J. R. Tucker theory...|$|E
