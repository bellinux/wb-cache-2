500|$|Bono {{said he did}} {{not feel}} {{responsible}} that a U2 song was used in a murder defence, but stated [...] "I still feel that you have to go down those streets in your music. If that's where the subject is taking you, you have to follow. At least in the imagination. I'm not sure I want to get <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> live. I'll take a walk occasionally, and have a drink with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's afraid of what somebody else might do {{as a result of his}} work? I would hate to see censorship come in, whether from the government or, from my point of view, personal." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferguson {{was delighted}} in how his team coped with the pitchside temperatures: [...] "You {{had to be}} <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> {{appreciate}} it. I was told it was 41 degrees on the pitch – I know I was roasting just watching them." [...] When asked about Howard's positioning for Arsenal's equaliser, he replied: [...] "Tim wanted three in the wall and he will learn from that. This isn't America." [...] Silvestre denied suggestions that the win gave United a psychological edge over Arsenal: [...] "This is still a pre-season game. We won the Premiership title with a strong run {{at the end of}} last season." [...] Howard was unsure whether he would displace Barthez in the first team for a prolonged run – [...] "that's not my decision", though continued [...] "We have four great goalkeepers and we're looking to have a good battle all season long." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{story in}} the Cowboy-friendly newspaper, the Nugget, stated without {{attribution}} that [...] "The Sheriff stepped out and said : 'Hold up boys, don't go down there or there will be trouble; I have been <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> disarm them.'" [...] In his testimony, Behan repeatedly insisted he told the Earps that he only intended to disarm the Cowboys, not that he had actually done so. The article said that Behan [...] "was standing near by commanding the contestants to cease firing but was powerless to prevent it." [...] Given the Nugget close relationship to Behan (it was owned by Behan's deputy sheriff), it is likely they interviewed him. By Williams' account, Behan told Virgil Earp immediately after the gunfight a story that corroborated the Nugget report, which the newspaper altered afterward to a version that matched the story Behan later told at the coroner's inquest.|$|E

500|$|In Batman Inc. Batwoman later appears while {{tracking}} down a gangster named Johnny Valentine, who is wanted for his {{connection to the}} murders of three marines. She tracks him to a local circus, the same one once owned by her predecessor, Kathy Kane. While chasing Valentine through a haunted house, Batwoman is attacked by {{what appears to be}} Kathy's ghost. Batwoman struggles with and eventually defeats the [...] "ghost", who is revealed to be nothing more than a blonde-haired female assassin clad in a wig and a replica of Kathy's costume. Kate realizes that she recognizes the assassin, and asks her father to run a facial-recognition scan. While Kate restrains her attacker, her father reveals that Valentine is connected to a supervillain operating out of South America, and tells Kate that she needs to get <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> find out what is going on.|$|E
500|$|In October 1969, Hendrix and Cox began jamming and {{recording}} demos with drummer Buddy Miles. [...] Miles had played with various R and soul musicians, {{as a member}} of the Electric Flag and fronting the Buddy Miles Express, both blues rock-R fusion groups. [...] Miles was also a frequent jam partner of Hendrix and played the drums the year before on the two-part song [...] "Rainy Day, Dream Away"/"Still Raining, Still Dreaming" [...] for Electric Ladyland. Cox and Miles expressed an interest in performing {{and recording}} a new album with Hendrix. Hendrix's manager, Michael Jeffery, saw the opportunity to record a live album during a New Year's performance at the Fillmore East and the trio began preparing for the upcoming concerts and new album. Between then and the end of December, the trio rehearsed at Juggy Sound Studios and recorded several demos at the Record Plant Studios in New York City, where Hendrix recorded much of Electric Ladyland. [...] After Hendrix's December 10, 1969, acquittal in his Canadian trial, the trio rehearsed their material at Baggy's Studios up until their first concert appearance on December 31. [...] In an interview, Hendrix explained, [...] "We spent 12 to 18 hours a day practicing this whole last week, straight ahead, and then we went into a funky little club and jammed <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> test it out". [...] Early versions of some of the songs which eventually appeared on Band of Gypsys from two of the rehearsal sessions were released as The Baggy's Rehearsal Sessions by Dagger Records in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Behan {{reneged on}} his deal with Earp and {{appointed}} prominent Democrat Harry Woods instead. Later that year, Behan gave a contrived explanation {{of his actions}} during the hearings after the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. He said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident shortly before his appointment. Searching for a horse stolen in late 1879, Wyatt learned {{about a year later}} that the horse was in nearby Charleston. Wyatt spotted Billy Clanton attempting to remove the horse from a corral and retrieved it without trouble. Behan was in the area to serve a subpoena on Ike Clanton. Ike was hopping mad when Behan finally found him, for Earp had told Clanton that Behan [...] "had taken a posse of nine men <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> arrest him." [...] Behan took offense at Wyatt's tactics and changed his mind about appointing Wyatt. Holliday reported in an interview in 1882 that [...] "from that time a coolness grew up between the two men." ...|$|E
