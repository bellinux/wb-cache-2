These reactions were examined in a fixed bed tubular reactor. ZSM- 5 (Si/ Al[*]=[*] 15), TS- 1, and amorphous silicates were used as catalyst supports for cobalt loadings. All catalysts were prepared by following standard methods and recipes. In general, cobalt loading on supports was varied between 0. 78 and 5. 40 [*]wt. -% (as determined from inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis). ICP, temperature programmed desorption, X-ray diffraction, and N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were used for the characterization of prepared catalysts. Cobalt on ZSM- 5 support <b>generates</b> <b>weak</b> and strong <b>acid</b> sites. Furthermore, for the Co-ZSM- 5 catalyst, prepared by a wet deposition method, the N 2 O decomposition reaction is first order with an activation energy of ~ 132 [*]kJ[*]mol − 1. Co 2 + and Co 3 + are the suggested active species for the N 2 O conversions in the studied range of temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Acetic acid {{produces}} an irritating sensation {{that can be}} attributed to activation of nociceptors within the trigeminal ganglion that innervate the nasal or oral cavities. These sensory neurons sense a diverse array of noxious agents in the environment, allowing animals to actively avoid tissue damage. Although receptor mechanisms have been identified for many noxious chemicals, the mechanisms by which animals detect <b>weak</b> <b>acids,</b> such as acetic acid, are less well understood. <b>Weak</b> <b>acids</b> are only partially dissociated at neutral pH and, as such, some can cross the cell membrane, acidifying the cell cytosol. The nociceptor ion channel TRPA 1 is activated by CO 2, through gating of the channel by intracellular protons, making it a candidate to more generally mediate sensory responses to <b>weak</b> <b>acids.</b> To test this possibility, we measured responses to <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> from heterologously expressed TRPA 1 channels and trigeminal neurons with patch clamp recording and Ca 2 + microfluorometry. Our results show that heterologously expressed TRPA 1 currents can be induced by a series of <b>weak</b> organic <b>acids,</b> including acetic, propionic, formic, and lactic acid, but not by strong acids. Notably, the degree of channel activation was predicted by the degree of intracellular acidification produced by each acid, suggesting that intracellular protons are the proximate stimulus that gates the channel. Responses to <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> produced a Ca 2 +-independent inactivation that precluded further activation by <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> or reactive chemicals, whereas preactivation by reactive electrophiles sensitized TRPA 1 channels to <b>weak</b> <b>acids.</b> Importantly, responses of trigeminal neurons to <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> were highly overrepresented in the subpopulation of TRPA 1 -expressing neurons and were severely reduced in neurons from TRPA 1 knockout mice. We conclude that TRPA 1 is a general sensor for <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> that produce intracellular acidification and suggest that it functions within the pain pathway to mediate sensitivity to cellular acidosis...|$|R

The antituberculosis activity of the front-line drug pyrazinamide (PZA), a <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> (pyrazinoic acid) precursor, can be enhanced by inhibitors of energy metabolism and anaerobiosis.

Some BA esters such as propyl hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 -dodecyloxylbenzoic acid had significant activity whereas amides of BA had no activity. As for PZA, inhibitors of energy metabolism DCCD and azide enhanced the antituberculosis activity of <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> under normal atmospheric oxygen tension.

We have investigated the effects of <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> on two stress-responsive signalling molecules, PtdIns(3, 5) P 2 and PtdIns(4, 5) P 2, which in S. cerevisiae are synthesized by Fab 1 p and Mss 4 p respectively. At low extracellular pH, benzoic acid, sorbic acid and acetic acid all cause a transient reduction in PtdIns(3, 5) P 2 accumulation and a more persistent rise in PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 levels. The increase in PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 levels is accompanied by a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, changes in PtdInsP 2 levels are independent of weak acid-induced Pdr 12 p expression. In contrast, changing the extracellular medium to alkaline pH provokes a prolonged and substantial rise in PtdIns(3, 5) P 2 levels. As PtdIns(3, 5) P 2 synthesis is required for correct vacuole acidification, it is possible that levels of this molecule are modulated to maintain intracellular pH homoeostasis in response to <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> and alkali stresses.
