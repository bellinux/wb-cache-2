5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans <b>is</b> <b>Saddam</b> worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

We {{would not have been}} able to get everybody out and bring everybody home....And the question in my mind is how many additional American casualties <b>is</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein worth? And the answer is not that damned many.

50|$|Throughout his tenure, Saddam killed {{supporters}} who gave advice contrary to his thinking, and thus {{surrounded himself with}} sycophants. He warred with the Kurds and Iranians and was pragmatic enough {{to change his mind}} regarding the Shatt al Arab Waterway, his foreign hostage policy, and the War with Iran, which had started going badly for the Iraqis. To his mind, Saddam is Iraq and Iraq <b>is</b> <b>Saddam.</b> He was a narcissist who believed he was the chosen leader of the Arab world, despite lack of support for the Kuwait invasion. Paranoid, he was convinced in conspiracies of the US, Israel, and Iran to kill him. After the Kuwait invasion and defeat, he worked to shore up his forces and eventually began to trust party loyalists over his family, including two of his sons who he killed after giving them amnesty. His goal is survival and a place in the world state with world class weapons. When backed into a corner, he fights with everything he has but can change his mind and compromise {{to be seen as a}} global leader.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, the US Defense Secretary {{during the}} war, Dick Cheney, {{made the same}} point:I would guess if we had gone in there, we would still have forces in Baghdad today. We'd be running the country. We {{would not have been}} able to get {{everybody}} out and bring everybody home.And the final point that I think needs to be made is this question of casualties. I don't think you could have done all of that without significant additional US casualties, and while everybody was tremendously impressed with the low cost of the (1991) conflict, for the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a cheap war.And the question in my mind is, how many additional American casualties <b>is</b> <b>Saddam</b> (Hussein) worth?

So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the President made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.Instead of a greater involvement of its own military, the US hoped that Saddam would be overthrown in an internal coup d'état. The CIA used its assets in Iraq to organize a revolt, but the Iraqi government defeated the effort.|$|E
5000|$|A {{total of}} 147 U.S. {{military}} personnel died in combat, and another 236 {{died as a}} result of accidents or other causes. Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6. There was subsequent debate about whether UN Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces. Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon. In an April 15, 1994 interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S. and UN forces should have moved into Baghdad. Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a [...] "bad idea" [...] and would have led to a [...] "quagmire", explaining that:Because if we'd gone to Baghdad we would have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. occupation of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq.
