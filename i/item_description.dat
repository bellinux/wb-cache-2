The system obviously cannot alert the user that the description is wrongly spelled, inappropriate, nonsensical, etc.|$|E

The process is managed through a backend dashboard that compiles all the comments and then allows retailers to send invoices to buyers. Retailers can also turn on automatic invoices, track customers, and put buyers on a waitlist for out-of-stock items. This process allows businesses to turn their Facebook and Instagram pages into points of sale.|$|E
50|$|Most {{data items}} are {{developed}} and delivered {{in compliance with}} pre-defined data item descriptions (DID). These pre-defined data items may be tailored by deleting any part of a DID that is not applicable to the specific acquisition,. The CDRL form provides a block for simple citation of which DID it is, as well as where it is mentioned in the SOW and what part(s) of the overall work breakdown structure it is involved with. The remarks block may explain how the DID will be applied, but can not alter or add to the DID. (Language altering the data <b>item</b> <b>description</b> would obviously make it no longer a standard DID available by simple citation, pre-approved, and readily handled by existing Department of Defense processes.)Contracts issued by governments (including their militaries) outside the US also use CDRLs {{as part of their}} statements of Work. These CDRLs do not use the US military's DD Form 1423, but may utilize some of the same elements to define their need for documentation.|$|E

These documents could take many forms, from source code, to installation scripts, to various electronic and paper reports, and the contracting party (e.g., the government) is encouraged to specify acceptable formats. Any data <b>item</b> <b>description</b> is tailored for a specific contract, meaning sections not desired for a particular effort are identified as not to be provided as part of identifying the Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) of what items are to be produced and delivered by a contractor.
