500|$|Quantum {{evolution}} was {{a controversial}} hypothesis advanced by Columbia University paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson, who was regarded by Stephen Jay Gould as [...] "the greatest and most biologically astute paleontologist {{of the twentieth}} century." [...] Simpson's conjecture was that according to the geological record, on very rare occasions evolution would proceed very rapidly to form entirely new families, orders, and classes of organisms. This hypothesis differs from punctuated equilibrium in several respects. First, punctuated equilibrium was more modest in scope, {{in that it was}} addressing evolution specifically at the species level. Simpson's idea was principally concerned with evolution at <b>higher</b> <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups.</b> Second, Eldredge and Gould relied upon a different mechanism. Where Simpson relied upon a synergistic interaction between genetic drift and a shift in the adaptive fitness landscape, Eldredge and Gould relied upon ordinary speciation, particularly Ernst Mayr's concept of allopatric speciation. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, quantum evolution took no position on the issue of stasis. Although Simpson acknowledged the existence of stasis in what he called the bradytelic mode, he considered it (along with rapid evolution) to be unimportant in the larger scope of evolution. In his Major Features of Evolution Simpson stated, [...] "Evolutionary change is so nearly the universal rule that a state of motion is, figuratively, normal in evolving populations. The state of rest, as in bradytely, is the exception and it seems that some restraint or force must be required to maintain it." [...] Despite such differences between the two models, earlier critiques—from such eminent commentators as Sewall Wright as well as Simpson himself—have argued that punctuated equilibrium is little more than quantum evolution relabeled.|$|E

In this respect a key observation is that genera, families or orders can each be assigned a characteristic average lifetime [Van Valen, L., (1973) Evolutionary Theory 1, 1 - 30]. Using the fossil marine animal genera database [Sepkoski, J. J. Jr. (2002) A Compendium of Fossil Marine Animal Genera, Bull. Am. Paleontol. 363, 563 pp. ] we here examine key determinants for robustness of a <b>higher</b> <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> in terms of the characteristics of its constituents.

40|$|Despite recent {{advance in}} mass {{sequencing}} {{technologies such as}} pyrosequencing, assessment of culture-independent microbial eukaryote community structures using universal primers remains very difficult due to the tremendous richness and complexity of organisms in these communities. Use of a specific PCR marker targeting a particular group would provide enhanced sensitivity and more in-depth evaluation of microbial eukaryote communities compared to what can be achieved with universal primers. We discovered that many phylum- or groupspecific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exist in small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes from diverse eukaryote groups. By applying this discovery to a known simple allele-discriminating (SAP) PCR method, we developed a technique that enables the identification of organisms belonging to a specific <b>higher</b> <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> (or phylum) among diverse types of eukaryotes. We performed an assay using two complementary methods, pyrosequencing and clone library screening. In doing this, specificities for the group (ciliates) targeted in this study in bulked environmental samples were 94. 6 % for the clone library and 99. 2 % for pyrosequencing, respectively. In particular, our novel technique showed high selectivity for rare species, a feature {{that may be more}} important than the ability to identify quantitatively predominant species in community structure analyses. Additionally, our data revealed that a target-specific library (or ciliate-specific one for the present study) can better explain the ecological features of a sampling locality than a universal library...|$|R

40|$|Rarity of macroinvertebrates {{can be used}} in {{assessing}} the ecological quality or conservation value of freshwaters. To select target species for nature conservation and to compare rarity or commonness between regions a classification of species distributions is needed. A distribution classification for Dutch macroinvertebrate taxa is presented. Frequencies of occurrence in surface waters of aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa were extracted from databases of water district managers and included data from 7608 sites from 1980 to 1998. Six classes were defined: very rare, rare, uncommon, common, very common, and abundant. The boundaries for these classes were established using the number of occurrences of the taxa and the expert opinion of a committee of water district managers and taxonomic experts. A distribution class was assigned to each of 1544 taxa, including 1514 species and 30 taxa on <b>higher</b> <b>taxonomic</b> level (<b>groups,</b> aggregates, genera). There were still many taxa for which the distribution was unknown due to their small size, their special habitat requirements, or identification difficulties due to immature animals and incomplete taxonomic information. The number of rare species differed between the 24 water management districts and depended on characteristics of the area, sampling strategy, and sampling intensity. The percentage of rare species differed between <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups.</b> The definition of distribution classes and their boundaries can be applied at different scales, (e. g., water management district or national scale), which makes results comparable between scales and provides a broad application in bioassessment and conservation...|$|R
40|$|Diverse {{and complex}} {{microbial}} ecosystems {{are found in}} virtually every environment on earth, yet we {{know very little about}} their composition and ecology. Comprehensive identification and quantification of the constituents of these microbial communities—a ‘census’—is an essential foundation for understanding their biology. To address this problem, we developed, tested and optimized a DNA oligonucleotide microarray composed of 10 462 small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) probes (7167 unique sequences) selected to provide quantitative information on the taxonomic composition of diverse microbial populations. Using our optimized experimental approach, this microarray enabled detection and quantification of individual bacterial species present at fractional abundances of < 0. 1 % in complex synthetic mixtures. The estimates of bacterial species abundance obtained using this microarray are similar to those obtained by phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA sequences from the same samples—the current ‘gold standard’ method for profiling microbial communities. Furthermore, probes designed to represent <b>higher</b> order <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups</b> of bacterial species reliably detected microbes for which there were no species-specific probes.

40|$|Abstract Background Phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate is {{involved}} in regulation of several key cellular processes, mainly endocytosis, signaling, nuclear processes, cytoskeletal remodelling, cell survival, membrane trafficking, phagosome maturation and autophagy. In most cases effector proteins bind to this lipid, using either FYVE or PX domain. These two domains are distributed amongst varied life forms such as virus, protists, fungi, viridiplantae and metazoa. As the binding ligand is identical for both domains, {{the goal of this}} study was to understand if there is any selectivity for either of these domains in different taxa. Further, to understand the different cellular functions that these domains may be involved in, we analyzed the taxonomic distribution of additional domains that associate with FYVE and PX. Results There is selectivity for either FYVE or PX in individual genomes where both domains are present. Fungi and metazoa encode more PX, whereas streptophytes in viridiplantae encode more FYVE. Excess of FYVE in streptophytes results from proteins containing RCC 1 and DZC domains and FYVE domains in these proteins have a non-canonical ligand-binding site. Within a <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> the selected domain associates with a higher number of other domains and is thus expected to discharge a larger number of cellular functions. Also, while certain associated domains are present in all <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups,</b> most of them are unique to a specific group indicating that while certain common functions are discharged by these domains in all <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups,</b> some functions appear to be group specific. Conclusions Although both FYVE and PX bind to PtdIns(3) P, genomes of different taxa show distinct selectivity of encoding either of the two. <b>Higher</b> numbers of <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> specific domains co-occur with the more abundant domain (FYVE/PX) indicating that group-specific rare domain architectures might have emerged to accomplish certain group-specific functions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Mass spectrometry-based {{proteomics}} {{was applied}} to analyze proteins isolated from dissolved organic matter (DOM). The focal question was to identify the type and biological origin of proteins in DOM, and to describe diversity of protein origin {{at the level of}} <b>higher</b> <b>taxonomic</b> units, as well as to detect extracellular enzymes possibly important in the carbon cycle. Identified proteins were classified according to their phylogenetic origin and metabolic function using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein and taxonomy database. Seventy-eight percent of the proteins in DOM from the lake but less than 50 % in forest soil DOM originated from bacteria. In a deciduous forest, the number of identified proteins decreased from 75 to 28 with increasing soil depth and decreasing total soil organic carbon content. The number of identified proteins and <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups</b> was 50 % higher in winter than in summer.
