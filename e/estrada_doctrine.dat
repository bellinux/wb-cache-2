50|$|The <b>Estrada</b> <b>Doctrine</b> {{suggests}} {{that under the}} establishment of de facto governments in other countries, Mexico is {{not in favor of}} giving recognition because it is considered a degrading practice. By hurting the sovereignty of other states, it puts them in a vulnerable position because their internal affairs can be judged by other governments, that in fact assume a critical attitude when deciding about the legality and legitimacy of foreign governments. Hence Mexico was itself hurt because of the practice, as it was difficult to obtain recognition of its independence. The most extended use of the <b>Estrada</b> <b>Doctrine</b> was in the 1970s, when Mexico did not withdraw its recognition of any South American government which was formed through a coup d'état, the only measure Mexico could use against such governments was withdrawing its diplomatic mission.|$|E

Indeed, the new foreign policy doctrine openly invited other nations to scrutinize Mexican affairs, criticizing the <b>Estrada</b> <b>Doctrine</b> as offering an excuse to ignore foreign criticism. Finally, José Galán, an editorialist in La Jornada, accused the Fox administration of not doing enough to stop border violence against Mexican nationals. However, during the country's appointment to the UN Security Council, Mexico did not support the U.S. lead invasion of Iraq, damaging US-Mexico relations.|$|E
