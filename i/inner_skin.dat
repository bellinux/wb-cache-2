25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{construction was}} quite novel. Barnwell borrowed from marine experience by using duralumin sheet, varnished to prevent corrosion and used these {{to make the}} fuselage in four sections. The two forward sections were semi-monocoque (i.e. open channels) with braced longitudinal upper members which, bolted together, held the engine, a water-cooled inline upright 140hp (100kW) Hispano-Suiza) and the pilot's cockpit. Aft, two more sections, both true monocoques, held the observer and carried the tail unit. The two cockpits were close together, with the pilot under the wing at mid-chord and the observer under a trailing edge cutout; Barnwell proposed that the short observer's fuselage section should be removable to turn the M.R.1 into a single-seater, though this configuration was not realised. The monocoque sections were very early examples of double-skinned construction, with a smooth outer skin riveted to a longitudinally-corrugated <b>inner</b> <b>skin.</b> The detailed design was by W.T.Read. The complete fuselage was of round-cornered rectangular cross-section and quite slender, mounted between the wings. The M.R.1 was a two-bay biplane without stagger or sweep, with ailerons on both planes. Aluminium wing spars proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid and Bristol outsourced their manufacture to The Steel Wing Company at Gloucester, who had built experimental steel wings for other aircraft.|$|E

Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the eyes become cloudy or blue-colored. The inner surface of the old outer skin liquefies. This causes the old outer skin to separate from the new <b>inner</b> <b>skin.</b> After a few days, the eyes clear and the snake [...] "crawls" [...] out of its old skin. The old skin breaks near the mouth and the snake wriggles out aided by rubbing against rough surfaces.

500|$|B.pila has an egg-shaped {{to roughly}} spherical fruit body {{measuring}} up to [...] in diameter. The thin (0.25millimeter) outer tissue layer (exoperidium) is white to slightly pink. Its surface texture, initially appearing as if covered with minute flakes of bran (furfuraceous), becomes marked with irregular, crooked lines (rivulose). The exoperidium flakes off in maturity {{to reveal a}} thin, inner peridium (endoperidium). The color of this shiny <b>inner</b> <b>skin,</b> splotched with darker areas, resembles the metallic colors of bronze and copper. Bovista pila puffballs {{are attached to the}} ground by a small cord (a rhizomorph) that typically breaks off when the puffball is mature. The interior flesh, or gleba, comprises spores and surrounding capillitial tissue. Initially white and firm with tiny, irregularly shaped chambers (visible with a magnifying glass), the gleba later becomes greenish and then brown and powdery as the spores mature. In age, the upper surface of the puffball cracks and tears open. The resilient texture of the inner peridium enables the puffball to maintain its ball-like shape after it has detached from the ground. As the old puffballs get blown around, spores get shaken out of the tears.|$|E

2500|$|The trio {{of ships}} {{incorporated}} advanced safety precautions into their designs, intended {{to mitigate the}} risk of flooding and all but eliminate the chances of foundering. Each ship featured an <b>inner</b> <b>skin,</b> a second layer of [...] thick steel above the keel which created a watertight box {{along the bottom of}} the hull known as a [...] "double bottom." [...] 15 transverse steel bulkheads reaching [...] up to E Deck (D Deck {{in the case of the}} two forward most bulkheads) divided the hulls of each ship into 16 watertight compartments, each equipped with an electric pump to remove floodwater. The compartments could be sealed by automatic doors from the bridge in the event of a collision, preventing water from spreading to other parts of the ship. Olympic and Titanic were so designed that either could stay afloat with four compartments breached. The Olympic-class liners also eliminated converse bulkheads, such as those on Lusitania and Mauretania, which separated the coal bunkers along either side of the hull from the engine rooms and boiler rooms in the center. Such an arrangement was believed to increase the risk of a ship capsizing by trapping water lengthwise along the ship and increasing her list to one side.|$|E

60|$|Of {{the nature}} of our task I must {{continue}} to give some summary idea. The forecastle was lumbered with ship's chandlery, the hold nigh full of rice, the lazarette crowded with the teas and silks. These must all be dug out; and that made but a fraction of our task. The hold was ceiled throughout; a part, where perhaps some delicate cargo was once stored, had been lined, in addition, with inch boards; and between every beam there was a movable panel into the bilge. Any of these, the bulkheads of the cabins, the very timbers of the hull itself, might be the place of hiding. It was therefore necessary to demolish, as we proceeded, a great part of the ship's <b>inner</b> <b>skin</b> and fittings, and to auscultate what remained, like a doctor sounding for a lung disease. Upon the return, from any beam or bulkhead, of a doubtful sound, we must up axe and hew into the timber: a violent and--from the amount of dry rot in the wreck--a mortifying exercise. Every night saw a deeper inroad into the bones of the Flying Scud--more beams tapped and hewn in splinters, more planking peeled away and tossed aside--and every night saw us as far as ever from the end and object of our arduous devastation. In this perpetual disappointment, my courage did not fail me, but my spirits dwindled; and Nares himself grew silent and morose. At night, when supper was done, we passed an hour in the cabin, mostly without speech: I, sometimes dozing over a book; Nares, sullenly but busily drilling sea-shells with the instrument called a Yankee fiddle. A stranger might have supposed we were estranged; as a matter of fact, in this silent comradeship of labour, our intimacy grew.|$|E
50|$|Some sources {{state the}} outer wing panels used double skins {{top and bottom}} with the steam being ducted into a thin space between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>skins</b> for cooling.

Furthermore, there was no access to the inner structure to repair damage such as a bullet hole from the inside, as would be needed if the system used a double skin. A similar system was used by the earlier Supermarine Type 224. Contrary to assertions in some references, all of the He 100s that were built used the evaporative cooling system described above.
