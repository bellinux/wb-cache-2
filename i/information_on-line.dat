40|$|In today’s society {{searching for}} {{information}} {{has become a}} question of whether one can use a computer or not. This study examines six Swedish high school students’ digital literacy skills. Specifically how they search for <b>information</b> <b>on-line,</b> how their digital literacy is displayed, what strategies they use to collect the information that is needed for a task and how they do this when they read in English, which is their second language. The main thesis {{of this study is that}} students are assumed to be digital natives and society needs to have knowledge about what strategies they use when reading on-line in English and how they think while completing a task. Questions which have been asked are, what strategies do students use while reading on-line? What impact does the subject of the text have on the students reading efficiency? Are students efficient on-line readers in English? And are students really so-called digital natives?The method developed into three main stages which were constructing a questionnaire, constructing a task and performing think-aloud recordings. The questionnaire intended to enable the selection of participants as well as provide background information for constructing the appropriate task for this study. The second stage was to construct two texts with questions and the third stage of the study was to perform think-aloud recordings with the participants as they were answering the questions. By developing the students’ language skills in English combined with digital literacy, the participating students have the ability to become more efficient on-line readers in English, thus make it easier for them to effectively gather <b>information</b> <b>on-line.</b> Validerat; 20150213 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
