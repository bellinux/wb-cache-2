5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and {{was left with}} the {{impression}} that she had interrupted an argument. She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> heroin, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> speed," [...] {{he said in a}} 2008 interview, adding that he stopped smoking cannabis and taking LSD at the age of 20.

Even with his reduced schedule, he needed a break. The brothers closed the label, and Elefante could finally take some {{time away from the}} industry. This proved more challenging than expected, and despite his best intentions, he served as producer on three albums in 2007.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s the {{question}} of whether polysynthesis could be considered a general characteristic of Native American languages became a hotly contested issue as Brinton debated {{the question}} with John Hewitt. Brinton, who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> fieldwork with any indigenous group continued to defend Humboldt and Duponceau's view of the exceptional nature of American languages against the claim of Hewitt, who was half Tuscarora and had studied the Iroquoian languages, that languages such as the Iroquois had grammatical rules and verbs just like European languages.|$|E
25|$|The logo was {{designed}} by Chicago-based Sender LLC (a brand development and design company) on assignment from Chicago-based Mode Project (a motion design studio). The latter had been brought on board early on by David Axelrod, Obama’s chief campaign strategist, although it <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> a political identity before. Creative director Sol Sender, now a partner at VSA Partners and founding director of the IBM Design Lab, led the design team of three which included Amanda Gentry and Andy Keene. Project managers at Mode Project were Colin Carter and Steve Juras.|$|E

25|$|Gaekwad {{played his}} early cricket for Bombay University and the Maharaja Sayaji University in Baroda. He made his Test debut at Headingley in 1952, opening the innings, though he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> it before this tour. He {{was among the}} four victims (others being Pankaj Roy, Vijay Manjrekar and Madhav Mantri) in India’s miserable 0–4 start in the second innings of the Headingley Test of 1952 with Fred Trueman playing havoc. His West Indies tour {{in the next year}} was {{terminated}} abruptly during the second Test when he collided with Vijay Hazare while going for a catch and dislocated his shoulder.|$|E
25|$|One of Ted Williams' final, {{and most}} memorable, public {{appearances}} {{was at the}} 1999 All-Star Game in Boston. Able to walk only a short distance, Williams {{was brought to the}} pitcher's mound in a golf cart. He proudly waved his cap to the crowd—a gesture he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> as a player. Fans responded with a standing ovation that lasted several minutes. At the pitcher's mound he was surrounded by players from both teams, including fellow Red Sox player Nomar Garciaparra. Later in the year, he was among the members of the Major League Baseball All-Century Team introduced to the crowd at Turner Field in Atlanta prior to Game two of the World Series.|$|E
25|$|On her website, Messenger {{chronicles the}} journey {{in the death}} of her son, and why she is an outspoken {{opponent}} of vaccines. She stated that she knew nothing about vaccines and only got them for her son because the doctor recommended it. Her 8-week old son had always been happy and calm, but became extremely upset immediately after his first vaccination shot, the doctor when asked said that this was normal behavior. The next day he was back to normal and she waited for his 4-month visit which included more vaccination shots. After this he vomited which Messenger says he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> before. The doctor suggested stopping breast-feeding and switch to juice which she did. The next day he started having seizures and convulsions.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of Hermann Bock, several friends of his testified at Haarmann's trial that, prior to Haarmann's arrest, they had been {{actively}} dissuaded from filing a missing person report upon the youth with police; these witnesses testified that Haarmann was insistent on filing the report himself (he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> so). Other witnesses testified to having acquired various personal possessions belonging to the youth from Haarmann. In addition, a tailor testified at Haarmann's trial to having been asked by Haarmann to alter the suit. Haarmann repeatedly contradicted himself regarding his claims as to how he had acquired the youth's possessions. It is likely that Haarmann chose to deny this murder due to evidence suggesting the murder had been premeditated, {{as opposed to being}} committed in the throes of passion. He had known the youth for several years prior to his murder, and Bock was known to be heterosexual. Due to his denial of having committed this particular murder, Haarmann was acquitted.|$|E

500|$|In {{a series}} of {{articles}} published in 1932, Von Neumann made foundational contributions to ergodic theory, a branch of mathematics that involves the states of dynamical systems with an invariant measure. Of the 1932 papers on ergodic theory, Paul Halmos writes that even [...] "if von Neumann <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>done</b> anything else, they would have been sufficient to guarantee him mathematical immortality". By then von Neumann had already written his famous articles on operator theory, and the application of this work was instrumental in the von Neumann mean ergodic theorem.|$|E
