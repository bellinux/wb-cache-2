5|$|In 1929, Edward Bernays {{helped the}} Lucky Strike {{cigarette}} brand increase <b>its</b> <b>sales</b> among the female demographic.

Bernays persuaded fashion designers, charity events, interior designers and others to popularize the color green.

5|$|Sinclair {{worked with}} musicians {{including}} Fernando Garibay, Jeff Bhasker, and Martin Kierszenbaum, {{and created a}} concept album based on perfectionism.

Perfectionist received mixed reviews from music critics, who asserted that the singer's visual projects were superior to her music. Obtaining top 50 positions in some European countries, the album performed moderately on international record charts. In the United Kingdom and United States, the set attained chiefly low positions; in the latter, <b>its</b> <b>sales</b> as of September 2013 were of 14,000 copies.|$|E
