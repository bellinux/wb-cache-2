5|$|As Cayman-Global attacks Eurocorp's New York HQ, Kilo and Lily head towards Denham's {{office to}} prevent him from {{activating}} the kill switch on their DART chips. Kilo has to fight off both Eurocorp and Cayman-Global forces, as well as several EuroCorp agents. At the top of the tower, he is forced to fight Merit and two other agents, who are under Denham's orders to kill him. Kilo defeats the agents, and overpowers and kills Merit. Kilo then heads towards Denham's office but finds Denham has activated his kill switch, which starts to affect Kilo's movements. Weakened, Kilo confronts Denham, who justifies abducting him as a child. Kilo manages to fight against the kill-switch order and corners Denham, who lets himself fall over a ledge to his death. As the game ends, Eurocorp lies in ruins and Lily gives Kilo a pistol, telling him that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> from anyone's control.|$|E
5|$|Captain Scarlet becomes Spectrum's {{foremost}} {{weapon in}} its {{fight against the}} Mysterons after {{the events of the}} pilot episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The original Captain Scarlet is {{killed in a car accident}} engineered by the Mysterons and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness. However, when the Captain Scarlet duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer Captain Blue and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns to life with the consciousness and the normal personality of the original Captain Scarlet fully restored let alone his memories of Mysteron control, and thereafter <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> from Mysteron control. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity, and if he is injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain Scarlet repeatedly braves the pain of death in the knowledge that he will recover to face the Mysterons again.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a mistake}} by April (Aubrey Plaza), Ron (Nick Offerman) {{is forced to}} deal with 93 {{meetings}} in a single day. He enlists the aid of April, Andy (Chris Pratt), Leslie (Amy Poehler) and Ann (Rashida Jones) to help handle them, while telling Jerry (Jim O'Heir) that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> to go home early. During her first meeting, Leslie learns a historic town monument, the Turnbill mansion, is soon to be altered by its new renter, the former Miss Pawnee beauty pageant winner Jessica Wicks (Susan Yeagley).

Leslie is shocked Jessica has already made several alterations, such as hanging up nude portraits of herself and painting the floor.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Betelgeuse—envisioned by McDowell as a winged demon, who {{takes on the}} form of a short Middle Eastern man, is also intent on killing the Deetzes rather than scaring them, and wanted to rape Lydia rather than marry her. In this version of the script, Betelgeuse only needs to be exhumed from his grave to be summoned, after which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> to wreak havoc; he cannot be summoned or controlled by saying his name three times, and wanders the world freely, appearing to torment different characters in different manifestations. McDowell's script also featured a second Deetz child, nine-year-old Cathy, the only person able to see the Maitlands and the subject of Betelgeuse's homicidal wrath in the film's climax, during which he mutilates her while in {{the form of a}} rabid squirrel before revealing his true form.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} reality of disaster, Lamentations concludes with the bitter {{possibility}} that God may have finally rejected Israel (chapter 5:22). Sufferers in the face of grief are not urged to a confidence in the goodness of God; in fact God is accountable for the disaster. The poet acknowledges that this suffering is a just punishment, still God is held to have had choice over whether to act in this way and at this time. Hope arises from a recollection of God's past goodness, but although this justifies a cry to God to act in deliverance, {{there is no guarantee that}} he will. Repentance will not persuade God to be gracious, since <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> to give or withhold grace as he chooses. In the end, the possibility is that God has finally rejected his people and may not again deliver them: if God is predictable, then God is just a tool of humans. Nevertheless, it also affirms confidence that the mercies of Yahweh (the God of Israel) never end, but are new every morning (3:22–33).|$|E

25|$|James's drivetime {{show was}} {{initially}} produced by Laura Sayers (known as Headmistress Laura), with Sarah Underwood, and later Pippa Taylor as Assistant Producer. After Sayers left {{the show to}} go on maternity leave, she was replaced by Taylor, and new Assistant Producer Travis Walby joined. James is joined regularly by newsreader Chris Smith (referred to as Chris Smith With The News), who takes part {{in a number of}} segments during the show, when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> of Newsbeat duties. There used to be a daily handover at 19:00 with Zane Lowe, prior to his departure from Radio 1. This tradition ended when Annie Mac took over Zane's show. Dev is the regular cover, who would also involve Smith, Taylor and Walby in the discussions, and continue some of the regular features. In June 2015, Taylor and Walby left the show; Taylor to eventually work on The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X, Walby to produce the weekend shows. Their final show was on 5 June 2015. Ian Chaloner took over producing, with Jenny Keough as assistant producer. It was at this point that Chris Smith's involvement in the show was reduced somewhat, with him no longer participating in links and features between 4:30 and 5:45, including Nerd Alerts and Rage Against the Answer Machine, or regularly speaking to Greg after the news.

25|$|Sambhāvanā (Hindi: सम्भावना, meaning Competency): Sambhāvanā or {{competency}} is vividly {{described in}} the first ten verses of the canto. Aṣṭāvakra is brimming with confidence as he approaches Mithilā. Mithilā is replete with scholars versed in the Vedas and all the six Āstika schools. The twelve-year olds Aṣṭāvakra and Śvetaketu run into Janaka, who {{is on his way}} to the court. Janaka asks his guards to get the handicapped boy out of his way. Aṣṭāvakra responds by saying that Janaka should get out of his way instead, as he (Aṣṭāvakra) is a Brāhmaṇa versed in the scriptures. Pleased with his brilliance, Janaka tells Aṣṭāvakra that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> to roam anywhere in Mithilā. However, Janaka's gatekeeper does not let Aṣṭāvakra into the court, and tells him that only the learned and wise elders deserve to be in Janaka's court. Aṣṭāvakra makes the gatekeeper speechless by his definition of elders – only those grown in knowledge are the elders. The gatekeeper now lets him into an assembly consisting of sages like Yājñavalkya, Gārgī and Maitreyī. Aṣṭāvakra openly challenges Bandī for a scriptural debate. Janaka asks Aṣṭāvakra to satisfy him first in debate, and poses him six cryptic questions, which Aṣṭāvakra answers convincingly. Janaka offers him Bandī, who knows within himself he will lose to Aṣṭāvakra, but decides to openly debate. Bandī mocks Aṣṭāvakra's deformities and the assembly laughs. Aṣṭāvakra chides both Bandī and the assembly and declares his intention to leave the assembly.|$|E

500|$|Fleming {{considers}} True at First Light {{similar to}} Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and A Moveable Feast—a book that presents a primary topic {{as a backdrop}} interspersed with internal dialogue. Unlike the other two books, True at First Light is without a preface [...] "indicating {{the intentions of the}} author or dictating how he intended to have the book read". Fleming thinks Hemingway regarded Green Hills of Africa [...] as experimental and A Moveable Feast as fiction. Rose Marie Burwell, author of [...] Hemingway: The Postwar Years and the Posthumous Novels, believes Hemingway enjoyed writing the [...] "strange combination of memoir and fiction". [...] She thinks in the fictional aspects of True at First Light <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> to imagine a second wife and to jettison his Protestant background.|$|E
500|$|The story {{continues}} with the Stranger traveling south. In the song [...] "Denver," [...] the character {{falls in love}} with a woman he meets in a bar in town. One of the lines from [...] "Blue Rock Montana" [...] is repeated, with a variation: [...] "And they danced with a smile on their faces". The following song, [...] "Can I Sleep in Your Arms?", shows the desire of the Stranger for redemption and love. Next is [...] "Remember Me", where he announces that his vows to his deceased wife are broken and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> to love. The story ends with [...] "Hands on the Wheel", which depicts the Stranger as an old man who is accompanied by a child, presumably his grandson, and his new love. The song marks the end of the sorrow of the Stranger, and his redemption years later. The album ends with the instrumental song [...] "Bandera".|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt's Shakespearean {{criticism}} {{continued to}} find some acceptance from then on, yet a stigma still hung about his character, and his criticism was often judged to be overly emotional and [...] "impressionistic". This attitude changed only gradually. In 1955, René Wellek, in his history of literary criticism in all Western culture for the previous two centuries, largely supported these earlier views. Characters, to him, centres excessively on Shakespeare's characters and, worse, Hazlitt [...] "confuses fiction and reality" [...] and discusses fictional characters {{as though they were}} real people. Yet he also notes, a half-century after Saintsbury, and following Schneider's lead, that for all of Hazlitt's impressionism, [...] "there is more theory in Hazlitt than is generally realised." [...] He also thought that Hazlitt shows considerable [...] "psychological acumen" [...] in explaining certain types of characters, such as Iago, and that Hazlitt's [...] "character sketch of Iago is superior to Coleridge's". He also praises Hazlitt's freedom, in Characters and elsewhere, from [...] "the defects which infected his nearest critical rivals, Johnson and Coleridge: chauvinism, prudery, and unctuous sermonising. [...] <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> of the prudery which in his day pervaded English culture." ...|$|E

500|$|In Island of Lost Souls (1932), an {{adaptation}} of H. G. Wells' science-fiction novel, The Island of Doctor Moreau, Charles Laughton plays yet another mad scientist with a God complex. As Moreau, Laughton creates a mad scientist's island paradise, an unmonitored haven where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> to create a race of man-beasts and Lota, a beast-woman he wants to mate with a normal human male. A castaway lands on his island, providing him {{an opportunity to see}} how far his science experiment, the barely clothed, attractive Lota, has come. The castaway discovers Moreau vivisecting one of the beast-men and attempts to leave the island. He runs into the camp of the man-beasts and Moreau beats them back with a whip. The film ends with Lota dead, the castaway rescued, and the man-beasts chanting, [...] "Are we not men?" [...] as they attack and then vivisect Moreau. The film has been described as [...] "a rich man's Freaks" [...] due to its esteemed source material. Wells, however, despised the movie for its lurid excesses. It was rejected by 14 local censor boards in the United States, and considered [...] "against nature" [...] in Great Britain, where it was banned until 1958.|$|E
500|$|In {{the ninth}} series, Harry reinstates Lucas {{as chief of}} Section D; this makes Lucas {{responsible}} for the integration of two new team members into the section, Beth Bailey (Sophia Myles) and Dimitri Levendis (Max Brown). Vaughn returns and hands Lucas a briefcase with possessions from his life before MI5, including photographs of him and Maya Lahan. When he visits her, however, she is so shocked at his reappearance and angry over his letting her believe him dead that at first she wants {{nothing to do with}} him. Later, Vaughn promises to leave Lucas alone in exchange for an MI5 file on [...] "Albany"; Lucas eventually hands him what he believes is the file. Believing <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> from Vaughn, Lucas persuades Maya to restart their relationship. However, it is revealed the file was not Albany, though it leads to the location of the actual file. Vaughn forces Lucas to find the file, which is in the possession of former Section D member Malcolm Wynn-Jones (Hugh Simon). After convincing Malcolm to give him the file, Lucas hands it over to Vaughn, but it is soon discovered that this file, too, is a fake, and Malcolm has abandoned the house where he and Lucas had met. To force Lucas to continue seeking the file hand Vaughn kidnaps Maya. By this time, Harry Pierce has discovered that Lucas is not who he claims to be. Arrested and questioned, Lucas admits his true identity and his past, but convinces Harry to save Maya. A mortally wounded Vaughn is able to [...] "wake up" [...] Lucas' true persona, who he was before MI5. Believing Harry may not honour the deal they have worked out, Lucas intends to leave the country after getting his hands on the Albany file. The file is revealed to contain directions for building a genetic weapon that Vaughn has agreed to sell to the Chinese. After Lucas acquires the real file from Harry in exchange for team member Ruth Evershed, whom he has kidnapped, Maya is killed while he is trying to escape with her. He delivers the file to the Chinese agents anyway and intends to kill Harry for revenge. During their roof-top confrontation, Lucas learns that Albany is an elaborate deception; the genetic weapon is unworkable. Lucas then forces Harry to turn around, as if he is about to execute him. Instead, Lucas throws himself from the roof, to his death.|$|E
