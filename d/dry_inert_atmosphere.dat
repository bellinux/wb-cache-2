It is found that package sealing, assembly, and rework are especially susceptible to contamination. Moisture and loose particles are identified as the worst contaminants. The points at which contaminants are most likely to enter the hybrid package are also identified, and both general and specific methods for their detection and control are developed. In general, the most effective controls for contaminants are: clean working areas, visual inspection at each step of the process, and effective cleaning at critical process steps. Specific methods suggested include the detection of loose particles by a precap visual inspection, by preseal and post-seal electrical testing, and by a particle impact noise test.

Prior to the storage, the loaded cask was subjected to extensive thermal benchmark tests. The cask was opened to examine the fuel for degradation and to determine if it was suitable for extended storage. No rod breaches had occurred and no visible degradation or crud/oxide spallation were observed. Twelve rods {{were removed from the}} center of the T 11 assembly and shipped from INEEL to the Argonne-West HFEF for profilometric scans. Four of these rods were punctured to determine the fission gas release from the fuel matrix and internal pressure in the rods. Three of the four rods were cut into five segments each, then shipped to the Argonne-East AGHCF for detailed examination. The test plan calls for metallographic examination of six samples from two of the rods, microhardness and hydrogen content measurements at or near the six metallographic sample locations, tensile testing of six samples from the two rods, and thermal creep testing of eight samples from the two rods to determine the extent of residual creep life. The results from the profilometry (12 rods), gas release measurements (4 rods), metallographic examinations (2 samples from 1 rod), and microhardness and hydrogen content characterization (2 samples from 1 rod) are reported here. The tensile and creep studies are just starting and will be reported at a later date, along with the additional characterization work to be performed. Although only limited prestorage characterization is available, a number of preliminary conclusions can be drawn based on comparison with characterization of Florida Power Turkey Point rods of a similar vintage. Based on this comparison, it appears that little or no cladding thermal creep and fission gas release from the fuel pellets occurred during the thermal benchmark tests or storage. Measurements of the cladding outer-diameter, oxide thickness and wall thickness are in the expected range for cladding of the Surry exposure. The measured hydrogen content is consistent with the oxide thickness. The volume of hydrides varies azimuthally around the cladding, but there is little variation across the thickness, of the cladding. It is most significant that all of the hydrides appear to have retained the circumferential orientation typical of prestorage PWR fuel rods...|$|E
40|$|Black liquors are {{presently}} combusted in recovery boilers where the inorganic cooking chemicals are recovered {{and the energy}} in the organic material is converted to steam and electricity. A new technology, developed by Chemrec AB, is black liquor gasification (BLG). BLG has more to offer compared to the recovery boiler process, in terms of on-site generation of electric power, liquid fuel and process chemicals. A prerequisite for both optimization of existing processes and the commercialization of BLG is {{better understanding of the}} physical and chemical processes involved including interactions with the refractory lining. The chemistry in the BLG process is very complex and to minimize extensive and expensive time-consuming studies otherwise required accurate and reliable model descriptions are needed for a full understanding of most chemical and physical processes as well as for up-scaling of the new BLG processes. However, by using these calculated model results in practice, the errors {{in the state of the}} art thermochemical data have to be considered. An extensive literature review was therefore performed to update the data needed for unary, binary and higher order systems. The results from the review reviled that there is a significant range of uncertainty for several condensed phases and a few gas species. This resulted in experimental re-determinations of the binary phase diagrams sodium carbonate-sodium sulfide (Na 2 CO 3 -Na 2 S) and sodium sulfate-sodium sulfide (Na 2 SO 4 -Na 2 S) using High Temperature Microscopy (HTM), High Temperature X-ray Diffraction (HT-XRD) and Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). For the Na 2 CO 3 -Na 2 S system, measurements were carried out in <b>dry</b> <b>inert</b> <b>atmosphere</b> at temperatures from 25 to 1200 °C. To examine the influence of pure CO 2 atmosphere on the melting behavior, HTM experiments in the same temperature interval were made. The results include re-determination of liquidus curves, in the Na 2 CO 3 rich area, melting points of the pure components as well as determination of the extent of the solid solution, Na 2 CO 3 (ss), area. The thermal stability of Na 2 SO 3 was studied and the binary phase diagram Na 2 SO 4 -Na 2 S was re-determined. The results indicate that Na 2 SO 3 can exist for a short time up to 750 °C, before it melts. It was also proved that a solid/solid transformation, not reported earlier, occurs at 675 ± 10 °C. At around 700 °C, Na 2 SO 3 gradually breaks down within a few hours, to finally form the solid phases Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 S. From HTM measurements a metastable phase diagram including Na 2 SO 3, as well as an equilibrium phase diagram have been constructed for the binary system Na 2 SO 4 -Na 2 S. Improved data on Na 2 S was experimentally obtained by using solid-state EMF measurements. The equilibrium constant for Na 2 S(s) was determined to be log Kf(Na 2 S(s)) (± 0. 05) = 216. 28 – 4750 (T/K) – 1 – 28. 28878 ln (T/K). Gibbs energy of formation for Na 2 S(s) was obtained as ΔfG°(Na 2 S(s)) /(kJ mol– 1) (± 1. 0) = 90. 9 – 4. 1407 (T/K) + 0. 5415849 (T/K) ln (T/K). The standard enthalpy of formation of Na 2 S(s) was evaluated to be ΔfH°(Na 2 S(s), 298. 15 K) /(kJ mol– 1) (± 1. 0) = – 369. 0. The standard entropy was evaluated to be S°(Na 2 S(s), 298. 15 K) /(J mol– 1 K– 1) (± 2. 0) = 97. 0. Analyses of used refractory material from the Chemrec gasifier were also performed in order to elucidate the stability of the refractory lining. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed that the chemical attack was limited to 250 - 300 μm, of the surface directly exposed to the gasification atmosphere and the smelt.

The sorption of the large ACENE- 4 molecule with relatively low ionization potential (6. 97 eV) occurs in Brnsted acidic HnZSM- 5 zeolites according to a complex and slow reaction sequence including protonation, charge separation, hole transfer, and charge recombination while ACENE- 4 is incorporated as an intact molecule in nonacidic NanZSM- 5. After a long organization period, ACENE- 4 lies in the straight channel in front of sodium cation in close proximity of Al framework atom as simulated by Monte Carlo calculations. The multivariate curve resolution (MCR) analysis of the huge DRUVv spectra set recorded during the ACENE- 4 sorption course in acidic HnZSM- 5 resolved successfully the specific absorption spectra and respective concentrations of all species as function of time. HACENE- 4 +@Hn- 1 ZSM- 5 - protonated species and ACENE- 4 +@HnZSM- 5 - radical pair are generated in the first steps of sorption while a long-lived ACENE- 4 @HnZSM- 5 -+ electron-hole pair is formed through hole transfer and recombines slowly to ACENE- 4 @HnZSM- 5 without any protonation. Two-dimensional hyperfine-sublevel correlation (2 D-HYSCORE) experiments reveal the structural surroundings of the unpaired electrons through the proper assignment of unpaired electron couplings with 1 H, 29 Si, and 27 Al nuclei.

First, charge separation occurs and t -St •+ @H 2. 2 -GaZSM- 5 •− radical pair is created, while long-lived t -St@H 2. 2 GaZSM- 5 •−•+ electron−hole pair is formed through hole transfer. The analysis of the DRUVv spectra set recorded during the t-St sorption course shows the respective concentrations of all transient species {{as a function of}} time. In particular, note that system reorganization is observed through a second type of electron−hole pair. The broad and strong bands observed in the near-IR regions over extended periods of time are tentatively assigned to the electron and/or hole spectral signatures in slightly different environments. Applying pulsed X-band EPR techniques, we were able to reveal the structural surrounding of the unpaired electrons of charge-separated states through the proper assignment of electron couplings with a large number of nuclei such as 1 H, 29 Si, 69 Ga, and 71 Ga using the two-dimensional hyperfine-sublevel correlation experiment (2 D-HYSCORE). The distance measurements deduced from dipolar coupling experiments provide a unique picture of the long distance distribution of unpaired electrons generated by spontaneous ionization of t -St upon incorporation within H 2. 2 -GaZSM- 5 zeolite. This result demonstrates that a large fraction of the unpaired electrons are ejected away from the initial site of ionization and that this compartmentalization plus the created electrostatic field hinder dramatically the propensity of charge recombination.

The following recommendations were made: • Process trials/functional testing should be conducted to determine whether printed wiring assemblies with surface mount pitch component pitches greater than 25 mil and no BGA/CSP component types are suitable for reflow soldering with an no <b>inert</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> • Process trials/functional testing should be conducted to determine whether printed wiring assemblie...|$|R
