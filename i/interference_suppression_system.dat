40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> aspects for DS/CDMA (Direct Sequence / Code Division Multiple Access) LEO (Low Earth Orbit) {{satellite}} communication systems. The interference of other users represents {{a serious problem}} for LEO satellite CDMA systems. The application of <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>systems</b> is a promising approach to mitigate the multiuser problem. With the concentration on the forward link the user has no information about the other users and so a blind algorithm is needed. Furthermore, due to {{the movement of the}} satellite the user’s constellation in a beam varies and therefore an adaptive algorithm must be implemented. In this paper three blind adaptive interference algorithms are applied to a LEO satellite communication system and their performance is compared. The LMS (Least Mean Squares) detector has a good performance compared to the conventional receiver, aside from having a slower convergence. The AS-LMS (Adaptive Step Size Least Mean Squares) algorithm is based on the LMS detector with an adaptive step-size. Its adaptation rate is improved and also in the steady state it performs better than the LMS. The best performance was that of the RLS (Recursive Least Squares) algorithm, however, this method requires an increased processing power...|$|R

40|$|Direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{wireless}} networks {{form the}} physical {{layer of the}} current generation of mobile networks and are anticipated to {{play a key role in}} the next generation of mobile networks. The improvements in capacity, data-rates and robustness that these networks provide come at the cost of increasingly complex <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> and resource allocation. Consequently, efficient approaches to these tasks are essential if the current rate of progression in mobile technology is to be sustained. In this thesis, linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) techniques for <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> and resource allocation in DS-CDMA and cooperative MIMO networks are considered and a set of novel and efficient algorithms proposed. Firstly, set-membership (SM) reduced-rank techniques for <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> in DS-CDMA <b>systems</b> are investigated. The principles of SM filtering are applied to the adaptation of the projection matrix and reduced-rank filter in reduced-rank signal processing based on the method of joint iterative optimisation (JIO) of adaptive filters. The sparse updates and optimised step-sizes that form the basis of SM schemes are introduced to JIO in order to improve its convergence and complexity whilst maintaining its use of low-dimensionality filters. An analysis of the proposed schemes confirms their stability and establishes bounds on their performance. Through simulation in a DS-CDMA system, the proposed schemes are shown to outperform the existing JIO and reduced-rank schemes whilst achieving a significant reduction in computational complexity. Secondly, resource allocation in multi-relay cooperative MIMO systems is addressed. Jointly operating iterative discrete stochastic algorithms (DSAs) are utilised to form a low-complexity transmit diversity selection (TDS) scheme which is optimised by a parallel relay selection (RS) procedure. The proposed scheme is shown to converge to the optimal exhaustive solution of the combinatorial TDS problem and enhance the performance of existing <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> methods. RS based on a DSA is then extended to continuous adaptive power allocation to form a joint discrete-continuous optimisation procedure that augments conventional iterative MMSE power allocation. Lastly, an investigation into the use of bidirectional MMSE algorithms for <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> in DS-CDMA <b>systems</b> operating over severely fading channels is presented. The correlation present, even in fast fading environments, between 3 or more successive channel coefficients is exploited to enable improved reception and multiuser <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> (MUI) without tracking of the faded or unfaded symbols. A set of adaptive mixing parameters is introduced to optimise the weighting of the correlation information from the considered channel coefficients in order to improve convergence and steady-state performance. An analysis of the proposed schemes is presented and the mechanisms behind their improved performance established. Accompanying signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) analysis also provides analytical performance curves. The proposed schemes are compared to existing schemes and are shown to provide improved tracking and robustness, both in conventional and cooperative DS-CDMA networks.

40|$|Most {{recent efforts}} on blind channel {{estimation}} and <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> for CDMA <b>systems</b> {{have concentrated on}} Direct-Sequence CDMA employing linear modulation (e. g., BPSK). Several existing CDMA systems however, {{do not conform to}} the above model as they employ orthogonal (rather than linear) modulation. For example, the reverse channel of the 15 - 95 cellular system employs 64 -ary Walsh orthogonal modulation as a means of expanding the signal's bandwidth. Unfortunately, orthogonal modulation destroys the linear, time invariant property of the baseband equivalent overall channel model and severely limits the applicability of common linear blind equalization techniques. In this paper, the structure of the Walsh codes is exploited in order to derive chip-rate receivers and channel estimation algorithms. It turns out that a partial pilot signal may be identified in the Walsh code structure, casting the problem as a semi-blind channel estimation task. Based on this observation, batch and adaptive methods are derived to identify the chip-rate channel. The design of optimal receivers based on the channel estimates is also studied...|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} blind {{adaptive}} reduced-rank scheme and constrained constant-modulus (CCM) adaptive algorithms for <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> in wireless communications systems. The proposed scheme and algorithms {{are based on}} a two-stage processing framework that consists of a transformation matrix that performs dimensionality reduction followed by a reduced-rank estimator. The complex structure of the transformation matrix of existing methods motivates the development of a blind adaptive reduced-rank constrained (BARC) scheme along with a low-complexity reduced-rank decomposition. The proposed BARC scheme and a reduced-rank decomposition based on the concept of joint interpolation, switched decimation and reduced-rank estimation subject to a set of constraints are then detailed. The proposed set of constraints ensures that the multi-path components of the channel are combined prior to dimensionality reduction. In order to cost-effectively design the BARC scheme, we develop low-complexity decimation techniques, stochastic gradient and recursive least squares reduced-rank estimation algorithms. A model-order selection algorithm for adjusting the length of the estimators is devised along with techniques for determining the required number of switching branches to attain a predefined performance. An analysis of the convergence properties and issues of the proposed optimization and algorithms is carried out, and the key features of the optimization problem are discussed. We consider the application of the proposed algorithms to <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> in DS-CDMA <b>systems.</b> The results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the best known reduced-rank schemes, while requiring lower complexity.

The MIMO GD-DTR combines the complementary advantages of both the JD-GRAKE and the MIMO D-DTR. It suppresses the interference, and takes into consideration the imperfect channel state information at the receiver. Our results show that the performance of the discrete-time version of the MIMO JD-GRAKE could be worse than a conventional RAKE receiver, when there are channel estimation errors in the system, whereas proposed MIMO GD-DTR provides gains up to 1. 7 dB at a bit error rate of 10 − 2 in 3 transmit 3 receive antenna system (3 × 3). 1...|$|R
