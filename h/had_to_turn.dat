5|$|Early {{the next}} morning, September 3, the North Koreans heavily {{attacked}} Check's men {{in an effort}} to regain the ridge. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire barrages, and an air strike directed from the battalion command post, met this attack. Part of the battalion <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> and fight toward its rear. After the attack had been repulsed hundreds of North Korean lay dead around the battalion position. A prisoner estimated that during September 2 and 3 the four North Korean battalions fighting Check's battalion had lost 1,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson died in Brooklyn of {{apoplexy}} {{at the age}} of 49. Initially {{buried in}} the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, he was later reinterred in Cypress Hills Cemetery, also in the borough of Brooklyn.

Eventually, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> people away.|$|E

5|$|To the {{attacker}}s' surprise, Voss {{did not try}} {{to escape}} the aerial trap. Instead, he flicked his triplane about in a flat spin and fired at his attackers in a headon firing pass, holing McCudden's wings. Voss riddled Cronyn's SE.5 from close range, putting him out of the dogfight. Cronyn <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> in under his attacker and throw his aircraft into a spin to escape being killed. His wingmates attacked Voss while Cronyn also limped for home.|$|E
5|$|After spring thaw in 1852, {{the elderly}} Buffalo, Oshaga, Armstrong, and four others {{set out from}} La Pointe for Washington, D.C. by birch bark canoe. Along the way, they stopped in towns and mining camps along the Michigan shore of Lake Superior, {{securing}} hundreds of signatures in support of their cause. At Sault Ste. Marie, they were held by the US Indian agent, who told them that no unauthorized Ojibwa delegations could go to Washington and they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back. The men pleaded the urgency of their case and traveled to Detroit by steamship. There another Indian agent tried to stop them. Once allowed to proceed, they sailed through Lake Erie to Buffalo, New York {{and then on to}} Albany and New York City.|$|E
5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire loomed, Brazil <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay which pitted its political parties against one another. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. Brazil's progressive cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War. The dictator of nearby Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the Uruguayan situation in late 1864 by attempting to establish his nation as a regional power. In November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War, and then invaded Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the recall}} process, Republican George Rivera {{announced}} his candidacy for Giron's senate seat. Rivera {{was planning to}} run against Giron in the 2014 elections but stated he would put {{his name on the}} ballot during the recall process. Rivera <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> in a petition with 1,000 signatures in order to qualify to be on the ballot and turned in 1,500 signatures on July 26. Sonia Negrete Winn, a Democrat, also sought to be on the ballot to replace Giron, but failed to obtain the required signatures to be a candidate. In Morse's district, Republican Bernie Herpin announced his interest in replacing Morse and submitted sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{opposition}} from the two SS panzer divisions in the area {{proved to be a}} critical factor not only in preventing the British 1st Airborne Division from holding the Rhine Bridge at Arnhem, but also imposed serious delays on the capture of the bridges at Nijmegen by the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the advance of the armoured units of the British XXX Corps. For SHAEF, the outcome meant that attention <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> to the Battle of the Scheldt to open the approaches to Antwerp and to building up resources for an invasion of Germany in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Schoemann {{patrolled the}} Skagerrak to inspect neutral {{shipping}} for contraband goods in October. The ship attempted {{to lay a}} minefield off the British coast {{on the night of}} 12/13 November, with two of her sisters, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back after she and Z6 Theodor Riedel suffered machinery breakdowns. She made another attempt on the night of 18 December to mine the Humber estuary, together with two other destroyers, but the German ships had to abandon the sortie when they could not pinpoint their location with the required degree of precision. While patrolling in the Jade estuary on 23 December, she collided with her sister Z15 Erich Steinbrinck in a heavy fog. Hermann Schoemann covered minelaying sorties in January and February 1940, but spent most of March under repair for machinery problems.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, McEntire {{starred in}} Is There Life Out There?, a {{television}} movie {{based on her}} song of the same name. The following year, she appeared in Buffalo Girls, which was based upon the life of western cowgirl, Calamity Jane (played by Anjelica Huston). Playing Jane's friend, Annie Oakley, Buffalo Girls was nominated for an Emmy award. In 1996, McEntire was cast by director James Cameron as Molly Brown in his film Titanic. However, when it became apparent production for the film would extend well beyond its original length, McEntire <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> down the part, as she had already scheduled prior concert engagements. The role was recast with Kathy Bates. In 1998, she starred as Lizzie Brooks in Forever Love, which was based upon McEntire's hit single of the same name.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, the WannaCry {{ransomware}} attack {{spread through}} the Internet, using an exploit vector named EternalBlue, which was leaked from the U.S. National Security Agency. The ransomware attack, unprecedented in scale, infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, using 20 different languages to demand money from users using Bitcoin cryptocurrency. WannaCrypt demanded US$300 per computer. The attack affected Telefónica and several other large companies in Spain, as well as parts of the British National Health Service (NHS), where at least 16 hospitals <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> away patients or cancel scheduled operations, FedEx, Deutsche Bahn, Honda, Renault, {{as well as the}} Russian Interior Ministry and Russian telecom MegaFon. The attackers gave their victims a 7-day deadline from the day their computers got infected, after which the encrypted files would be deleted.|$|E
5|$|In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under Gustaf Otto Stenbock put to sea, but sailed {{no further}} than Stora Karlsö off Gotland before it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back to Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, {{and the loss of}} vital equipment. Stenbock, held {{personally}} responsible for the failure by King Charles XI, was forced to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, who attempted to put to sea in January to February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.|$|E

5|$|James Chadwick {{was born}} in Bollington, Cheshire, on 20 October 1891, the first child of John Joseph Chadwick, a cotton spinner, and Anne Mary Knowles, a {{domestic}} servant. He was named James after his paternal grandfather. In 1895, his parents moved to Manchester, leaving him {{in the care of}} his maternal grandparents. He went to Bollington Cross Primary School, and was offered a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School, which his family <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> down as they could not afford the small fees that still had to be paid. Instead he attended the Central Grammar School for Boys in Manchester, rejoining his parents there. He now had two younger brothers, Harry and Hubert; a sister had died in infancy. At the age of 16, he sat two examinations for university scholarships, and won both of them.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, he would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E

5|$|Marlborough now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> his {{attention}} from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, {{in and around the}} walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.|$|E
5|$|Phraates III {{was assassinated}} by his sons Orodes II of Parthia and Mithridates III of Parthia, after which Orodes turned on Mithridates, {{forcing him to}} flee from Media to Roman Syria. Aulus Gabinius, the Roman proconsul of Syria, marched in support of Mithridates to the Euphrates, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back to aid Ptolemy XII Auletes (r.80–58; 55–51BC) against a {{rebellion}} in Egypt. Despite losing his Roman support, Mithridates managed to conquer Babylonia, and minted coins at Seleucia until 54BC. In that year, Orodes' general, known only as Surena after his noble family's clan name, recaptured Seleucia, and Mithridates was executed.|$|E
5|$|The Beagle now {{sailed to}} {{southern}} Patagonia, and on 19 April an expedition including FitzRoy and Darwin {{set off to}} take boats {{as far as possible}} up the Santa Cruz river, with all involved taking turn in teams dragging the boats upstream. The river cut through a series of rises then plateaux forming wide plains covered with shells and shingle, and Darwin discussed with FitzRoy his interpretation that these terraces had been shores that had gradually raised in accordance with Lyell's theories. Several of the smaller rheas were seen in the distance, but were too elusive to catch. The expedition approached the Andes but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back.|$|E
