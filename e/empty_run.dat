50|$|Buses when {{late may}} {{experience}} a problem known as bus bunching. On some bus lines {{with a more}} frequent service, if one bus falls behind schedule passenger numbers waiting at bus stops may grow, required a longer layover time. One or more subsequent buses on the published schedule may pass these already cleared stops and have a nearly <b>empty</b> <b>run,</b> and may actually jump ahead of their scheduled time {{to the point that}} two or more buses are within close sight of one another. In some cases, one bus is able to pass another. This phenomenon is sometimes known as clumping or bunching. When this occurs, the even spacing of buses on the schedule may be severely disrupted, leading to extremely long waits for those attempting to catch a bus, and multiple buses arriving at once. Bus bunching serves to reduce the effectiveness of buses as a transport mode.|$|E

A preliminary calculation of the efficiency of its usage has allowed to confirm the main advantages of this scheme over the existing one as follows: reducing the required number of transport for the needs of open-pit mine operation by increasing the productivity of mining trucks; decreasing the transport operating costs (some part of an empty truck movement occurs when the engine is switched off); dropping the probability of accidents (reduced a number of the counter transport maneuvers). The calculation showed the regularity of changes in the efficiency using the alternative scheme in relation to the basic one, which reflecting significantly higher effectiveness in situations with a smaller distance between the <b>empty</b> <b>run</b> sites of the ring scheme...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{fragmentation}} of Russian transport industry, its effectiveness has decreased, unproductive downtime {{and the number of}} <b>empty</b> <b>runs</b> have increased. Increased loading delays lead to a number of negative consequences. First and foremost, it is inefficient and insufficient use of modern fuel-efficient vehicles due to the high fixed cost ratio in total cost (the majority of the carriers rely on used vehicles; average vehicle age in Russia exceeds 10 years). Secondly, short <b>empty</b> <b>runs</b> on the route are impractical (about 20 % of total vehicle mileage consist of <b>empty</b> <b>runs).</b> The dependence of fixed and variable costs from vehicle age has been analyzed. The influence of load and unload time on the choice of a vehicle with regard to the transportation distance has been determined. The effect of the load/unload time reduction, including energy efficiency, has been calculated. The proposals for normative regulation of time for loading and unloading are suggested...|$|R

After landing in a somewhat non-nominal way on the cometary nucleus of 67 /P, Philae carried out its First Science Sequence. As part of these activities COSAC acquired seven mass-spectra in sniffing mode, the first while still flying, the other at the final landing site. In addition, since drilling of a soil sample was attempted at the final site, a combined GC-MS measurement {{was performed on the}} sample transferred to COSAC. In the MS measurement made after the first touch- down a wide range of mass peaks was observed. These are ascribed to a variety of organic compounds, quite a few of them oxygen and nitrogen bearing species. However, no sulfur compounds were detected. The following six MS sniffings showed peaks of decreasing signal intensity mostly, but not completely, following the temperature drop pertaining aboard Philae. The results of the GC-MS measurement were, if at all, only marginally different from an <b>empty</b> <b>run</b> performed by COSAC in April 2014 when Rosetta was still far from the comet.

40|$|The main aim of {{transport}} stakeholders {{has always been}} to transport freight efficiently, as this efficiency contributes to the growth and success of their business. A country like Namibia is no different as the efficiency {{of transport}} lies in the effective utilisation of carrier capacity in any direction. Due to the various types of freight, transport operators rarely have the capacity to cover all freight movement requests. This research put the <b>empty</b> <b>runs</b> experienced by most of the Namibian transporters at 33 %. <b>Empty</b> <b>runs</b> could however be reduced through collaboration and sharing of capacity among transport stakeholders. Multi-agent systems (MAS) are various individual computer agents that are configured independently to interact with other agents to achieve one goal.

40|$|In the New Zealand {{transport}} sector, the Owner-Operator is {{an indispensable}} part of Logistics industry. Most couriers and road freight companies Owner-Operators as independent contractors for delivery service. Hence, the vehicle utilization of Owner-Operators might directly influence the profitability and service quality of couriers companies {{as well as}} their personal incomes. With respect to the inefficient vehicle utilization, it normally represents as underutilized capacities of part-load shipments, empty movements or idle time. In conducting the qualitative research, the researcher has interviewed thirty respondents who consist of Owner-Operators and Operations team staff. According to the relevant qualitative data, the research found that the inefficient activities, such as <b>empty</b> <b>run,</b> unpaired shipments and part load shipments are principally caused by unsteady delivery frequency, lack of business acquisition opportunities and small time window. These causes provide mobile technology with a significant potential to enhance the vehicle efficiency. A Logistical Mobile Application, which is installed in a smart phone or portable electronic devices, offers a cost-effective and real-time information exchange platform between customers and service providers. From the perspectives of respondents, Owner-Operators believe that the mobile app is a new trend of integrating the functions of scanner, GPS and pager. Furthermore, around ninety percent of them perceive that it is a useful tool for improving the vehicle utilization and incomes. However, although the respondents have relatively positive attitudes on this new technology and business model, there are some constraints of its practical effect, due to the boundary and policy of the companies, as well as the population density of New Zealand.

The main energy resource sawmill is electricity, so the energy costs reduction, ie Optimization is especially important for more efficient wood-working company's work. Tasks: •	• the object of study and individual devices electricity parameters recording; •	• operating modes specific to individual device settings; •	• Analysis of the data collected; •	• Identify optimization solutions for facilities improvement and operating modes for reducing electricity consumption, electricity use is likely to pay back for energy efficiency measures, as well as determine which efficiency improvement measures is not worth applying for a long payback. Research and analysis In order to apply appropriate optimization solutions necessary to realize continuous recording of electrical parameters. Electrical parameters for registration included several measuring instruments - portable network analyzer and created electrical parameter monitoring system. After the installation work and electricity consumption monitoring and following an analysis of the data collected was set sawmill equipment characteristics: • high start-up current equipment; • frequent start-up and braking,; • permanent installation work when there is no strain on the motors nominal power; • engine work idle mode -For the very high reactive power consumption and low power factor; • inefficient lighting system. Summary of Results 1. 	A large starting currents reduction {{of one of the most}} effective and quickest return on a machine tool is an electric motor control system, the start-up time of changing the motor winding connection to the star circuit, while routine work using a triangle by the winding circuit, as recent work by the engine develops maximum power and torque. 2. 	No fully loaded motor is running and the engine idle mode increases the reactive energy consumption - for reactive power compensation equipment installation. For maximum benefits and least cost, reactive power compensation device uses only the largest electricity consumers, as well as engines for a long time working in idle mode. 3.

Those factors are likely to lower the emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants on German roads. The only negative consequence of the freight toll system detected thus far has been the rerouting of some trucks off the motorways onto other roads, resulting in additional noise and congestion on those routes.
