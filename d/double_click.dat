Some X11 clients deal with accessibility issues better than others, so persons with accessibility problems are not locked out of using X11. However, there is no accessibility standard or accessibility guidelines for X11. Within the X11 standards process there is no working group on accessibility, however, accessibility needs are being addressed by software projects to provide these features on top of X.|$|E

[...] Three more background images were also added.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{structure}} of calls emitted by the echolocating fruit bat Rousettus leschenaulti (Megachiroptera: Pteropodidae) while flying inside a free-flight room. The echolocation sounds consists of both single as well as <b>double</b> <b>clicks,</b> with single clicks emitted either in the beginning or {{at the end of}} click sequences. The duration of clicks was brief, about 1. 6 ms and most of the acoustic energy is between 18 to 32 kHz. The use of simple, brief impulsive clicks and the reduction of interpulse interval and duration, when approaching the sides of the walls suggest that they have a good capability of obstacle avoidance as similar to microchiropteran bats. Furthermore, the production of both single as well as <b>double</b> <b>clicks</b> like cave swiftlets in orientation flights has an implication for the evolution of echolocation in bats...|$|R
