2500|$|In June 2007, Chabot {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to block federally funded road building in Tongass National Forest. Proponents of the amendment said that the federal timber program in Tongass is a <b>dead</b> <b>loss</b> for taxpayers, costing some $30 million annually, and noted that the Forest Service faces an estimated $900 million road maintenance backlog in the forest. Supporters of the bipartisan amendment included the Republicans for Environmental Protection. Of the bill, Representative Chabot said [...] "I am not opposed to logging when it's done on the timber company's dime...But in this case, they are using the American taxpayer to subsidize these 200 jobs at the tune of $200,000 per job. That just makes no sense".|$|E

The piston generates electricity on both strokes, reducing piston <b>dead</b> <b>losses.</b> The generator operates on a two-stroke cycle, using hydraulically activated exhaust poppet valves, gasoline direct injection and electronically operated valves. The engine is easily modified to operate under various fuels including hydrogen, natural gas, ethanol, gasoline and diesel. A two-cylinder FPEG is inherently balanced.|$|R

40|$|Efficiency of an {{ultra-low}} {{power energy}} harvesting dc-dc converter {{depends on its}} losses and the power consumption of the control circuit. Unlike other loss mechanisms, <b>losses</b> related to <b>dead</b> times have not been thoroughly studied. Therefore, in most cases these losses are not adequately suppressed. This paper investigates <b>dead</b> time <b>losses</b> {{and their impact on}} the overall system efficiency. Simple expressions for fast estimation of <b>dead</b> time <b>losses</b> are derived. Analysis shows that in many applications where high voltage conversions are required, such as implantable biosensors, the efficiency reduction due to these losses can easily exceed 2 %. The analysis is validated using an adaptive dead time circuit which minimizes the associated losses and improves the overall system efficiency according to the calculated values.

40|$|Every {{radiation}} counting system {{exhibits a}} characteristic pulse resolving time (dead time) that {{is related to}} the time required to individual detected events.

40|$|The routine way of {{anticipating the}} effects of the {{corporate}} (profit) tax on investments and location choice is to calculate the effective marginal and average tax rates. This paper introduces a model of monopolistic competition to show how investment on the extensive and intensive margins responds to changes in the effective marginal and average tax rates. Intensive investment reflects the marginal expansion of established businesses. Extensive investment refers to the location of new production sites and reflects the choice between exports and foreign direct investments as alternative strategies of foreign market access. The paper calculates the comparative static effects of the corporate tax and shows how the <b>dead</b> weight <b>loss</b> of the tax depends on the elasticities of extensive and intensive investments.

40|$|Corporate {{taxation}} {{can play}} an important role in a firm's choice of organizational form by changing the relative attractiveness of incorporating. Recent general equilibrium models have shown that with substantial shifting between corporate and noncorporate activity in response to taxation, the <b>dead</b> weight <b>loss</b> of the corporate income tax can be very high. This paper tests the empirical importance of this idea by estimating the impact of taxes on the noncorporate share of capital for various sectors using data from 1900 - 1939 [...] a period of large and frequent changes in both corporate and personal tax rates. The results indicate that taxes do matter for organizational form decisions but the magnitude of the effect is small. An increase in the corporate rate of. 10 raises the noncorporate share of capital between. 2 and 3 percentage points. At this magnitude, the <b>dead</b> weight <b>loss</b> of the corporate income tax is less than 10 % of revenue. JEL Classification: Keywords...|$|R
