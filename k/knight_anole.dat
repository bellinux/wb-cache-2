50|$|Many anoles {{are between}} eight and 18 cm (3-7 in) in length. Some larger species, {{such as the}} <b>knight</b> <b>anole,</b> can surpass 12 in; some males of the <b>knight</b> <b>anole</b> species can even reach 20 in in length.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Knight</b> <b>anole</b> (Anolis equestris) is {{a species}} of lizard in the Polychrotidae family, and the largest species of anole. Other common names include Cuban <b>knight</b> <b>anole.</b> It grows to a length of 13 to 20 in (33 to 51 cm) {{including}} the tail. A few specimens have reached up to 24 in (61 cm).|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the spatial relationships of terrestrial lizards, but arboreal species remain poorly studiedbecause they are difficult to observe. The conventional view of home-range size and overlap among territorial, polygynous species of lizards is that: (1) male home ranges are larger than those of females; (2) male home ranges usually encompass, or substantiallyoverlap, those of several females; and (3) male home-range overlap varies but often is minimal, but female home ranges frequently overlap extensively. However, the paucity of pertinent studies {{makes it difficult to}} generalize these patterns to arboreal lizards. Weinvestigated home-range size and overlap in the arboreal <b>Knight</b> <b>Anole,</b> Anolis equestris, and compared our findings to published home-range data for 15 other species of Anolis. Using radiotelemetry and mark-recapture/resight techniques, we analyzed the home rangesof individuals from an introduced population of Knight Anoles in Miami, Florida. The home ranges of both sexes substantially overlapped those of the same- and different-sex individuals. In addition, male and female home ranges did not differ significantly, an unusual observation among lizard species. If one compares both male and female home ranges to those of other Anolis species, Knight Anoles have significantly larger home ranges, except for two species for which statistical comparisons were not possible. Our results suggest that home ranges and sex-specific spatial arrangements of canopy lizards may differ from those of more terrestrial species...|$|E
50|$|<b>Knight</b> <b>anoles</b> are {{arboreal}} although {{during the}} day are known to warm on asphalt, rocks, or sidewalks. These lizards are diurnal predators.|$|R
50|$|<b>Knight</b> <b>anoles</b> {{are native}} to Cuba, {{but have been}} widely {{introduced}} into South Florida, where they reproduce and spread readily. They cannot withstand freezing temperatures; in winter freezes in South Florida, they drop semiconscious from tree canopies. In its native Cuba, this large anole is called chipojo.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Knight</b> <b>anoles</b> are {{fiercely}} territorial, {{and will}} initially turn to face almost any perceived threat, if {{only from a}} distance. During its challenge display, a lizard will sit high on all fours, gape menacingly, turn green, and perhaps bob its head. The male will extend its dewlap (a reddish-white flap underneath the chin), and both females and males will [...] "puff themselves up" [...] with air.|$|R
