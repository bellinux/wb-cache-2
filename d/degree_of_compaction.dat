Furthermore, an empirical relationship between Ed and applied cyclic stress (σd) is developed that incorporates density and moisture variations. Three different evolution types of PPS with number of load cycles, plastic stable, plastic creep, and incremental collapse, are identified as the increase of moisture content. In addition, the critical dynamic stress (σdc) separating stable and unstable deformation is determined based on the shakedown concept.

40|$|AbstractSystems {{and methods}} are {{described}} for monitoring {{temporal and spatial}} moisture content changes in clay embankments using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) imaging. The methodology is based upon development of a robust relationship between fill resistivity and moisture content and its use in the transformation of resistivity image differences in terms of relative moisture content changes. Moisture level and moisture content movement applications are exemplified using two case histories from the UK. The first is the BIONICS embankment, near Newcastle (NE England), which was constructed in 2005 using varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> a medium plasticity sandy, silty clay derived from the Durham Till. The second is a Victorian embankment south of Nottingham (Central England), constructed in 1897 using end tipping of Late Triassic siltstone and mudstone taken from local cuttings. Climate change forecasts for the UK suggest that transportation earthworks will be subjected to more sustained, higher temperatures and increased intensity of rainfall. Within the context of preventative geotechnical asset maintenance, ERT imaging can provide a monitoring framework to manage moisture movement and identify failure trigger conditions within embankments, thus supporting on demand inspection scheduling and low cost early interventions...|$|R
50|$|The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> of a soil can be {{measured}} by its dry unit weight, γd. When water {{is added to the}} soil, it functions as a softening agent on the soil particles, causing them to slide between one another more easily. At first, the dry unit weight after compaction increases as the moisture content (ω) increases, but after the optimum moisture content (ωopt) percentage is exceeded, any added water will result in a reduction in dry unit weight because the pore water pressure (pressure of water in-between each soil particle) will be pushing the soil particles apart, decreasing the friction between them.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} <b>of</b> soil <b>compaction</b> in timber skidding {{was carried}} out on two skid trails of uniform slope – 15 %and 30 %. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>compaction</b> is shown by changes of water-air soil characteristics of the skid trail after {{a certain number of}} passes of a loaded skidder and by comparison between these values and the characteristics of untreaded soil during research. The research {{was carried out}} in winter conditions at low air and soil temperatures and with the research site covered with snow. Multiple passes of a loaded skidder affect the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>compaction.</b> The result <b>of</b> soil <b>compaction</b> is the decrease of momentary moisture content, porosity and soil water capacity, as well as the increase of native bulk density. Soil compaction is higher if the soil is not frozen. Due to low air temperatures and disappearance of snow from wheel ruts during skidding, the rut soil gets frozen more easily during the night than the untreaded soil. Soil compaction during the day does not cause squeezing out of water from soil micropores and consequently its freezing enlarges the volume of micropores and increases soil porosity and soil water capacity and decreases its native bulk density...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} model sandy soils {{in the form}} of silica particle compacts under dynamic compression (0. 2 – 10. 0 Hz) is reported. The solid content ranges from 24 to 28 % by volume, as controlled by compaction. Both viscous and elastic characters are largely governed by the solid part of the compact. The elastic character stems from the stiffness of the silica, while the viscous character stems from the interparticle movement. The elastic character of the solid part (the storage modulus and solid content) is essentially independent of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> indicating validity of the rule of mixtures. The viscous character of the solid part (the loss tangent and solid content) decreases with increasing <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> indicating decreasing ease of interparticle movement as the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> increases. The loss modulus and solid content is essentially independent of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction.</b> All quantities decrease with increasing frequency. A low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> is recommended for fast decay of the vibration amplitude; no particular <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> is recommended for mechanical energy dissipation.

However, discussions of the area's overcrowded neighborhoods, its health problems, and the destruction of its green areas have inspired self-examination with respect to the compact city paradigm. High population density attracts even more residents and frequently renders the existing urban green space (UGS) insufficient for use as part of a living environment. Due to the unique benefits that these qualities confer, UGS allocation is now considered a significant contributing factor to urban livability.

Protein kinase activity in these fractions {{was measured by}} using both endogenous and exogenous myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrates. In both cases, less compact myelin fractions possessed higher levels of protein kinase activity than the compact myelin fraction. In addition, the specific activity of phosphorylated basic protein was greater in the loosely compacted fractions than in compact multilamellar myelin. When basic protein in compact myelin or the myelin fractions was phosphorylated by the endogenous kinase, approximately 70 % of the [32 P]phosphate was incorporated at a single site, identified as Ser- 102. The remaining 30 % was found in three other minor sites. Electron microscopy of less compact myelin showed it was composed of fewer lamellae which correlated with a relative decrease {{in the proportion of}} cationic charge isomers (microheteromers) when MBP was subjected to gel electrophoresis at alkaline pH. The shift in charge microheterogeneity of basic protein to the less cationic isomers in the less compact myelin fractions correlated with an increase in protein kinase activity and a greater specific activity of phosphorylated basic protein.
