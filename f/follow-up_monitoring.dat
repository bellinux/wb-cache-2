Most major companies offer devices with wireless capabilities that communicate automatically with home transmitters, which then relay data to the physician, thereby allowing remote patient <b>follow-up</b> and <b>monitoring.</b> These systems are being widely used in the USA for remote follow-up, and have been more recently introduced in Europe, where their adoption is increasing.

50|$|Although much early {{research}} was done using film cameras, the widespread application of gait analysis to humans with pathological {{conditions such as}} cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, and neuromuscular disorders, began in the 1970s with the availability of video camera systems that could produce detailed studies of individual patients within realistic cost and time constraints. The development of treatment regimes, often involving orthopaedic surgery, based on gait analysis results, advanced significantly in the 1980s. Many leading orthopaedic hospitals worldwide now have gait labs that are routinely used to design treatment plans and for <b>follow-up</b> <b>monitoring.</b>|$|E
50|$|Phase III Environmental Site Assessment is an {{investigation}} involving remediation of a site. Phase III investigations aim to delineate the physical extent of contamination based on recommendations made in Phase II assessments. Phase III investigations may involve intensive testing, sampling, and monitoring, “fate and transport” studies and other modeling, {{and the design}} of feasibility studies for remediation and remedial plans. This study normally involves assessment of alternative cleanup methods, costs and logistics. The associated reportage details the steps taken to perform site cleanup and the <b>follow-up</b> <b>monitoring</b> for residual contaminants.|$|E

50|$|Ke Kama Pono - A Safe House {{program that}} {{services}} {{a maximum of}} 12 adjudicated youth, ages 13-17, for {{six to nine months}} with <b>follow-up</b> <b>monitoring</b> by the program for three years. On site classes are held by DOE certified teachers in order to assist the youth in maintaining school credits. Additionally, the residents take part in monthly team meetings with case managers, probation officers, and parent/guardians to evaluate resident treatment and service plans. The Ke Kama Pono program embeds Native Hawaiian values throughout its activities, functions, and mentorships. Residents work three times a week at the Mountain View Dairy, and twice a week they engage in activities at the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Weekend activities vary from outdoor recreation to performing community service. The emphasis on parent and family involvement is an important aspect of the program. Parent/guardians are required to attend monthly parenting classes which help to ensure a successful family reunification process. The Safe House program differs from many other residential programs because of the holistic approach in addressing all areas of need of the residents, including their family dynamics.|$|E

40|$|A broad {{overview}} is presented {{of the economic}} and technological aspects of Indonesian milkfish (Chanos chanos) aquaculture covering information on the economic importance of milkfish, fry capture and distribution, milkfish grow-out system, economics of production, and milkfish marketing and distribution. In Indonesia, milkfish is regarded as a high value food item. Because of various constraints to high milkfish yield, Indonesian milkfish ponds are still grossly underutilized. As a consequence, these constraints and the resulting present low per hectare yield level {{would not be able to}} support the government s drive toward self-sufficiency in fish in the near future. Understanding socioeconomics of milkfish production such as the attitudes of producers toward present low yield and the reasons why they are not using more inputs is of importance. Government assistance should not be narrowly focused on production alone but should also encompass organized marketing and distribution involving as much as possible the private sector in moving the fish, and continuous <b>follow-up</b> <b>monitor</b> progress of government projects...|$|R
40|$|Meningeal melanocytoma is {{a benign}} lesion arising from leptomeningeal melanocytes {{that at times}} can mimic its {{malignant}} counterpart, melanoma. Lesions of the spine usually occur in extramedullary locations and present with spinal cord compression symptoms. Because most reported spinal cases occur in the thoracic region, these symptoms usually include lower extremity weakness or numbness. The authors present a case of primary intrame­dullary spinal meningeal melanocytoma presenting with bilateral lower extremity symptoms in which the patient had no known supratentorial primary lesions. Gross total surgical resection allowed for full recovery, but early recurrence of tumor was detected on close <b>follow-up</b> <b>monitoring,</b> allowing for elective local radiation without loss of neurological function. Case reports of such tumors discuss different treatment strategies, but just as important is the close <b>follow-up</b> <b>monitoring</b> in these patients even after gross total surgical resection, since these tumors can recur...|$|E

40|$|The "knee-jerk" {{implementation}} of curriculum without study, understanding, proper implementation, and <b>follow-up</b> <b>monitor</b> cannot assure a purposeful addition to educational programs. This {{research was conducted}} to assess {{the effectiveness of a}} new course (Co-Op Management Applications, or CMA) added to the curriculum at a higher-education level. Course effectiveness was assessed from all stakeholders' perspectives; students, sector representatives, school administration, and instructors. Data were collected through questionnaires and interview schedules and subjected to quantitative (descriptive) and qualitative (content) analysis. The findings show that a representative "needs assessment, facility analysis, and force field analysis" was not conducted during the course development and implementation. Further, the proper monitor of student assessment was not being conducted. It is apparent that a meaningful work experience was being imparted to the students. Early monitor and evaluation could have potentially assured that the students benefited and achieved the course intentions before going forward. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an effort to predict relapse by <b>follow-up</b> <b>monitoring</b> of MRD and {{subsequently}} to begin the treatment of the patients during their clinical and hematological remission prior to overt hematological relapse. Expression of WT 1 in AM Lis known to be independently associated with significant inferior response to therapy and short survival outcome. <b>Follow-up</b> <b>monitoring</b> of WT 1 gene expression during or after therapy would be a valuable predictive marker for early recurrence or relapse of AMLdisease. This pilot study evaluated newly diagnosed and post-induction or consolidation chemotherapy of AMLpatients who were registered with the Oncology Clinics of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. High WT 1 burden (3 ̆e 5000 copies/ml) in 2 patients was indicative of early recurrence of the disease along with shorter disease-free and overall survival.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the issues of organization of long-term <b>follow-up</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the patient population in real clinical practice. Every medical intervention is analyzed from the position of positive evidence of its effectiveness, safety and clinical-economic benefits. Although randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard of evidence-based medicine, they feature a range of drawbacks; in some cases, such trials are infeasible are extremely complicated to perform due to certain aspects. Along with that, results of RCTs may not completely correlate with clinical practice. Thus, a register – a system of long-term clinical monitoring of a patient population – is a significant source of information on effectiveness and safety of medical interventions. This tool of follow-up observation of a patient’s condition is irreplaceable in medicine, particularly, in allergology both for epidemiological purposes and to assess effectiveness and safety of therapeutic interventions: e. g., use of IgE antibodies – biopharmaceutical omalizumab. Keywords: register, long-term <b>follow-up</b> <b>monitoring</b> system, effectiveness, safety, uncontrolled severe persisting bronchial asthma, omalizumab, children. </p...|$|E
