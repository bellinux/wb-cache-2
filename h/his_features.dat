5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason <b>his</b> <b>features,</b> though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a {{favorite}} subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that coined the term McCarthyism appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1953, the popular daily comic strip Pogo introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing <b>his</b> <b>features.</b> The explanation was that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{skin was}} a medium-brown color {{throughout}} his youth; however, {{starting in the}} mid 1980s, his skin gradually grew paler, which was partly due to vitiligo, but also widely considered {{to be due to}} skin bleaching and changing of <b>his</b> <b>features</b> to appear white. According to Jackson's biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli, in 1984, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, which Taraborrelli stated was sometimes considered by doctors to be a consequence of damage done by bleaching chemicals over the years. However, vitiligo is a rare non-contagious disease; the causes are not known, but a range of genetic, auto-immune, and environmental factors are suspected {{to play a role in}} this disease. Between 1% and 2% of the world population is considered to be affected. The depigmentation occurs in patches and affects all ethnic/racial groups equally.|$|E

5|$|Arriving {{back in the}} wilderness, {{the trio}} sets up camp when Snatchers find and chase them down. Hermione strikes Harry with a curse to {{disguise}} <b>his</b> <b>features</b> as the Snatchers take them all to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione for information on how they got the sword of Gryffindor, which Bellatrix claims was in her vault at Gringott's. Harry requests help, communicating {{with a piece of}} broken mirror in his possession. Dobby apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. Dobby drops a chandelier above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby. Harry insists that they bury Dobby properly without any magic, which they all agree to do.|$|E
25|$|Robert Emmet is {{described}} as slight in person; <b>his</b> <b>features</b> were regular, his forehead high, his eyes bright and full of expression, his nose sharp, thin, and straight, {{the lower part of}} his face slightly pock-marked, his complexion sallow.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Ion Luca {{was known}} as Ioanne L. Caragiali. His family and friends knew him as Iancu or, rarely, Iancuţu—both being antiquated hypocoristics of Ion. The {{definitive}} full version of <b>his</b> <b>features</b> the syllable ca twice in a row, which is generally avoided in Romanian due to its scatological connotations. It has however {{become one of the}} few cacophonies accepted by the Romanian Academy.|$|E
25|$|Demetrius II issued only {{silver and}} mostly tetradrachms, another trait {{which he has}} {{in common with the}} last Bactrian kings. The obverse shows a diademed portrait, with a {{standing}} Pallas Athene holding a spear on the reverse. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he has no epithet. Demetrius II is depicted as a young man, though <b>his</b> <b>features</b> differ considerably among the different issues. Several coins are struck off-center and crudely; this suggests that Demetrius II used a number of temporary mints.|$|E
25|$|Bader {{had been}} pushing for more sorties to fly in late 1941 but his Wing was tired. He was intent on adding to his score, which, {{according}} to the CO of No. 616 Squadron RAF Billy Burton, brought the other pilots and mood in his wing to a near-mutinous state. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, Bader's immediate superior as OC No. 11 Group, Fighter Command, relented and allowed Bader to continue frequent missions over France even though his score of 20 and the accompanying strain evident on <b>his</b> <b>features</b> obliged Leigh-Mallory to consider his withdrawal from operations. Ultimately, Leigh-Mallory {{did not want to}} upset his star pilot, and did not invoke any restrictions.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, he {{achieved}} his international breakthrough with Zombi 2, a violent zombie film that was marketed in European territories as {{a sequel to}} George Romero's Dawn of the Dead/ Zombi (1978). He followed it up with several other horror films, also featuring zombies, which were popular horror film trope of the time. <b>His</b> <b>features</b> released from 1979 through 1983 (most of them scripted by famed Italian screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti) were described by some critics as being among the most violent and gory films ever made. City of the Living Dead (1980), The Beyond (1981), The House by the Cemetery (1981), The Black Cat (1981), The New York Ripper (1982) and Manhattan Baby (1982) were among his biggest hits, {{all of which were}} noted for their extreme content and amount of gore.|$|E
500|$|George Finlayson, a {{representative}} of the British government who visited Gia Định in 1822, described Duyệt as a man who liked to dress plainly, almost {{in a manner similar to}} his peasant constituents. Finlayson said that Duyệt [...] "has an intelligent look, and may be esteemed to possess considerable activity both of mind and body: his face is round and soft, <b>his</b> <b>features</b> flabby and wrinkled; he has no beard, and bears considerable resemblance to an old woman: his voice, too, is shrill and feminine." ...|$|E
500|$|In the zoomorphic form, Varaha {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a free-standing boar colossus, for example, the monolithic sculpture of Varaha in Khajuraho (c. 900-925) made in sandstone, is [...] long and [...] high. The sculpture may not resemble a boar realistically, and may have <b>his</b> <b>features</b> altered for stylistic purposes. The earth, personified as the goddess Bhudevi, clings to one of Varaha's tusks. Often the colossus is decorated by miniature figurines of gods and goddesses and other world creatures appearing all over his body, which signify the whole of creation. Such sculptures are found in Eran, Muradpur, Badoh, Gwalior, Jhansi and Apasadh.|$|E

500|$|Léal Souvenir (also {{known as}} Timotheus or Portrait of a Man) {{is a small}} 1432 oil-on-oak panel {{portrait}} by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. The sitter has not been identified, but his highly individual features suggest a historical person rather than the hypothetical ideal usual {{at the time in}} northern Renaissance portraiture; his slight and unassuming torso is contrasted with a sophisticated facial expression. <b>His</b> <b>features</b> have been described as [...] "plain and rustic", yet thoughtful and inward-looking. A number of art historians, including Erwin Panofsky, have detected mournfulness in his expression. The sitter was apparently significant enough a member of the Burgundian duke Philip the Good's circle that his court painter portrayed him.|$|E
500|$|The {{remains were}} {{immediately}} prepared for burial and were brought down from Chicago {{on the train}} leaving there Saturday afternoon. [...] The Illinois Central railroad very kindly furnished two private cars {{for the use of}} the family and friends.

Halliday lay in a handsome cloth covered metallic casket, and throngs of people passed through the rooms Sunday and Monday to gaze once more upon <b>his</b> <b>features.</b> [...] His illness had left its traces on his face, which looked thin and haggard. [...] Profuse floral pieces surrounded the casket, and the life-size oil painting of the deceased, which hung at the head of the casket, was draped heavily in mourning.|$|E
500|$|Macdonald (1815–91) was {{the first}} Prime Minister of Canada, in office 1867–73, and again 1878–91. [...] Brown depicts the Prime Minister {{in the role of}} scheming villain and caricatures <b>his</b> <b>features</b> in an absurd manner, giving him an {{extremely}} oversized nose and showing him as a drunk. [...] He is a man of ambitions and will not let anyone {{stand in the way of}} his legacy. [...] In the appendix, however, Brown discloses that he does not see Macdonald as the villain he has portrayed in the book. [...] Brown's distrust of big government leads him to push the conspiracy theory side of the story to Macdonald's detriment, but, in the end, he states that he [...] "would rather have lived in a state run by John A. Macdonald than one run by Louis Riel".|$|E

500|$|In Tokyo, a weak, unassertive {{boy named}} Sena Kobayakawa enters {{the high school}} of his choiceDeimon Private Senior High School. Sena's only {{remarkable}} physical abilities are his running speed and agility, which are noted by the school's American football team captain Yoichi Hiruma. Hiruma forces Sena to join the Deimon Devil Bats football team as its running back. To protect his identity from other teams who want to recruit him, Sena is forced to publicly {{assume the role of}} team secretary and enter the field under the pseudonym of [...] "Eyeshield 21" [...] wearing a helmet with an eyeshield to hide <b>his</b> <b>features.</b> The makeshift team initially takes part in the spring football tournament hoping to win through the strength of their new [...] "secret weapon". However, the extremely weak team is eliminated early by the Ojo White Knights, one of the best football teams in Japan.|$|E
500|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{lips are}} thin and tightly pursed {{and his mouth}} is broad and down-turned, yet <b>his</b> <b>features</b> are those of a {{handsome}} man. Marcel Brion described him as appearing [...] "mild and thoughtful", an impression reinforced by the uncomplicated design of the painting. This view {{is reinforced by the}} relative drabness or simplicity of his clothes, which seem intended to convey a reserved, ascetic piousness. Dürer presents his father more like a low-ranking [...] ecclesiastic than a tradesman: a calm, considerate and straightforward man dressed up in his best, albeit modest, clothes. After his father's death in 1502, Dürer wrote that Albrecht the Elder [...] "passed his life in great toil and stern hard labour, having nothing for his support save what he earned with his hand for himself, his wife and his children... He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him... he was also of few words, and was a God-fearing man." ...|$|E
500|$|But {{where he}} will be missed the most will be among {{those people who have}} been sharers of his bounty. [...] Their name is legion. [...] He gave quietly, but he gave liberally. [...] It was true of him that he did not let his right hand know what his left hand did. [...] Very {{frequently}} the recipient of his bounty could only guess from whence the gift came. [...] He aided the needy in distress in thousands of ways. [...] He seemed to have some occult way of finding out that people needed assistance at certain times, and then he knew how to come to their aid without offending. [...] Hundreds whom the public would never dream had needed his assistance blessed his name as they gazed upon <b>his</b> <b>features</b> for the last time, because he came to them in a substantial way at a critical time. [...] This is where and by whom he will be missed the most. [...] Truly he was a great man.|$|E
