2500|$|In 2007, Michael said he {{had hidden}} the fact he was gay because of worries over what effect it might have on his mother. In 2009 Michael said: [...] "My {{depression}} {{at the end of}} Wham! was because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to realize I was gay, not bisexual." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two of the theatre's stars {{provided}} {{inspiration for}} the young singer. [...] "Watching the art of Nezhdanova and Sobinov ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to realize {{for the first time}} that even great masters, in order to elevate their character to peaks of expressiveness have to expose their inner exaltation in the most stark, transparent ways; that hidden riches of an artist's inner world should come hand in hand with economy in outward movement", she wrote in autobiography.|$|E
2500|$|According to Loveless, [...] "...I {{learned so}} much about what to feel in a song from those years of playing those clubs. I was saddened {{sometimes}} because I thought 'I left Nashville, I left all that for this? What happened to me? What is wrong with me?' But I think what was happening was that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to find... me. Find who I really was. And {{what kind of person}} I was inside and out. I still believe to this day it happened the way it was supposed to happen.|$|E

"Perhaps {{you will}} think, Mary, from my telling you all this, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to change my}} mind about him, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to think that there}} is {{something}} more in him than in others, and that it will all come out some day. But it would be a mistake; what I have always thought I think still." ...|$|R
50|$|People {{often ask}} why I fish, and after seventy-odd years, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to understand.|$|R
60|$|What {{does it all}} mean? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to wonder}} if my long habit of life amongst the insane <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> to tell upon my own brain.|$|R
2500|$|While {{living in}} Israel, his views of Zionism changed. He writes that, he [...] "was disillusioned personally, disillusioned at the {{institutionalized}} racism, disillusioned at what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to learn about}} Zionism's cruelties. The principal interest Israel had in Jews from Islamic countries was as a supply of cheap labor, especially for the farm work that was beneath the urbanized Eastern European Jews. Ben-Gurion needed the [...] "Oriental" [...] Jews to farm the {{thousands of acres of}} land left by Palestinians who were driven out by Israeli forces in 1948".|$|E
2500|$|Beatles guitarist George Harrison {{described}} {{the song in}} 1969 as [...] "one of those instant whistle-along tunes which some people hate, and other people really like. It's a fun song, but it's kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher, and then, finally, the judge." [...] Lennon described it as [...] "more of Paul's granny music". In 1994, McCartney said that the song merely epitomises the downfalls of life, being [...] "my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue, as it so often does, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to find out {{at that time in}} my life. I wanted something symbolic of that, so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer. I don't know why it was silver, it just sounded better than Maxwell's hammer. It was needed for scanning. We still use that expression now when something unexpected happens." ...|$|E
60|$|One day, {{just before}} I ate midday dinner, after my morning's writing was done, when I had no guest, I took a {{cocktail}} by myself. Thereafter, {{when there were}} no guests, I took this daily pre-dinner cocktail. And right there John Barleycorn had me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to drink regularly. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to drink alone. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to drink, not for hospitality's sake, not {{for the sake of the}} taste, but for the effect of the drink.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she said, [...] "I feel <b>I</b> <b>am</b> being rather {{generous in}} trying to help you, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to rather like you myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is too late. The man must marry whom he pleases. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to wonder that anybody should ever want to get married. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Craig's in Mexico, right enough," [...] he {{answered}} savagely, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to feel that}} I could fetch him back out of hell!" ...|$|R
60|$|She shivered, {{but she did}} {{not answer}} me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to feel impatient.|$|E
60|$|I gave it him. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to {{understand}} why I had not been kept very long waiting.|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. Pussy, you'll make me horribly conceited. Just when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to feel so humble, too.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do not feel," [...] {{continued}} Kilbright, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> a new life, {{but that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> taking up my old {{one at the}} point where I left it off." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to {{feel more}} and more the woman's artful depth, but yet I did not really doubt her.|$|E
60|$|I turned round {{sharply and}} {{caught him in}} the act of {{inspecting}} my labels. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> now to lose my temper.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you've come, have you, Amateur? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to think}} you'd struck a {{business}} rush, and I shouldn't see you before to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] he remarked, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to {{like your}} uncle. Great idea of his, sending us off here {{directly}} after breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has seen}} {{no signs of}} them, so we can light a fire and get {{something}} to eat. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to feel <b>I</b> want something badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All's {{well that}} ends well, my dear," [...] he said. [...] "But upon my word <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to wish that <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> {{content with the}} humble profits of horse-breeding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Umph!" [...] {{said the}} Prince; [...] "I {{have heard a}} good deal about the English girl. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to think it exaggerated. Stand up." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to remind}} her that to-day was Wednesday, when she checked me with her former {{impatient}} movement of the fingers of her right hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to deplore my folly {{at having}} cut myself adrift from my {{followers}} {{in the first}} place, and having embroiled myself with the soldiers in the second; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to contemplate the wisdom of seeking some outhouse of this mansion wherein to lie until morning, when of a sudden a broad shaft of light, coming {{from one of the}} windows on the first floor, fell athwart the courtyard. Instinctively I crouched back into the shadow of my friendly buttress, and looked up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Myra," [...] Nat said, [...] "we will {{investigate}} {{the contents of}} the basket. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to get as hungry as a hunter, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure that you must be so too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course! It <b>is</b> because <b>I</b> believe--it <b>is</b> too ridiculous--but <b>I</b> {{believe that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in your {{position}} with the circumstances reversed. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to care in the most foolish way for an unmistakable Englishman." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Even if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> free,' he {{continued}} to think, 'we should only grow apart, Helena and I. She would leave me. This time <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> the laggard. She is young and vigorous; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to set.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to {{understand}} what pushes me into painting - the love of seeing and the fact as the chosen subject grows in beauty, so it becomes more elusive.|$|R
60|$|After six weeks' confinement, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> to {{walk across}} the room. They have been six horrible weeks; anguish and low spirits made me unfit to read, write, or think.|$|R
