60|$|Joe {{found the}} jib-halyard and cast {{it off the}} pin, and, as the canvas fluttered down, came in hand over hand on the <b>downhaul.</b>|$|E
60|$|The cap at the {{mainmast}} {{head was}} broken out, and sheet and <b>downhaul</b> pulled flat, amid a scattering rifle {{fire from the}} boats; and the Mary Rebecca lay over and sprang ahead faster than ever.|$|E
6000|$|I ran {{forward and}} had the <b>downhaul</b> of the flying jib all in and fast as we slipped by the boat a hundred feet to leeward. The three men in it gazed at us suspiciously. They had been hogging the sea, and they knew Wolf Larsen, by {{reputation}} at any rate. I noted that the hunter, a huge Scandinavian sitting in the bow, held his rifle, ready to hand, across his knees. It {{should have been in}} its proper place in the rack. When they came opposite our stern, Wolf Larsen greeted them with a wave of the hand, and cried: ...|$|E

50|$|The Kite is a one-design planing dingy, self-bailing, easy righting for 2 {{people or}} as a single-handler. Planes easily. Well made, sturdy, with boom vang, out- and <b>downhauls</b> for sail control, not a board boat like a Laser or Sunfish.|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} see {{a danger to the}} ship. The jibs I speedily doused and brought {{tumbling}} to the deck; but the mainsail was a harder matter. Of course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I thought this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I half feared to meddle. At last I got my knife and cut the halyards. The peak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water; and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the <b>downhaul,</b> that was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, the Hispaniola must trust to luck, like myself.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{helmsman}} {{shouted and}} Marston felt {{one side of}} his face and body cool. The loose canvas flapped noisily. Its folds shook out and swelled, and Marston seized a rope. His skin prickled; he felt a strange tension and a feverish desire to drag down the sticking gaff. A few moments afterwards, something flickered behind the sail and a peal of thunder drowned the noise on board. When it died away, rolling hull, slanted masts, and the figures of the men stood out, wonderfully sharp, against a dazzling blaze that vanished and left bewildering dark. The next peal of thunder deafened Marston, who thought Wyndham shouted but heard no words. This did not matter, because he knew they must secure the sail before the tornado broke, and he pulled at the <b>downhaul.</b> He could not hear the wind for the thunder, but it had begun to blow.|$|E
6000|$|As this occurred, I {{heard the}} cheers of the seamen; and Marble, {{shouting}} out to [...] "revenge Captain Williams," [...] {{gave the order}} to charge. I soon had my own fellow perfectly at my mercy, and got him so {{near the end of}} the jib <b>downhaul,</b> as to secure him with a turn or two of that rope. The man made little resistance, after the first onset; and, catching up the pistols, I left him, to join in what was doing aft. As I lay on the deck, I heard several plunges into the water, and then half-a-dozen of most cruelly crushing blows succeeded. Not a shot was fired by either party, though some of our people, who had carried all their arms below the night the ship was seized, used their pikes with savage freedom. By the time I got as far aft as the main-mast, the vessel was our own. Nearly half the Indians had thrown themselves into the sea; the remaining dozen had either been knocked in the head like beeves, or were stuck, like so many porkers. The dead bodies followed the living into the sea. Old Smudge alone remained, at the moment of which I have spoken.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{running rigging}} {{for the modern}} junk sail can be divided between the [...] "pull ups" [...] (halyard and topping lift) and the [...] "pull downs" [...] (yard hauling parrel, luff hauling parrel, and sheets). Not shown are {{optional}} <b>downhauls</b> for the yard, battens, and boom.|$|R
60|$|I felt relief, {{at least}} as far as the two men were concerned. It was clear he did not wish to run too far away from them. I picked up hope at the thought and put the order swiftly into execution. I had {{scarcely}} opened my mouth to issue the necessary commands, when eager men were springing to halyards and <b>downhauls,</b> and others were racing aloft. This eagerness on their part was noted by Wolf Larsen with a grim smile.|$|R
5000|$|Shaping - Barber haulers adjust a spinnaker/jib {{sheeting}} angle inboard {{at right}} angles to the sheet with a ring or clip on the sheet attached to cordage which is secured and adjusted via fairlead and cam cleat. Kicking straps/boom vangs control a boom-footed sail's leech tension by exerting downward force mid-boom. Cunninghams tighten the luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling downward on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. <b>Downhauls</b> lower a sail or a yard and can adjust the tension on the luff of a sail. [...] Outhauls control the foot tension of a boom-footed sail.|$|R
5000|$|... the batten <b>downhaul,</b> whose {{function}} is to assist lowering the junk sail {{in addition to the}} yard <b>downhaul.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a windsurfing rig, the <b>downhaul</b> is {{the primary}} {{load-bearing}} line which controls the sail's shape. Modern windsurfing sails incorporate a sleeve for the mast, and therefore {{do not have a}} halyard which tensions the top of the sail. The <b>downhaul</b> is tensioned early in the rigging process and is generally not adjustable on the water, and is therefore rather different in use than the <b>downhaul</b> on a sailboat.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>downhaul</b> may be {{attached}} to the boom near the gooseneck to pull the boom down and increase tension on the luff (forward edge) of the sail. If no <b>downhaul</b> is present, the gooseneck is usually fixed vertically to the mast and a cunningham may be used to control luff tension.|$|E
50|$|Emergency furling is {{fast and}} simple. When {{the sheets and}} halyard are let go, the sail will blow down wind, drop into the cradle of the topping lifts, while being steadied by the full battens. While this is fast and easy, it will also make a mess of the halyards, boom hauling parrel, yard hauling parrel, and <b>downhauls.</b> They {{will have to be}} put in order before raising the sail again. For non-emergency furling, it is {{preferable}} to drop the sail with two crew so that the slackening lines can be hauled in and maintained in order. Alternatively, a single-handed sailor can lower the sail in stages and attend to the slack lines.|$|R
50|$|Moveable {{lines that}} control sails or other {{equipment}} are known collectively as a vessel's running rigging. Lines that raise sails are called halyards while those that strike them are called <b>downhauls.</b> Lines that adjust (trim) the sails are called sheets. These are {{often referred to}} using {{the name of the}} sail they control (such as main sheet, or jib sheet). Sail trim may also be controlled with smaller lines attached to the forward section of a boom such as a cunningham; a line used to hold the boom down is called a vang, or a kicker in the United Kingdom. A topping lift is used to hold a boom up in the absence of sail tension. Guys are used to control the ends of other spars such as spinnaker poles.|$|R
50|$|Raising {{the junk}} sail {{is done by}} easing the sheets until the furled sail is blown down wind. This will take the {{pressure}} off the sail and ease the raising. Then {{it is important to}} watch the lines that will run in while the sail is raised, including the gaff hauling parrel, luff hauling parrel, the <b>downhauls</b> if equipped, and the sheets. Hauling the sail with a 3:1 or 4:1 purchase will ease the burden, but the length of halyard will consequently be very long. The fully battened sail will remain calm in the lee of the mast during the hauling. Due to the weight of a huge canvas sail and its many spars, some junk sailors find a winch is needed for the last few feet. There is probably already a standing tack line in place, so the halyard is hauled until the tack line is taut, although {{there is no need to}} tighten up the leech severely to avoid scallops as in trimming the triangular sails. After hauling and securing the halyard, the fore and aft position of the leech is set by hauling the yard hauling parrel until the halyard is close to the mast. A short pull on the luff hauling parrel may be needed to extend the middle battens toward the leech to control wrinkles in the sail. The last act is to haul the sheets and set the sail to the wind.|$|R
5000|$|The sail is tuned by {{adjusting}} the <b>downhaul</b> and the outhaul tension. Generally, a sail is trimmed more (flatter shape) for stronger winds. More <b>downhaul</b> tension loosens {{the upper part of}} the leech, allowing the top of the sail to twist and [...] "spill" [...] wind during gusts, shifting the center of effort (strictly, the center of pressure) down. Releasing <b>downhaul</b> tension shifts the center of effort up. More outhaul lowers the camber/draft, making the sail flatter and easier to control, but less powerful; less outhaul results in more draft, providing more low-end power, but usually limiting speed by increasing aerodynamic resistance.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>downhaul</b> {{is a line}} {{which is}} part of the rigging on a sailboat; it applies {{downward}} force on a spar or sail. The most common <b>downhaul</b> on a modern sailboat is attached to the spinnaker pole, though this may be referred to as the foreguy in some rigging nomenclature. The term is also commonly applied to the cunningham on the mainsail.|$|E
50|$|A windsurfing sail is {{tensioned}} at two points: at the tack (by <b>downhaul),</b> {{and at the}} clew (by outhaul). There {{is a set of}} pulleys for downhauling at the tack, and a grommet at the clew. Most {{shape is}} given to the sail by applying a very strong <b>downhaul,</b> which by design bends the mast. The outhaul tension is relatively weak, mostly providing leverage for controlling the sail's angle of attack.|$|E

50|$|He skippered {{the first}} victorious 12-metre yacht Columbia in the 1958 America's Cup race, and invented the {{cunningham}} <b>downhaul</b> {{to increase the}} speed of racing sailboats.|$|E
50|$|Mainsail {{controls}} {{permitted by}} the class are <b>downhaul</b> (Cunningham), outhaul and kicking strap (Vang). The Jib tack fixing {{may also be}} adjustable while sailing allowing changes in jib luff tension and tack height.|$|E
50|$|The boat has a 3:1 {{purchase}} <b>downhaul</b> (upgradable to 6:1) {{to tension}} the mainsail and an outhaul (standard 1:1, upgradable to 2:1) to flatten the mainsail along the boom. Both the mainsail and jib are fully battened.|$|E
50|$|In sailing, a {{cunningham}} or cunningham's eye {{is a type}} of <b>downhaul</b> used on a Bermuda rigged sailboat {{to change}} the shape of a sail. It is named after its inventor, Briggs Cunningham, a victorious America's Cup skipper and yacht builder.|$|E
50|$|Columbia was helmed by Cunningham, the {{inventor}} of the cunningham <b>downhaul,</b> with syndicate head Sears as navigator. After defeating Sceptre in the Cup challenge, she went on to a long career competing in the Defender trials for the 1962, 1964, and 1967 America's Cup competitions.|$|E
50|$|The {{variants}} in {{the design}} of the coypu depend on the builder. The hull is normally glass-reinforced plastic construction, with buoyancy tanks on front, sides, and rear. The centreboard is metal, and the rudder is removable, either fixed (i.e. does not have a <b>downhaul)</b> or with a moveable blade.|$|E
5000|$|Downhauls also vary. Original upper vang {{block is}} mounted {{halfway between the}} goose neck and the main sheet block. There is a {{stainless}} bail with a mounting hole bolted to the mast - vang block with built-in cleat can be mounted to it. <b>Downhaul</b> setup offers 3:1 purchase.|$|E
50|$|A special line, the topping lift, {{runs from}} the middle of the {{spinnaker}} pole up to a block on the mast, and is used to support the weight of the spinnaker pole. Another line referred to as the <b>downhaul</b> or foreguy runs down so that the height of the pole is under positive control at all times.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are other}} ways to tack or gybe a lugsail. Some methods use a <b>downhaul</b> to the forward end of the spar so that a sharp {{downward}} tug on the line will pull dip the forward end around the aft side of the mast. Generally the procedure, which may be feasible only on smaller sails, is to: ...|$|E
50|$|Blokarts are raced in {{two classes}} - {{production}} and performance. The production class {{is based on}} the basic blokart design. In the performance class additional parts from the manufacturer are allowed such as carbon fibre mast sections and an aerodynamic shell, adjustable <b>downhaul</b> and modification of the sail battens to alter the shape of the sail. New Blokart components must sanctioned by IBRA before they can be used in racing.|$|E
50|$|The {{cunningham}} {{differs from}} a typical <b>downhaul</b> {{in the way}} that it attaches to the sail. The system usually consists of a line which is secured at one end to the mast or boom below the foot of the mainsail. It is then passed through a cringle in the luff of the sail near the foot, but above the tack, and then led down on the other side to a fitting on the mast or boom or on deck.|$|E
