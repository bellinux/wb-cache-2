5|$|Blas Fajardo Ople (February 3, 1927 – December 14, 2003) was a Filipino {{journalist}} and politician who held several high-ranking {{positions in the}} executive and legislative branches of the Philippine government, including as Senate President from 1999 to 2000, and as Secretary of Foreign Affairs from 2002 until his death. Perceived as a leftist-nationalist {{at the onset of}} his career in public service, Ople was, in his final years, a vocal supporter for allowing a limited United States military presence in the Philippines, and for American initiatives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> including the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror.</b>|$|E
5|$|Predator {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{flew over}} Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa on 8 and 9 July, capturing {{images of the}} deployment of people inside. Security forces had the images taken to study the claims of Ghazi Abdul Rashid regarding casualties and damage caused to Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa. The UAVs flew over Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa {{for more than an}} hour, from 2:40 to 4:00am. Senior government officials and the Security Forces personnel examined the pictures and relayed the information directly to the command post on the ground. The UAV was given to Pakistan by the United States for use <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror.</b> Strategic planning for the assault on the mosque was conducted based on information gathered by the drone. Pakistan deployed several security units to execute the attack on the mosque. These include the Army's 78th Paratrooper Brigade and 111th Infantry Brigade; its elite strike force, the Special Service Group (SSG) Division; the Ninth Wing Company of the Pakistan Army, the Rangers paramilitary force; and the Elite Police squad of the Punjab Police.|$|E

5|$|In October 2004, Tony Blair {{announced}} he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term. Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the 2005 election, which Labour won with a reduced majority and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year. Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; {{he was the only}} candidate spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become Prime Minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and global change. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister; speaking at a Fabian Society conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror</b> as key priorities.|$|E

25|$|An End to al-Qaeda: Destroying Bin Laden's Jihad and Restoring America's Honor is a non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism {{strategies}} towards al-Qaeda, written by U.S. Navy retired cryptology analyst Malcolm Nance.

Nance writes the United States should do much more to engage traditional believers in Islam around the world to denounce al-Qaeda through education and a public relations campaign.|$|E
25|$|War on Terror: Although R's {{contribution}} to the War on Terror is highly classified, the organisation gained some attention in the Western media after claims that it was assisting the United States by providing intelligence on Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban's whereabouts. Maps and photographs of terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan along with other evidence implicating Osama bin Laden in terrorist attacks were given to US intelligence officials. RAW's role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> may increase as US intelligence has indicated that it sees RAW as a more reliable ally than Pakistani intelligence. It has further come to light that a timely tip-off by RAW helped foil a third assassination plot against Pakistan's former President, General Pervez Musharraf.|$|E
