25|$|In April 1971, {{a project}} to install {{high-level}} platforms at stations along the Harlem Line started.

Most of the new platforms were built as island platforms. These cars started entering into service in September 1971. At the same, time reverse signaling was installed to allow trains to use either track in either direction, enabling both tracks to be used in one direction during the peak of the rush hour.|$|E

25|$|On February 8, 1980, Metro-North {{announced}} {{its plan to}} extend electrification to Brewster. Metro-North undertook a project to electrify the territory north of North White Plains to Brewster North (now known as Southeast) in 1984 for $30 million. For $45 million, high-level platforms were installed to reduce <b>dwell</b> <b>times,</b> and electric substations were built to supply the power needed for third-rail operation. The project was started out of dissatisfaction by riders on the line, and Governor Hugh Carey approved the project, owing to the advocacy of commuter organizations. Initially, the work was {{to be completed by}} the end of 1983, but due to a strike, its completion was delayed to 1984. Initially, service was provided with a mixture of new and old electric cars, but these were replaced by the new M3s. Work on the project was completed during off-peak hours to allow for service on the line to be maintained. Thirteen of the stations received new high-level center island platforms. Mount Pleasant station got side platforms, while the station at Thornwood was closed because of excessive curvature of the track, which would have resulted in a large gap between the train and the platform. The new stations received glass-enclosed overpasses and elevators.|$|E
25|$|The {{block system}} handles all control and {{supervision}} of routes through interlockings including switch (point) control and switch status, for broken rail protection, and tracking of trains with failed (or not equipped for) CBTC. CBTC lines are fully track circuited with power frequency, single-rail track circuits. (Broken-rail protection is only guaranteed {{on one of}} the two rails, however.) Equipment aboard every train identifies the location of the train using wayside transponders as a basis. Once the Zone Controller has determined, based on track circuit information and train localization, that the CBTC train is a single discrete train ("sieved"). The Wayside Zone Controller uses this information to grant movement authorities based on conditions ahead. The CBTC Zone Controller functions then as an overlay which only provides safe separation of trains and cannot do so without interaction from the Wasyide (Legacy) Signaling system. Trains, with CBTC, can then operate closer together, although as before, platform <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> and train performance are the true limiting factors in terms of headway performance. With the new system, signals and interlockings are still absolutely required, their job being done better by relay interlockings or Solid State Interlocking controllers. The ATS system at the Control Center is not a vital (life-safety) system and serves only to automate the routing of trains based on the overall timetable. The location of the train is also used to inform passengers of arrival times. The MTA's form of CBTC uses a reduced form of the old fixed-block signaling system, requiring that both be maintained at high cost.|$|E

40|$|The common {{approach}} to estimate bus <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> at a BRT station {{is to apply}} the traditional <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> methodology derived for suburban bus stops. In spite of being sensitive to boarding and alighting passenger numbers {{and to some extent}} towards fare collection media, these traditional <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> models do not account for the platform crowding.

Using the experience from Brisbane busway (BRT) stations, a new variable, Bus Lost Time (LT), is introduced in traditional <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> model. The bus lost time variable captures the impact of passenger walking and platform crowding on bus <b>dwell</b> <b>time.</b> These are two characteristics which differentiate a BRT station from a bus stop.

Thus, a condition for the probability density function (PDF) of the velocity is derived, which prevents an unbounded mean <b>dwell</b> <b>time.</b> Since an infinite mean <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> causes some problems for the estimation of the mobility-related signaling traffic, {{it is important that the}} mean <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> is finite.

They also have wider doors for easier boarding and alighting of passengers in order to reduce <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> in stations. The trains have been built with Bombardier's FICAS technology, giving a thinner bodyshell and hence (along with the larger size) more internal space for passengers. They are the first London Underground trains to be designed since the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations were introduced, so they have more facilities for people with impaired mobility, including multi-purpose areas with tip-up seats and space for wheelchairs and pushchairs, and offset centre door poles for wheelchair access.|$|E
