To understand videogames, {{it is essential to}} understand how their spaces are implicated <b>in</b> play. <b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> asks what are the relationships between play and space <b>in</b> videogames? <b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> examines the relationships between space and play by looking at how architecture is constructed in gamespace and by looking at gamespace as an architectonic construct. <b>In</b> short, <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> examines the architecture in and of gamespace. The relationships between space and play in videogames are examined by looking at the structure of gamespace, by looking at the differences between real space and gamespace and by analysing architectural and spatial functionality. <b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> discovers a series of important relationships between space and play, arguing that gamespace is used to create, manipulate and control gameplay, while gameplay dictates and influences the construction of gamespace.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{automatic}} and robust Cartesian mesh generation method for two-dimensional and three-dimensional flow simulation problems is developed and introduced <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thesis.</b> The new algorithm adopts {{an idea of}} zigzag mapping from computer graphics for terrain generation. Three achievements have been presented <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thesis.</b> A coherent Z-ordering is applied into the grids' topological structure. By deploying this ordering to quadtree/octree, a robust grid navigation algorithm is developed. The algorithm simplifies the grid's navigation procedure, which is usually the most time consuming part in both the grid generation and flow simulation. A binary coding system is developed to mark the grids, instead of using a decimal coding system. Finally, a second-order finite volume scheme is developed based on the analysis of various current schemes. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional schemes are presented <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thesis.</b> Thus, a unique fast Cartesian grid generation method is provided. A finite volume Navier-Stokes flow solver is discussed and applied to refined Cartesian grids presented <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thesis.</b> Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional flow cases are chosen <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> for numerical simulation at various Reynolds numbers. The validity and performance of this Cartesian grid are tested in these flow simulations and results prove that the Cartesian grids presented <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> have very good performance at low Reynolds numbers flows.
