40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} desalination is {{an emerging}} technology {{with a promise}} to considerably reduce environmental impacts associated with traditional desalination technologies such as thermal and reverse osmosis. Various membrane module configurations {{have been reported in}} the literature. The most popular configuration reported in the literature was the direct contact and can be used for both <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> and hollow fiber membranes. The literature study has shown that the bulk of studies involved either <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> or hollow fiber modules separately and no single study involved both configurations in a single research work. This investigation was therefore aimed at comparing the flux performance of <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> and hollow fiber direct contact modules under similar conditions using real seawater from the Qatar coastal area of the Arabian Gulf. Our work has shown that the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> direct contact membrane distillation module gave consistently higher fluxes than the hollow fiber module. The highest flux measured for the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> module at 65 C and 3 L/min was 37. 1 L/m 2. h compared to 5. 2 L/m 2. h for the hollow fiber module under identical experimental conditions. The large difference in flux between the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> module and the hollow fiber module was explained in terms of difference in flow regime and convective heat transport in the flow compartment of the two modules. The flow channel Reynolds numbers ranged between 283 to 770 for the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> module while the Reynolds numbers ranged between 106 to 287 for the hollow fiber module. Our work also indicated that the Nusselt number Nu can be as much as 11 times higher for the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> module than for the hollow fiber. This clearly indicates that the convective heat transfer coefficient in the hot side is much greater in the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> module than in the hollow fiber module. The maximum hot side convective heat transfer coefficient for the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> module was estimated to be 17044 W/m 2. h compared to 2163 W/m 2. h for the hollow fiber module. The values of thermal coefficients obtained in this work were consistent with literature values. The observed salt rejection for all used membranes is above 99. 8 % thus confirming the ability of DCMD desalination to produce very pure water. This work has shown that more work needs to be done in hollow fiber module design to enhance flow turbulence and therefore improve convective thermal coefficients which will lead to higher permeate fluxes.

40|$|The {{membrane}} oxygenator {{is known}} to be superior to the bubble oxygenator, but little information is available about the difference between the hollow fiber and <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> membrane oxygenators with regard to pressure drop, shear stress, and leukocyte activation. In this study, we compared these 2 types of membrane oxygenators in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery with special focus on leukocyte activation and pressure drop across the oxygenators. Plasma concentration of elastase, a marker indicating leukocyte activation, increased to 593 +/- 68 % in the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> oxygenator group versus 197 +/- 42 % in the hollow fiber oxygenator group (p < 0. 01) at the end of CPB compared to their respective baseline concentrations before CPB. Pressure drop across the oxygenator was significantly higher in the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> group than in the hollow fiber group throughout the entire period of CPB (p < 0. 01). High pressure drop across the oxygenator as well as the calculated shear stress was positively correlated with the release of elastase at the end of CPB (r = 0. 760, p < 0. 01, r = 0. 692, p < 0. 01). However, this positive correlation existed in the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> oxygenator but not in the hollow fiber oxygenator. Clinically, both membrane oxygenators have satisfactory performance in O- 2 and CO 2 transfer. These results suggest that a higher pressure drop across the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> oxygenator is associated with more pronounced activation of leukocytes in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass...|$|R

Test results validate the assumption that <b>flat</b> <b>sheets</b> in compression do not significantly contribute to the flexural stiffness of multiwall sandwich for the multiwall geometry tested.

40|$|Folding of <b>flat</b> <b>sheets</b> of {{material}} into intricate three-dimensional structures provides {{a new technology}} for production of cores and sandwich structures of high strength/weight and/or strength/volume ratios. Geometric patterns are generated by transforming <b>flat</b> <b>sheets</b> {{of material}}s (traditional or composite) by imposing a permanent fold at specific edges of tessellated sheets. This might result in new structures with improved mechanical properties and light weight. They are also developed at a cost significantly less that any existing manufacturing process. Folding technology for sheet material is unique {{and one of the}} most efficient shape and structural forming processes. Other production methods such as stretch-drawing, forging, pressing, casting and fabrication may appear to produce three-dimensional patterns that are cosmetically similar but the mechanical properties of the resultant patterns are significantly different. This is particularly so in the case of folding thin sheet materials where variations in sheet thickness and/or mechanical properties are unacceptable. In this paper we present new approaches for sheet folding and investigate the use of sheet folding theory and technology in generating 3 -D intricate engineering designs. We describe the theory of generating different patterns by folding <b>flat</b> <b>sheets</b> of materials. We investigate the effect of the parameters of the pattern in terms of its material type and geometry on its performance measures of the folded patterns.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{possibilities}} of a new capillary nanofiltration membrane (manufactured by Stork/X-Flow, The Netherlands), designed to reduce membrane fouling and thus allowing to omit or reduce the extensive pretreatment usually required {{for the implementation of}} nanofiltration in drinking water production. In the laboratory, the membrane performance (flux decline and flux recovery) during nanofiltration of surface water from the river Dijle, Flanders, Belgium was compared with that of a series of nine commercial <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> membranes. All membranes showed flux decline to some extent. For the capillary membrane, the water flux could, however, easily be increased and maintained at a stable level by a combination of forward flushing and airflushing, which is not possible with the <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> membranes. Furthermore, the water permeability for the capillary membrane was three to 15 times higher than for the commercial <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> membranes, which leads to lower operating pressure and a correspondingly lower energy consumption. For the capillary membrane rejections of organic and inorganic compounds were satisfactory to reach for COD and conductivity standards in one step starting from the Dijle water. Rejections for most <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> membranes were comparable to the rejections obtained with the capillary membrane, but the rejection of ions was usually higher, except for the N 30 F and NF PES 10 membranes (Nadir, Germany). Low ion rejections are advantageous for drinking water production because demineralization is avoided. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
