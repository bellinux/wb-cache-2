5|$|From the {{conflicting}} {{accounts of the}} sources, historians have tried to reconstruct the most likely sequence of {{events leading up to}} the battle. It is probable that Olaf Tryggvason was indeed sailing from Wendland to Norway when he was ambushed, though the kings' sagas probably play up the importance of Thyri and her marriages. While it is possible that Olaf was collecting dowry, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> probable that he was expecting war and seeking allies in Wendland, but met with little success. The character of Sigvaldi remains enigmatic, though there is evidence from skaldic poetry that he did indeed betray Olaf.|$|E
5|$|No-one had {{questioned}} Calvert's conformity at the time, {{and if he}} {{had been}} secretly Catholic, he had hidden it well. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> likely Calvert converted in late 1624. At the time, Simon Stock, a Discalced Carmelite priest reported to the Congregation Propaganda Fide in Rome on 15 November that he had converted two Privy Councillors to Catholicism, one of whom historians are certain was Calvert. Calvert, who had probably met Stock at the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on a plan for a Catholic mission in his new first Newfoundland Colony (off modern Canada).|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{presence}} in Gibraltar began on 27 April 711 when the Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad led the initial incursion into Iberia {{in advance of}} the main Moorish force under the command of Musa ibn Nusayr, Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya. Gibraltar was named after Tariq, who was traditionally said to have landed on the shores of the Rock of Gibraltar, though <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> likely that he landed somewhere nearby. Muslim sources claimed that Tariq established some kind of fortification on the Rock, but no evidence has been found and it is not considered credible. It was not until 1160 that a first fortified settlement was built there.|$|E

5|$|However, the two western towers left of {{the church}} display an unusual detail in the painting. The uniformly proportioned, large, square windows {{depicted}} there {{are associated with the}} Italian Renaissance, which was introduced in Sweden in 1572 during reconstruction of Kalmar Castle. While the construction works of Gustav Vasa are poorly documented, the presence of these windows in Stockholm in 1535 is unlikely. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> credible that this part of the painting had been damaged before 1632, forcing the copyist to rely on another source. As the two square and crenellated towers in the painting are depicted much as they appear on a copperplate of Stockholm produced by Frantz Hogenberg around 1560–1570, the painting thus probably renders this part of the castle as it appeared while the reconstruction was still under way, before its completion in the 1580s.|$|E
5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} spouses for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E

25|$|Cyber Chicken Animation Studio and DQ Entertainment Limited animate {{the series}} in {{traditional}} 2-D. The character designs are kept from the web series, with some changed details; such as cleaner lines and brighter eyes. Despite {{the fact that}} both versions use Adobe Flash to create animation, the television episodes are cleaner-looking. This is probably because the characters and backgrounds in the web episodes were made of overlapping JPEG files, and that the television series has an actual budget. Also, the colors still go outside the outlines, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> like a second outline than messy drawing. Every building was changed; in the web cartoon most buildings were grey, but was changed to different colors for the TV version. Vendetta's house is now dark green and Charlotte's blue.|$|E
25|$|That same year, the Aquileian War of Succession erupted as a {{coalition}} of secular nobles from Udine and surrounding cities sought to remove the newly appointed Patriarch, Philippe II d'Alençon. Fiore seems to have sided with the secular nobility against the Cardinal as in 1383 there is record of him being tasked by the grand council with inspection and maintenance on the artillery pieces defending Udine (including large crossbows and catapults). There are also records of him working variously as a magistrate, peace officer, and agent of the grand council {{during the course of}} 1384, but after that the historical record is silent. The war continued until a new Patriarch was appointed in 1389 and a peace settlement was reached, but it's unclear if Fiore remained involved for the duration. Given that he appears in council records five times in 1384, it would be quite odd for him to be completely unmentioned over the subsequent five years, and since his absence after May 1384 coincides with a proclamation in July of that year demanding that Udine cease hostilities or face harsh repercussions, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>more</b> likely that he moved on.|$|E
