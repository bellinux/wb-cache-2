5|$|Yttrium has {{at least}} 20 {{metastable}} ("excited") isomers ranging in mass number from 78 to 102. Multiple excitation states have been observed for 80Y and 97Y. While most of yttrium's isomers {{are expected to be}} less stable than their ground state, 78mY, 84mY, 85mY, 96mY, 98m1Y, 100mY, and 102mY have longer half-lives than their ground states, as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than <b>isomeric</b> transition.|$|E
5|$|At least 25 {{nuclear isomers}} have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 84 to 104. Within this range, only 96Nb, 101Nb, and 103Nb {{do not have}} isomers. The most stable of niobium's isomers is 93mNb with a {{half-life}} of 16.13years. The least stable isomer is 84mNb with a half-life of 103ns. All of niobium's isomers decay by <b>isomeric</b> transition or beta decay except 92m1Nb, which has a minor electron capture branch.|$|E
5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by <b>isomeric</b> transition with a half-life of 241years, making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E
5|$|Twenty nine {{isotopes}} of protactinium {{are known}} with mass numbers 212–240 {{as well as}} three excited <b>isomeric</b> states. Only 231Pa and 234Pa {{have been found in}} nature. All the isotopes have short lifetime, except for protactinium-231 (half-life 32,760 years). The most important isotopes are 231Pa and 233Pa, which is an intermediate product in obtaining uranium-233 and is the most affordable among artificial isotopes of protactinium. 233Pa has convenient half-life and energy of γ-radiation, and thus was used in most studies of protactinium chemistry. Protactinium-233 is a β-emitter with a half-life of 26.97 days.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{tantalum}} {{consists of}} two isotopes: 180mTa (0.012%) and 181Ta (99.988%). 181Ta is a stable isotope. 180mTa (m denotes a metastable state) is predicted to decay in three ways: <b>isomeric</b> transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, or electron capture to 180Hf. However, radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed, and only a lower limit on its half-life of 2.0×1016years has been set. The ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of only 8 hours. 180mTa is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer (excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides). It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe, {{taking into account the}} elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of 180mTa in the natural mixture of isotopes (and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides).|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of neptunium {{range in}} atomic weight from 225.0339 u (225Np) to 244.068 u (244Np). Most of the isotopes that are {{lighter than the}} most stable one, 237Np, decay primarily by electron capture although a sizable number, most notably 229Np and 230Np, also exhibit various levels of decay via alpha emission to become protactinium. 237Np itself, being the beta-stable isobar of mass number 237, decays almost exclusively by alpha emission into 233Pa, with very rare (occurring only about once in trillions of decays) spontaneous fission and cluster decay (emission of 30Mg to form 207Tl). All of the known isotopes except one that are heavier than this decay exclusively via beta emission. The lone exception, 240mNp, exhibits a rare (>0.12%) decay by <b>isomeric</b> transition {{in addition to the}} beta emission. 237Np eventually decays to form bismuth-209 and thallium-205, unlike most other common heavy nuclei which decay into isotopes of lead. This decay chain is known as the neptunium series. This decay chain had long been extinct on Earth due to the short half-lives of all of its isotopes above bismuth-209, but is now being resurrected thanks to artificial production of neptunium on the tonne scale.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-one {{isotopes}} of actinium {{and eight}} excited <b>isomeric</b> states {{of some of}} its nuclides were identified by 2010. Three isotopes, 225Ac, 227Ac and 228Ac, were found in nature and the others were produced in the laboratory; only the three natural isotopes are used in applications. Actinium-225 {{is a member of the}} radioactive neptunium series; it was first discovered in 1947 as a decay product of uranium-233, it is an α-emitter with a half-life of 10 days. Actinium-225 is less available than actinium-228, but is more promising in radiotracer applications. Actinium-227 (half-life 21.77 years) occurs in all uranium ores, but in small quantities. One gram of uranium (in radioactive equilibrium) contains only 2 gram of 227Ac. Actinium-228 is a member of the radioactive thorium series formed by the decay of 228Ra; it is a β− emitter with a half-life of 6.15 hours. In one tonne of thorium there is 5 gram of 228Ac. It was discovered by Otto Hahn in 1906.|$|E

25|$|In {{the above}} reaction, while {{a mixture of}} <b>isomeric</b> allylic bromide {{products}} are possible, only one is created due to the greater stability of the 4-position radical over the methyl-centered radical.|$|E
25|$|Pure gamma {{emission}} is the desirable {{decay mode}} for medical imaging because other particles deposit more {{energy in the}} patient body (radiation dose) than in the camera. Metastable <b>isomeric</b> transition is the only nuclear decay mode that approaches pure gamma emission.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, Mössbauer spectroscopy has {{an extremely}} fine energy resolution and can detect even subtle {{changes in the}} nuclear environment of the relevant atoms. Typically, there are five types of nuclear interactions that are observed: <b>isomeric</b> shift, chemical shift, quadrupole splitting, hyperfine splitting and Zeeman splitting.|$|E
25|$|Ether {{molecules}} cannot form {{hydrogen bonds}} with each other, resulting in relatively low boiling points {{compared to those}} of the analogous alcohols. The difference in the boiling points of the ethers and their <b>isomeric</b> alcohols becomes lower as the carbon chains become longer, as the van der Waals interactions of the extended carbon chain dominates over the presence of hydrogen bonding.|$|E
25|$|Proteolysis {{does not}} always yield a set of readily analyzable {{peptides}} covering the entire sequence of the POI. The fragmentation of peptides in the mass spectrometer often does not yield ions corresponding to cleavage at each peptide bond. Thus, the deduced sequence for each peptide is not necessarily complete. The standard methods of fragmentation do not distinguish between leucine and isoleucine residues since they are <b>isomeric.</b>|$|E
25|$|In certain cases, {{the excited}} nuclear state {{that follows the}} {{emission}} of a beta particle or other type of excitation, may be more stable than average, and is termed a metastable excited state, if its decay takes (at least) 100 to 1000 times longer than the average 10−12 seconds. Such relatively long-lived excited nuclei are termed nuclear isomers, and their decays are termed <b>isomeric</b> transitions. Such nuclei have half-lifes that are more easily measurable, and rare nuclear isomers are {{able to stay in}} their excited state for minutes, hours, days, or occasionally far longer, before emitting a gamma ray. The process of <b>isomeric</b> transition is therefore similar to any gamma emission, but differs in that it involves the intermediate metastable excited state(s) of the nuclei. Metastable states are often characterized by high nuclear spin, requiring a change in spin of several units or more with gamma decay, instead of a single unit transition that occurs in only 10−12 seconds. The rate of gamma decay is also slowed when the energy of excitation of the nucleus is small.|$|E
25|$|Like nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy probes tiny changes in the energy levels of an atomic nucleus in response to its environment. Typically, three types of nuclear interactions may be observed: an <b>isomeric</b> shift, {{also known as a}} chemical shift; quadrupole splitting; and magnetic splittings due to the Zeeman effect or hyperfine splitting. Due to the high energy and extremely narrow line widths of gamma rays, Mössbauer spectroscopy is a very sensitive technique in terms of energy (and hence frequency) resolution, capable of detecting change in just a few parts per 1011.|$|E
25|$|Acrylamide is {{considered}} a potential occupational carcinogen by U.S. government agencies and classified as a Group 2A carcinogen by the IARC. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set dermal occupational exposure limits at 0.03mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. In animal models, exposure to acrylamide causes tumors in the adrenal glands, thyroid, lungs, and testes. Acrylamide is easily absorbed by the skin and distributed throughout the organism; {{the highest levels of}} acrylamide post-exposure are found in the blood, non-exposed skin, kidneys, liver, testes, and spleen. Acrylamide can metabolically-activated by cytochrome P450 to a genotoxic metabolite, glycidamide, which {{is considered}} to be a critical mode of action to the carcinogenesis of acrylamide. On the other hand, acrylamide and glycidamide can be detoxified via conjugation with glutathione to form acrylamide- and <b>isomeric</b> glycidamide-glutathione conjugates, subsequently metabolized to mercapturic acids and excreted in urine. Acrylamide has also been found to have neurotoxic effects in humans who have been exposed. Animal studies show neurotoxic effects as well as mutations in sperm.|$|E
25|$|The {{wavelengths}} {{at which}} azobenzene isomerization occurs {{depends on the}} particular structure of each azo molecule, but they are typically grouped into three classes: the azobenzene-type molecules, the aminoazobenzenes, and the pseudo-stilbenes. These azos are yellow, orange, and red, respectively, owing to the subtle differences in their electronic absorption spectra. The compounds similar to the unsubstituted azobenzene exhibit a low-intensity n-π* absorption in the visible region, and a much higher intensity π-π* absorption in the ultraviolet. Azos that are ortho- or para-substituted with electron-donating groups (such as aminos), are classified as aminoazobenzenes, and tend to closely spaced n-π* and π-π* bands in the visible. The pseudo-stilbene class is characterized by substituting the 4 and 4' positions of the two azo rings with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (that is, the two {{opposite ends of the}} aromatic system are functionalized). The addition of this push-pull configuration results in a strongly asymmetric electron distribution, which modifies a host of optical properties. In particular, it shifts the absorption spectra of the trans and the cis isomers, so that they effectively overlap. Thus, for these compounds a single wavelength of light in the visible region will induce both the forward and reverse isomerization. Under illumination, these molecules cycle between the two <b>isomeric</b> states.|$|E
500|$|To {{explain the}} {{observed}} ratios of <b>isomeric</b> compounds, the minimum energy principle has been used. In {{the majority of}} cases, it explains that some organic entities have greater abundance than their isomers due to the lower total energies of the first one. However, a few exceptions where the principle fails are also known.|$|E
500|$|The isotope 248Bk {{was first}} {{obtained}} in 1956 by bombarding {{a mixture of}} curium isotopes with 25MeV α-particles. Although its direct detection was hindered by strong signal interference with 245Bk, {{the existence of a}} new isotope was proven by the growth of the decay product 248Cf which had been previously characterized. The half-life of 248Bk was estimated as 23 ± 5 hours, though later 1965 work gave a half-life in excess of 300years (which may be due to an <b>isomeric</b> state). Berkelium-247 was produced during the same year by irradiating 244Cm with alpha-particles: ...|$|E
500|$|The stablest {{artificial}} isotope is indium-111, with a half-life {{of approximately}} 2.8days. All other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 5 hours.

[...] All decay by <b>isomeric</b> transition.

500|$|The Berkeley team, {{consisting}} of Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, John R. Walton and Torbjørn Sikkeland, then claimed {{the synthesis of}} element 102 in 1958. The team used the new heavy-ion linear accelerator (HILAC) to bombard a curium target (95% 244Cm and 5% 246Cm) with 13C and 12C ions. They were unable to confirm the 8.5MeV activity claimed by the Swedes but were instead able to detect decays from fermium-250, supposedly the daughter of 254102 (produced from the curium-246), which had an apparent half-life of ~3s. Later 1963 Dubna work confirmed that 254102 could be produced in this reaction, but that its half-life was actually 50±10s. In 1967, the Berkeley team attempted to defend their work, stating that the isotope found was indeed 250Fm but the isotope that the half-life measurements actually related to was californium-244, granddaughter of 252102, produced from the more abundant curium-244. Energy differences were then attributed to [...] "resolution and drift problems", although these had not been previously reported and should also have influenced other results. 1977 experiments showed that 252102 indeed had a 2.3-second half-life. However, 1973 work also showed that the 250Fm recoil could have also easily been produced from the <b>isomeric</b> transition of 250mFm (half-life 1.8s) which could also have been formed in the reaction at the energy used. Given this, {{it is probable that}} no nobelium was actually produced in this experiment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the eicosanoid products formed {{may differ}} among the pathways. For prostaglandins, {{this is often}} indicated by Greek letters (e.g. PGF2α versus PGF2β). For hydroperoxy and hydroxy eicosanoids an S or R designates the chirality of their substituents (e.g. 5S-hydroxy-eicosateteraenoic acid [...] is given the trivial names of 5S-HETE, 5(S)-HETE, 5S-HETE, or 5(S)-HETE). Since eicosanoid-forming enzymes commonly make S isomer products either with marked preference or essentially exclusively, the use of S/R designations has often been dropped (e.g. 5S-HETE is 5-HETE). Nonetheless, certain eicosanoid-forming pathways do form R isomers and their S versus R <b>isomeric</b> products can exhibit dramatically different biological activities. Failing to specify S/R isomers can be misleading. Here, all hydroperoxy and hydroxy substituents have the S configuration unless noted otherwise.|$|E

Fructose itself exists as a mixture of [...] "furanoses", each of which having α and β isomers, but only one particular isomer links to the glucosyl unit. What is notable about sucrose is that, unlike most disaccharides, the glycosidic bond is formed between the reducing ends of both glucose and fructose, and not between the reducing end of one and the nonreducing end of the other. This linkage inhibits further bonding to other saccharide units. Since it contains no anomeric hydroxyl groups, it is classified as a non-reducing sugar.|$|E

It reduces Fehling's solution and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, {{as does the}} <b>isomeric</b> pyrocatechol. Iron(III) chloride colors its aqueous solution a dark-violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromoresorcin. These properties are what give it its use as a colouring agent for certain chromatography experiments. Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150 to 160°C with concentrated barium hydroxide solution gives γ-acetylbutyric acid (D. Vorlgnder); when fused with potassium hydroxide, resorcinol yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechol, and diresorcin. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, {{in the presence of}} dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, e.g., with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145°C it yields resacetophenone (HO)2C6H3~CO.CH3. With the anhydrides of dibasic acids, it yields fluoresceins. When heated with calcium chloride—ammonia to 200°C it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine. With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of lacmoid. [...] It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition of catalytic hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin 2•CH2. Reaction with chloral hydrate in the presence of potassium bisulfate yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid. In alcoholic solution it condenses with sodium acetoacetate to form 4-methylumbelliferone.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{gamma ray}} source to be {{discovered}} historically was the radioactive decay process called gamma decay. In this type of decay, an excited nucleus emits a gamma ray almost immediately upon formation (it is now understood that a nuclear <b>isomeric</b> transition, however, can produce inhibited gamma decay with a measurable and much longer half-life). Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from radium. Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of rays from radium, which included beta rays, first noted as [...] "radioactivity" [...] by Henri Becquerel in 1896, and alpha rays, discovered as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type. Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from previously named rays, by Ernest Rutherford, who in 1903 named Villard's rays [...] "gamma rays" [...] by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that Rutherford had differentiated in 1899. The [...] "rays" [...] emitted by radioactive elements were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials, using the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha rays as the least penetrating, followed by beta rays, followed by gamma rays as the most penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or at least, not easily deflected) by a magnetic field, another property making them unlike alpha and beta rays.|$|E

The units composing polymers derive, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass. The term was coined in 1833 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, though with a definition distinct from the modern IUPAC [...] definition.H2) and benzene (C6H6) – Berzelius called them [...] "polymeric".

6000|$|Merely noting this, however, I go on {{to remark}} that {{scientific}} discovery is day by day narrowing the chasm, or, to vary Mr. Martineau's metaphor, [...] "opening the door."
