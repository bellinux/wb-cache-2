50|$|What is known, and {{a matter}} of public record, is that, through the 1980s and 1990s, the USAF did {{undertake}} a series of projects to study, research, develop and test <b>demonstrator</b> <b>vehicles</b> capable of SSTO (single-stage-to-orbit) and TSTO (two-stage-to-orbit) missions. These programs were code-named, in order, Science dawn, Science realm, and Copper canyon, and involved the development of three different competitive <b>demonstrator</b> <b>vehicles.</b> It was at the conclusion of Copper canyon's design phase that President Reagan proposed the X-30 NASP, which is claimed to have been used to pay for development of this spaceplane.|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} awareness and adoption of eco-friendly vehicle {{technologies such as}} hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs); {{most if not all}} major worldwide vehicle manufacturers have released an eco-friendly vehicle or have announced a future release (e. g. concept <b>demonstrator</b> <b>vehicles).</b> Such vehicles can meet current legislative emissions standards (with comparatively lower CO 2 tailpipe emissions compared to conventional combustion engine vehicle equivalents), yet performance in the real world is often far worse than quoted test figures (e. g. fuel economy). In order to maintain and grow customer acceptance of such vehicle technologies it is important that real world usage is considered during the design and development processes. This paper describes the method of selecting a suitable all electric range (AER) to meet both legislative emissions and real world usage demands and demonstrates its use through a case study of a lightweight plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). ...|$|R

40|$|As {{vehicle and}} {{computer}} technology {{are more and}} more merging, new forms of assistance and automation in vehicles open up the potential to increasing safety and improving comfort. In HAVEit, an EU-FP 7 Integrating Project, car and truck manufacturers, suppliers and research organizations explore highly automated driving applications, where the automation can take over substantial parts of the driving task, but where the driver is still in the loop. The interaction between the human and such an automation becomes a crucial part for a successful, dynamic balance between human and machine.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{here two}} innovative in-flight measurement techniques for onboard operation on atmospheric re-entry <b>demonstrator</b> <b>vehicles</b> like EXPERT or pre-X actually in study in Europe. The {{first one is}} the Electron Beam Fluorescence (EBF) technique which aims at characterising shock layer chemistry through measurements of density, rotational and vibrational temperatures of N 2 and NO in low density hypersonic flows. These data are of great importance for the validation of the modelling tools commonly used for aerothermodynamics simulations, since they include a variety of thermo-chemical models yet to be fully validated with relevant flight data. The second measurement technique is a short range Rayleigh Lidar for measurements of upstream total density which is a primary variable in many aerodynamic key feature...|$|R
