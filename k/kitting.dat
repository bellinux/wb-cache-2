5|$|In 2005, a {{business}} case was developed with three options {{to extend the}} life of the fleet. The first two options involved expanding the service life extension program (SLEP) at a cost of $4.6 billion and $3.16 billion respectively. The third option, worth $1.72 billion, was to build 242 new wings and avoid the cost of expanding the SLEP. In 2006, option 3 was chosen and Boeing won the contract. The base contract is for 117 wings with options for 125 additional wings. In 2013, the Air Force exercised a portion of the option to add 56 wings, putting 173 wings on order with options remaining for 69 additional wings. In November 2011, two A-10s flew with the new wings fitted. The new wings improved mission readiness, decreased maintenance costs, and allowed the A-10 to be operated up to 2035 if necessary. The re-winging effort was organized under the thick-skin urgent spares <b>kitting</b> (TUSK) program.|$|E

25|$|Mounting options: The bailout {{cylinder}} may {{be mounted}} with the valve {{at the top}} or at the bottom, depending on local codes of practice. A generally used arrangement is to mount the cylinder with the valve up, as this is better protected while <b>kitting</b> up, and the cylinder valve is left fully open while the diver is in the water. This means that the regulator and supply hose to the bailout block will be pressurised during the dive, and ready for immediate use by opening the bailout valve on the harness or helmet.|$|E

The choice of an appropriate <b>kit</b> for a specific application {{should be based on}} the specific performance requirements with regard to the respective sample material. In this study, the performance of nine <b>kits</b> was evaluated: EpiTect Fast FFPE Bisulfite <b>Kit,</b> EpiTect Bisulfite <b>Kit,</b> EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite <b>Kit</b> (Qiagen), EZ DNA Methylation-Gold <b>Kit,</b> EZ DNA Methylation-Direct <b>Kit,</b> EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning <b>Kit</b> (Zymo Research), innuCONVERT Bisulfite All-In-One <b>Kit,</b> innuCONVERT Bisulfite Basic <b>Kit,</b> innuCONVERT Bisulfite Body Fluids <b>Kit</b> (Analytik Jena). The <b>kit</b> performance was compared with regard to DNA yield, DNA degradation, DNA purity, conversion efficiency, stability and handling using qPCR, UV, clone sequencing, HPLC, and agarose gel electrophoresis. All <b>kits</b> yielded highly pure DNA suitable for PCR analyses without PCR inhibition. Significantly higher yields were obtained when using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold <b>Kit</b> and the innuCONVERT Bisulfite <b>kits.</b> Conversion efficiency ranged from 98. 7 % (EpiTect Bisulfite <b>Kit)</b> to 99. 9 % (EZ DNA Methylation-Direct <b>Kit).</b> The inappropriate conversion of methylated cytosines to thymines varied between 0. 9 % (innuCONVERT Bisulfite <b>kits)</b> and 2. 7 % (EZ DNA Methylation-Direct <b>Kit).</b> Time-to-result ranged from 131 min (innuCONVERT <b>kits)</b> to 402 min (EpiTect Bisulfite <b>Kit).</b> Hands-on-time was between 66 min (EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning <b>Kit)</b> and 104 min (EpiTect Fast FFPE and Fast DNA Bisulfite <b>kits).</b> Highest yields from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections without prior extraction were obtained using the innuCONVERT Bisulfite All-In-One <b>Kit</b> while the EZ DNA Methylation-Direct <b>Kit</b> yielded DNA with only low PCR-amplifiability. The innuCONVERT Bisulfite All-In-One <b>Kit</b> exhibited the highest versatility regarding different input sample materials (extracted DNA, tissue, FFPE tissue, cell lines, urine sediment, and cellular fractions of bronchial aspirates, pleural effusions, ascites).

60|$|Although in {{the present}} story a boy plays the {{principal}} part, and encounters many adventures by land and sea, a woman is the real heroine, and the part she played demanded an amount of nerve and courage fully equal to that necessary for those who take part in active warfare. Boys are rather apt to think, mistakenly, that their sex has a monopoly of courage, but I believe that in moments of great peril women are to the full as brave and as collected as men. Indeed, my own somewhat extensive experience leads me to go even further, and to assert that among a civil population, untrained to arms, the average woman is cooler and more courageous than the average man. Women are nervous about little matters; they may be frightened at a mouse or at a spider; but {{in the presence of}} real danger, when shells are bursting in the streets, and rifle bullets flying thickly, I have seen them standing <b>kitting</b> at their doors and talking to their friends across the street when not a single man was to be seen.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{tyrosine}} kinase receptor <b>KIT</b> {{plays a major}} role in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) oncogenesis. Indeed, 95 % of GISTs express <b>KIT</b> protein, and about 70 % exhibit activating mutations of the <b>KIT</b> gene. However, little is known about <b>KIT</b> overexpression mechanisms in these tumors, and the correlation with <b>KIT</b> mutations. GISTs with mutations within exon 11 (n= 12) or 9 (n= 1) of <b>KIT</b> were compared with GISTs without <b>KIT</b> mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 (n= 10), two of them had PDGFRA mutations. <b>KIT</b> amplification was studied by real-time PCR of <b>KIT</b> and beta-ACTIN genes, and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using <b>KIT</b> and chromosome 4 centromere specific probes. <b>KIT</b> transcripts and protein expression were quantified by reverse transcription real-time PCR and Western blot respectively. Genomic analysis revealed a single mutated GIST with <b>KIT</b> amplification. <b>KIT</b> protein and RNA levels were highly variable in GISTs but closely correlated (r= 0. 82, P< 1. 10 − 5), and were higher in GISTs with <b>KIT</b> mutations (P= 0. 07 and P= 0. 03 respectively). In conclusion, contrasting with the regulation of other {{tyrosine kinase}} receptors, <b>KIT</b> overexpression in GISTs is rarely related to a gene amplification, which suggests a deregulation of <b>KIT</b> gene transcription...|$|R
