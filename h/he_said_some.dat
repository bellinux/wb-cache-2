5|$|In {{the sixth}} edition Darwin {{inserted}} {{a new chapter}} VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and {{could not have been}} produced by natural selection. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on Fertilisation of Orchids that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart's criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes {{on one side and the}} camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Michael McCaughan {{invited a}} group of people who held anti-Chávez views to a {{screening}} of the film. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> among the audience changed their opinion of Chávez after seeing it, although many remained hostile. McCaughan said the consensus opinion was that the film was excellent' and reasonably objective", but that [...] "Chávez remained a dictator leading the country to a totalitarian grave". As of 2006, groups such as Global Exchange were arranging tours to Venezuela that included a screening of the film.|$|E
500|$|Writing {{in music}} website Sputnikmusic, Rudy Klapper {{said she would}} bet that [...] "Peacock" [...] would [...] "never [...] seeing the light of day, {{primarily}} because it's a terrible song with a double entendre so blunt it would make Ke$ha blush". Klapper also said the lyrics do not compliment Perry's writing skills. The Washington Post staff writer Chris Richards' review of the track was also negative. Talking about how hooks on Teenage Dream are catchy, but quickly start to erode if listeners {{pay more attention to}} the words, he cited [...] "Peacock" [...] as an example of this. Describing its chorus as [...] "an earworm of the highest order," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> of the lyrics are enough to make people clench their teeth.|$|E

500|$|Biasini and Mitterrand {{liked the}} plans, but {{the scope of}} the {{renovation}} displeased Louvre director André Chabaud. He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was [...] "unfeasible" [...] and posed [...] "architectural risks". The public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid. One critic called it a [...] "gigantic, ruinous gadget"; another charged Mitterrand with [...] "despotism" [...] for inflicting Paris with the [...] "atrocity". Pei estimated that 90percent of Parisians opposed his design. [...] "I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>Some</b> condemnations carried nationalistic overtones. One opponent wrote: [...] "I am surprised that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France." ...|$|E
500|$|Mustaine stated {{he did not}} [...] "go {{into making}} this record with any pre-conceived notions". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> of the lyrics on United Abominations were written about his {{frustration}} with his past record labels, stating [...] "a lot of that translated into the intensity on the record." [...] Mustaine wrote the songs for the album {{in an attempt to}} [...] "stir something {{in the minds of the}} listener". The lyrics of the album were mostly about choices the American government were making at the time, which Mustaine found to be foolish. Mustaine stated recording the new songs was [...] "super fun", despite having troubles with some of the complex music and vocal arrangements. All of the lyrics and music, with the exception of one song, were written by Mustaine. [...] "Never Walk Alone... A Call to Arms" [...] was co-written by Mustaine and guitarist Glen Drover. When bassist James LoMenzo was asked about the lyrics of the album, he said to [...] "talk to Dave about that". Although most of the band had no writing credits on the album, they stated that they were excited about recording the music.|$|E
500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{praised the}} episode for {{displaying}} some of Leslie's {{stronger and more}} competent aspects, which he said makes audiences [...] "much more {{willing to put up}} with her many, many eccentricities". Heisler said he thought the Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added he was a little [...] "taken aback" [...] by how rudely Tom treated Wendy. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> of the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between [...] "the sweet and the absurd", and that some of the character moments [...] "played out a bit too jarringly real for a show like this". Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and Louis C.K., who played Leslie's love interest Dave Sanderson earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience. [...] Mike Murphy of The Press Democrat said the episode was funny, and he particularly praised the [...] "hilariously whacked-out" [...] performance of John Laroquette. Several commentators praised the joke about Andy's new rock song [...] "Sex Hair", about how one can tell whether someone had sex because their hair is matted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> with <b>some</b> hauteur, [...] "in the {{ordinary}} course of business I should hardly waste time {{over a small}} crib like--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'We have an {{old saying}} here,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> with <b>some</b> humour, 'that we do not often lose any one whom we very much desire to keep.' ...|$|R
500|$|New York Daily News writer David Hinckley said Lowe and Scott {{were strong}} {{additions}} to the show, and that Scott's character in Parks was better than his character in Party Down. Hinckley said the humor [...] "remains happily rooted in the show's eccentric characters", although <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> of the jokes, like Andy's [...] "November" [...] song [...] "sometimes feels {{like a series of}} short sketches instead of a show". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell described Lowe as entertaining but [...] "one-note", but said Adam Scott was [...] "much more promising and nuanced", with better potential for a romantic interest for Leslie than previous guest stars like Will Arnett and Justin Theroux. Kandell felt Schneider's imminent departure from the series seemed unceremonious, and praised Nick Offerman's reactions of [...] "unbridled ecstasy" [...] at the idea of cutbacks and the government shutdown. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic expressed doubt about the long-term effectiveness of Lowe's character, and said the April and Andy subplot felt [...] "dragged out for yet another week". However, he praised the script, the addition of Scott, and the performance of the entire cast, especially Rashida Jones and Aziz Ansari. Hochberger said, [...] "I'm not convinced Parks and Recreation could have a bad episode {{at this point in the}} season." [...] TV Squad writer Kona Gallagher felt [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was an especially important episode due to the addition of the Lowe and Scott characters, the beginning of Mark's exit from the series and the economic problems for Pawnee. However, Gallagher also said the episode felt mostly like a preparation for the third season.|$|E
2500|$|... "If {{he finds}} the crowd harsh here then he must {{remember}} he asked for it." [...] said Jeremy Coney. [...] "But crowds just can't be neutral about him", <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>Some</b> applaud his behaviour and others didn't. His behaviour polarises the crowds here and he must expect some sort of reaction from those who don't like it. I just feel neutral about him – when he is batting I {{want to get rid}} of him, when he is bowling I want to hit him around the park." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, the United States AID {{director}} repeated {{that the}} Carter Center {{understood that the}} ruling party (EPRDF) won the election {{and most of his}} peers confirmed that as well. The USAID director also criticized some EU observers, accusing them of bias and favoring the opposition. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> European observers practiced outside of their jobs and went [...] "overboard in encouraging the opposition and making them think that somehow they had won the election." [...] He concluded that the American government never believed the opposition won the election.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll not stick {{you like}} a hog!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>some</b> cried, [...] "Well done!" [...] for the act seemed noble. Only Acour muttered, [...] "Fool!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The man," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> with <b>some</b> bitterness, [...] "who invented big {{buttons and}} little button-holes {{should have had}} his nose {{skewered}} with a button-hook. He was an ass!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> after <b>some</b> reflection, [...] "no, I {{could not}} do that; {{it would look like}} a {{confession}} of dishonesty. People would say that you distrusted me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Before {{his death}} {{from a heart}} attack at age 49 in 2001, Adams was {{considering}} writing a sixth novel in the Hitchhiker's series. He was working on a third Dirk Gently novel, under the working title The Salmon of Doubt, but felt that the book was not working and abandoned it. In an interview, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> of the ideas in the book might fit better in the Hitchhiker's series, and suggested he might rework those ideas into a sixth book in that series. He described Mostly Harmless as [...] "a very bleak book" [...] and said he [...] "would love to finish Hitchhiker on a slightly more upbeat note". Adams also remarked that if he were to write a sixth instalment, he would at least start with all the characters in the same place. Eoin Colfer, who wrote the sixth book in the Hitchhiker's series in 2008–09, used this latter concept but none of the plot ideas from The Salmon of Doubt.|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2011, Common {{released}} his first single, titled [...] "Ghetto Dreams", from his next album. A second single,"", {{was released on}} October 4, 2011. On December 20, 2011, Common {{released his}} ninth solo album titled The Dreamer, The Believer. Although he left GOOD Music in 2011, Common was featured on the label's first compilation album, 2012's Cruel Summer. Common released a song entitled [...] "Sweet", from The Dreamer/The Believer, which included lyrics critical of rappers who sing, although this criticism was not aimed specifically at Canadian recording artist Drake. Drake took offense and responded by releasing [...] "Stay Schemin'", a song with Rick Ross and French Montana. Common fans only had to wait two-and-a-half days for him to respond to Drake's diss track. On February 13, 2012, Common commented on the feud by saying [...] "It's over. But {{it was all in}} the art of hip hop. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> things to me so I had to say some things back...I wouldn't say [...] but I know I heard something that I felt was directed to me so I addressed it. That's all. But you know, thank God we were able to move forward from it and all is good." ...|$|E

6000|$|Father Buonaventure raised {{himself on}} the couch, angrily, as if displeased by this intrusion. 'How now, madam,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> with <b>some</b> sternness; 'why have we the honour of your company?' ...|$|R

60|$|Everybody {{said it was}} a real {{beautiful}} oath, {{and asked}} Tom if he got it out of his own head. <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>some</b> of it, but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it.|$|E
6000|$|... "We then {{talked of}} Literature; {{and from that}} moment he forgot his age and infirmities, and spoke with the warmth of a man of thirty. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> {{shocking}} things against Moses and against Shakspeare. [Like enough!]... We then talked of Spain.|$|E
60|$|Right away old Mr. Toad {{began to}} swell with anger too. For a whole minute {{he glared at}} Grandfather Frog, so indignant he couldn't find his tongue. When he did find it, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> very {{unpleasant}} things, and right away they began to dispute.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will-- er-- make my {{offer an}} even {{thousand}} dollars," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> after <b>some</b> more talk. [...] "But {{that is my}} limit. If you won't take that, you'll get nothing." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Silence now," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> with <b>some</b> of his {{habitual}} impatience; [...] "send my litter and bearers home; {{bring me}} the mantle I required, and do thou and Nola follow me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> {{things in}} jest {{that were very}} {{handsome}} and mannerly, and would have pleased me very well {{if they had been}} in earnest; but that passed over, I took the directions, and appointed to attend him at his house at seven o'clock the same evening.|$|E
60|$|After some {{hesitation}} {{the subject}} returned again to his lips, and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> more--indeed, much more; Lady Constantine often throwing in an appreciative remark or question, often meditatively regarding him, {{in pursuance of}} ideas not exactly based on his words, and letting him go on as he would.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes; he took {{my paper}} {{regularly}} for many years. Do you know <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>some</b> good things now and then?
