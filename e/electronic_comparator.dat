40|$|A {{method of}} unpolarized laser pulses shaping is reported. The {{basis of the}} method {{is the use of}} an hybrid optical {{bistable}} device with nematic liquid-crystals, similar to the one previously reported by us. A sample of the input light constrols, by an asymmetrical <b>electronic</b> <b>comparator,</b> a 1 x 2 electro-optical total switch. The output pulses are reshaped and maintain the same polarization properties as the input light. From triangular input light signals, symmetriacl and asymmetrical output pulses have been obtained. The minimum pulse width achieved was 0. 1 msec. A representation of the output versus input light signals gives an hysteresys cycle in the asymmetrical case...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{periodic}} {{as well as}} {{more complex}} behaviors are shown to occur in the human pupil light reflex with piecewise constant mixed and delayed feedback. The output of an infrared video pupillometer, an analog voltage proportional to pupil area, is processed by an <b>electronic</b> <b>comparator</b> which synthesizes the piecewise constant feedback. The system is described by a nonlinear delay differential equation which has been previously shown analytically to exhibit periodic and aperiodic behavior. After parameter estimation from the data, it is found that the observed simple periodic behaviors correlate well with the model behaviors, Although more complex behavior can be observed for parameter values which gave complicated dynamics in the model, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between the observed and predicted results. The effect of uncontrollable fluctuations in the parameters on the observability of complex dynamics in this system is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The term LION is {{an acronym}} for Long Ionization Chamber. This is a {{distributed}} ion chamber {{which is used to}} monitor secondary ionization along the shield walls of a beam line resulting from incorrectly steered charged particle beams in lieu of the use of many discrete ion chambers. A cone of ionizing radiation emanating from a point source as a result of incorrect steering intercepts a portion of 1 - 5 / 8 " Heliax cable (about 100 meters in length) filled with Argon gas at 20 psi and induces a pulsed current which is proportional to the ionizing charge. This signal is transmitted via the cable to an integrator circuit whose output is directed to an <b>electronic</b> <b>comparator,</b> which in turn is used to turn off the accelerated primary beam when preset limits are exceeded. This device is used in the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) Beam Containment System (BCS) to prevent potentially hazardous ionizing radiation resulting from incorrectly steered beams in areas that might be occupied by p [...] ...|$|E

The pilot can then judge {{the rate of}} ice accumulation and make a piloting decision. Once the aircraft has left the icing region, the ice either ablates or melts and blows away. The icing rate display sequence then reverses itself.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} three {{different}} mechanisms of nonlinear and chaotic oscillation occurrence are studied. The first model comes from antisymmetric system structure and oscillations {{are caused by}} impossibility to reach the equilibrium state or to diverge to infinity. The second case studies phenomena in Lorenz system of three differential equations. The third case comes from study of the <b>electronic</b> circuit with <b>comparator</b> with hysteresis. It is shown that switching with hysteresis can cause chaotic oscillations as well...|$|R
40|$|A Schmitt trigger is an <b>electronic</b> circuit, a <b>Comparator</b> {{that is used}} {{to detect}} whether a voltage has crossed over a given {{reference}} level. It has two stable states and is very useful as signal conditioning device. When an input waveform in the form of sinusoidal waveform, triangular waveform, or any other periodic waveform is given, the Schmitt trigger will produce a Rectangular or square output waveform that has sharp leading and trailing edges. Such fast rise and fall times are desirable for all digital circuits. The state of the art presented in the paper is the design and implementation of Schmitt trigger using operational amplifier ÂµA- 741, generating a Rectangular waveform. Furthermore, the Schmitt trigger exhibiting hysteresis is also presented in the paper. Due to the phenomenon of hysteresis, the output transition from HIGH to LOW and LOW to HIGH will take place at various threshold...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Excessive wear of the {{polyethylene}} {{bearing surfaces}} of tibial components {{has become an}} important factor in early failure of total knee arthroplasty. Inadequate thickness of the polyethylene insert is one cause of excessive wear, and various minimum thicknesses have been recommended in order to reduce contact stresses within the polyethylene. However, the true thicknesses of modular polyethylene tibial inserts typically are not stated accurately by the manufacturers in their product information. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the information about the thickness of tibial inserts supplied by the manufacturers is adequate. METHODS: Five of the thinnest available polyethylene tibial inserts from five different manufacturers were selected. The minimum thickness of each was measured with use of a Sigma <b>electronic</b> micrometer <b>comparator</b> to an accuracy of +/- 0. 005 mm. RESULTS: The stated thicknesses of the polyethylene tibial inserts were 8, 9, and 10 mm, values that differed markedly from the actual minimum thicknesses, which ranged from 5. 5722 to 6. 2048 mm (mean values). CONCLUSION: The thickness of polyethylene tibial inserts has been implicated as a potential cause of excessive wear and early failure of total knee replacements. This paper highlights the fact that the information supplied by the manufacturers is inaccurate and potentially misleading; in one case, the true thickness was much less than the recommended minimum thickness. We recommend that the minimum thickness of the tibial components as well as the combined thickness of the polyethylene insert and the metal tibial tray be specified in the product information and on the packaged insert...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the retentive ability and weight change of two extracoronal attachments after repeated insertion/removal cycles. Material and methods: Two extracoronal attachments were used, one with plastic inserts and the other one with conventional metal-alloy. Initial retentive ability was checked under a 20 kgf load cell at 5 mm/min. The weight of the fi xed/removable pairs was verifi ed with an <b>electronic</b> mass <b>comparator.</b> Fixed/removable pairs were tested with an insertion/removal cycling machine, for 5800 cycles (corresponding to 5 years) at a speed of 32 rpm speed. Insertion/ removal cycles were performed under artifi cial saliva. Weight change and retentive ability of attachments were verifi ed at baseline, six-month, one-year, two-year, three-year, four-year and fi ve-year time intervals. The two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements test was used to verify possible interactions between precision attachment type and retentive ability/weight change over time. Statistically signifi cant associations were found between attachment type and retentive ability over time (P= 0. 006). Metal-alloy group showed signifi cant differences between baseline and fi rst year (P= 0. 005), baseline and second year (P= 0. 001), and between baseline and fi ve years (P= 0. 035) of insertion/removal cycles. In the plastic insert group, no signifi cant differences were found over time. No statistically signifi cant associations were found between precision attachment types and weight change over time (P= 0. 643). Initial retentive ability can not be standardized for both attachments; the metal-alloy showed better performance than the plastic insert after fi ve years. Both attachments did not show weight change after fi ve years of simulated use...|$|R
40|$|The {{report in}} hand deals with mass {{determination}} of high accuracy (relative uncertainty < 1. 10 "-" 5) {{as it is}} carried out in industrial and legal metrology for calibration and verification of mass standards and weights of classes E_ 1, E_ 2, F_ 1 and F_ 2. It is intended {{to serve as a}} close synopsis which combines the detailed description of the theoretical background with practical aspects of mass determination of high accuracy. The main subjects of this guide are: Principles of measurement and adjustment of balances (equal-arm beam balance, electromechanical and <b>electronic</b> analytical and <b>comparator</b> balance), weighing equations and corrections for subsitution weighings in air, air density determination, volume determination by hydrostatic weighing, calculation of uncertainties conforming with recognized international standards or recommendations (BIPM, ISO, OIML), realization of a mass scale by a least-squares adjustment, calculation of uncertainties with the variance-covariance matrix. The theoretical context is always illustrated by a respective practical example. Apart from this motivation, the report in hand describes the state-of-the-art of mass determination at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) which enables suitable mass standards and weights to be calibrated with relative uncertainties of 5. 10 "-" 8 and less.
