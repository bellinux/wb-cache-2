5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
25|$|The High Commission is {{mandated}} to help refugees <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives {{as quickly as}} possible, and works to settle them rapidly, most frequently in countries other than those they fled. UNRWA policy, however, states that the Palestinian Arabs who fled from Israel {{in the course of}} the 1948 war, plus all their descendants, are to be considered refugees until a just and durable solution can be found by political actors. UNRWA was specifically designed not to proscribe how the outcome of an agreement would take shape.|$|E
25|$|In December 1776, Philippe Charles Tronson de Coudray and a {{group of}} French {{officers}} left for America on the Amphitrite. The ship was soon forced to turn back to France. Anxious to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> journey, Lieutenant du Plessis and Philippe Hubert Preudhomme de Borre went aboard the Mercure. Du Plessis paid 400 livres for the price of his passage. Carrying a secret cargo of military supplies, the vessel left Saint-Nazaire on 5 February 1777. The Mercure reached Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 17 March and de Borre arrived at Morristown, New Jersey exactly two months later. Appointed captain of artillery in the Continental Army, du Plessis' commission dated from 15 April 1777. He fought at the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September.|$|E

25|$|But {{the main}} problem for the British was discontent among their soldiers. The troops in India were no longer as {{uncritical}} {{as they had been}} when considering what they were being asked to do. Like other units of the British Army many of the troops considered the war over and looked forward to being demobilised. The Indian Army had been heavily committed to the First World War and had suffered a large number of casualties. Many of its units still had not returned from overseas, and those that had, had begun the process of demobilisation and as such many regiments had lost almost all their most experienced men. Likewise, the British Army in India had been gutted. Prior to 1914 there had been 61 British regiments serving in India. However, of these all but 10 (two cavalry and eight infantry) had been withdrawn in order to fight in Europe or the Middle East. In their place, units of the Territorial Army (TA), part-time soldiers usually only intended for home defence but who had volunteered for overseas service, had been sent in order to release regular units for the fighting in France. After four years of mundane garrison duty, away from their families and disaffected, most of these men were really only interested in demobilisation and returning to Britain to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives. They were in no way prepared for a hard fought campaign on the Indian frontier.|$|E
500|$|In April and May that year, some European-Americans in Texas {{wrote to}} the editor of the Brazosport Facts {{questioning}} the fuss over her death; some were offended because Selena Day coincided with Easter Sunday. Others said, [...] "Easter is more important than Selena Day", and believed people should let Selena rest in peace and <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives. Mexican-Americans living in Texas also {{wrote to the}} newspaper; some agreed that others were too critical of Selena Day, stating they did not need to celebrate the day and should not have responded to its announcement so rudely. This was also seen by the Corpus Christi Caller Times, which said it had printed several of the negative comments left by people and that many comments were [...] "unprintable". Latino filmmaker Lourdes Portillo said she did not know who Selena was when she heard about the shooting.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Doyle {{has stated}} that he is uncomfortable being {{described}} as an [...] "Africa expert", noting in 1998:"The little I have learnt about this place makes me realise that I am very ignorant about it. It's a vast continent with huge differences between even neighbouring countries. Like anywhere, it's full of ordinary people just <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> personal, complicated lives. Anyone who claims to be an 'expert' on Africa - {{as if it were}} a homogeneous region where simple rules apply - is either arrogant or just plain silly." ...|$|R
50|$|Fields of Sacrifice was {{produced}} by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) for the Canadian Department of Veteran Affairs. The film was originally {{intended to be a}} straightforward look at Canadian military cemeteries. Brittain, a staff filmmaker who had just completed the 13-part Canada at War series, decided on different approach. He combined stock footage with glimpses of the former battlegrounds a generation later and added his own commentary. Brittain shows that while these former battlefields are now peaceful and people are <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives, the sacrifices of Canadians are not forgotten. The film was narrated by Douglas Rain and shot in 35 mm.|$|R

Explaining her choice of title, in a 2007 interview for the BBC's Blast website, Blackman said that noughts and crosses is [...] "one of those games that nobody ever plays after childhood, because nobody ever wins". In an interview for The Times, Blackman said that before writing Noughts & Crosses, her protagonists' ethnicities had never been central to the plots of her books. She has also said, [...] "I wanted to show black children just <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives, having adventures, and solving their dilemmas, like the characters in all the books I read as a child." ...|$|R

40|$|Acceptance {{of chronic}} pain is {{associated}} with positive health outcomes. The study examined participants’ chronic pain experiences by exploring two acceptance factors: pain willingness and activity engagement. Eleven participants (seven women and four men) participated in semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were analysed to identify pain willingness and activity engagement in participants’ experiences. The study found that participants demonstrated some pain willingness and activity engagement, but that avoidance and control could result in unwanted activity restrictions. Three themes were identified in participants’ accounts of <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives: making necessary adjustments, taking control and finding purpose and meaning. To improve outcomes for people with chronic pain, counsellors and rehabilitation professionals should encourage pain acceptance, and educate their clients {{about the effects of}} social withdrawal, and avoidance and control of pain...|$|R

2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{decision}} to demolish the Anglican Cathedral has caused great controversy. One commentator has asked why there is [...] "relative silence {{over the future of}} the Basilica for the Catholics who are allowed to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> decision-making processes in relative peace, while the Anglicans have to fight it out in the streets and letters to the editor pages of The Press? I suspect there remains in Christchurch the notion of old that the Catholics are still regarded as peripheral, parked over {{on the edge of town}} in an area back in the day that was next to the gas works that turned the cathedral a nicotine yellow. Now the distance from the heart of the city seems to have at last paid off as the Basilica's counterpart in the Square can't get out of the ring".|$|E
2500|$|Brodhead, in an {{interview}} with Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes, stated that [...] "Duke has a rule and many, many, many other universities observe the same rule, which is that when a student is indicted for a crime that has an element of violence, we often separate the student from the university because you don't know at that time what harm [...] might be done either in the community or to the student. It isn’t a judgment of guilt. It isn't a disciplinary measure. And what we've done is to use the interim to try {{to understand the nature of}} the case better. Weighing a lot of things [...] the presumption of innocence, the nature of the charges, the need of the students to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> life. Once the facts took the turn they did in December, then we had to rebalance those things. Then at that point it just seemed to us that simple fairness meant that we had to allow the students to come back." ...|$|E

50|$|The farm is {{a metaphor}} for the state, a place in which orderly labour is {{threatened}} continually by forces of disorder and in which the most everyday details are potentially filled with moral and eschatological significance. While the workers on the left of the composition are <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> labours, clearing away weeds, the servant at the right is demanding a response from Cromwell, her shout repeated by the screeching duck she carries. The pigs under the horse and the lamb all create a potential for disruption and instability. Behind the workers clearing weeds, a young farm worker barely controls the large herd of cattle streaming though the gate into Crowmell's farm, separating the latter from his wife and child, visible {{at the door of the}} house at the right. A spot of blood can be seen on Cromwell's collar, a reference to a famous description of him by Sir Philip Warwick, and emblematic of a bloodstained future.|$|R

2500|$|With the {{settlement}} of so many major issues between France and Spain by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, {{there was no longer}} any reason to keep Spanish troops in the Netherlands. [...] Thus, the people of the Netherlands could <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> peacetime pursuits. [...] As they did so they found that {{there was a great deal}} of demand for their products. [...] Fishing had long been an important part of the economy of the Netherlands. [...] However, now the fishing of herring alone came to occupy 2,000 boats operating out of Dutch ports. Spain, still the Dutch trader's best customer, was buying fifty large ships full of furniture and household utensils from Flanders merchants. Additionally, Dutch woolen goods were desired everywhere. [...] The Netherlands bought and processed enough Spanish wool to sell four million florins of wool products through merchants in Bruges. So strong was the Dutch appetite for raw wool at this time that they bought nearly as much English wool as they did Spanish wool. [...] Total commerce with England alone amounted to 24 million florins. [...] Much of the export going to England resulted in pure profit to the Dutch because the exported items were of their own manufacture. The Netherlands was just starting to enter its [...] "Golden Age." [...] Brabant and Flanders were the richest and most flourishing parts of the Dutch Republic at the time. The Netherlands was one of the richest places in the world. The population reached 3 million in 1560, with 25 cities of 10,000 people or more, by far the largest urban presence in Europe; with the trading and financial center of Antwerp being especially important (population 100,000). Spain could not afford to lose this rich land, nor allow it to fall from Catholic control. Thus came 80 years of warfare.|$|E

40|$|This study explores {{meanings}} of family care held by seven families {{that include a}} middle-aged adult with intellectually disability. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} members of each family- the person with intellectual disability, parents, siblings and sibling spouses. Participants described care as simply <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives, as Family Business, characterised by the conduct of well-understood tasks and routines. As such, all, including the person with intellectually disability, performed roles critical to the well-being of each other and the family as a whole. Family Business was underpinned by negotiated albeit often implicit rules that reflected family values and were amenable to changes in circumstances throughout the lifecycle. Future planning was perceived as a sensitive whole family issue. Interdependence among members was key to retaining family independence from formal services that were regarded as a "top up". Suggested is the importance of services adopting a relational approach to understanding family care and supporting future planning for middle aged people with intellectual disabilities, rather than simply focussing on "older carers"...|$|R
50|$|The desolation left as a {{consequence}} of the bombing that Germany endured before the end of World War II left the major German cities in shambles. However, unlike other cities, Berlin's structures had steel frames. This enabled many of them to remain standing, despite the bombings. This left jagged figures on the landscape, as well as a lot of rubble on the ground. Often, directors would have either horizontal or vertical shots of the rubble from a low angle.The Murderers are Among Us begins with a ground shot facing upwards showing a Berlin street, complete with piles of rubble, and destroyed buildings. The viewer sees several children running around, and the protagonist ambling up the street. The viewer also sees German citizens working together to clean up, and <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lives, despite the devastation. It has been argued by Gertrud Koch that, aside from the expressionist and neorealistic qualities of the Rubble Film, a major purpose of these films was to re-envigorate the German people, and instill a work ethic that would facilitate the reconstruction of Germany.|$|R

6000|$|The old man {{mentioned}} above {{told me that}} the birds were called [...] "rocks" [...] by the townspeople, also that they had been there {{for as long as he}} could remember. Six or seven years ago, he said, when the repairs to the roof and spire were started, the pigeons began to go away until there was not one left. The work lasted three years, and immediately on its conclusion the doves began to return, and were now as numerous as formerly. How, I inquired, did these innocent birds <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> black neighbours, seeing that the daw is a cunning creature much given to persecution--a crow, in fact, as black as any of his family? They got on badly, he said; the doves were early breeders, beginning in March, and were allowed to have the use of the holes until the daws wanted them at the end of April, when they forcibly ejected the young doves. He said that in spring he always picked up a good many young doves, often unfledged, thrown down by the dawn. I did not doubt his story. I had just found a young bird myself--a little blue-skinned, yellow-mouthed fledgling which had fallen sixty or seventy feet on to the gravel below. But in June, he said, when the daws brought off their young, the doves entered into possession once more, and were then permitted to rear their young in peace.|$|E

There's little overall tension, and the time-travelling historians come over as both panicky and amateurish - an undesirable combination, one might think, where timelines are lying about ready to be mucked up."

40|$|Public art {{invariably}} {{involves the}} drawing of individuals into the roles of audience and participant by virtue of it being {{in the public domain}} – in public places where those individuals are <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> everyday lives.

This is equally true of public sound art, where response to an intervention may vary from engagement to non-engagement to indifference to unawareness, along with a variety of transitional states between. This essay seeks to investigate this ambiguous territory in public sound art, proposing it both as an area rich in possibility for creative exploration and as a means by which artists may reveal and encourage sensitivity to the existing characteristics of a site (thus accommodating the pursuit of agendas relating to acoustic ecology). In particular it investigates and presents a case for the use of lowercase strategies in sound art as ways in which the public might be invited into a dialogue with works (invitation rather than imposition) and thus empowered as partakers of public sound art...|$|R
