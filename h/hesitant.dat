5|$|A {{volatile}} {{member of}} the team, undone by years of combat stress and alcohol abuse. Lundgren's personal history (including his chemical engineering degree) were incorporated into the character's story by Stallone.

5|$|After Isaac {{had been}} weaned, Sarah saw Ishmael mocking, and urged {{her husband to}} cast out Hagar the bondservant and her son, so that Isaac would be Abraham's sole heir. Abraham was <b>hesitant,</b> but at God's order he listened to his wife's request.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was also}} Prime Minister of Romania for three {{mandates}} (1918, 1920–1921, 1926–1927), his political success is not as spectacular as the military one. Averescu ended up {{as one of the}} pawns maneuvered by Brătianu. Argetoianu later repeatedly expressed his distaste for Averescu's <b>hesitant</b> stance and openness to compromise.|$|E
5|$|Bungie had {{previously}} released soundtracks for their games due to fan request, but Microsoft was <b>hesitant</b> {{to commit to}} producing a soundtrack for Halo; at the time most video games {{did not get a}} commercial soundtrack release.

5|$|Gore was {{initially}} <b>hesitant</b> {{to accept a}} position as Bill Clinton's running mate for the 1992 United States presidential election, but after clashing with the George H. W. Bush administration over global warming issues, he decided to accept the offer. Clinton stated that he chose Gore due to his foreign policy experience, work with the environment, and commitment to his family.|$|E
5|$|So far the Banu Qurayza {{had tried}} {{their best to}} remain neutral, and were very <b>hesitant</b> about joining the Confederates since they had earlier made a pact with Muhammad. When Akhtab {{approached}} them, their leader refused to allow him entry.|$|E
5|$|Speech {{assessment}} {{also contributes}} to assessment of mood, for example people with mania or anxiety may have rapid, loud and pressured speech; {{on the other hand}} depressed patients will typically have a prolonged speech latency and speak in a slow, quiet and <b>hesitant</b> manner.|$|E

5|$|While {{initially}} <b>hesitant</b> about releasing annotated editions, Gaiman eventually {{changed his}} mind when he forgot a reference when asked about it by a reader. The task of annotating the series was undertaken by Gaiman's friend Leslie S. Klinger of The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes who worked from the original scripts {{given to him by}} Gaiman.|$|E
5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was <b>hesitant</b> to equip an army that would not {{unequivocally}} take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|After {{a costly}} legal battle over {{a real estate}} deal with William S. King and the {{financial}} downturn of the Panic of 1893, Menage's real estate empire collapsed and he fled the country to avoid prosecution on charges of embezzlement. The charges against Menage were eventually dropped after several key witnesses had died or become <b>hesitant</b> to testify against him. He spent the later portion of his life working in real estate in the New York City area and never worked in Minnesota again.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} the burst's X-ray afterglow, the BeppoSAX team provided {{a more accurate}} localization, and what Metzger had {{assumed to be a}} variable star was still present in this smaller error box. Both the Caltech team and the Amsterdam team were <b>hesitant</b> to publish any conclusions on the variable object. On May10 Howard Bond of the Space Telescope Science Institute published his discovery, which was later confirmed to be the burst's optical afterglow.|$|E
5|$|After playing AAA midget {{with the}} Strathmore Bisons of the Foothills Bisons Hockey Association, Raymond began a two-year Junior A {{career with the}} Camrose Kodiaks of the AJHL in 2003–04. Raymond had been <b>hesitant</b> about {{pursuing}} his career {{due to a lack}} of interest from major junior teams, but his friend Dan Bertram encouraged him to play with him in Camrose. Bertram also played midget with Raymond and went on to be a Chicago Blackhawks draft pick, three selections after him.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and {{approached}} Dilip Kumar. After watching the film, Kumar was <b>hesitant</b> to play the lead role as he felt he would not match Ganesan's performance in the original version. K. Balachander was signed {{up to be the}} director of the remake, which led to Kumar being initially convinced that he could be successful.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom <b>hesitant</b> to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin found himself in {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's suggestion {{that he would like to}} have been a combatant were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war effort on the side of the Allied Powers. Initially <b>hesitant,</b> due to his personal inability to sign up for active duty, Kropotkin was eventually persuaded by Grave.|$|E
5|$|Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent {{suggested}} that Spencer audition {{for the role}} of Chase, but he was <b>hesitant,</b> fearing the show might be similar to General Hospital. Once the actor saw the scripts, he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show ER. Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read the scripts and believed that the show would be either a hit or miss.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, McBride {{had made}} {{his way through the}} minor leagues to the Cardinals' Class AA {{affiliate}} in Little Rock. Though he was successful there and he received a promotion to the Class AAA team in Tulsa, he was initially <b>hesitant</b> to report there, wondering whether he was ready for Class AAA baseball. In his first at bat at the Class AAA level, McBride hit a ball off of the outfield wall and seemed to collect a triple, but he was called out for failing to touch second base.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was <b>hesitant</b> {{to accept his}} {{election}} when word of the cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely unprepared for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell {{under the influence of}} the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Celestine V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E
5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially <b>hesitant</b> {{to accept the}} offer as {{he felt that the}} audience would not want to see him as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E
5|$|Eva, a {{masseuse}} and the {{divorced mother}} of a teenage girl, attends a party in Pacific Palisades with her friends, married couple Will and Sarah. There she meets a poet, Marianne, and Will introduces Eva {{to one of his}} friends, Albert. After the party, Albert asks Will for Eva's number and, although <b>hesitant</b> since she is not physically attracted to him, Eva agrees to go on a date with Albert, which goes well. Marianne contacts Eva for a massage, and after taking an immediate liking to one another they become friends.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was <b>hesitant</b> and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Crawford married Franchot Tone, a stage actor from New York {{who planned}} to use his film {{earnings}} to finance his theatre group.

Tone and Crawford had first appeared together in Today We Live (1933) but Crawford was <b>hesitant</b> about entering into another romance so soon after her split from Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1943, Hergé {{had decided}} that he wanted Jacobs to {{collaborate}} with him on The Adventures of Tintin. Although initially <b>hesitant,</b> Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next Adventure of Tintin, The Seven Crystal Balls, which began serialisation in Le Soir in December 1943.|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, Jack is in Phuket, Thailand, {{where he}} meets a local woman named Achara (Bai Ling); the two soon {{enter into a}} relationship. After finding out that she works in a tattoo parlor and claims {{to be able to}} see who people really are, Jack demands that she give him a tattoo. Achara is <b>hesitant</b> to give him a tattoo, but she does so anyway and tells him there will be consequences. The next morning, he is beaten up by her brother and other locals and told to leave.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, flashbacks reveal why Hurley is <b>hesitant</b> {{at his new}} job of distributing food {{found in}} the newly {{discovered}} Swan station. Meanwhile, a few castaways become worried that the raft sent by them for rescue may have not {{gone as far as}} they hoped. Jack and Sayid explore the hatch, while Sawyer, Jin, and Michael find out that their captors are from the tail section of the plane..|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted {{to revisit the}} {{previous}} proposal to reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King wrote that he believed league owners were still <b>hesitant</b> on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games {{and how it will}} impact the postseason, and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Army's command {{structure}} fell apart as Bagration was evacuated {{from the battlefield}} and the report of him being hit quickly spread and caused morale collapse. Napoleon, who had been sick with a cold and was {{too far from the}} action to really observe what was going on, refused to send his subordinates reinforcements. He was <b>hesitant</b> to release his last reserve, the Imperial Guard, so far from France.|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} {{glare of}} celebrity and the tribulations {{of the season}} forced Bradman to reappraise his life outside the game and to seek a career away from his cricketing fame. Harry Hodgetts, a South Australian delegate to the Board of Control, offered Bradman work as a stockbroker if he would relocate to Adelaide and captain South Australia (SA). Unknown to the public, the SA Cricket Association (SACA) instigated Hodgetts' approach and subsidised Bradman's wage. Although his wife was <b>hesitant</b> about moving, Bradman eventually agreed to the deal in February 1934.|$|E
5|$|The scene changes again, now to bright {{daylight}} and blue sky. Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto down an empty road. As {{one of the}} men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and he holds her hands while she gains confidence. With a nudge she is airborne, but she seems <b>hesitant</b> and afraid as he lets go.|$|E
5|$|Theophilos, in turn, was <b>hesitant</b> {{to believe}} the accusations, and was {{eventually}} convinced by the protovestiarios (chamberlain) Leo Chamodrakon and the synkellos John the Grammarian of his general's innocence. He therefore resolved to get Manuel to return, and sent John the Grammarian to Baghdad on a diplomatic mission {{in the winter of}} 829/830, ostensibly in order to announce his accession. John was indeed able to see Manuel in private and offered him the Emperor's pardon, which Manuel seemed to accept, although for the time being, Manuel remained publicly loyal to his Abbasid allegiance.|$|E
5|$|Vachss had {{previously}} worked with Dark Horse Comics {{to produce a}} ten-issue series (1992–1993) titled Hard Looks. Steve Korte of DC Comics's book division approached Vacchs {{with the possibility of}} a partnership. Vachss was <b>hesitant</b> about using creative property that belonged to someone else but recognized the opportunity to reach a new audience. He started writing the novel, on speculation, and DC Comics eventually agreed to the project, allowing Vachss to take some creative liberties.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and <b>hesitant</b> performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.|$|E
5|$|According to e-mails {{released}} in the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, Millionaire narrowly avoided cancellation after the 2014–15 season. The show's declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was <b>hesitant</b> to accept. The series was nonetheless renewed for the 2015–16 season, with various cuts to the show's production budget {{and a return to}} the original format (but with only 14 questions). Had the show not been renewed, SPE would have placed the show on extended hiatus for three years, reclaimed full rights to the show (without the innovations and format added in the syndicated run, to which DADT owns intellectual property rights), and shopped the revived show to another network or syndicator. In January 2017, it was announced that Millionaire has been renewed through 2018.|$|E
