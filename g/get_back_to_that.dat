[...] "The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless—and the best Americana does that as well." [...] The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, [...] "If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts—Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, The Waterboys—have since tried to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place." ...|$|E

I've {{been working on this}} piece of music for a year now, and it will be ready next summer, I believe. I'm very excited about it.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rap-Up magazine in May 2011, Jerkins confirmed that he had met with Ciara regarding the future of her career, stating [...] "We had a long talk. I think she just has <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> where she started, She had a lane that was specifically hers—that ghetto urban lane with the 808s. No female was doing that and she had it. I think if she just <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the blueprint…”, and went on <b>to</b> express <b>that</b> he had a desire {{to get into the}} studio and work with her. The two had previously worked together on Ciara's previous albums Ciara: The Evolution (2006) and Fantasy Ride (2009). In {{an interview}} with Broadcast Music Incorporated in March 2012, while elaborating on her future projects, songwriter, Ali Tamposi, announced that she and Livvi Franc (Olivia Waithe) would be doing the majority of the writing for the then-titled One Woman Army.

It’s <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> beginner’s headspace." [...] Manson described Strange Little Birds as a [...] "romantic" [...] record. Manson clarified later, [...] "What I mean by romance, really, is vulnerability. I used to feel so scared, and I think that was why I was so aggressive — but I’m much more willing to admit weaknesses than I was before.” Each song, she says, addresses “different points in my life between me and a person I’ve loved. They’re hot spots in my life, when I was afraid, or vulnerable, or didn’t behave at my best.” Drummer Butch Vig said that the album is a departure for the band, darker and more [...] "cinematic and atmospheric".|$|R

6000|$|... "I think I saw God," [...] he {{repeated}} more firmly. [...] "I {{had a sudden}} realization of how great he was and how great life was, and how timid and mean and sordid were all our genteel, professional lives. I was seized upon, for a time I was altogether possessed by a passion to serve him fitly and recklessly, to make an end to compromises with comfort and self-love and secondary things. And I want to hold to that. I want to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> I am given to lassitudes. I relax. I am by temperament an easy-going man.

6000|$|As {{this cold}} and bracing {{realization}} {{that all was}} not right with her position, with Sir Isaac's business procedure and the world generally, took possession of Lady Harman's thoughts there came also with it and arising out of it quite a series of new moods and dispositions. At times she was very full of the desire [...] "to do something," [...] something that would, as it were, satisfy and assuage this growing uneasiness of responsibility in her mind. At times her consuming wish was not to assuage but escape from this urgency. It worried her and made her feel helpless, and she wanted beyond anything else to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> child's world where all experiences are adventurous and everything is finally right. She felt, I think, {{that it was a}} little unfair to her that this something within her should be calling upon her to take all sorts of things gravely--hadn't she been a good wife and brought four children into the world...? ...|$|E
60|$|Let us <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{tent with}} its songs and cheery conversation. Courage. I {{do not think}} it is to be got by your {{becoming}} solemn-sides before your time. You must have been warned against letting the golden hours slip by. Yes, but some of them are golden only because we let them slip. Diligence--ambition; noble words, but only if 'touched to fine issues.' Prizes may be dross, learning lumber, unless they bring you into the arena with increased understanding. Hanker not too much after worldly prosperity--that corpulent cigar; if you became a millionaire you would probably go swimming around for more like a diseased goldfish. Look to it that what you are doing is not merely toddling to a competency. Perhaps that must be your fate, but fight it and then, though you fail, you may still be among the elect of whom we have spoken. Many a brave man has had to come to it at last. But there are the complacent toddlers from the start. Favour them not, ladies, especially now that every one of you carries a possible marechal's baton under her gown. 'Happy,' it has been said by a distinguished man, 'is he who can leave college with an unreproaching conscience and an unsullied heart.' I don't know; he sounds to me like a sloppy, watery sort of fellow; happy, perhaps, but if there be red blood in him impossible. Be not disheartened by ideals of perfection which can be achieved only by those who run away. Nature, that 'thrifty goddess,' never gave you 'the smallest scruple of her excellence' for that. Whatever bludgeonings may be gathering for you, I think one feels more poignantly at your age than ever again in life. You have not our December roses to help you; but you have June coming, whose roses do not wonder, as do ours even while they give us their fragrance--wondering most when they give us most--that we should linger on an empty scene. It may indeed be monstrous but possibly courageous.|$|E
