5|$|September saw Maine and Vermont go heavily Republican {{in their}} state elections, meaning the Northeast was likely safe for McKinley. Early in that month, {{dissident}} Democrats, who favored the gold standard and President Cleveland's policies, formed the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats, meeting in Indianapolis. The nomination of Illinois Senator John M. Palmer for president and former Kentucky governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for vice president meant Bryan would have to overcome an electoral split in his party. Hanna applauded the selection, and predicted <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> large numbers of votes. There was no chance Palmer would win the election, and Hanna {{saw to it that}} the Gold Democrats were aided with quietly-provided funds.|$|E
5|$|The 1894 Championship {{began with}} a loss for the {{defending}} champions against England, during {{a game in which}} Welsh in-fighting affected the result. Before the game, Gould instructed his forwards to heel the ball from the scrums swiftly, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> to the backs quickly and allow them to run at the English. Frank Hill decided that this was the wrong option and put all his might into wheeling the scrums instead, which worked against the efforts of Jim Hannan, who was trying to follow his captain's wishes. In the next match Gould was partnered by Dai Fitzgerald in a win over Scotland, but was unavailable for the encounter with Ireland and was replaced by Jack Elliott from Cardiff RFC.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the First World War, Rhodesia's white {{population}} was split between the Unionists, for amalgamation into the Union of South Africa, and the Responsible Government Association, for independence. While the RGA was led by Coghlan, the Union Party's leader was Herbert Longden, another lawyer from Bulawayo. Longden, like the British Government, believed Rhodesia lacked the population and resources for an independent state. For Britain, union with South Africa would mean avoiding having to buy out the BSAC, leaving the burden on South Africa instead. After the war, Coghlan noted that the new Secretary of State, Winston Churchill, was determined to achieve the amalgamation of Southern Rhodesia with South Africa. For its part, the BSAC encouraged the Unionists, expecting that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a better price for its assets from South Africa than from Southern Rhodesia. Other major corporations were also pro union, since South Africa would be able to provide cheap labour from the south. These interests controlled the local press and were thus highly influential in the debate. With General Smuts, a skillful statesman, also {{on the side of the}} Unionists, it seemed unlikely that Coghlan would dissuade the electorate from entering into the Union.|$|E

But this {{was as close as}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get,</b> as the Redskins added two more touchdowns before halftime, a 21-yard catch by Monk and a 1-yard run by Riggins.|$|E

25|$|Following that, Guest and Mathieson got {{permission}} from Capitol Records {{to create a}} vehicle for Klaatu's songs. They wrote and directed a half-hour television special they titled Happy New Year Planet Earth, hoping that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> yearly broadcasts {{as an alternative to}} Christmas specials. New Year's Eve was Mathieson's birthday. Again the group Klaatu was photographed and rotoscoped, with an astronaut wraparound created to connect the six Klaatu songs. Although the project was completed, Guest and Mathieson were dropped by their Canadian film investment group and wound up financing it themselves. They never released it.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{director}} John Fenty {{became the}} controlling shareholder {{in the club}} after a search for outside investors failed, and a sale of shares to the local public was poorly received. He owned a 51% majority stake in the club and has made significant loans to the club to ensure its continued operation. Former Leicester City chairman John Elsom also joined {{the board of directors}} along with racehorse stable trainer and owner Michael Chapman in December 2002. However, with cash flow problems, corners had to be cut and the squad was paper thin, numbers were mainly made up by inexperienced youth team players, and loan signings of questionable purpose. Like many other teams who suffer a relegation in the previous season, Grimsby got off to a mediocre start and a lower mid-table finish was as good as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> for Slade's men.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} the Second World War brought extreme {{hardship}} for the Horiuchis. They lived far enough inland {{that they were not}} subject to forced relocation, but all Japanese were immediately fired by Union Pacific and evicted from company housing. People of Japanese ancestry were often physically threatened, and denied decent work and housing. The Horiuchis were forced to live in a homemade trailer much of the time, while Paul worked various temporary, menial jobs. Unable to carry it with them, and fearing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> them in trouble with the authorities, Horiuchi burned his collection of old Japanese books and prints; a collection of twenty-five of his best paintings, left with a friend, was destroyed in a flood. At one point, the family applied for placement in a relocation camp (a not uncommon occurrence for desperate Japanese-Americans seeking shelter and food), but were denied.|$|E

But the great Amar Singh and Abu Azmi fuelled the issue by taking him more seriously than what he deserves. The confrontational position aided the MNS volunteers to get into the limelight". Ketkar also said the Shiv Sena would lose in the scenario commenting, [...] "The Sena tried to woo the North Indians after it realised their value as a vote bank in the 2004 defeat. They realised that the demography of the city had changed within a decade. That is when they {{decided it was time to}} please the North Indians. Uddhav started organising Uttar Bharatiya functions. This is the year that he bore the fruits of his efforts. That is why Raj decided to strike at the same sentiment that the Sena played in the pastâ€”the Marathi Manoos." ...|$|E
500|$|When Roberts & Vinter {{made the}} {{decision}} to close down New Worlds in 1963, Moorcock and Ballard considered publishing a new magazine that would be willing, as Carnell had been, to publish experimental material. [...] Moorcock assembled a dummy issue, and later described his intentions: [...] "It would be on art paper, to take good quality illustrations; it would be the size of, say, Playboy so that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> good display space on the newsstands; it would specialise in experimental work by writers like [...] Burroughs and [...] Paolozzi, but it would be 'popular', it would seek to publicise such experimenters; it would publish all those writers who had become demoralised by a lack of sympathetic publishers and by baffled critics; it would attempt a cross-fertilization of popular sf, science and the work of the literary and artistic avant garde." [...] Moorcock also wrote a letter to Carnell setting out his thoughts on what science fiction needed: [...] "Editors who are willing to take a risk on a story and run it even though this may bring criticism on their heads." [...] The letter was published in the final Nova Publications issue, which also carried the announcement that Moorcock would be taking over from Carnell as editor of New Worlds, though Moorcock had been unaware he would be considered for the post when he wrote his letter.|$|E
500|$|Composer Christophe Beck was a late {{addition}} to the film, taking over from Ramin Djawadi, who was Liman's first choice to replace his frequent collaborator John Powell, as Powell was on sabbatical. Edge of Tomorrow marked Beck's first science fiction film score. To prepare, Beck watched the film with temp tracks, including one from the 2012 film Battleship. He experimented with repeating the music with the scenes, but because this approach did not frequently fit the events on the screen, Beck used minimal repetition in the film. [...] "The day is reset dozens {{of times in the}} film and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> very repetitive to approach that musically the same way every time", Beck recalled. He initially tried for [...] "traditional heroic themes" [...] that involved horns and trumpets, but he said Liman [...] "preferred a non-traditional approach, driven by percussion and distorted orchestra". To that end, Beck used the pizzicato playing technique, [...] "not in the traditional, plinky-plinky-isn't-this-funny way, but a little darker, and always accompanied by some higher concept synth colors". The distorted orchestral samples enhanced the comedic tone of the extended sequences where Cage recurrently dies in battle, as the director felt it was important for the audience to find humor in this sequence. With Liman's approach, the composer said there were [...] "only a couple of traditional themes" [...] in the film, including one for Emily Blunt's character Rita.|$|E

500|$|The Powerpuff Girls series {{debut on}} November 18, 1998, {{was the highest}} rated premiere in Cartoon Network's history at the time. During its run, the series {{consistently}} scored the highest rating for an original series each week for the network across {{a wide range of}} demographicsâ€”from young children to adults. In October 2000, Cartoon Network credited the series for its Friday night prime time ratings win among cable networks. By the end of 2000, merchandising based on the series encompassed a whole variety of products, including T-shirts, toys, video games, lunchboxes, and dishware. Concerning the show's success, Craig McCracken has stated, [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> on Cartoon Network and college kids would watch it and there would be a few random T-shirts out there in the rave scene or in record shops. But I had no idea that it would take off to this extent." [...] Following the series' fourth season, the closing of Hanna-Barbera Productions and the death of its executive William Hanna in 2001, McCracken left it to focus on his new animated series, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, leaving Chris Savino to take his place and the production of The Powerpuff Girls was moved to Cartoon Network Studios. The show's last original run episode was on March 25, 2005; in all, six seasons were made. Cartoon Network had offered to give McCracken and Savino a seventh season of the series, but they believed the series had run its course.|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants was an {{immediate}} hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook PokÃ©mon (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change {{increased the number of}} older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on {{to become one of the}} longest-running series on Nickelodeon. [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it," [...] Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary. Its popularity has made it a media franchise, which is the most-distributed property of MTV Networks. , it has generated $12 billion in merchandising revenue.|$|E
