40|$|AbstractGenetic {{variability}} of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was studied using the haplotypes detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of genesp 18 andp 20 in six virus populations of two origins. The Spanish group included a CTV isolate and subisolates obtained by graft-transmission to different host species. The other included two subisolates aphid-transmitted {{from a single}} Japanese isolate. The homozygosity observed for <b>genep</b> 20 was always significantly higher than that expected under neutral evolution, whereas only three populations showed high homozygosity forp 18,suggesting stronger host constraints forp 20 than forp 18. Sequential transmissions of a Spanish isolate to new host species increased the difference between its population {{and that of the}} successive subisolates for <b>genep</b> 18,as estimated by theFstatistic. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that variation between both groups of populations was not statistically significant, whereas variations between populations of the same group or within populations were significant for both genes studied. Our data indicate that selection affects the haplotype distribution and that adaptation to a new host can be as important or more as the geographical origin. Variation of the CTV populations after host change or aphid transmission may explain in part the wide biological variability observed among CTV isolates...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt at a {{systematic}} account {{of the history of}} influences between anthropology and the theory of drama in the twentieth century. The starting point is the definition of drama as a mimesis of the movement towards self-knowledge as rebirth. It is described as a variation of the original spring dance in honour of the regeneration of life represented in the figure of the twice-born Dionysus. Anthropologists whose contribution to the theory of drama has been acknowledged are Jane Harrison, Gilbert Murray, Arnold Van <b>Genep,</b> Joseph Campbell and Victor Turner...|$|R
40|$|Research on rite-de-passage marked Serbian {{ethnology}} {{and anthropology}} {{especially during the}} seventies, eighties {{and to some extent}} nineties of the 20 th century. This paper offers some observations on the attitudes of Serbian scientists towards this method, on the novelties that the rite-de-passage introduced to interpretation of rituals, as well as some shortfalls of this analytical method in Serbia. For future analysis the author proposes more attention on the qualitative change that any ritual incurs, and towards this aim suggests some of the advantages of Van <b>Genep's</b> approach to rites-de-passage...|$|R
50|$|Basa gede, {{also known}} as basa rajang, is a spice paste that is a basic {{ingredient}} in many Balinese dishes. Basa gede form the cornerstone of many Balinese dishes. Its ingredients include garlic, red chili peppers, Asian shallots, nutmeg, ginger, turmeric, palm sugar, cumin, shrimp paste and salam leaves (Indonesian bay leaf).Balinese dishes are punctuated by basa <b>genep,</b> the typical Balinese spice mix used as the base for many curry and vegetable dishes. As well as bumbu (seasoning) used as a marinade. Tabia lala manis, which is a thin soy sauce with chili peppers, and sambal matah are popular condiments.|$|R
5000|$|In Bali {{the mixed}} rice called Nasi Campur Bali or simply Nasi Bali is a {{favorite}} among tourists. This Balinese version of nasi campur probably is the most internationally well-known version, mostly due to the [...] "Bali factor", the Balinese popularity as the island resort among international visitors. The tastes are often distinctly local, punctuated by basa <b>genep,</b> the typical Balinese spice mix used as the base for many curry and vegetable dishes. The Balinese version of mixed rice may have grilled tuna, fried tofu, cucumber, spinach, tempe, beef cubes, vegetable curry, corn, chili sauce on the bed of rice. Mixed rice is often sold by street vendors, wrapped in a banana leaf.|$|R
40|$|Homocysteine is an {{amino acid}} that is toxic to {{vascular}} endothelial cells, and plasma elevations have been associatedwith venous thromboembolism. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia (> 100 μmol/L) {{may result from}} mutations in the genescoding for enzymes in the trans-sulfuration or the folate/vitamin B 12 -dependent re-methylation pathways. Here, wereport {{the case of a}} young woman with severe, recurrent thrombo-embolic events associated with severehyperhomocysteinemia (111 μmol/L). We identified a homozygous mutation in the cystathionine β -synthase <b>gene(p.</b> I 278 T) and the presence of the Factor V Leiden mutation. Family study shows segregation of elevated homocysteinein heterozygous relatives for the mutation in the cystathionine β -synthase gene. Management consisted ofanticoagulation with warfarin and supplementation with folate, vitamin B 6 (pyridoxine) and vitamin B 12. After twelveyears of follow-up, plasma homocysteine levels remain in the moderate range (~ 20 μmol/L, reference range 8 - 12 μmol/L) and no further thromboembolic events were identified...|$|R
40|$|Purple nutsedge Cyperus rotundus is an {{important}} weed in cotton (Gossypium spp.) production in Arizona. It is estimated that 15 % of the crop acreage is infested. The technology available for selective control of purple nutsedge is not adequate and the infestation level of this weed is increasing. In 1986, the thiocarbamate herbicides, vernolate (Surpass), EPTC (Eptam, <b>Genep)</b> and butylate (Swan +, Genate plus) were evaluated as preplant and postemergence incorporated applications for selective control of purple nutsedge in cotton. There were 25 different trials conducted in Arizona cotton fields. Butylate was more selective to seedling cotton than EPTC and vernolate but all were capable of unacceptable cotton injury. Where preplant irrigations require every furrow irrigation, this concentrated the thiocarbamates in the seed row and resulted in less selectivity. Preplant treatments controlled purple nutsedge for 1 or 2 postemergence irrigations. Postemergence applications were most effective following preplant treatments but were not consistent in controlling nutsedge season -long. This research indicates that purple nutsedge lowered yields only when the cotton was stunted in growth by severe early season infestations. Wherever cotton established dominance over the weeds, yields were not affected. Preplant applications of butylate, if carefully adjusted for the growing conditions, can provide early season control of purple nutsedge...|$|R

In the village of Peliatan, there are three SPSL {{ensembles}} owned by Banjar Teges Kanginan, Tirta Sari group, and by individual. The SPSL repertoires in Peliatan were taught by three well-known artists such as I Nyoman Lotring, I Made Lebah, and I Made Gerindem. The gamelan SPSL in Peliatan is well-known because of internal and external factors. The internal factors are the gamelan itself, the tuning system, musical techniques, the members musical ability, and the music repertoars. The external factor {{is caused by the}} strong and wide networking in the local, national, and international areas. From this research, there are 11 kinds of pupuh kekendangan and seven angsels that are found. The 11 kinds of pupuh kekendangan are: pupuh kendang wangsit, kekilitan, sesimbaran, Asta Windu, ecet-ecetan, ngunda, ngelog, gemulung, ngetog malpal, dan pupuh kekendangan pekaad. Meanwhile the seven angsels which are found are: angsel <b>genep,</b> angsel numpuk, angsel penyalit, angsel ngantet, angsel ngetog, angsel narik, dan angsel kado. The pupuh kekendangan and angsels are used within the petegak and dance of the SPSL repertoires and becomes an important factor as the idenity within the SPSL in Peliatan.

40|$|AbstractThe connector, the {{structure}} located between the bacteriophage capsid and tail, is interesting from several points of view. The connector {{is in many}} cases involved in the initiation of the capsid assembly process, functions as a gate for DNA transport {{in and out of}} the capsid, and is, as implied by the name, {{the structure}} connecting a tail to the capsid. Occupying a position on a 5 -fold axis in the capsid and connected to a coaxial 6 -fold tail, it mediates a symmetry mismatch between the two. To understand how the connector is capable of all these interactions its structure needs to be worked out. We have focused on the bacteriophage P 2 /P 4 connector, and here we report an image reconstruction based on 2 D crystalline layers of connector protein expressed from a plasmid in the absence of other phage proteins. The overall design of the connector complies well with that of other phage connectors, being a toroid structure having a conspicuous central channel. Our data suggests a 12 -fold symmetry, i. e., 12 protrusions emerge from the more compact central part of the structure. However, rotational analysis of single particles suggests that there are both 12 - and 13 -mers present in the crude sample. The connectors used in this image reconstruction work differ from connectors in virions by having retained the amino-terminal 26 amino acids normally cleaved off during the morphogenetic process. We have used different late gene mutants to demonstrate that this processing occurs during DNA packaging, since only mutants in <b>geneP,</b> coding for the large terminase subunit, accumulate uncleaved connector protein. The suggestion that the cleavage might be intimately involved in the DNA packaging process is substantiated by the fact that the fragment cleaved off is highly basic and is homologous to known DNA binding sequences...|$|R
