40|$|This paper {{describes}} an extension {{to the current}} Java security model called the &quot;Gateway &quot; and why {{it was necessary to}} create it. This model allows secure applications, such as those used in electronic commerce, to safely exchange data and interoperate without compromising each individual application's security. The Gateway uses digital signatures to enable application programming interfaces to authenticate their caller. JavaSoft is using the Gateway to create a new integrated open platform for financial applications called Java Electronic Commerce Framework. The JECF will be the foundation for electronic wallets, point of sale terminals, <b>electronic</b> <b>merchant</b> servers and other financial software. The Gateway model can also be used for access control in many multiple application environments that require trusted interaction between applications from multiple vendors. These applications include browsers, servers, operating systems, medical systems and smartcards. 1. Electronic Commerce in Java Sun Microsystems Inc.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an overview}} of data mining techniques for personalization. It discusses some of the standard techniques which are used in order to adapt and increase {{the ability of the}} system to tailor itself to specific user behavior. We discuss several such techniques such as collaborative filtering, content based methods, and content based collaborative filtering methods. We examine the specific applicability of these techniques to various scenarios and the broad advantages of each in specific situations. 1 Introduction In recent years, electronic commerce applications have gained considerable importance because {{of the importance of the}} web in electronic transactions. The Web is rapidly becoming a major source of revenue for <b>electronic</b> <b>merchants</b> such as Amazon, and Ebay, all of which use some form of personalization in order to target specific customers based on their pattern of buying behavior.

40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} is a {{large and}} ever growing industry. Online transactions are returning ever-growing revenues to <b>electronic</b> <b>merchants.</b> The e-commerce industry is still facing a range of problems concerning the process of completion of online transactions. Such problems are connected to consumer fears dealing with the identity of online merchants, their security pre- cautions and methods for accepting online payments. This thesis develops and presents a Mutual Authentication Model (MAM), which addresses the problem of mutual authentication between online shoppers and merchants. The model combines existing technologies in the eld of cryp- tography, {{as well as the}} use of digital signatures and certi cates. This is done in a speci c manner as for the model to achieve mutual authentication between communicating parties, in an online transactions. The Mutual Authentication Model provides a process through which an online shopper can be quickly and transparently equipped with a digital identi cation, {{in the form of a}} digital certi cate of high trust, in order for this shopper to participate in an authen- ticated transaction within the MAM. A few of the advantages of the developed model include the prospect of decreased online credit fraud, as well as an increased rate of completed online transactions. Prof. S. H. von Solm...|$|R
40|$|Negotiation {{represents}} a key {{form of interaction}} between providers and consumers in electronic markets. One of the main benefits of negotiation in e-commerce is that it enables greater customization to individual customer preferences, and it supports buyer decisions in settings which require agreements over complex contracts. Automating the negotiation process, {{through the use of}} intelligent agents which negotiate on behalf of their owners, enables <b>electronic</b> <b>merchants</b> to go beyond price competition by providing flexible contracts, tailored to the needs of individual buyers. Multi-issue (or multi-item) negotiation models are particularly useful for this task, since with multi-issue negotiations mutually beneficial (2 ̆ 2 win-win 2 ̆ 2) contracts can be found [7, 9, 12, 13, 20]. In this chapter we consider the negotiation over the contents of a bundle of items (thus we use the term 2 ̆ 2 multi-item 2 ̆ 2 negotiation), though, at a conceptual level, the setting is virtually identical to previous work on multi-issue negotiation involving only binary-valued issues (e. g. [13]). A bottleneck in most existing approaches to automated negotiation is that they only deal with linearly additive utility functions, and do not consider high-dimensional negotiations and in particular, the problem of inter-dependencies between evaluations for different items. This is a significant problem, since identifying and exploiting substitutability/ complementarity effects between different items can be crucial in reaching mutually profitable deals...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} dilemma confronts retailers with stand-alone {{sites on}} the World Wide Web and those attempting to build electronic malls for delivery via the Internet, online services, or interactive television (Alba et al. 1997). For consumers, the main potential advantage of electronic shopping over other channels is a reduction in search costs for products and product-related information. Retailers, however, fear that such lowering of consumers' search costs will intensify competition and lower margins by expanding the scope of competition from local to national and international. Some retailers' electronic offerings have been constructed to thwart comparison shopping and to ward off price competition, dimming the appeal of many initial electronic shopping services. Ceteris paribus, if electronic shopping lowers the cost of acquiring price information, it should increase price sensitivity, just {{as is the case}} for price advertising. In a similar vein, though, electronic shopping can lower the cost of search for quality information. Most analyses ignore the offsetting potential of the latter effect to lower price sensitivity in the current period. They also ignore the potential of maximally transparent shopping systems to produce welfare gains that give consumers a long-term reason to give repeat business to <b>electronic</b> <b>merchants</b> (cf. Alba et al. 1997, Bakos 1997). We test conditions under which lowered search costs should increase or decrease price sensitivity. We conducted an experiment in which we varied independently three different search costs via electronic shopping: search cost for price information, search cost for quality information within a given store, and search cost for comparing across two competing electronic wine stores. Consumers spent their own money purchasing wines from two competing <b>electronic</b> <b>merchants</b> selling some overlapping and some unique wines. We show four primary empirical results. First, for differentiated products like wines, lowering the cost of search for quality information reduced price sensitivity. Second, price sensitivity for wines common to both stores increased when cross-store comparison was made easy, as many analysts have assumed. However, easy cross-store comparison had no effect on price sensitivity for unique wines. Third, making information environments more transparent by lowering all three search costs produced welfare gains for consumers. They liked the shopping experience more, selected wines they liked more in subsequent tasting, and their retention probability was higher when they were contacted two months later and invited to continue using the electronic shopping service from home. Fourth, we examined the implications of these results for manufacturers and examined how market shares of wines sold by two stores or one were affected by search costs. When store comparison was difficult, results showed that the market share of common wines was proportional to share of distribution; but when store comparison was made easy, the market share returns to distribution decreased signi. cantly. All these results suggest incentives for retailers carrying differentiated goods to make information environments maximally transparent, but to avoid price competition by carrying more unique merchandise.

40|$|M. Comm. Electronic {{commerce}} is a {{large and}} constantly growing industry (Kisimov. 2008), and on-line transactions are returning ever-larger revenues to <b>electronic</b> <b>merchants.</b> However, the a-commerce industry is still facing a range of problems concerning the process of secure completion of on-line transactions. "Such problems are connected to consumer fears dealing with the identity of on-line merchants, their security pre-cautions and methods for accepting on-line payments" (Kisimov, 2008). According to Kim (2007), financial institutions must ensure that the perceptions and realities surrounding security are successfully managed, both to ensure adoption and to protect customers and the institution from emerging threats. The South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) expressed its concern about the increase in phishing attacks on South African banking clients. Banking industry data managed by SABRIC shows {{that the number of}} phishing websites targeting local bank clients that have been detected and closed down by the banks have more than trebled since November 2009 until February 2010. This is a clear indication that fraudsters are constantly trying to defraud internet and cell phone banking clients (SABRIC, 2010 : 1). This study will aim to determine what controls financial institutions should implement to ensure that internet and cell phone banking can be done safely and with confidence. It will also determine whether the independent external auditors {{play a vital role in}} the process of implementing controls and solutions. With internet and cell phone banking growing rapidly (more than three billion people depend on cell phones every day for business and personal use), it is of the utmost importance that the necessary controls are implemented to protect clients' confidential information (Ciickatell, 2009 a) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{the success}} and failure of two electronic payment systems in Hong Kong, Octopus and Mondex, during 1996 - 2002. The case illustrates the new properties of electronic currencies, and provides insights for product designers and regulators. Mondex was endowed with the full legal status of money, launched by a mammoth banking group, with Mondex cards given away for free to consumers. Yet the Mondex system went into oblivion within five years. Octopus started as a modest stored value transport ticket that required a deposit. It ended up as a city-wide multipurpose payment card used by 95 % of the adult population. The system has saved significant transaction costs from the handling of coins, generating heavy transactions and turnover volume. The success of Octopus {{and the failure of}} Mondex cannot be explained by marketing strategies or technical merits alone. The two systems sought to overcome user resistance in different approaches: Mondex relied on voluntary uptake, but Octopus imposed a compulsory switch upon a large base of commuters. The case shows that in <b>electronic</b> currencies, large <b>merchants</b> and technology platforms are now {{in a better position to}} negotiate for what is valid money and what is not. Mondex, a legitimate and trustworthy source of money supply from the banking industry, failed to diffuse across the public. Meanwhile a large merchant group equipped with the point-of-sale device was able to define a new value token for the public. By controlling the material interface of <b>electronic</b> payment, the <b>merchant</b> side is playing a more active role in the loop of social consensus of money...|$|R

Thus, the existence of standardized and widely accepted mobile payment procedures is crucial for successful business-to-customer mobile commerce. The acceptance of mobile payment procedures depends on costs, security and convenience issues. For the latter, it is important that a procedure can be used over the different payment scenarios mobile commerce, <b>electronic</b> commerce, stationary <b>merchant</b> and customer-to-customer. Current payment procedures can be categorized with strategic, participation and operational criteria, using the morphological method. The proposed scheme allows to unambiguously identify and characterize any given mobile payment procedure. The design of today's mobile payment procedures should less try to optimize on the future mobile commerce problems but focus on the ease of spreading in the electronic commerce setting as lead-in scenario. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{considerable}} interest in the development of electronic money schemes. Electronic money has the potential to take over from cash as the primary means of making small-value payments and could make such transactions easier and cheaper for both consumers and <b>merchants.</b> <b>Electronic</b> money is a record of the funds or "value " available to a consumer stored on an electronic device in his or her possession, either on a prepaid card or on a personal computer for use over a computer network such as the Internet. This paper argues that e-money, as a network good, could become an important form of currency in the future. Such a de-velopment would influence the effectiveness and implementation of monetary policy. If an in-creased use of e-money substantially limits demand for central bank reserves, it would require changes in the operational target of the central bank and a closer coordination of monetary and fiscal policies...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{the rhetoric}} about Web-based {{electronic}} commerce focuses on its use in reaching global markets. Yet not all businesses can or should target global audiences. The literature on electronic commerce to date does not provide adequate guidance about the ways that local merchants can exploit synergies between their local physical presence and electronic commerce on the Web. In this paper, potential synergies, such as using a combined physical and virtual presence to improve trust, help consumers manage risk, meet diverse shopping preferences, and taking advantage of natural physical-virtual complementarities, are developed. We follow with a brief empirical analysis that illustrates the relative lack of use of these synergies among small and medium sized enterprises having a physical presence in a local market. We conclude {{that there is a}} mismatch between electronic commerce rhetoric and the capabilities of many local businesses, and policy makers may need to take a more local approach to electronic commerce in order to prevent it from becoming a threat to local economies.
