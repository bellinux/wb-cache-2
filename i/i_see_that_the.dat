In [...] "Song of Myself", he gave an inventory of major religions and indicated he respected and accepted all of them—a sentiment he further emphasized in his poem [...] "With Antecedents", affirming: [...] "I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god, / <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception". In 1874, he was invited to write a poem about the Spiritualism movement, to which he responded, [...] "It seems to me nearly altogether a poor, cheap, crude [...]" [...] Whitman was a religious skeptic: though he accepted all churches, he believed in none. God, to Whitman, was both immanent and transcendent and the human soul was immortal and in a state of progressive development. American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who [...] "took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world." ...|$|E

I now warn my countrymen to beware of these execrable philosophers, whose only object it is to destroy every thing that is good here, and to establish immorality and murder by precept and example—'Hic niger est hunc tu Romane caveto' [...]|$|E
2500|$|As I've been a {{governor}} {{and seen the}} impact {{that the federal government}} can have holding down the interest of the teachers' unions and instead putting the interests of the kids and the parents and the teachers first, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Department of Education can actually make a difference. So I supported No Child Left Behind. I still do. I know there are a lot in my party that don't like it, but I like testing in our schools. I think it allows us to get better schools, better teachers; allows us to let our kids have the kind of hope that they ought to have." [...] However, during a presidential primary debate in 2011 he said, [...] "education has to be held at the local and state level, not at the federal level. We need to get the federal government out of education." ...|$|E

2500|$|Charles [...] "Wag" [...] Bennett, one of {{the judges}} at the 1966 competition, was {{impressed}} with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited {{him to stay in}} his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: [...] "Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.” ...|$|E
