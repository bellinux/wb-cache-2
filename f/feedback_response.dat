The tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism was evaluated in the nonclipped kidney of Goldblatt hypertensive rats from both stop flow pressure (SFP) and single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) responses to step increases in late proximal perfusion rate from 0 to 40 nl/min. During control conditions, increases in late proximal perfusion rate produced flow dependent decreases in SFP and SNGFR with maximal values of 10. 2 ± 1. 0 mm Hg and 12. 9 ± 2. 5 nl/min, values {{similar to those}} obtained in normal rats. During ACE inhibition (MK 422; 0. 6 mg/kg/hr), arterial pressure decreased from 168 ± 8 to 137 ± 7 mm Hg {{and there was a}} marked attenuation in the magnitude of SFP <b>feedback</b> <b>responses</b> (Δ = 2. 5 ± 0. 3 mm Hg).

Feedforward, horizontal and <b>feedback</b> <b>responses</b> largely activate separate layers of a cortical unit, meaning they can be dissociated by lamina-resolved neurophysiological techniques.

However, recent developments in high spatial resolution fMRI allow for non-invasive, in vivo measurements of brain responses specific to separate cortical layers. This provides an important opportunity to dissociate between feedforward and <b>feedback</b> brain <b>responses,</b> and investigate communication between brain areas at a more fine- grained level than previously possible in the human species.

Recent {{studies have suggested that}} cytosolic calcium serves in the transmission of signals between distal tubular fluid and glomerular vascular elements. Since cAMP can modify calcium-mediated events, it was of interest to determine if agents that elevate intracellular cAMP could influence <b>feedback</b> <b>responses</b> and to assess the interaction of cAMP and intracellular calcium in the transmission of feedback signals. Stop flow pressure (SFP) was measured in the rat during retrograde microperfusion into the distal tubule at 15 nl/min. SFP averaged 37. 5 ± 0. 5 mm Hg and decreased by 12. 8 ± 0. 8 mm Hg (N = 44) during perfusion with an isotonic Ringer's solution. Addition of 3 -isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, decreased the magnitude of SFP feedback responses; 89 ± 4. 5 % (N = 16) inhibition was observed at an IBMX concentration of 500 µm. In addition, SFP decreased by only 3 ± 1 mm Hg (N = 8) during perfusion with 10 mM dibutyryl cAMP {{in the presence of a}} low concentration of IBMX and by 1. 6 ± 0. 7 mm Hg (N = 12) during perfusion with forskolin, an agent that stimulates adenylate cyclase activity.

50|$|The {{deflection}} {{signals are}} caused {{not only by}} sample topography, {{but also by the}} thermal expansion caused by Joule heating. Since AFM has feedback controller with a bandwidth, for example 20 kHz (different AFM may have different bandwidths), the signal below 20 kHz is captured and processed by the feedback controller which then adjusts the z-piezo to image surface topography. Joule heating frequency is kept well above 20 kHz to avoid <b>feedback</b> <b>response</b> and to separate topological and thermal effects. The upper limit of the frequency is limited by the decrease of thermoelastic expansion with the inverse power of the modulation frequency and the frequency characteristics of the cantilever arrangement. A lock-in amplifier is specially tuned to the Joule heating frequency for detecting only the expansion signal and provides the information to an auxiliary Atomic Force Microscopy channel to create the thermal expansion image. Usually expansion signals approximately 0.1 Angstroms start to be detected, although the resolution of SJEM highly depends on the whole system (cantilever, sample surface, etc.).|$|E

Here, we studied whether vestibular signals evoke fixed responses with the aim to preserve the hand trajectory in space or are processed more flexibly, correcting trajectories only in task-relevant spatial dimensions. We used galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to perturb reaching movements toward a narrow or a wide target. Results show that the same vestibular stimulation led to smaller trajectory corrections to the wide than the narrow target. We interpret this reduced compensation as a task-dependent modulation of vestibular <b>feedback</b> <b>responses,</b> tuned to minimally intervene with the task-irrelevant dimension of the reach.

To test the pH hypothesis in a manner independent of artificial pH-buffer systems, we studied the effect of interfering with the endogenous pH buffer, the bicarbonate/carbonic anhydrase system. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase allowed for large changes in pH in the synaptic cleft of bipolar cell terminals and cone terminals, but the predicted enhancement of the cone <b>feedback</b> <b>responses,</b> according to the pH-hypothesis, was not observed.
