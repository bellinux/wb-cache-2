500|$|American TV series Firefly {{and film}} {{spin-off}} Serenity were cited by O'Brien as inspirations. [...] "Our other theme is you can't force {{other people to}} live by your rules and your society, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> society is better," [...] he said. [...] "In Serenity The Operative actually says, 'This is not an evil empire. We just don't understand why you don't {{want to be part}} of our happy club.' Obviously they take it too far, and that's kind of what happens in our game as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E

500|$|Themes in Lavigne's music include {{messages}} of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. Lavigne believes her [...] "songs are about being yourself {{no matter what}} and going after your dreams <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true." [...] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as [...] "Losing Grip", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as [...] "Complicated", saying that [...] "the songs I did with the Matrix... were good for my first record, but I don't {{want to be that}} pop anymore." [...] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that [...] "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about... Like boys, like dating or relationships". Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style. [...] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. [...] "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [...] Her objective in writing the album was simply to [...] "make it fun". The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as [...] "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". Ian McKellen defined her as [...] "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" [...] on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Wood {{wrote the}} quasi-memoir Hollywood Rat Race, which was {{eventually}} published in 1998. In it, Wood advises new writers to [...] "just keep on writing. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> story gets worse, you'll get better", and also recounts tales of dubious authenticity, {{such as how}} he and Bela Lugosi entered the world of nightclub cabaret.|$|E
2500|$|On October 2, 2016 at a {{press conference}} at Fenway Park, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said that the {{anonymous}} drug test in 2003 were inconclusive because [...] "it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program." [...] Manfred argued that [...] "it was important to make people understand that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> name was on that list, that it was entirely possible that you were not a positive". Furthermore, Manfred sustained that the 2003 test was supposed to be confidential and it would be unfair to judge players based on [...] "leaks, rumors, innuendo, [...] not confirmed positive test results". Manfred finished by stating that Hall of Fame voters should use their best judgment and only consider confirmed testing by the MLB as there were many [...] "legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly positives." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{cutting of}} wood was {{restricted}} {{from the start}} of the occupation and rationed from July 1941. Gathering wood needed a permit, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> on <b>your</b> own land.
