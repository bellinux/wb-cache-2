5|$|The neuroendocrine {{system is}} typical of insects. There is a brain, a subesophageal <b>ganglion,</b> three {{thoracic}} ganglia, and six abdominal ganglia. Strong neuron connections connect the neurohemal corpora cardiaca to the brain and frontal <b>ganglion,</b> where the closely related median corpus allatum produces juvenile hormone III {{in close proximity to}} the neurohemal dorsal arota. The digestive system of earwigs is like all other insects, consisting of a fore-, mid-, and hindgut, but earwigs lack gastric caecae which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect. Long, slender (extratory) malpighian tubules can be found between the junction of the mid- and hind gut.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} segments {{have one}} <b>ganglion</b> on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also {{seen in the}} abdomen {{but only in the}} first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen, whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen. Some insects, like the house fly Musca domestica, have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic <b>ganglion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The trigeminal ganglia of the {{trigeminal nerve}} (V) {{occupies}} {{a space in}} the dura mater called Trigeminal cave. This <b>ganglion</b> contains the cell bodies of the sensory fibers of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve.|$|E
50|$|The infra-oesophageal <b>ganglions</b> {{are placed}} in the usual {{situation}} on the buccal mass, below the oesophagus. The buccal <b>ganglions</b> are scarcely larger than the olfactory, and are of an oval form, their inner extremities being connected across the median line by a short commissure; their outer extremities receive a cord of communication {{from each of the}} cerebroid <b>ganglions.</b> Two minute elliptical <b>ganglions</b> are almost sessile on the anterior border of the buccal ganglions; these are the gastro-cesophageal <b>ganglions.</b> Thus in all there are six pairs of ganglions; four above the gullet, and two below it.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} all {{hand and}} wrist <b>ganglions</b> in patients aged 12  years and younger that were treated at our institution during a 3 -year period. Our patients were predominately female (1. 8 : 1). Volar <b>ganglions</b> were more common (1. 2 : 1), whereas dorsal <b>ganglions</b> {{have been reported}} to be more common in adults. <b>Ganglions</b> had a higher incidence of arising from tendon sheaths in our patients (33 %) compared to what has been previously reported for <b>ganglions</b> in studies of all age groups (5 % to 16 %). While observation and/or splinting alone will likely be helpful in resolution of a majority of pediatric hand and wrist <b>ganglions,</b> surgical excision should be employed in those that are symptomatic and/or do not resolve with observation...|$|R

The differentitation of neural system show not only {{relative}} higher level in Cephalopoda animal, but also is easily to separate for studying In the neural sciences. Here, proteomes of both cerebral and optic <b>ganglions</b> in Sepia esculenta were effectively {{separated by a}} improved approach of 2 D-PAGE. In addition, we used both peptide mass finger printing (PMF) and database search to identify protein spots in part in 2 D-PAGE gel for establishing maps of molecular anatomic of cerebral and optic <b>ganglions</b> primarily in Sepia esculenta. We used a software of Melanie 4 Trial to analyze those <b>ganglions,</b> indicating approximately 682 and 594 protein spots in cerebral and optic <b>ganglions,</b> respectively, which the spot numbers in front more than that in later. Moreover, the same proteins such as mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase precursor, pre-MDH, SNAP-type proteins can be found by both <b>ganglions.</b> In addition, these spots such as elongation factor G, tubulin, and actin shows high match rate, but most protein identified in the gel are hypothetic and structural proteins...|$|R
5|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} position, the foramen {{is used as}} an anatomical landmark during neurosurgery. As a landmark, the foramen spinosum reveals the positions of other cranial foramina, the mandibular nerve and trigeminal <b>ganglion,</b> foramen ovale, and foramen rotundum. It may also be relevant in achieving haemostasis during trauma surgery.|$|E
5|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} frequently {{passes the}} prelaryngeal lymph nodes (located {{just above the}} isthmus), and the pretracheal and paratracheal lymph nodes. The gland receives sympathetic nerve supply from the superior, middle and inferior cervical <b>ganglion</b> of the sympathetic trunk. The gland receives parasympathetic nerve supply from the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is driven by}} the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic <b>ganglion.</b> Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E
50|$|The first pair {{of nerves}} come from the {{olfactory}} <b>ganglions,</b> and are large, but of no great length; they divide into several filaments {{as they enter the}} base of the dorsal tentacles. The second pair pass from the under surface of the anterior border of the cerebroid <b>ganglions,</b> not far from their union with the olfactory ganglions; these nerves go to supply the upper surface of the channel of the mouth. The third and fourth pairs of nerves issue from the same <b>ganglions,</b> but considerably behind the second pair; these also go to the channel of the mouth; the third probably sending a branch to the oral tentacles. A strong cord passes off close to the root of the fourth pair: these cords curve round the oesophagus and are united to the outer extremities of the buccal <b>ganglions,</b> forming the anterior collar. The fifth pair of nerves issue apparently from the outer border of the branchial ganglia, and go to the skin {{by the side of the}} head. The sixth pair are small, and come from the upper surface of the branchial ganglions; these nerves go to the skin of the sides of the back. The seventh, much larger than the sixth, emerge from the posterior margin of the same <b>ganglions,</b> and supply the dorsal skin, and apparently likewise the cerata. These are the branchial nerves. The eighth and ninth pairs are large nerves; they issue from the outer border of the pedial <b>ganglions</b> and go to the foot. The posterior margins of these <b>ganglions</b> are united by a stout, shortish commissure, composed of two or three cords, which, passing below the gullet, form the great oesophageal collar. The tenth pair of nerves are given off from the posterior margin of the buccal ganglions; these pass into the buccal mass and go to supply the tongue. The eleventh pair, issuing from the outer extremities of the buccal <b>ganglions,</b> are distributed to the muscles of the buccal mass. The twelfth pair come from the apex of the gastro-oesophageal <b>ganglions,</b> and being applied to the gullet, each divides into two branches, one of which supplies the upper portion of that tube, the other, passing down it, goes to the stomach as in the other nudibranchs. The thirteenth pair are large; these are the hepatic nerves; they issue from the buccal mass and probably (as in genus Aeolidia) are connected at their origin with <b>ganglions,</b> which must be looked upon as belonging to the sympathetic system. Immediately on emerging from the buccal mass, they are connected to the buccal <b>ganglions</b> at their point of union with the gastrooesophageal, and then, arching outwards and upwards, pass from within the anterior oesophageal collar, and go to supply the glands of the cerata.|$|R

5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model of a pair of nerve cords, each with a <b>ganglion</b> per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E
5|$|The {{nervous system}} of an insect {{can be divided}} into a brain and a ventral nerve cord. The head capsule is made up of six fused segments, each with either a pair of ganglia, or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain. The first three pairs of ganglia are fused into the brain, while the three {{following}} pairs are fused into a structure of three pairs of ganglia under the insect's esophagus, called the subesophageal <b>ganglion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The somatic motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and pharyngeal {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve. Fibers cross over to and join the vagus nerve in the jugular foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular <b>ganglion,</b> and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{diffraction}} based model {{to explain how}} coloured filters are able to improve the reading abilities of readers with abnormal eye saccades. We have explained how light of short wavelengths such as blue forms a broader diffraction image compared to light of long wavelength such as red. It is known that blue filters appear to improve reading ability of dyslexics who often present with abnormal eye saccades. Since blue coloured light {{gives rise to a}} diffracted image with is broader, it activates both the centrally located parvocellular <b>ganglions</b> as well as the peripherally located magnocellular <b>ganglions.</b> Thus, both pathways formed by these <b>ganglions</b> are activated even if the saccades are abnormal. In the case of red light, since the diffracted image is narrower, the retinal activation region is also narrow matching the narrow retinal region rich in parvocellular <b>ganglions.</b> Images formed in eyes with abnormal saccades will result multiple crossings of a narrow pencil of the diffracted red light beam across the centrally located parvocellular <b>ganglions</b> resulting in a dramatic rise and fall in neural signal in the parvocellular pathway. This causes image instability resulting in unsteady, unclear and distorted images as seen by some poor readers...|$|R

5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{invertebrates}} have notably complex brains: arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others), and cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and similar molluscs). The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend {{through the body}} of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain, the supraesophageal <b>ganglion,</b> with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing. Cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, lantern fishes, and rattails). It {{has also been}} known to take other sharks and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese dogfish has more acute vision than many other deepsea sharks: {{in addition to having}} a large pupil and lens, and a tapetum lucidum, its eyes also contain a high concentration of <b>ganglion</b> cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane. The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a <b>ganglion</b> of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E

5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a <b>ganglion</b> in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.|$|E
5|$|The slug-like larva of Phoronis ovalis swims {{for about}} 4 days, creeps on the sea-bed for 3 to 4 days, then bores into a {{carbonate}} floor. Nothing {{is known about}} three species. The remaining species develop free-swimming actinotroch larvae, which feed on plankton. The actinotroch is an upright cylinder with the anus {{at the bottom and}} fringed with cilia. At the top is a lobe or hood, under which are: a <b>ganglion,</b> connected to a patch of cilia outside the apex of the hood; a pair of protonephridia (smaller and simpler than the metanephridia in the adult); the mouth; and feeding tentacles that encircle the mouth. After swimming for about 20 days, the actinotroch settles on the seabed and undergoes a catastrophic metamorphosis (radical change) in 30minutes: the hood and larval tentacles are absorbed and the adult lophophore is created round the mouth, and both now points upward; the gut develops a U-bend so that the anus is just under and outside the lophophore. Finally the adult phoronid builds a tube.|$|E
25|$|Transduction {{involves}} chemical messages {{sent from}} the photoreceptors to the bipolar cells to the <b>ganglion</b> cells. Several photoreceptors may send their information to one <b>ganglion</b> cell. There {{are two types}} of <b>ganglion</b> cells: red/green and yellow/blue. These neuron cells constantly fire—even when not stimulated. The brain interprets different colors (and with a lot of information, an image) when the rate of firing of these neurons alters. Red light stimulates the red cone, which in turn stimulates the red/green <b>ganglion</b> cell. Likewise, green light stimulates the green cone, which stimulates the red/green <b>ganglion</b> cell and blue light stimulates the blue cone which stimulates the yellow/blue <b>ganglion</b> cell. The rate of firing of the <b>ganglion</b> cells is increased when it is signaled by one cone and decreased (inhibited) when it is signaled by the other cone. The first color {{in the name of the}} <b>ganglion</b> cell is the color that excites it and the second is the color that inhibits it. i.e.: A red cone would excite the red/green <b>ganglion</b> cell and the green cone would inhibit the red/green <b>ganglion</b> cell. This is an opponent process. If the rate of firing of a red/green <b>ganglion</b> cell is increased, the brain would know that the light was red, if the rate was decreased, the brain would know that the color of the light was green.|$|E

50|$|Nervous system: The {{cerebral}} ganglia {{are placed}} at the commencement of the oesophagus. There are as usual four pairs of supra-oesophageal ganglia, though at first sight only three are apparent. The cerebroid and branchial are completely fused. Branchial ganglia form two oval central masses, resting upon the upper surface of the oesophagus, {{one on each side}} of the median line, across which they are united at the anterior extremity by a short but distinct commissure. Their posterior extremities diverge and are slightly bilobed, marking the boundaries of the two ganglia of which each mass is composed, — the anterior lobe indicating the cerebroid, the posterior the branchial. (Branchial ganglia are also fused in Onchidoris bilamellata and in Lamellidoris aspera.) The pedial <b>ganglions</b> are irregularly rounded, being equal in bulk to the cerebroid and branchial together. They lie against the sides of the oesophagus, and are united to the under surface of the central masses. The fourth pair of <b>ganglions</b> are the olfactory: they are well developed, though very much smaller than those just described, and are joined by a short commissure to the upper surface of the anterior margins of the cerebroid <b>ganglions.</b>|$|R
