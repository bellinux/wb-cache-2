Histopathological examination showed neoplastic cell invasion in the spleen, lymph nodes, cerebrum and cerebellum...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{course of}} naturally infected dogs with E. equi are described. Fever (up to 41 degrees C), depression, <b>dysorexia</b> and ascites were observed. Laboratory findings revealed mild anemia, inclusion bodies within neutrophils in one dog, thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia {{and in two}} dogs hyperglobulinemia. In acute and convalescent dogs sera antibody titers from 1 : 60 to 1 : 480 to E. equi using IFA test were detected. Clinical resolution was obtained with long-term doxycycline monohydrate therapy...|$|E
40|$|A 12 {{year old}} male Fox Terrier (case 1) and a one year old female Poodle (case 2) were {{presented}} {{with a history of}} <b>dysorexia</b> and vomiting, and case 2 also with distress associated with eating. Both dogs were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis based on clinical signs, blood analysis and ultrasonography which revealed the presence of a vegetable foreign body in the proximity of the pancreatic right lobe. Laparatomy enabled the gramineae awns to be removed which led to full resolution of clinical signs. We believe that these are the first reported cases of acute pancreatitis due to grass awns...|$|E
40|$|An 8 -year-old male lion with {{progressive}} lack {{of secondary}} sex characteristics, <b>dysorexia</b> {{and weight loss}} was referred to our Institution. The patient was anaesthetized to undergo general clinical evaluation, hematologic, serum biochemical and hormonal profile, FIV/FeLV tests. Total body computed tomography, abdominal ultrasonography and fine-needle aspirates of the liver and left adrenal lesion were performed. Imaging findings showed {{the presence of a}} neoplastic lesion on the left adrenal gland and generalized hepatopathy. Blood tests reported an estradiol concentration of 462 ng/dl. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an adrenal mass in a lion associated with secondary feminization...|$|E
40|$|A female Rottweiler dog was {{presented}} {{with a history of}} intermittent vomiting and diarrhoea, <b>dysorexia,</b> weakness, and weight loss. Haemocytometry and biochemistry values were within normal ranges except for electrolyte analyses, that demonstrated hyponatremia and hyperkalemia with a decreased sodium/potassium ratio. A diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism was suspected. Basal and post-ACTH stimulation cortisolemia were within the normal values. Electrocardiography was normal, and thoracic radiography showed no significant modifications. On abdominal ultrasonography, adrenal glands appeared normal, while the bowel was distended, and several thin linear hyperechoic objects floating in the lumen were observed. Two adult female whipworms (Trichuris vulpis) were collected following bowel irrigation. Anthelmintic treatment against the parasite was curative...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{carried out}} {{microscopic}} examination of blood smears of 1438 dogs infected with Leishmania infantum. Unusual findings of leishmaniosis associated with circulating parasitised cells {{are described in}} four dogs. Most of the dogs presented severe illness, with lethargy, <b>dysorexia,</b> emaciation and alterations of the haematological pattern (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia and monocytosis). In three cases, leishmaniosis was associated with ehrlichiosis. On examination of peripheral blood smears, Leishmania sp. amastigotes were observed both in various circulating leukocytes (neutrophil, monocyte, macrophage) and free. In conclusion, parasites can rarely be detected in blood smears (in 0. 28 % of the animals examined); thus, the time-consuming microscopic search for amastigotes can make only a weak contribution to the conventional diagnosis of canine leishmaniosis...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the topic of {{nutrition}} for oncological patients. Tumour illnesses are often followed by diet malfunctions, great loss of weight and <b>dysorexia.</b> Diet malfunctions can be caused {{not only by the}} tumour illness itself, but also by tumour treatment. Malnutrition of an oncologically ill patient might worsen the state of the illness together with the quality of the life. The thesis provides a view onto this serious but unfortunately also often neglected side of the problem and emphasises the need of awareness among the patients about the proper diet. The thesis consists of a theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part includes in-depth information of nutritional problems of the patients and knowledge of the specific diet. The practical part focuses research of particular problems exhibited by the patients related to their illness and its treatment. Additionally it checks their awareness of possibilities of the proper diet suitable during the illness (therapy) and how nurses are involved into providing the information. Special concern is also given to the role of proper diet awareness in everyday care...|$|E
40|$|The vaccine Canileish® is {{distributed}} in Europe {{to reduce the}} risk of developing an active infection and clinical leishmaniosis. An English Setter dog vaccinated with Canileish® and treated with anti-feeding and repellent medications showed typical clinical signs of leishmaniosis. The dog was presented with <b>dysorexia,</b> weight loss, fever and forelimb lameness. The physical exam revealed moderate generalized external lymph node enlargement, sero-purulent ocular discharge, photophobia, and swollen and painful right carpal joint. Clinico-pathological findings revealed moderate microcytic-hypochromic non-regenerative anemia, mild neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, hyperglobulinemia, hematuria and mild elevation of urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, polyclonal peak in the gamma globulins, Leishmania spp. amastigotes in lymph nodes and bone marrow, and immunofluorescence antibody titer (IFAT) of 1 : 5120. The successful treatment included meglumine antimonate and allopurinol for 40 days, and metronidazole-spyramicin for 24 days. The dog was monitored up to 9 months and normalization of most hemato-biochemical abnormalities was achieved. The bone marrow qPCR for Leishmania infantum was negative, while IFAT was 1 : 160. Despite the systematic leishmaniosis prevention, the typical clinical disease can occur...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of visceral or cutaneous canine leishmaniasis cases among dermatophatic dogs {{admitted to the}} veterinary teaching hospital School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry - University of São Paulo from 1997 to 2008 was retrospectively characterized. For the diagnosis of 427 animals, serological (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Indirect Immunofluorescence and/or Complement Fixation), parasitological and molecular (Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests were performed, which resulted in 117 (27. 4 %) confirmed positive cases. Of these, 96 (82. 1 %) were pure breed dogs and the others 21 (17. 9 %) were cross breed, being 57 (48. 7 %) females and 60 (51. 3 %) males. In terms of age, 26 (22. 2 %) were younger than 36 months, 48 (41 %) were between 36 and 84 months, and 43 (36. 8 %) were older than seven years old. Sixty-four (54. 7 %) dogs were considered oligosymptomatic, 44 (37. 6 %) symptomatic, and the remaining nine (7. 7 %) asymptomatic. The main clinical findings were, in descending order, dermal lesions, lymphadenopathy, anemia, <b>dysorexia,</b> prostration and splenomegaly. As for hematological disorders, relative and absolute lymphopenia {{was the most important}} findings. Ninety-six (82. 1 %) of the positive animals correspond to allochthonus cases from São Paulo municipality...|$|E
40|$|The 5 -year-old bitch boxer {{came from}} an area where ticks are endemic and was {{referred}} to the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Napoli Federico II (Italy) with clinical signs of acute lameness of the right forelimb, fever (39. 7 _C) and <b>dysorexia.</b> Routine haematology and serum biochemistry gave results in the normal range, but leukocytosis (13, 000 cells/lL) with absolute neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia (16, 0000 /lL) and mild anaemia were recorded. Microscope analysis of blood smears stained with Giemsa revealed granulocytic inclusion bodies identified as Ehrlichia spp. organisms. Clinical, haematological, and serological data {{as well as the}} morphology of the causative agent are not sufficient for the differentiation of closely related members of the E. phagocytophila genogroup. Molecular analysis is the method of choice for the identification and classification of bacteria that cannot be cultured or characterized by conventional techniques. A blood sample (5 mL) collected in ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) was used for extraction of ehrlichial DNA. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the new isolated Ehrlichia spp. from the Italian dog is positioned in the E. phagocytophila genogroup (Fig. 2, Panel A). The nucleotide sequence of the Italian Ehrlichia isolate was similar to those of E. equi, E. phagocytophila and HE (identity 98...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Anorexia and {{impaired}} appetite (<b>Dysorexia)</b> {{are common}} symptoms with varying causes, and often need no serious medical intervention. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic psychiatric disease {{with a high}} mortality rate. In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), anorexia is {{a condition in which}} anorexic patients lose appetite due to dystemperament. This review aims to discuss the common points of traditional and conventional approaches rather than introducing Persian medical recommendations suitable for nowadays use. Materialsand Methods: For this purpose, Avicenna's Canon of Medicine, main TPM resources and important databases were reviewed using the related keywords. Results: Despite complex hormonal explanation, etiology of AN in conventional approach is not completely understood. In TPM approach, the etiology and recommended interventions are thoroughly defined based on humoral pathophysiology. In TPM approach, disease states are regarded as the result of imbalances in organs’ temperament and humors. In anorexia with simple dystemperament, the physician should attempt to balance the temperament using foods and medicaments which have opposite quality of temperament. Lifestyle, spiritual diseases (neuro – psychological) and gastrointestinal worms are the other causes for reducing appetite. Also, medicines and foods with warm temperaments (such as Pea soup and Mustard) are useful for these patients (cold temperament). Conclusion: Although the pathophysiology of AN in TPM is different in comparison with conventional views, TPM criteria for treatment this disorder is similar to those of current medicine. Recommending to have spiritual support and a healthy lifestyle are common in both views. Simple safe interventions recommended by TPM may be considered as alternative medical modalities after being confirmed by well-designed clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{impairment}} with a decreased glomerular {{filtration rate}} is a classical nephrotoxicity associated with cisplatin (CDDP). Renal salt wasting syndrome (RSWS), which {{is characterized by}} water and salt wasting, is a rare nephrotoxicity associated with CDDP. This syndrome shares many similarities with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Thus, {{it is important to}} differentiate between RSWS and SIADH because the treatment of one affects the pathogenesis of the other. Here, we report a case of RSWS after chemotherapy with CDDP. A 72 -year-old man with bladder urothelial carcinoma (cT 2 N 0 M 0) was admitted to our hospital for the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CDDP and gemcitabine. He was administered intravenous fluids on day 2 before chemotherapy. Five days later, he developed nausea, <b>dysorexia,</b> delirium, hyponatremia (serum sodium level 115 mEq/l), and renal dysfunction. Thus, we administered a normal saline infusion. Over the next 6 days, his serum sodium level increased to 137 mEq/l, and we stopped normal saline infusion. Three days after discontinuation of saline infusion, his serum sodium level again decreased to 128 mEq/l, and the next day, his systolic blood pressure dropped gradually between 70 and 80 mmHg. Therefore, we resumed the normal saline infusion, and after 3 days, his serum sodium level increased to 135 mEq/l and systolic blood pressure ranged between 110 and 130 mmHg. On the basis of dehydration and high urinary sodium excretion at the onset of chemotherapy, we diagnosed this clinical condition as RSWS. We abandoned neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, and performed total cystectomy and ileal conduit. Since 4 months after surgery, he has been free from recurrence and metastasis...|$|E
40|$|History and signalment: A 10 {{years old}} female Doberman of 40 kg of body weight, was {{referred}} to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital for <b>dysorexia</b> and respiratory problems. Diagnostic work: The dog was depressed, with grey mucous membrane, polypneic (respiratory rate > 60 bpm), and heart rate of 123 bpm. At the auscultation no heart murmurs were present but crackles sounds were audible in the thorax. Rectal temperature was 38. 3 °C and non-invasive blood pressure was 128, 102 and 110 mm Hg for systolic, diastolic and mean pressure, respectively. A flow-by oxygen therapy started immediately. A serious pulmonary edema, of suspected cardiogenic origin, was revealed by the x-ray. Arterial blood gas analysis showed severe hypoxia: PaO 2 53 mm Hg, PaCO 2 35 mm Hg, SaO 2 86 %, pH 7. 45. Hematochemical parameters and electrolytes were within the clinical range. Electrocardiogram showed sporadic PVC. Therapy: Furosemide (4 mg/kg) was administered intravenously and a fluid therapy with NaCl 0. 9 % initially started. Butorphanol 0. 25 mg/kg was given IV to decrease the dog discomfort. Continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP) via facemask with the Boussignac valve (VygonTM) was administered starting with a pressure of 2. 5 cm H 2 O. A rubber diaphragm was used to fit the mask to the dog muzzle. A catheter {{was placed in the}} dorsal pedal artery to make serial blood samples for the blood gas analysis. Non-invasive blood pressure was initially monitored every five minutes with oscillometric technique and the electrocardiographic evaluation was continuously performed. A Foley urinary catheter was placed to evaluate the urinary output. Thirty minutes after the starting of the 2. 5 cm H 2 O CPAP ventilation, an arterial blood gas analysis was performed and the oxygenation still resulted low (PaO 2 63 mm Hg). The pressure ventilation was set at 5 cm H 2 O. In the first 60 minutes the arterial blood gas analysis revealed a PaO 2 of 158 mm Hg while in the next 60 minutes it rose to 267 mm Hg. The CPAP was discontinued and oxygen was then administered with a facemask and the blood gas analysis showed a PaO 2 of 97 mm Hg. Because of the clinical amelioration of the status, it was decided to perform CPAP only if PaO 2 would fall under 90 mm Hg. During the night the oxygen therapy was interrupted and the PaO 2 at room air was 85 mm Hg. A blood gas analysis done in the morning demonstrated that the dog oxygenation status was stable (PaO 2 104 mm Hg). Echocardiographic examination confirmed a dilated cardiomyopathy and an appropriate therapy was prescribed. After two days the dog was discharged in good clinical conditions, even if the radiography still showed interstitial pulmonary edema signs. The dog died euthanized seven months later. Discussion: This case report showed that the employment of CPAP ventilation via facemask could be effective in increasing the patient oxygenation during the management of the acute pulmonary edema. The procedure was non-invasive and well tolerated by the patient and no alteration of the blood pressure was registered during the treatment...|$|E
