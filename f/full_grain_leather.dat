Split Kip was split leather and was often used just on the heel (the quarters). The presence of wax and oil made the leather hard, and necessitated a heated Half Round Bottom Glazer for shaping over the last. Kip lasts up to 40 years, but is no longer imported.|$|E
5000|$|The only type {{of leather}} {{suitable}} for carving is vegetable tanned, <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> <b>leather.</b> This {{is because the}} vegetable tanning process allows the leather to absorb water, {{which is used to}} soften the leather before the carving process, and the grain of the leather is necessary to allow the leather to hold the shape after the carving process is complete. Other leathers lack these two essential qualities.While the process of cutting into the leather and pushing the edges of the cuts in is relatively modern, marking wet leather has been around since the Roman period. There are some beautiful examples of Roman leather at Vindolanda near Hadrian's wall and the book [...] "Purses in Pieces" [...] is very informative with some lovely examples of medieval carved leather work. Historically, tools for stamping leather would probably have been made out of bone, but would not have been too different from what we use today.|$|E

Oiling does impart colour and an element of water resistance.

40|$|The shoes {{manufacturing}} {{implies the}} use of various types of leathers, leather substitutes and fabric. The sewing plays {{a very important role}} in shoe making, having an impact both in terms of functionality and outlook. One of the most important indicators of the sewed products quality is seam strength, which is influenced by a series of technological parameters such as: the shape of the needle’s top, the needle’s diameter, the seam thickness, the number of seams, the gauge of the thread, the type of seam and the material type. This paper studies the stitching strength of the <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> and <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> shiny surface used for footwear uppers, in order to improve productivity and seam quality. The experimental researches obtained for the stitching strength allow calculating the weakening coefficient of the material in the process of sewing (a= 0. 33 - 0. 48). The “a” coefficient is dependent on the stitch density, the shape of the needle’s top and the joined materials. In terms of stitching strength, the results indicate that the <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> obtains higher values than the <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> shiny surface. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the technological process for manufacturing a low-cut footwear product (type shoe) for women, for casual use, in an IL system. The paper {{begins with a}} general presentation of the technological process of manufacturing the product, and follows with a case study which details the characteristic operations, {{as well as the}} common ones, which take place during the process. Depending on the structure of the model and the characteristics of the raw and auxiliary materials, the technological process used in the manufacture workshops will be laid-out. Product manufacture begins with cutting the materials, in our case the parts being cut from <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> <b>leather,</b> and the lining from lining leather. After the pieces for {{the upper part of the}} shoe are cut according to the guides, they will be assembled using different methods such as: stitching, gluing or fastening. The guides are processed in order to thin out the edges evenly or in a slant, or to decorate them by bending, burning or painting. For stitching the parts a simple two-thread stitch is used, with one or two seams and back-stitches, and the gluing can be temporary or permanent. In the process the time and production quotas are presented, which are influenced by the qualification level of the workers, as well as the performance of the machines used...|$|E

5000|$|Being a {{man-made}} material, it is washable and retains its softness when wet, unlike natural leather. After many decades of development, Clarino has achieved performance that exceeds that of leather in some applications, especially where the item may {{be exposed to}} water, such as riding saddles. Top <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> applications include [...] "patent leather" [...] shoes that retain high gloss {{without the need for}} polish. During manufacturing it is microscopically perforated to give it breathability similar to that of natural leather. Clarino is based on a non-woven fabric composed of special synthetic fibers that are intertwined three-dimensionally. The material’s softness and suppleness arise from the structure of the non-woven fabric’s special fibers—a superfine fiber construction and tiny cavities.|$|R

50|$|The kidneys appear symmetrically atrophic {{and there}} is a reduced nephron mass. The kidneys have a surface of diffuse, fine {{granularity}} that resembles <b>grain</b> <b>leather.</b> Microscopically, the basic anatomic change consists of hyaline thickening of the walls of the small arteries and arterioles (hyaline arteriolosclerosis). Under a microscope, this appears as a homogeneous, pink hyaline thickening {{at the expense of the}} vessel lumina, with loss of underlying cellular detail. The narrowing of the lumen restricts blood flow, resulting in ischemia. All structures of the kidney can show ischemic atrophy although glomerular ischemic atrophy may be patchy. In advanced cases of benign nephrosclerosis the glomerular tufts may become globally sclerosed. Diffuse tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis are present. Often there is a scant interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate. The larger blood vessels (interlobar and arcuate arteries) show reduplication of internal elastic lamina along with fibrous thickening of the media (fibroelastic hyperplasia) and the subintima.|$|R

40|$|Grain size {{refinement}} can {{be achieved}} by recrystallisation during hot deformation, with multiple deformation steps during rolling or forging being used to generate fine grain sizes. Whilst the mode (or average) grain size after recrystallisation can be determined from standard equations the <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> size distribution is required for predicting a range of mechanical properties. In this work an approach has been proposed to allow prediction of the <b>full</b> <b>grain</b> size distribution by varying the value of the D’ parameter value in the Dutta - Sellars equation developed to predict the recrystallised mode/average grain sizes. It has been found that D’ is a function of strain at high strain values (above 0. 3) and the relative position of the grain size in the grain size range (D*). Results for recrystallised grain size distributions for a range of steel grades (including model Fe - Ni steels, commercial Nb-microalloyed plate and high alloy (9 Cr) forging steel) with different initial grain sizes and following deformation to different deformation strains, show that the predictions give good agreement with the experimental data except for samples with larger mode grain sizes deformed to a strain of 0. 15...|$|R
