5|$|After the storm, {{the island}} was rebuilt with {{investments}} in tourism, shipping, and continued emphasis on higher education and health care. Notably {{the addition of the}} Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier and the replacement of the bascule-type <b>drawbridge</b> on the railroad causeway with a vertical-lift-type <b>drawbridge</b> to allow heavier freight.|$|E
5|$|A bakehouse, {{kitchen and}} chapel are recorded, {{as well as}} the hall, great chamber, and <b>drawbridge,</b> but the details of the {{internal}} layout for the castle are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} {{was entered}} via a <b>drawbridge</b> over an artificial ditch, giving {{access to a}} pend in the small north range.|$|E
50|$|The Sanibel-Captiva Optimists Club {{had held}} a raffle for the {{opportunity}} to be the operator of the <b>drawbridge's</b> machinery for its final opening. A private ceremony was held the day after the current bridge opened to commemorate the <b>drawbridge's</b> final opening. Seasonal Sanibel residents Bob and Ana Finks won the raffle, and they also got to keep the operating lever from the <b>drawbridge's</b> control room as part of the prize.|$|R

5|$|Research {{started by}} Count Gabriel de La Rochefoucauld, {{which had been}} {{interrupted}} by the war, uncovered a buried part of the castle dating to the 12th and 13th centuries, including the room that housed the <b>drawbridge</b> mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The Duchy of Lancaster {{continued}} {{to improve and}} expand the property through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. John of Gaunt had windows glazed in the Communal Hall and the Great Chamber in 1392/3, along with other works. He repaired a <b>drawbridge</b> in 1393/4 and made plumbing improvements in 1399/1400, using lead acquired as a forfeit two years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{summer of}} 1971 ushered in another devastating strike, as over 8,000 workers {{belonging}} to AFSCME District Council 37 walked off their jobs for two days. The strikers included the operators of the city's <b>drawbridges</b> and sewage treatment plants. <b>Drawbridges</b> over the Harlem River {{were locked in}} the [...] "up" [...] position, barring automobile travel into Manhattan, {{and hundreds of thousands}} of gallons of raw sewage flowed into local waterways.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} wooden causeway {{was replaced}} in 1925 {{by a series}} of arch <b>drawbridges</b> and renamed the Venetian Causeway.|$|R

5|$|The {{bridge was}} first {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the Cambrian Line between Aberystwyth and Pwllheli by the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway around 1861-2. It was designed by Benjamin Piercy and Henry Conybeare in 1864, and opened on 10 October 1867. Conybeare decided to construct the viaduct from timber as it would be cheaper to import by sea than iron. As built, it included a wooden lifting <b>drawbridge</b> section at the northern end to permit the passage of tall ships. It was never in regular use since the opening of the railway killed off competition from boat traffic. In 1899, the <b>drawbridge</b> arrangement was changed to the current swing bridge arrangement. It is still theoretically in operation, though it has not been opened since 1987 as part of a test operation.|$|E
5|$|The current {{concrete}} {{stairs to}} the keep are modern, and the original medieval stairway, made from timber and stone, would have incorporated a <b>drawbridge</b> just before the castle doors. The basement contained a well, which could also {{be drawn from the}} 1st floor {{through a hole in the}} stone floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{hexagonal}} Great Tower {{was probably}} {{begun in the}} 1430s and 1440s, possibly on the motte of a previous castle. The tower today has lost not only one of its walls but part of its upper structure, and would originally have been three storeys high with probably additional machicolations on top similar to those on the gatehouse. It {{was designed to be}} a self-contained fortification, with its own water and food supplies, and luxurious quarters lit by large windows on the upper floors. Originally the tower was reached by a bascule <b>drawbridge,</b> usually considered to be drawn from contemporary French designs, such as those at Ferté-Milon and Vannes. This <b>drawbridge</b> was designed to have two parts— a wide, heavy bridge that would be raised or lowered when the family was in residence, and a thinner bridge, easier to lift, designed for the use of servants at other times. The Herberts used the bridge as their badge, and it {{can be seen in the}} carved window designs around the castle. The <b>drawbridge</b> was replaced with a grander stone bridge in the 1460s, probably at a cost of around £900 to £1000. An apron wall with six turrets was also added around the tower at around the same time.|$|E
50|$|Chamber gates {{were often}} {{integrated}} into existing buildings and {{protected by the}} defensive levels above them, by defensive towers or by portcullises and <b>drawbridges.</b>|$|R

5|$|Upon leaving Port Penn, DE 9 heads through {{marshland}} {{with some}} fields and woods within the Augustine Wildlife Area. The route rises onto the Reedy Point Bridge, which carries {{it over the}} Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. After crossing over the canal, the road crosses over Fort DuPont State Park, curving northwest and passing to the southwest of Fort DuPont and the Governor Bacon Health Center. DE 9 continues into Delaware City and becomes 5th Street, crossing the Delaware City Channel on a <b>drawbridge.</b> Past the <b>drawbridge,</b> the road heads through residential {{areas of the city}} and intersects Clinton Street, which leads northeast to the Forts Ferry Crossing which provides access to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island, part of Fort Delaware State Park.|$|E
5|$|According to folklore, the priory {{is haunted}} by {{the ghost of a}} monk in a black habit who returns {{annually}} to check that its buried treasure has not been disturbed. He is said to arrive at midnight on the year's first new moon to lower a ghostly <b>drawbridge</b> spanning a vanished moat. In 1966 and 1967 a hundred people turned out to watch and allegedly managed to spot a cowled figure, but in 1968 the few spectators who turned up saw nothing.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury Castle, {{also known}} as Arlington Castle, was a private house located in {{southwest}} Portland, Oregon and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Constructed during 1929–1931, the house was designed by Jeter O. Frye to resemble England's Canterbury Castle on the exterior and to evoke the Art Deco styling of Hollywood of the 1920s on the interior. The house included castle features such as a moat, <b>drawbridge</b> and turret and attracted paying tourists immediately following its completion.|$|E
50|$|The bridge replaces {{an earlier}} 1911 drawbridge; the current {{structure}} {{was built to}} accommodate the widening of the canal. Like the old Sagamore Bridge, the original <b>drawbridge's</b> approaches are still accessible.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, the two <b>drawbridges</b> on the {{northern}} approach to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, dating to the original twin Skyway bridges, were replaced with high-level fixed spans, eliminating bottlenecks caused by openings.|$|R

5|$|The Gatehouse {{is reached}} across a wooden bridge, {{incorporating}} a <b>drawbridge.</b> Burges intended {{the bridge to}} copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire {{in the event of}} attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive bretache and, above the entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the Madonna and Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1867, and {{originally}} included a <b>drawbridge</b> section at its north end for tall ships to pass, {{though this was}} later replaced by the current swing bridge section. In 1980, woodworm threatened {{the safety of the}} bridge, which needed major repairs to avoid closure. Tolls were collected for foot and cycle traffic until 2013. The bridge is a Grade II* listed structure, and has one of the longest timber viaducts still in regular use in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{external}} work was complete {{by the end of}} 1879. The result closely followed Burges's original plans, with the exception of an additional watch tower intended to resemble a minaret, and some defensive timber hoardings, both of which were not undertaken. Clark continued to advise Burges on historical aspects of the reconstruction and the architect tested the details of proposed features, such as the <b>drawbridge</b> and portcullis, against surviving designs at other British castles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fortified}} gate, rebuilt in the 15th century, is in {{the form}} of a square tower provided with a walkway protected by battlements, breached by a door and a postern formerly defended by <b>drawbridges.</b>|$|R
60|$|Very valiantly did the {{garrison}} oppose themselves to these efforts. But each day showed the progress {{made by the}} besiegers. Their forces had been increased, Prince John having ordered his captain at Gloucester to send another 100 men to the assistance of Sir Rudolph. Other towers had now been prepared. These were larger than the first, and overtopped the castle walls. From the upper story were <b>drawbridges,</b> so formed as to drop from the structures upon the walls, and thus enable the besiegers to rush upon them. The process was facilitated {{by the fact that}} the battlements had been shot away by the great stones, and there was a clear space on which the <b>drawbridges</b> could fall. The attack was made with great vigour; but for a long time the besieged maintained their post, and drove back the assailants as they poured out across the <b>drawbridges</b> on to the wall. At last Cuthbert saw that the forces opposed to him were too numerous to be resisted, and gave orders to his men to fall back upon the inner keep.|$|R
50|$|The Mikhailovsky Castle is a fortified, medieval-style castle {{that was}} built to protect the Russian Tsar Paul I from assassins. Completed in 1800, the castle's {{protective}} features included massive walls and water on all four sides (rivers and canals), with <b>drawbridges</b> that were raised at night and gun emplacements overlooking the <b>drawbridges.</b> The Tsar also had a secret passageway built into the hallway outside his bedroom to enable him to escape if assailants managed {{to get past the}} castle's defences. However, he was never able to use the secret passageway. Forty days after he took up residence in the castle, a group of co-conspirators killed him in his bedroom.|$|R
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle is through the western barbican, an exterior defence {{in front of the}} main gate. When first built, the barbican was reached over a <b>drawbridge</b> and a masonry ramp that came up sharply from the town below; the modern path cuts east along the outside of the walls. The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain, and the gate would originally have been protected by a portcullis.|$|E
5|$|Clare Castle {{was built}} between the River Stour and the Chilton Stream {{and took the}} form of a motte and bailey design, with two baileys rather than the more common one. The motte is 850 feet (259 m) wide at the base and 100 feet (30 m) tall, with its flat summit 63 feet (19 m) across. The two baileys, {{stretching}} alongside from the motte along the north and east, were protected by deep ditches and steep palisades, with either a causeway or a <b>drawbridge</b> linking the inner to the outer bailey; the inner bailey was also sheltered by the curve of the Chilton.|$|E
5|$|Fort Eliza, {{also known}} as The Salt Battery, is a {{freestanding}} five-sided four-gun battery, constructed around 1812, and standing {{on the east side}} of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed of broad parapets. The other two sides meet at the rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The battery is surrounded by a dry moat, with the entrance originally across a <b>drawbridge</b> close to the guardhouse. At the centre of the enclosure was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell's Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from all angles.|$|E
50|$|A fixed link, fixed crossing, or bridge-tunnel is a persistent, {{unbroken}} road or rail connection across {{water that}} uses {{some combination of}} bridges, tunnels, and causeways and does not involve intermittent connections such as <b>drawbridges</b> or ferries.|$|R
50|$|Ankle {{breakers}} {{are small}} but deep holes drilled into <b>drawbridges,</b> stone bridges, and other defensive fortifications, {{in order to}} allow a slow moving party to cross easily, while causing a running person to twist their ankle and fall.|$|R
5|$|The {{town has}} four city gates: two {{that lead to}} the harbor and two (with <b>drawbridges)</b> {{that lead to the}} mainland. During the time period when the Austrian Empire {{controlled}} the city, two more gates were opened in the wall.|$|R
