40|$|Following {{the demand}} {{of the speech}} {{technology}} market, {{a number of companies}} and research laboratories joined their forces in order to produce valuable and reusable resources, especially speech databases. Serving their purpose, the collected databases are used for developing, testing, enhancing and evaluating speech technology products, like <b>interactive</b> <b>voice</b> <b>servers,</b> listening typewriter, speaker verification and identification systems, etc. Especially for capturing intra-speaker variability, the PolyVar database was designed and recorded at IDIAP, as a complement to the Swiss French PolyPhone database, which adresses inter-speaker variability issues. We will detail in the following the specific problems of speech database collection (sampling the speaker population, selection of vocabulary items,...), and will present actual development we carried out at IDIAP throught the PolyPhone and PolyVar databases. 2 IDIAP [...] RR 96 - 01 Contents 1 Introduction 3 2 General overview 3 3 Da [...] ...|$|R

We first explain the terminologies involved such as an <b>interactive</b> <b>voice</b> response system, computer telephony integration, information management, and religious domain. Then we look at how information is managed through an <b>interactive</b> <b>voice</b> response system. IVR application supports two kinds of communications, i. e. real time communication and message type communication. Users could make either a real time communication or a message type communication as needed. Real time communication includes accessing databases {{in order to get}} instant and updated information within the real time during the call is made through the system. Message type communication includes voice mail application using telephone recording. The suitability of using <b>interactive</b> <b>voice</b> response for institution of religious domain is studied, and we also describe a few options for the implementation of the system...|$|R

RESULTS: The cellular approach was comparable to human-administered interviews in reliability and validity and yielded higher self-reported levels of drug use.

40|$|While most users {{currently}} access Web {{applications from}} Web browser interfaces, pervasive computing is emerging and offering {{new ways of}} accessing Internet applications from any device at any location, by utilizing various modes of interfaces to interact with their end users. The PC and its back-end servers remain important in a pervasive system, and the technology could involve new ways of interfacing with a PC and/or various types of gateways to back-end servers. In this research, cellular phone {{was used as the}} pervasive device for accessing an Internet application prototype, a multimodal Web system (MWS), through voice user interface technology. This paper describes how MWS was developed to provide a secure <b>interactive</b> <b>voice</b> channel using an Apache Web <b>server,</b> a <b>voice</b> <b>server,</b> and Java technology. Securing multimodal applications proves more challenging than securing traditional Internet applications. Various standards have been developed within a context of Java 2 Micro Edition (J 2 ME) platform to secure multimodal and wireless applications. In addition to covering these standards and their applicability to the MWS system implementation, this paper also shows that multimodal user-interface page can be generated by using XSLT stylesheet which transforms XML documents into various formats including XHTML, WML, and VoiceXML.
