During the feast, she tells him that she needs to <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a heart. The warlock shows her his beating hairy heart inside a crystal casket in his dungeon. The witch begs him to put it back inside himself. After the warlock does so, she embraces him. However, being {{disconnected}} from its body for so long, his heart has developed savage tastes as it has degenerated into an animalistic state. And so he is driven to take by force a truly human heart.

2500|$|The title {{character}} is a mysterious warrior {{with the head of}} a leopard. He stumbles upon Rinda and Remus being attacked by soldiers and defeats the entire unit single-handedly. He remembers nothing of his past, knowing only his fighting instincts, what he believes is his name, and a word: Aurra.

[...] As of Prisoner of the Lagon, he starts to realize that he really is part of the Destiny reshaping the land.

2500|$|On July 1, 1971, Felt was {{promoted}} by Hoover to Deputy Associate Director, assisting Associate Director Clyde Tolson. Hoover's right-hand man for decades, Tolson was in failing health {{and no longer}} able to attend to his duties. Richard Gid Powers wrote that Hoover installed Felt to rein in William C. Sullivan's domestic spying operations, as Sullivan had been engaged in secret unofficial work for the White House. In his memoir, Felt quoted Hoover as having said, [...] "I need someone who can control Sullivan. I think you <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been getting out of hand." [...] In his book, The Bureau, Ronald Kessler said that Felt [...] "managed to please Hoover by being tactful with him and tough on agents."

Pretty much everyone goes there whether or not they're Jewish. They just seem to pass through there on their way to Florida". Celebrities featured on Who Do You Think You Are? including Stephen Fry, Jerry Springer and Natasha Kaplinsky, have traced their family histories back to Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Second World War. The BBC released a statement: “Anyone who listens to the Chris Moyles Show will <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> an irreverent style.

Bejo brings out the assailants from the prison riot, who Uco proceeds to kill before noticing a distinctive gang tattoo on Benny's wrist. The duo hatch a plot to start a gang war to disrupt the truce between the two families, allowing Uco to prove himself to Bangun, and Bejo {{to profit from the}} chaos, as they carve up Hideaki Goto's territory. Uco lures Prakoso into an ambush at a nightclub, where he's ultimately killed by The Assassin, then lies to his father the Japanese were responsible. Failing to sway Bangun into a counterattack, the frustrated Uco phones Bejo to [...] "Just do it" [...] anyway. Bejo's elite hitmen – the deaf-mute Hammer Girl, her brother Baseball Bat Man, and The Assassin – proceed to kill several of Goto's men, sparking a gang war between the families.|$|E

2500|$|Fisher's aim was 'efficiency of {{the fleet}} and its instant {{readiness}} for war', which won him support amongst {{a certain kind of}} navy officer. He believed in advancing the most able, rather than the longest serving. This upset those he passed over. Thus, he divided the navy into those who approved of his innovations and those who did not. As he became older and more senior he also became more autocratic and commented, 'Anyone who opposes me, I crush'. He believed that nations fought wars for material gain, and that maintaining a strong navy deterred other nations from engaging it in battle, thus decreasing the likelihood of war: [...] On the British fleet rests the British Empire. Fisher also believed that the risk of catastrophe in a sea battle was far greater than on land: a war could be lost or won in a day at sea, with no hope of replacing lost ships, but an army could be rebuilt quickly. When an arms race broke out between Germany and Britain to build larger navies, the German Kaiser commented, 'I admire Fisher, I say nothing against him. If I were in his place I should do all that he has done and I should do all that I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> in mind to do'.|$|E
2500|$|In early March 1943 the {{provision}} of electric power for the lighting in the internees' compounds was halted. This was a serious blow as the radio was run off the power supply. Batteries were unavailable and so the only solution, again the idea of Russell, was to construct a generator. His idea again met with some initial scepticism: [...] "Now I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> gone mad", wrote Pringle. Pringle’s colleagues were more enthusiastic. Beckett was sure he could build the generator and British RAOC personnel were certain they could supply the necessary components, though {{they thought it would}} take three months to make the tools needed. To disguise the noise of the work the enterprise was described as a [...] "watch repairing factory" [...] to the Japanese, who offered the use of various tools and other equipment. In March 1943, after the execution of some prisoners at the Sandakan POW camp for operating a radio, the Japanese stepped up their searches at Batu Lintang. Many items essential for the construction of the generator such as magnets, wire, and scrap iron were not easily available, but the involvement of [...] "Freddie", one of the prisoners who was a self-confessed thief (and most likely the same man who sorted the power supply: records are unclear) meant that material and equipment was soon obtained.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson is infamously {{difficult}} to interview, rarely ever giving a long answer. According to Salon writer Peter Gilstrap: [...] "He’s also {{been known to}} get up, extend a hand and blurt out 'Thanks!' well before the allotted time is up. And sometimes he just gets tired and shuts down. None of this, however, {{is due to a}} bad attitude." [...] He admits to having a poor memory, and in interviews, occasionally lies to [...] "test" [...] people. David Oppenheim, who interviewed Wilson in 1966, remembers that [...] "we tried to talk with him but didn't get much out of him. Some guy said 'He's not verbal.' He was odd and he seemed odder." [...] In 2017, the Charlotte Observers Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still [...] "is faring well enough to write a book ... and to headline [...] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling people who work for him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't." [...] When asked about negative comments written in the book, Love responded: [...] "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a lot of issues. Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the various}} modern {{language}} departments were introduced into American {{universities in the}} 1880s, speakers at {{the first meeting of}} the Modern Language Association in 1883 had been concerned to counter the popular perception that “English literature is a subject for the desultory reader in his leisure hours rather than an intellectual study for serious workers", a mere [...] "accomplishment", whereas when “a boy studies Greek you <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> worked hard”. Philology [...] "met the desire for facts, for accuracy, and for the imitation of the scientific method which had acquired such an overwhelming prestige" [...] in the United States. It had yielded the discoveries of the Grimms and others, tracing the step-by-step relationships of classical and modern European to ancient Indian languages and their evolutionary development. A former Harvard graduate student James H. Hanford, reminisced how under Kittredge, Students were expected to talk in a scholarly way in the classroom and on a final examination about Grimm’s or Verner's laws, the differentiating characteristics of Anglo-Saxon among the Teutonic languages, the changes in English phonology, inflection, and syntax from Anglo-Saxon times to the sixteenth century, the influence of Danish, French and Latin on the English language in its various periods. But these phases of language development were closely associated with the entire cultural history of which they were a part. The philologist is the person who makes his approach to the past through the phenomenon of language. “In the beginning was the word”.The objective was the equipment of a man of real erudition, about whose professional and scientific status there should be no doubt and who could hold up his head in pride among his fellows in the older and more reputable field of classics[...] [...] [...] Source and background study, so decried by [...] critics of the philological regime, was conceived of both as a means of interpretation and as an independent contribution to cultural history.|$|E
