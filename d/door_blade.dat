5000|$|A unique [...] "roll-up" [...] system {{generally}} {{defines a}} high-speed door from a conventional roller door. The door's main {{objective is to}} produce a high opening speed and the guiding system must allow smooth operations with minimal friction. Effortless movement will ensure the longevity of the door's moving parts and operating soundness. The latest versions of high quality high-speed doors use a spiral guiding system, thus keeping the <b>door</b> <b>blade</b> apart through a whole operating cycle, ensuring effortless movement of the door's roller devices in the guiding system and contributing to the excessive high speed. Excessive because these doors, by opening so fast and closing very slowly, {{are just trying to}} avoid getting their rigid closing edge caught by a forklift, {{at the expense of the}} insulation.|$|E
40|$|In D 2. 1. 3. a, {{simulation}} models are built for different bus design {{in order to}} find a optimal bus layout in terms of dwell time and passenger flow. The simulation result shows that layout 4 is the optimal one compared to other layouts. The main features of layout 4 are centre driver position and short front overhang, double doors with large <b>door</b> <b>blade</b> and flexible seat type in front car. It is also shown that dwell time can be reduced when ticket machines are positioned far away from the door (on {{the opposite side of the}} aisle), compared to the results when the ticket machines are positioned near by the door. Physical bus mockups are built in order to evaluate how different bus layouts affect dwell times and passengers’ experiences. It shows that the addition of the 4 th door is positive. The experiment allowing passengers to only enter through the front door, however, increases dwell times...|$|E

Door {{recognition is}} a key problem to be solved during mobile robot navigation. Doors give access to many locations that are defined as goals for the robot. This paper presents an approach to door identification by means of recognition of the door handle.

5000|$|The first safety razor {{using the}} new {{disposable}} blade went on sale in 1903. Gillette maintained a limited range of models of this new type razor until 1921 when the original Gillette patent expired. In anticipation of the event, Gillette introduced a redesigned razor and offered it {{at a variety of}} prices in different cases and finishes, including the long running “aristocrat". Gillette continued to sell the original razor but instead of pricing it at $5, it was priced at $1, making a Gillette razor truly affordable to every man regardless of economic class. In 1932 the Gillette Blue Blade, so-named because it was dipped in blue lacquer, was introduced. It {{became one of the most}} recognizable blades in the world. In 1934 the [...] "Twist to Open" [...] (TTO) design, was intuitionistic. It featured butterfly-like <b>doors</b> that made <b>blade</b> changing much easier than it had been, wherein the razor head had to be detached from the handle.|$|R
40|$|A model {{supersonic}} inlet with auxiliary inlet {{doors and}} boundary layer bleeds was acoustically tested in simulated low speed flight up to Mach 0. 2 in the NASA Lewis 9 x 15 Anechoic Wind Tunnel and statically in the NASA Lewis Anechoic Chamber. A JT 8 D refan model {{was used as}} the noise source. Data were also taken for a CTOL inlet and for an annular inlet with simulated centerbody support struts. Inlet operation with open auxiliary <b>doors</b> increased the <b>blade</b> passage tone by about 10 dB relative to the closed door configuration although noise radiation was primarily through the main inlet rather than the doors. Numerous strong spikes in the noise spectra were associated with the bleed system, and were strongly affected by the centerbody location. The supersonic inlet appeared to suppress multiple pure tone (MPT) generation at the fan source. Inlet length and the presence of support struts were shown not to cause this MPT suppression.

50|$|The Okhotnik {{is based}} on a low beam {{carrying}} seats, cabin, engine and tail. The three seats are arranged with the pilot alone in front and two close placed seats behind. The engine and rotor pylon are immediately behind the rear seats. The cabin of the Okhotnik 2M and 3 variants is rounded and largely glazed, with side access <b>doors.</b> A two <b>blade</b> rotor with a gust-correcting vane just below its hub rotates freely above a support pylon, though it can be hydraulically pre-rotated for jump starts. The Subaru engine drives a five blade propeller of radius 950 mm (37.4 in), its tips passing close to the fuselage beam. Two tall, narrow chord tail surfaces are mounted {{at the end of this}} beam, at right angles to it but splaying outwards to form a V-Tail. They are supported at the top by an arched transverse member, itself attached by straight struts to the rotor pylon. On the Okhotnik 3 the top of a third, vertical and forward leaning tail surface is attached to this arch, its lower end held aft of the other tail surfaces on a strut to the fuselage beam.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the Reynolds number is for certain aeroelastic and aerodynamic phenomena of high significance, in particular in case the flow is dominated by massive separation areas, like bluff body flows. These kind of flows are broadly represented in our daily life, e. g. in the aerospace industry (landing gear <b>doors,</b> propeller <b>blades</b> of single turboprops or piston twin aircrafts during start or landing), civil engineering (overhead transmission lines, bridge decks, pillars of semi-submerged offshore structures) or in wind engineering (blade-tower interactions and deep dynamic stall). The structures are subject to fluid-structure interactions, which in many cases lead to flow-induced vibrations like galloping or flutter and, in case of large amplitudes, even to damage of parts {{or failure of the}} complete construction. In order to minimize or even suppress those undesired flow-induced vibrations, it is of great concern to understand in detail the unsteady three-dimensional flow characteristics around these structures. For that purpose a new test section was designed and built to be implemented inside the High-Pressure Wind Tunnel Gottingen, a test facility in which the air pressure can be increased up to 100 bar to simulate realistic flow conditions at Reynolds numbers up to 10 million. The test section consists out of two torque motors that are used to either set and maintain a steady angle of incidence within 0 and 359 deg or to let the two-dimensional wind tunnel model perform a forced pitching motion with amplitudes of up to +/- 15 deg at maximum pitching frequencies of 15 Hz (i. e. reduced frequencies of k 1) around a certain steady angle of incidence. A piezo-electric balance is placed {{at both ends of the}} model outside the test section in order to obtain the unsteady aerodynamic lift and drag forces and pitching moment The coupled fluid-structure responses of the wind tunnel models, having a span of 600 mm and a maximum chord length of 120 mm, can be obtained by a combination of the balances and up to 60 unsteady pressure sensors and accelerometers integrated in the model...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{people often}} talk about {{biologic}} agriculture and Integrated Production (IP), {{even if the}} real meaning of these terms is altered. In both cases, they deal with production methods characterized by a {{particular attention to the}} reduction of the environmental impact of all the farm practices used, especially for defence from adversities, being the element of major concern for environment and consumers&rsquo; health. Farm practice evolution, especially those about pest defence, is based on important conceptual change, accurate scientific analysis and organization of technical assistance, rationalization of agri-pharmaceutical product use {{is one of the main}} objective of Integrated Production Specifications (IPS). The quantitative reduction is the first objective, obtained by various means such as the use of efficient equipment and the qualitative selection based on the priority use of minor impact means, effectiveness being equal. At post-harvest, the anti-parasitary defence is undergoing deep changes in our country. Once, pesticides very toxic and persistent were used; however, in the last years the availability of active principles (a. p.) usable on foodstuffs or in productive environments; for instance, methyl bromide use has been progressively reduced till its banishment because it is recognized to damage the ozone layer. Thus, on the whole we can talk about &ldquo;integrated pest management&rdquo; even for the post-harvest sector. However, substantial differences exist between agriculture and post-harvest, thus the integrated pest management in food production environment has to be designed in a different way. The fundamental element of this technique is to identify a tolerance threshold to pest attack but for the defence of food industries and stored foodstuffs is very difficult, if not impossible, to fix a limit to insect presence after which intervening is compulsory. Monitoring of pest attacks and the implementation of prevention practices is fundamental; in post-harvest sector this activity can be carried out checking first matters to be stored and used by suitable analysis, as well as modifying systems, department structure, installing double <b>door</b> and air <b>blade</b> barriers, laying of pavements with special epoxy paints, replacing the traditional electric raceways with others, totally opened, steel grated, vertical and surely less delicate. As stated above, integrated pest management is a well estabilished technique, even if under continuous refinement; at post-harvest we are in a still transitory phase at the moment. However, industry are making great efforts to give consumers foods protected against pest attacks along the whole productive row, with strict hygienic and safety criteria...|$|R
