40|$|Collateral {{circulation}} in intracranial atherosclerosis {{has never been}} systematically characterized. We investigated collaterals in a multicenter trial of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Baseline angiography was reviewed for <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>collaterals</b> in stenoses of the internal carotid, middle cerebral, vertebral, and basilar arteries. A battery of angiographic scales was utilized to evaluate lesion site, arterial patency, antegrade flow, downstream territorial perfusion, and collateral circulation, blinded to all other data. Collateral circulation was adequately available for analysis in 287 / 569 (50 %) subjects with proximal arterial stenoses ranging from 50 % to 99 %. Extent of collaterals was absent or none in 69 %, slow or minimal in 10 %, more rapid, yet incomplete perfusion of territory in 7 %, complete but delayed perfusion in 11 %, and rapid, complete collateral perfusion in 4 %. Extent of collateral flow correlated with percentage of stenosis (P< 0. 0001), with more severe stenoses exhibiting greater compensation via collaterals. Overall, collateral grade increased with diminished antegrade flow across the lesion (thrombolysis in myocardial ischemia) and resultant downstream perfusion (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction) (both P< 0. 001). Our findings provide the initial detailed description of collaterals {{across a variety of}} stenoses, suggesting that collateral perfusion is a pivotal component in pathophysiology of intracranial atherosclerosis and implicating the need for further evaluation in ongoing studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we focus on}} firms’ access to credit under {{different}} sources of asymmetric information. In Chapter 1 we analyze how the institution of debt discharge of bankruptcy law affects loan contracts. In particular we evaluates the effects of debt discharge on access to credit and cost of credit by taking into account {{its impact on the}} role of collateral as a signaling device. In the theoretical model we take explicitly into account the fact that borrowers can undo the effects of exemption by posting collateral to secure debt. Using the results of the theoretical analysis we test for the signaling effect of collateral in a sample of US small businesses. In Chapter 2 we study the emergence of the phenomenon of firms’ bor- rowing discouragement. This becomes a relevant issue in the credit market especially when credit worthy firms do not apply causing a po- tential misallocation of financial resources. Regarding this aspect of access to credit, our work aims to give a new theoretical view of bor- rowing discouragement stemming from the interaction between asym- metric <b>information,</b> uncertainty <b>on</b> <b>collateral</b> requirements and cost of applications. In Chapter 3 we study the importance of using trade credit to reduce the information asymmetries between firms and banks. Under this per- spective trade credit is a complementary financing resource. We test the complementarity hypothesis using an empirical methodology that takes into account the relevance of private information in the firm-bank relationship. </br...|$|R

While patients with 22 q 11 deletion {{were more likely to}} have collateral origin from brachiocephalic vessels, patients without 22 q 11 deletion {{were more likely to have}} collateral origin from the descending aorta. There was no significant difference in arch sidedness or the presence of central pulmonary arteries. Patients with 22 q 11 deletion were more likely to have an aberrant subclavian artery (15 / 46 vs 5 / 54, p < 0. 05), whether a left or right arch was present. Nine of the fifteen 22 q 11 deletion patients had a collateral originating from an aberrant subclavian artery. In time, genomic and embryologic research may help determine the exact mechanisms by which 22 q 11 deletion contributes to the development of congenital heart disease such as pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collaterals...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prognostic}} {{relevance of}} the collateral circulation is still controversial. The goal {{of this study was}} to assess the impact on survival of quantitatively obtained, recruitable coronary collateral flow in patients with stable coronary artery disease during 10 years of follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight-hundred forty-five individuals (age, 62 +/- 11 years), 106 patients without coronary artery disease and 739 patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease, underwent a total of 1053 quantitative, coronary pressure-derived collateral measurements between March 1996 and April 2006. All patients were prospectively included in a collateral flow index (CFI) database containing <b>information</b> <b>on</b> recruitable <b>collateral</b> flow parameters obtained during a 1 -minute coronary balloon occlusion. CFI was calculated as follows: CFI = (P(occl) - CVP) /(P(ao) - CVP) where P(occl) is mean coronary occlusive pressure, P(ao) is mean aortic pressure, and CVP is central venous pressure. Patients were divided into groups with poorly developed (CFI or = 0. 25). Follow-up <b>information</b> <b>on</b> the occurrence of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events after study inclusion was collected. Cumulative 10 -year survival rates in relation to all-cause deaths and cardiac deaths were 71 % and 88 %, respectively, in patients with low CFI and 89 % and 97 % in the group with high CFI (P= 0. 0395, P= 0. 0109). Through the use of Cox proportional hazards analysis, the following variables independently predicted elevated cardiac mortality: age, low CFI (as a continuous variable), and current smoking. CONCLUSIONS: A well-functioning coronary collateral circulation saves lives in patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease. Depending on the exact amount of collateral flow recruitable during a brief coronary occlusion, long-term cardiac mortality is reduced to one fourth compared with the situation without collateral supply...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The shadow {{banking system}} {{played a major role}} in the recent {{financial}} crisis but remains largely unregulated. We propose principles for its regulation and describe a specific proposal to implement those principles. We document how the rise of shadow banking was helped by regulatory and legal changes that gave advantages to three main institutions: money-market mutual funds (MMMFs) to capture retail deposits from traditional banks, securitization to move assets of traditional banks off their balance sheets, and repurchase agreements (repos) that facilitated the use of securitized bonds as money. The evolution of a bankruptcy safe harbor for repos was crucial to the growth and efficiency of shadow banking; regulators can use access to this safe harbor as the lever to enforce new rules. History has demonstrated two successful methods for regulating privately created money: strict guidelines <b>on</b> <b>collateral,</b> and government-guaranteed insurance. We propose the use of insurance for MMMFs, combined with strict guidelines <b>on</b> <b>collateral</b> for both securitization and repos, with regulatory control established by chartering new forms o...|$|R

For this we used two hindlimb ischemia models to dissect the impact of different repair processes <b>on</b> <b>collateral</b> function. Ligation of the femoral artery increases shear stress in the muscular branch and results in outward remodeling and arteriogenesis. In contrast, resection of the femoral artery proximal to the muscular branch induces blood flow divergence and neutral remodeling along with expectedly greater hypoxia and inflammation. On day 14 after each surgery the diameter of the muscular branch was measured using sidestream dark field (SDF) imaging before and after gracilis muscle stimulation. A slight, but not statistically significant, impairment in functional vasodilation was observed in ligated mice (69 ± 10 % average diameter increase compared to 74 ± 7 % average diameter increase). Resected mice exhibited slightly (not statistically significant) enhanced collateral artery functional vasodilation (104 ± 16 % average diameter increase) but were also refractory to the restoration of resting vascular tone following the cessation of stimulation. Outward remodeling did not significantly impair vascular function, whereas neutral remodeling and tissue hypoxia induced impaired vascular tone...|$|R

40|$|The recent use of vasodilators {{to improve}} {{ventricular}} function in {{acute myocardial infarction}} led us to investigate the effects of nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, and phentolamine <b>on</b> coronary <b>collateral</b> flow. Dogs were studied 2 - 4 wk after an ameroid constrictor was placed around the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Retrograde flow and peripheral coronary pressure were measured from a cannula inserted in the LAD distal to the ameroid. Systemic arterial pressure was held constant by an aortic cuff. When administered intracoronary (i. c.), nitroglycerin, 0. 3 - 100 μg/min, or nitroprusside, 3 - 100 μg/min, produced quantitatively similar, dose-dependent increases in retrograde flow. Neither drug, i. c., changed peripheral coronary pressure. Nitroglycerin, 3 - 300 μg/min, intravenous (i. v.), produced dose-dependent increases in retrograde flow; nitroprusside, i. v., increased retrograde flow only in high doses (100 - 300 μg/min). Nitroglycerin and nitroprusside, i. v., produced similar increases in peripheral coronary pressure. Phentolamine, 1 - 300 μg/min, i. v., decreased retrograde flow, and did not change peripheral coronary pressure. Nitroprusside was considerably more potent than nitroglycerin in decreasing systemic arterial pressure and in reducing total coronary resistance. Thus, (a) although i. c. nitroglycerin and nitroprusside produce similar effects <b>on</b> <b>collateral</b> function, i. v. nitroglycerin {{is more effective than}} i. v. nitroprusside in augmenting collateral flow; (b) phentolamine has deleterious effects <b>on</b> <b>collateral</b> function; and (c) the relative vasodilator potencies of nitroglycerin and nitroprusside vary in different vascular beds; thus, for a given reduction in systemic arterial pressure, nitroprusside is less effective in increasing retrograde flow...|$|R
