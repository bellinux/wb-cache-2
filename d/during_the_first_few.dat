5|$|Bergen {{remained}} a quiet base <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> {{years of the}} occupation, experiencing only one large Allied air attack. In 1943, the U-boat base added two new bunkers, U-Stützpunkt Prien and U-Stützpunkt Weddingen along with a shipyard named Danziger Werft.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> years, the emigrants {{were mostly}} former {{occupants}} of Nauvoo who were following Young to Utah. Later, the emigrants increasingly comprised converts from the British Isles and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Channel 4 {{was also}} accused of showing too many studio {{segments}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> {{days of the}} Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where Eleanor Simmonds set a new personal best and almost beat the world record, Sarah Storey winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain's opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days to explain Paralympic events and the classification system to viewers, {{and that it was}} operating three additional channels' worth of live coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated that it had to make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress. The amount of live coverage was also affected by Olympic Broadcasting Services, who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4's news department did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.|$|E
50|$|While the MP3 format has near-universal {{hardware}} and software support, primarily due to MP3 being the format of choice <b>during</b> <b>the</b> crucial <b>first</b> <b>few</b> years of widespread music file-sharing/distribution over the internet, AAC is a strong contender due to some unwavering industry support.|$|R
50|$|The {{hormonal}} {{endocrine control}} system drives milk production <b>during</b> pregnancy and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days after <b>the</b> birth. When the milk supply is more firmly established, autocrine (or local) control system begins.|$|R
25|$|Although the Midshipmen {{dominated}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> quarter statistically, three turnovers {{prevented the}} team from scoring <b>during</b> <b>the</b> game's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> drives. Midshipmen fullback Eric Kettani finished the game with 125 yards on 12 carries, averaging 10.4 yards per carry, finishing one yard short of his season-best of 126 yards in a loss to the Ball State Cardinals earlier that year.|$|R
5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{official}} student government <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> decades at Georgia Tech, the ANAK society acted as an unofficial student government and proposed an Honor Code, modeled on that of West Point's, in 1908. ANAK worked to set up a more formal organization, the Student Council (later the Student Government Association), in 1922, at which point it relinquished any decision-making privileges it had over the student body.|$|E
5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation {{is known as}} dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort to}} develop a lighter, quieter camera with a reflex {{viewfinder}} led {{to the introduction of}} the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a shutter angle of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> years after its introduction, and it soon {{became one of the most}} popular studio cameras in the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.|$|E
5000|$|A {{major source}} of {{contention}} about the game is the difficulty of <b>the</b> combat, especially <b>during</b> <b>the</b> game's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> hours. Some sources such as Eurogamer have praised {{the difficulty of the}} prologue, explaining [...] "game treats you not as a player... but as an adult, free to make your own mistakes and suffer a plot in which not everyone gets what they deserve".|$|R

5000|$|D.C. United was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{franchise}} {{awarded by}} MLS, {{and was the}} dominant team in MLS <b>during</b> <b>the</b> league's <b>first</b> <b>few</b> years of existence. For those reasons, United is often regarded as MLS's [...] "flagship franchise".

The team has also won three U.S. Open Cup titles and a CONCACAF title.|$|R
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days {{in addition to}} antibiotics {{to help with the}} burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E
5|$|The site of Ashdod in the Bronze Age and Iron Ages {{was at a}} tell {{just south}} of the modern city. It was {{excavated}} by archaeologists in nine seasons between 1962 and 1972. The effort was led <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> years by David Noel Freedman of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and Moshe Dothan. The remaining seasons were headed by Dothan for the Israel Antiquities Authority.|$|E
5|$|Chiprovtsi {{is thought}} to have been founded in the Late Middle Ages as a mining and metalsmithing centre. Attracting German ore miners who {{introduced}} Roman Catholicism to the area, the town grew in importance as a cultural, economic and religious centre of the Bulgarian Catholics and the entire Bulgarian northwest <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> centuries of Ottoman rule. The apogee of this upsurge was the anti-Ottoman Chiprovtsi Uprising of 1688. After the suppression of the uprising, some of the town's population fled to Habsburg-ruled lands; those unable to flee were killed or enslaved by the Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> {{months after}} the election, Modi made trips {{to a number of}} {{different}} countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits. One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> months, {{the wing}} was not {{assigned}} any aircraft, and thus worked with other units {{who were in}} possession of the B-36 Peacemaker. In March and April, the base began preparing for operations of the B-36, which arrived later in April. This gave the newly activated 69th Bombardment Squadron {{a full complement of}} aircraft. By the end of August, the number had increased to 27 bombers, 322 officers, 313 airmen, and 350 civilians. Additionally, more buildings were constructed on base, making it more of a home for airmen and their families.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} days of July, the 24th Infantry {{generally}} tried to hold positions during the day, and then withdrew at night. Their performance was mixed; <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> North Korean attacks, most units held positions until they ran out of ammunition. Higher officers attempted to move the units back in position but were unsuccessful in the face of mounting North Korean resistance. Notably, L Company fought until surrounded by North Korean attackers; the rest of the regiment was able to drive them off.|$|E

During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> five ABC broadcasts, the title track was a shortened version of Louis Armstrong's [...] "What A Wonderful World". The closing theme that Frederick and Salvay wrote and recorded was a melody loosely based on [...] "What A Wonderful World", featuring a more uptempo beat dominated by saxophone and culminating in an orchestral crescendo.|$|R
5000|$|A popular feature <b>during</b> <b>the</b> {{stations}} <b>first</b> <b>few</b> months, Pirate Radio {{would invite}} listeners {{to call the}} station and [...] "flush your former station" [...] on the air.

5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> months of life.|$|E

5|$|In general, in the Solar System, {{planetary}} {{formation is}} thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> million years of the Solar System's history, an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become planetesimals.
