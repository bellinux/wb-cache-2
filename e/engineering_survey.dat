The issue was resolved {{to the satisfaction of}} the trust's auditors, VAB and the Charity Commissioners, although the crisis was estimated to have cost £31,500 in lost income, £150,000 in management time, and a 5 figure sum for an independent <b>engineering</b> <b>survey.</b> In addition, it was estimated to have put back the completion date for Tornado by 2 years.|$|E
25|$|The High Wycombe Society, a local {{conservation}} group, has {{campaigned for}} the last 14 years for the reinstatement of the line as Light rail, the feasibility of which was confirmed by an <b>engineering</b> <b>survey</b> of the route. In September 2008, Buckinghamshire County Council backed the proposal for reinstatement and called upon a private operator to finance the rebuilding work. The future of the route was raised at a planning hearing in November at which Wycombe District Council identified the prospect of reinstatement {{as a reason for}} refusing a planning application to construct housing over the trackbed at Wycombe Lane, Wooburn Green. A previous application for the same development was rejected in 2006 and the Council's decision was upheld on appeal to the planning inspector. In January 2009, the second attempt to build on the route of the railway line was rejected by the Planning Inspectorate which specifically cited the possible future reinstatement of the line as a reason for refusing consent.|$|E
25|$|Velator Quay and the {{surrounding}} area is used as a mooring for small boats. In 2006 Braunton council blocked vehicular access to the quay as it was found to be in danger of collapse. An <b>engineering</b> <b>survey</b> was conducted on the quay in 2010, by consultants Bolgar Sykes, as the council were hoping to make it more of an amenity. The survey revealed several possible options for repair, ranging in cost from £80,000 to £400,000. The limited budget available to the council for such work meant that only basic repairs were considered. A subsequent report by Peter Lord, one of the parish counsellors, recommended that demolition of the quay would be the best long-term option, with the provision of a slipway to assist boat owners. The quay is widely held to be a free port, this status having been awarded to Barnstaple seamen who fought against the Spanish Armada. However, the report highlighted {{the fact that this is}} likely to be just a local legend, as the quay was not constructed until 300 years after the event.|$|E
40|$|The {{internet}} service Competence Centre for <b>Engineering</b> <b>Surveying</b> (CCES) is {{a platform for}} a knowledge-based management system for the <b>surveying</b> <b>engineering</b> profession. CCES presents {{an overview of the}} numerous areas of activities in <b>engineering</b> <b>surveying.</b> In addition to application possibilities and guidelines, this {{internet service}} offers a collection of working groups associated with <b>engineering</b> <b>surveying.</b> It addresses mainly people from outside the profession to give them an idea of what the <b>engineering</b> <b>surveying</b> profession can offer in specific areas. One of the main aims of knowledge management is to establish an appropriate framework to support the optimal development and application of knowledge. CCES could be such a framework in <b>engineering</b> <b>surveying.</b> CCES is a basic model of knowledge management in <b>engineering</b> <b>surveying</b> with action, knowledge and data levels. This paper explains the motivation for such an information exchange model, the basics of the conception phase and some achievements so far.

Renovations were originally expected to cost $750,000 and begin in early 2011, with a 12-month completion time. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation granted $150,000 toward the renovation.

500|$|In February 1864, {{plans were}} in place to extend {{the route of the}} {{proposed}} Wallkill Valley Railroad between the towns of Shawangunk and New Paltz. A civil <b>engineering</b> <b>survey</b> to determine a possible route and cost of such an endeavor was undertaken in March of that year. The proposal sparked a controversy as to whether the route would run east or west of the Wallkill River in New Paltz. The western route was roughly [...] shorter, and the eastern route would cost $25,000 more. However, it was felt that the increased economic activity from having the rail line run east of the river, and directly through the village of New Paltz, would offset the expense. Bonding for the rail line through New Paltz, at a cost of $123,000, was completed by January 1869. The Wallkill Valley Railroad was the first rail line in Ulster County, and was heralded as a cure for the region's isolation {{from the rest of the}} industrialized world.|$|E

For medical students, it was called premedical course, and consisted of the study of: botany, zoology, chemistry and physics at advanced level. According to one of Nwokolo‟s contemporaries at Yaba Higher College: Pius Okigbo, who entered in 1941, Nwokolo was [...] "studious, serious, somewhat shy, and witty without ostentation or exuberance" [...] Two notable Nigerians on the teaching staff who provided mentorship to Nwokolo and served as role models were: Titus Seye Ejiwunmi and Michael Etikerentse Okorodudu. Most of the students that went to Government College Umuahia went on to Yaba College which was the only science-based institution of higher learning at the time.|$|E
