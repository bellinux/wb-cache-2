5|$|Fortunately for {{the future}} of the Spitfire, many of the {{production}} jigs and machine tools had already been relocated by 20 September, and steps were being taken to disperse production to small facilities throughout the Southampton area. To this end, the British government requisitioned the likes of Vincent's Garage in Station Square Reading, which later specialised in manufacturing Spitfire fuselages, and Anna Valley Motors, Salisbury, which was to become the sole producer of the wing leading-edge fuel tanks for photo-reconnaissance Spitfires, as well as producing other components. A purpose-built works, specialising in manufacturing fuselages and installing engines, was built at Star Road, Caversham <b>in</b> <b>Reading.</b> <b>The</b> drawing office in which all Spitfire designs were drafted was relocated to Hursley Park, near Southampton. This site also had an aircraft assembly hangar where many prototype and experimental Spitfires were assembled, but since it had no associated aerodrome no Spitfires ever flew from Hursley.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 {{release of}} Jaojoby's first {{full-length}} album, titled Salegy!, was facilitated by fRoots magazine editor Ian Anderson, {{who had worked}} with Jaojoby to record several of his tracks for a radio broadcast two years previously. Jaojoby's second album, Velono, was the first salegy album to be recorded in France, as well as the first of his albums to be produced in a professional-quality recording studio. Following the 1994 release of Velono, Jaojoby became a regular on the international music festival circuit and has performed at such events as WOMAD <b>in</b> <b>Reading,</b> <b>the</b> Festival du Bout du Monde in Brittany, WOMEX in Spain, the Festival des Musiques Métisses in Angoulême, the MASA Festival in Abidjan, and similar events in Germany, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Jaojoby's excitement over his rise to international celebrity was attenuated by the 1995 death of the band's original drummer, Jean-Claude Djaonarana, who had first performed with Jaojoby as a member of Los Matadores.|$|E

But I have seen it on the stage and found it a moving experience. Why? In watching Titus Andronicus we come to understand – perhaps more than by looking at any other Shakespeare play – the nature of his genius: he gave an inner awareness to passions; cruelty ceased to be merely physical. Shakespeare discovered the moral hell. He discovered heaven as well. But he remained on earth.|$|E

25|$|Motivated by the {{publication}} of Evelyn's Diary, Lord Granville deciphered a few pages.

Others had apparently succeeded <b>in</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> diary earlier, perhaps knowing about the key, because a work of 1812 quotes from a passage of it.

25|$|While {{acting as}} Governor of Xuzhou, Su Shi in 1078 AD wrote a {{memorial}} to the imperial court about problems faced in the Liguo Industrial Prefecture which was under his watch and administration. In an interesting and revealing passage about the Chinese iron industry during {{the latter half of}} the 11th century, Su Shi wrote about the enormous size of the workforce employed in the iron industry, competing provinces that had rival iron manufacturers seeking favor from the central government, as well as the danger of rising local strongmen who had the capability of raiding the industry and threatening the government with effectively armed rebellion. It also becomes clear <b>in</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> text that prefectural government officials in Su's time often had to negotiate with the central government in order to meet the demands of local conditions.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, some Loyalist clergy were defiant. In Connecticut, John Beach {{conducted}} worship {{throughout the}} war and swore that he would continue praying for the king.

Charles Inglis, rector of Trinity Church in New York, persisted <b>in</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> royal prayers even when George Washington was seated in his congregation and a Patriot militia company stood by observing the service. The consequences of such bravado were very serious. During 1775 and 1776, the Continental Congress had issued decrees ordering churches to fast and pray on behalf of the Patriots. Starting July 4, 1776, Congress and several states passed laws making prayers for the king and British Parliament acts of treason.|$|E

25|$|Various historiographers {{note that}} the concept of dreamed world precedes the German school by several generations, finding its {{literary}} expression in Calderón de la Barca's 1635 allegory, before arriving at Gautier. Eminescu's own perception of spacetime, as apparent in the story and in some poems (La steaua, for instance), has intrigued Romanian students of physics, particularly after they became aware of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. In 1928, Einstein received a letter from his Romanian admirer, Melania Șerbu, who informed him that Poor Dionis had anticipated his finds; Einstein kept corresponding with Șerbu, but did not show an interest <b>in</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> story. In addition to investigating such connections herself, critic Ioana Em. Petrescu believed that the modern interest of Poor Dionis, and of Eminescu's work in general, was given by its multiple levels, and especially by its hermeneutic suggestions. In her view, Zoroaster's book is a mirror of the world symbol, as in the deconstruction terminology coined by Jacques Derrida.|$|E
25|$|Minucius, {{after the}} battle, turned over supreme command to Fabius, {{resuming}} his duties as the Master of Horse, and billeted his remaining troops {{with those of}} Fabius.

Hannibal had again demonstrated his skill <b>in</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> character of his opponent and devising a tactical plan {{to take full advantage of}} the situation. The plan of Hannibal to destroy in detail the armies deployed against him did not bear fruit in the manner for which he had hoped. Whatever speculated advantages Hannibal had forsaken by not confronting the combined armies of Fabius and Minucius would be regained tenfold in the August of the following year when the Carthaginians would deal one of the largest armies ever fielded by the Roman Republic one of the greatest defeats ever suffered by any nation in history near a Roman supply depot in Apulia. The Armies of Hannibal and Rome remained in Geronium until June 216 BC, when Hannibal decided to start for Cannae.|$|E
