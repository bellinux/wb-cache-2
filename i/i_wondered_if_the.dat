60|$|I {{listened as}} in a spell as Jacob Settle spoke.

60|$|I {{leaned against}} the rail {{in the lee of}} the wheel-house, and stared up at the lofty spars and myriad ropes that I could guess were there. No, I decided I was not keen on the voyage. The whole {{atmosphere}} of it was wrong. There were the cold hours I had waited on the pier-ends. There was Miss West coming along. There was the crew of broken men and lunatics. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> wounded Greek in the 'midship house still gibbered, and if Mr. Pike had yet sewed him up; and I was quite sure I would not care to witness such a transaction in surgery.|$|E
60|$|While {{standing}} beside Hal, undecided as to my next move, I heard a whistle. It was faint, perhaps miles away, yet unmistakably {{it was the}} whistle of an engine. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> railroad turned round {{this side of the}} peaks. Mounting Hal, I rode down the forest to the point where I had seen the men, and there came upon a trail. I proceeded along this in the direction the men had taken. I had come again to the slow-rising level that I had noted earlier in my morning's journey. After several miles a light or opening in the forest ahead caused me to use more caution. As I rode forward I saw a vast area of tree-tops far below, and then I found myself {{on the edge of a}} foot-hill.|$|E
60|$|The day was Wednesday, and my 'afternoon off', but {{the rain}} was driving against the windows, and the attractions of billiards with the marker at the 'Feathers' had not proved {{sufficient}} to make me face the two-mile walk in the storm. I had settled myself in the study. There was a noble fire burning in the grate, and the darkness lit by {{the glow of the}} coals, the dripping of the rain, the good behaviour of my pipe, and the reflection that, as I sat there, Glossop was engaged downstairs in wrestling with my class, combined to steep me in a meditative peace. Audrey was playing the piano in the drawing-room. The sound came to me faintly through the closed doors. I recognized what she was playing. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> melody had the same associations for her that it had for me.|$|E

6000|$|The Temple of Jupiter is {{a smaller}} ruin {{than the one}} I have been {{speaking}} of, and yet is immense. It is in a tolerable state of preservation. One row of nine columns stands almost uninjured. They are sixty-five feet high and support a sort of porch or roof, which connects them with {{the roof of the}} building. This porch-roof is composed of tremendous slabs of stone, which are so finely sculptured on the under side that the work looks like a fresco from below. One or two of these slabs had fallen, and again <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> gigantic masses of carved stone that lay about me were no larger than those above my head. Within the temple, the ornamentation was elaborate and colossal. What a wonder of architectural beauty and grandeur this edifice must have been when it was new! And what a noble picture it and its statelier companion, with the chaos of mighty fragments scattered about them, yet makes in the moonlight! ...|$|E
6000|$|Of all desolate places, the one {{at which}} I was ditched was the limit. It was called a flag-station, and it {{consisted}} of a shanty dumped inconsequentially into the sand and sagebrush. A chill wind was blowing, night was coming on, and the solitary telegraph operator {{who lived in the}} shanty was afraid of me. I knew that neither grub nor bed could I get out of him. It was because of his manifest fear of me that I did not believe him when he told me that east-bound trains never stopped there. Besides, hadn't I been thrown off of an east-bound train right at that very spot not five minutes before? He assured me that it had stopped under orders, and that a year might go by before another was stopped under orders. He advised me that it was only a dozen or fifteen miles on to Wadsworth and that I'd better hike. I elected to wait, however, and I had the pleasure of seeing two west-bound freights go by without stopping, and one east-bound freight. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Swede was on the latter. It was up to me to hit the ties to Wadsworth, and hit them I did, much to the telegraph operator's relief, for I neglected to burn his shanty and murder him. Telegraph operators have much to be thankful for. At the end of half a dozen miles, I had to get off the ties and let the east-bound overland go by. She was going fast, but I caught sight of a dim form on the first [...] "blind" [...] that looked like the Swede.|$|E
60|$|A {{couple of}} days later I walked for old acquaintance' sake over to San Onofrio on the Janiculan. The {{approach}} is one of the dirtiest adventures in Rome, and though the view is fine from the little terrace, the church and convent are of a meagre and musty pattern. Yet here--almost like pearls in a dunghill--are hidden mementos of two of the most exquisite of Italian minds. Torquato Tasso spent the last months of his life here, and you may visit his room and various warped and faded relics. The most interesting is a cast of his face taken after death--looking, like all such casts, almost more than mortally gallant and distinguished. But who should look all ideally so if not he? In a little shabby, chilly corridor adjoining is a fresco of Leonardo, a Virgin and Child with the donatorio. It is very small, simple and faded, but it has all the artist's magic, that mocking, illusive refinement and hint of a vague arriere- pensee which mark every stroke of Leonardo's brush. Is it the perfection of irony or the perfection of tenderness? What does he mean, what does he affirm, what does he deny? Magic wouldn't be magic, nor the author of such things stand so absolutely alone, if we were ready with an explanation. As I glanced from the picture to the poor stupid little red-faced brother at my side <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> thing mightn't pass for an elegant epigram on monasticism. Certainly, at any rate, there is more intellect in it than under all the monkish tonsures it has seen coming and going these three hundred years.|$|E

6000|$|The Commissioner's wife {{stood in}} the doorway and watched:--"Poor little mite! A blue sash ... and my own {{precious}} Patsie! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> best of us, or we who love them best, ever understand what goes on in their topsy-turvy little heads." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{things went}} on like this, {{both of us}} getting raspier, till the CLIMAX came. Emily invited our {{minister}} and his wife to tea, and another minister and HIS wife that was visiting them. I'd promised to put Ginger away in some safe place where nobody would hear him [...] . Emily wouldn't touch his cage with a ten-foot pole [...] . and I meant to do it, for I didn't want the ministers to hear anything unpleasant in my house. But it slipped my mind [...] . Emily was worrying me so much about clean collars and grammar that it wasn't any wonder [...] . and I {{never thought of that}} poor parrot till we sat down to tea. Just as minister number one was in the very middle of saying grace, Ginger, who was on the veranda outside the dining room window, lifted up HIS voice. The gobbler had come into view in the yard and the sight of a gobbler always had an unwholesome effect on Ginger. He surpassed himself that time. You can smile, Anne, and I don't deny I've chuckled some over it since myself, but at the time I felt almost as much mortified as Emily. I went out and carried Ginger to the barn. I can't say I enjoyed the meal. I knew by the look of Emily that there was trouble brewing for Ginger and James A. When the folks went away I started for the cow pasture and on the way I did some thinking. I felt sorry for Emily and kind of fancied I hadn't been so thoughtful of her as I might; and besides, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> ministers would think that Ginger had learned his vocabulary from me. The long and short of it was, I decided that Ginger would have to be mercifully disposed of and when I'd druv the cows home I went in to tell Emily so. But there was no Emily and there was a letter on the table [...] . just according to the rule in story books. Emily writ that I'd have to choose between her and Ginger; she'd gone back to her own house and there she would stay till I went and told her I'd got rid of that parrot.|$|E

50|$|Writing The Afterlife {{marked a}} {{departure}} for Antrim {{away from the}} comic surrealism of his early novels into more difficult, emotionally earnest, traditionally realist prose. Donald Antrim: What I gained writing The Afterlife was something related to writing into emotion, into my own feelings, into what I imagined other peoples feelings to have been. The novels are very much card houses. Theyre conceptually driven constructions. And to some degree they contain some kind of emotional core. But with the memoir, the emotional {{lives of the people}} Im writing about, my own emotional life as I was writing, these things were much more on the surface and much more pressing to me...Q: Your stories that have appeared in The New Yorker since the memoir are different from what you were doing before.

50|$|Bernd Heinrich theorizes that Geri and Freki, {{along with}} Odin and his ravens Huginn and Muninn, reflect a {{symbiosis}} {{observed in the}} natural world among ravens, wolves, and humans on the hunt::In a biological symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s).

5000|$|Railroad {{history was}} made on Screven's tracks in March 1901 in an event that still holds forth in {{railroad}} lore. The Spanish-American War had ended, but occupation troops were to remain in Cuba until 1902. Post Office Department officials, realizing the need for faster mail service, had begun drawing up a contract to award to either the Plant System (then known as the Savannah, Florida and Western) or the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, both of which operated south of the ACL termination point of Charleston, South Carolina. The Havana mail would depart from Jacksonville. Actually, Seaboard was favored because of her more direct route. The Plant Road detoured over 30 miles from Savannah to Waycross then to Jacksonville. And it was Jacksonville where the steam packet to Havana waited to load the mail. Both trains left Union Station in Savannah at 3:00 a.m. The SF&W's route was a longer one since it traveled through Jesup, Screven, and Waycross before cutting over southwest to Folkston to travel on to Jacksonville. Twelve miles out of Savannah, the SF&W’s engines ran hot. After one attempt at repairing the engine failed, Engineer Albert Lodge {{made the decision to}} switch engines and start again making it from Fleming to Jesup in less than 33 minutes. Knowing he must make up an hour of time if they were to have a shot at the mail contract, Lodge ripped out of Jesup on Number 111 and made 11 miles in 9 minutes. More speed was added and the train traveled five miles in two and a half minutes - she was traveling at 120 miles per hour when she passed through the town of Screven and approached the Little Satilla Bridge. Dispatcher D. S. McClellan is quoted as saying, [...] "I shall never forget the things that passed through my mind as this train reached the top of a little hill just south of Screven and started slowing down for the fill for the Satilla River. There is a little curve just after passing over the river, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> engine were going to take that curve or if it were going to take to the woods." [...] When the train came into Waycross, the crew figured they had come the 40 miles from Jesup in 28 minutes. The stop in Waycross completed, the train headed south to Racepond and arrived in Folkston in 25 minutes. Engine 111 arrived in Jacksonville at 6:31. The men had traveled faster than any other and their record would stay unequaled until 1934; to date, it has never been beaten.|$|E
