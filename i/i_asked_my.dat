500|$|Padukone has {{admitted}} to being socially awkward {{as a child}} and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, [...] "I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep." [...] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, [...] "I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all." [...] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.|$|E
500|$|Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999novel Battle Royale {{have been}} noted. Collins stated that she [...] "had {{never heard of}} that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was {{mentioned}} to me, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'." [...] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" [...] of Battle Royale but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] Stephen King noted that the reality TV [...] "badlands" [...] were similar to Battle Royale, {{as well as his}} own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. Eric Eisenberg wrote that The Hunger Games was [...] "not a rip off of Battle Royale, but simply a different usage of a similar idea", pointing out various differences in both story and themes.|$|E

2500|$|The day after, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> pilot, {{a cheerful}} young New Zealander, {{if he thought}} we really needed an escort. He said that, unless we had bad luck, he could {{probably}} get away from anything except a very up-to-date fighter. [...] I {{asked him if he}} would get into trouble if we went without an escort. He replied cheerfully that, if we came back safely, no one would say anything, and if we didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing our arrival, and set off on our own.|$|E
2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E
2500|$|Cheung {{distinguished}} {{himself as}} a Canto-pop singer through embodying the politics, sexual and gender identity of a queer subject position. He announced his gay relationship with Daffy Tong during a concert in 1997, earning him prestige in LGBT communities in China, Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In a 2001 interview with Time magazine, Cheung said: [...] "It's more appropriate to say I'm bisexual. I've had girlfriends. When I was 22 or so, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> girlfriend Teresa Mo (...) to marry me.", but was unsuccessful. In two interviews in 1992 and 2002, Cheung also stated that [...] "My mind is bisexual. It's {{easy for me to}} love a woman. It's also easy for me to love a man too" [...] and [...] "I believe that a good actor would be androgynous, and ever changing," [...] referencing his performance of intersexuality, androgynous dressing, and gay femininity in his music videos and films.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{the parents}} of Seattle University president Stephen Sundborg (and former 26-year residents of Alaska) George and Mary Sundborg donated $1million to the Seattle University School of Law Alaska Fund, a scholarship for Alaskan law students. Addressing the donation, to a school [...] southeast of Alaska, the president noted that Alaska was the only state without a law school: [...] "As an Alaskan myself, I seek as president of Seattle University to develop this educational service to Alaska in many ways. It was because of this commitment {{and in order to}} begin this broader initiative that <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>my</b> own parents for the initial gift to the Alaska Fund." [...] The elder Sundborg (one of the 55 signers of the Alaska State Constitution, a copy of which was displayed at Seattle University {{at the time of the}} donation) was an editor of newspapers in Juneau and Fairbanks, general manager of the Alaska Development Board and assistant to Governor and United States Senator Ernest Gruening. That year, Seattle University devoted a school-library room to Alaskan law [...] "to better serve the legal community in Alaska" [...] and bid (unsuccessfully) to publish the Alaska Law Review.|$|E
