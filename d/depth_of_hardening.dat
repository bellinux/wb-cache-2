In this work, plasma arc is scanned at the 4340 steel surface to improve the hardness. The variable parameters investigated were at scanning speed and operating current. Four types of surfaces were observed after they are scanned with plasma arc. They are fully-melted, partially-melted, non-melted continuous and non-melted intermittent where each type of surface has different roughness value. This work found that scanning speed and operating current has significantly influence the type of surface and roughness values.

40|$|The surface {{properties}} of functional components {{have a significant}} influence on the wear resistance or fatigue behavior and therefore on the lifetime of the part. To improve these {{surface properties}}, one common industrial process is laser hardening. The aim of the process is to heat the material locally over the Ac 3 temperature staying below the melting temperature and to get martensite by self-quenching. However, in case of thin walled parts, {{the volume of the}} material is not large enough to transport the heat fast enough out of the process zone for self-quenching. To realize a sufficient cooling and to get simultaneous a high <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardening,</b> the approach of using an active cryogenic cooling for laser hardening of thin walled parts was investigated. As a result of the cryogenic cooling with liquid CO 2, the temperature decreased fast enough under the martensite start temperature that the microstructure changed to martensite. Due to the position of the localized cooling point in relation to the position and feed rate of the laser spot, parts with a thickness of 1 mm and 3 mm have been hardened.

40|$|In {{industry}} {{different methods}} of surface hardening {{are widely used}} to increase reliability and durability of friction unit parts. Among these methods are areas of focus based on deformcutting technology (DC) i. e. method of chip-free mechanical treatment. It is shown that DC method allows us to produce through- or partial-hardening surface layers of a large thickness (0, 4 … 1. 5 mm) on steel with no additional heat sources. The standard metal-cutting equipment and common tools are used for deform-cutting process. The significant heat generation in the deform-cutting zone and mechanical effect from the tool allow us to heat undercut layers to the phase transformation point to have the hardening structure {{as a result of}} heat removal to the cold balk. The hardening structure formation occurs at significant heating and cooling rate (106 C/c) with large degrees and rates of strain. The deform-cutting modes and working face tool grinding determine the type and properties of the hardening structure. To produce the hardening structure would require the heat transfer and force action augmentation while treatment. These researches deal with through- and partial surface hardening samples produced by turning steel 35 shafts. While through hardening the phase transformation carry among the whole thickness of the undercut layer; while partial hardening the hardening interlayer formed {{on the side of the}} cutting tool contact. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardening</b> zone of samples with through hardening layers is 0, 5 mm; the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardening</b> zone of partial hardening samples is 0, 8 mm. Micro-hardness of the through hardening layers is 653 HV 0, 1 and 485 HV 0, 1 for the partial hardening layers. The metallographic analysis shows that the hardening zone formed while deform cutting has disperse structure; there are ferrite ghosts in it. The tempering at temperatures of 200 – 700 C showed that the micro-hardness of the hardening structures formed while deform cutting is larger than the micro-hardness of the samples after quenching. There special structures formed while deform cutting demand more in-depth study using different methods of physical-chemical analysis and mechanical testing. </p...|$|E

40|$|The surface {{hardness}} of industrial parts which {{are subject to}} high wear is usually treated by surface hardening processes. For hardened surfaces, it is desirable to know both the {{surface hardness}} value and the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> layer. Ultrasonic testing {{has been used to}} nondestructively measure the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hardened</b> surface layer.

This phenomenon takes place dependent on: hardenability of the steel, cross-section size of the workpiece and on quenching condition. It {{is related to the}} delayed quenching with discontinuous change of cooling rate, and to the incubation period consumed before changing the cooling rate. Own experiments using cylindrical specimens of 50 mm Dia, made of the same heat of AISI- 4140 stee 1 have shown that polymer solutions (PAG) of high concentration may reproducible cause delayed quenching and yield inverse hardness distribution. This Controllable Delayed Quenching (CDQ) technology, influencing intentionally the dynamics of heat extraction, has a great potential to increase the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardening,</b> compared to conventi onal quenching practice. After tempering a workpiece having inverse hardness distribution to suitable tempering temperature, uniform microstructure of tempered martensite, giving the best impact toughness, can be obtained through the whole cross-section. Bending fatigue tests with adequate specimens have shown a significant increase of the fatigue life for tempered specimens with inverse hardness distribution after quenching, in comparison with specimens having normal hardness distribution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{modify the}} surface {{structure}} of AISI 1005 steel and its properties without any dimensional loss, different plasma surface treatments were performed at low temperatures (500 ºC) in this study. The samples {{were subjected to}} single plasma treatments including: nitriding (N 5 % and N 3 %), carburizing (CE) and ferritic nitrocarburizing (NC) and to duplex treatments of nitriding followed by carburizing (N 5 %+CE and N 3 %+CE) and ferritic nitrocarburizing followed by carburizing (NC+CE). The gas mixture used for these treatments was varied as follows: nitriding (5 %N 2 + 95 %H 2 and 3 %N 2 + 97 %H 2), carburizing (5 %CH 4 + 95 %H 2) and ferritic nitrocarburizing (5 %N 2 + 1. 5 %CH 4 + 93. 5 %H 2). A microstructural characterization of the samples was carried out using optical and scanning electron microscopy in addition to XRD analysis. Microhardness testing was also performed. The XRD analysis showed a stabilization of the outermost cementite layer {{for all of the}} carburizing treatments. The results show that a greater hardness increase was achieved for the nitriding treatment as well as a more regular compound layer. However, a greater <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardening</b> was obtained in samples with NC+CE and N 5 %+CE, which extended to the hardened depth to 800 µm...|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} applying the carbon {{to the surface}} of the iron involved packing the iron in a mixture of ground bone and charcoal or a combination of leather, hooves, salt and urine, all inside a well-sealed box. This carburizing package is then heated to a high temperature but still under the melting point of the iron and left at that temperature for a length of time. The longer the package is held at the high temperature, the deeper the carbon will diffuse into the surface. Different <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardening</b> are desirable for different purposes: sharp tools need deep hardening to allow grinding and resharpening without exposing the soft core, while machine parts like gears might need only shallow hardening for increased wear resistance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The laser surface {{alloying}} of 18 / 8 stainless steel with Mn, {{was carried out}} by 6 kW cw CO 2 laser. The microstructure, chemical composition and phase identification of the modified layer were examined using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry, respectively. Cavitation behavior of produced layers was investigated in a rotating disc facility. Cavitation properties of laser-processed steel were calculated in the initial stage of erosion, on the surface of about 4 mm 2, on which cavitation intensity was constant. As a property characterizing the cavitation erosion resistance of materials was proposed for the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> strain <b>hardening.</b> It was found that presence of manganese in the amount of 7. 31 % causes the highest increase hardness after alloying and the lowest <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> strain <b>hardening</b> due to cavitation loading...|$|R

Plasma arc {{was used}} as a heat source to make a surface {{quenching}} on alloy cast iron, and orthogonal test was used to optimize the surface <b>hardening</b> technological parameter <b>of</b> plasma arc.
