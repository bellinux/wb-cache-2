500|$|Rick Sanchez of IGN {{wrote that}} the pilot episode [...] "The Watchers" [...] {{demonstrated}} [...] "a huge leap in quality and style for the show that just <b>keeps</b> <b>getting</b> better and better by episode" [...] and that [...] "Season Two pretty much surpasses Season One in every way imaginable." [...] Sanchez gave the season an overall rating of 8 out of 10.

500|$|Jayne Nelson, {{writing in}} {{magazine}} SFX, named Dale {{the second most}} [...] "serial" [...] science-fiction guest star after Mark Sheppard. She wrote: [...] "The thing is, soap-opera origins aside, Dale is always good. Which is why he <b>keeps</b> <b>getting</b> so much work....Dale never lets you down, always (well, usually) summoning up a pitch-perfect accent, too. There's something comforting about his presence on a show, as though the fact he's in it has lent it some weight."

500|$|Many reviewers {{found the}} battle system a {{refreshing}} mix from other role-playing games. Fitch of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that [...] "it <b>keeps</b> <b>getting</b> better {{the longer you}} play". Joystiq's Kubba called the game's combat a [...] "triumph", praising its ability to blend different styles, and GameTrailers found it [...] "immensely satisfying". Kotaku's Schreier felt that the combat never feels unfair, although criticized {{the use of the}} artificial intelligence during the battle. Phil Iwaniuk of Official PlayStation Magazine found the game's consistent battle encounters irritating, but that combat is [...] "otherwise a pleasure". Polygons Kollar felt that the game's artificial intelligence resulted in a [...] "sloppy" [...] and [...] "frustrating" [...] combat system.|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, the New York Times wrote Fringe [...] "has {{kept its}} plates {{spinning}} entertainingly well into its third season" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "the best major-network show {{that no one is}} watching". Because of its [...] "ultra-daring" [...] and [...] "bold" [...] storylines, IGN gave Fringe their award for [...] "Best Sci-Fi Series" [...] in 2010. They noted, [...] "With stellar performances, sci-fi intrigue and a newly introduced Doomsday machine in play that almost guarantees the two worlds will face off Thunderdome-style, this series just <b>keeps</b> <b>getting</b> better and better." [...] For 2011, Fringe third season helped the show place sixth on Digital Spy's top 25 television shows of the year, which described the season as [...] "exemplary". Similarly, The A.V. Club named Fringe the sixteenth best television series of 2011, in particular highlighting [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] and [...] "The Firefly".|$|E
500|$|... "Return to Sender" [...] was {{generally}} praised by critics. Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode's [...] "most interesting facet" [...] was its flashbacks to Dexter's youth from Debra's perspective, though {{he felt that the}} young Debra's hasty apology to Dexter after insulting him was [...] "a slightly cheesy moment". He thought that LaGuerta's bonding with Oscar [...] "was okay, but [...] fell a little flat". TV Guides Paula Paige [...] "love" [...] the episode, saying that [...] "It just <b>keeps</b> <b>getting</b> better and better", but was unsure [...] "what Deb having dinner with the Doakes' family has to do with anything". Writing for TV Squad, Jonathan Toomey opened his review of [...] "Return to Sender" [...] by saying, [...] "Dexter did it again. Wowed me. Amazed me. Edge of my seat for the whole hour." [...] He was amused that Debra's profile of Valerie's murderer matched Dexter, but was uninterested in Rita's storyline with her husband.|$|E
500|$|Gil Kaufman from MTV News {{called the}} video [...] "geektastic". Popjustice also gave the video a {{positive}} review, saying: [...] "The video's {{a riot of}} costume changes, makeovers, multiple 'scenarios' and Christina even seems to look like she's having fun. We'd sort of forgotten the single was even coming out, but the video makes it all seem quite exciting." [...] The Sun commented that [...] "has done the impossible – made the blue rinse sexy". Anna Pickard from The Guardian heavily compared Aguilera to Britney Spears in the video, saying: [...] "We're at a final count of four Christinas to five Britneys. [...] We can't be seen to have achieved a perfect Xtina/Britney balance. [...] We'd probably need a guest appearance from Madonna for that". She also felt that [...] "the 30-second Target advert {{is better than the}} whole video. But still: any release that makes it compulsory to type 'Christina Aguilera <b>Keeps</b> <b>Getting</b> Better' is surely a clever ploy".|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the episode is a play on words, {{referring}} both {{to the introduction of}} the eleventh Doctor and {{to the fact that he}} was nearly too late, the connotation of [...] In the DVD commentary, Moffat said it was originally titled The Doctor Returns, and that it was the most difficult script he had ever written, as he had to introduce a new Doctor, a new companion, convince the audience that it was both a new and an old show, and deliver a fast-paced story. While traditionally the Doctor rests after he regenerates, Moffat thought it would be fun to make him save the world instead. He described it as a comedy of a man whose day <b>keeps</b> <b>getting</b> worse and worse. Believing that London and companions from London had become a cliché and the audience had become bored with it, Moffat set the episode in the fictional village of Leadworth. Moffat, a Scot, debated whether to locate the episode in a village in Scotland. He ultimately decided on England, in keeping with the notion of Amelia as an unconventional girl.|$|E
500|$|Verne Gay of Newsday {{referred}} to the episode as [...] "yet another brilliant outing by TV's best drama [...] <b>keeps</b> <b>getting</b> better"; {{she was not the}} only critic to give a positive review. [...] E!'s Kristin Dos Santos thought that the fight scene between Juliet and Charlotte in the Tempest was [...] "awesome" [...] and suggested that Alan Dale receive a [...] "lifetime achievement award for his parade of marvelously malicious patriarchs", such as Widmore. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a score of eight out of ten and described it as [...] "a good episode of Lost that has all the action, suspense and excitement that this show consistently delivers". [...] Carabott wrote that [...] "seeing how twisted [...] 'relationship' really is was fascinating". [...] SyFy Portal's Dan Compora wrote that [...] "this week's episode contributed to what is shaping up to be a pretty solid fourth season. … Fine acting carried the episode despite a few potholes in the plot." [...] Compora also enjoyed the title and the [...] "nice cat fight" [...] in the Tempest between Juliet and Charlotte.|$|E

A Sims family that <b>keeps</b> <b>getting</b> murdered." [...] The Sims is a video game in which players create virtual people called [...] "Sims" [...] and places them in houses and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Tracy {{responds}} [...] "One day, you will have what I have because you are an amazing, strong, intelligent woman, like Hilary... from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." [...] The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was a series that previously aired on NBC, and the Hilary character was a dull-witted individual who lacked intelligence. Before going their separate ways, Liz discovers that Wesley's last name is Snipes, but Wesley tells her that it is a name more fitting for a [...] "pale English guy", than actor Wesley Snipes. Liz and Wesley also attend a second run of the movie Hot Tub Time Machine, which provokes arguments between them despite their mutual enjoyment of the film.|$|E

[...] Stack praised the Kurt and Finn plotline, calling the scene between them and Burt [...] "one of Glee greatest moments ever." [...] Terri Schwartz of MTV also reviewed the episode positively, writing that it topped the previous episode, [...] "Dream On", and rivalled the grandeur of the Madonna tribute episode [...] "The Power of Madonna". CNN's Lisa Respers France deemed [...] "Theatricality" [...] even better than the Madonna episode, calling it [...] "the perfect, over-the-top homage to an artist who is pretty over-the-top herself", and writing that Glee [...] "just <b>keeps</b> <b>getting</b> better and better."

[...] He {{became the first}} Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006. [...] It was his seventh win in a row, eighth {{straight}} road victory (a new Texas record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and tops in the AL). [...] "I'm not doing anything different on the road than I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same. [...] I think it's a pretty humbling game, so you can't get too high or too low." [...] He became the first Rangers right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts.

500|$|Dan Casey at Nerdist {{found the}} adage [...] "third {{time is the}} charm" [...] {{to apply to the}} episode, feeling that [...] "Rather than {{trying to figure out where}} it fits within Marvel’s grander {{on-screen}} universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. is focusing its energy on developing the eponymous agents and giving us more backstory", and though he felt that [...] "The show still needs to figure out its balance of seriousness and humor", he concluded that the [...] "show just <b>keeps</b> <b>getting</b> better." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek felt that [...] "There's a distinct feeling of treading water", finding the episodic plot to be [...] "fairly by-the-numbers for a show that's supposed to be about the fantastic", and he was disappointed in [...] "Graviton's non-appearance appearance", referring to the lack of Hall's comics' alter-ego. Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter praised the episode's opening sequence, but criticized the character Skye and the focus the episode put on her rather than Coulson. He also spoke unfavorably of Quinn, noting that Hall would likely return as a villain himself in the future, but [...] "until then, S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to up its adversarial game". Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt [...] "the plot’s twists and turns clicked, even though it’s kind of embarrassing when the commercials are more engrossing than the show." ...|$|E
