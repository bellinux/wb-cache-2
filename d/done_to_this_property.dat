We report here the molecular cloning of a mutated HOXB 7 transcript encoding a truncated homeodomain-containing protein in MCF 7 cells. This {{is a new}} example of mutation affecting the coding region of a HOX gene. In addition, we detected two HOXB 7 transcripts in several breast cell lines and demonstrated that both normal and mutated alleles were expressed at the RNA level in MCF 7 cells {{as well as in}} a variety of breast tissues and lymphocytes, suggesting that a truncated HOXB 7 protein might be expressed in vivo. Using transient co-transfection experiments, we demonstrated that both HOXB 7 proteins can activate transcription from a consensus HOX binding sequence in breast cancer cells. Our results provide evidence that HOXB 7 protein has transcription factor activity in vivo and that the two last amino acids <b>do</b> not contribute <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>property.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Glycosylation is {{a common}} {{modulation}} of protein function in eukaryotes and is biologically important. However, in bacteria protein glycosylation is rare, and relatively few bacterial glycoproteins are known. In Escherichia coli only two glycoproteins have been described to date. Here we introduce a novel member <b>to</b> <b>this</b> exclusive group, namely, antigen 43 (Ag 43), a self-recognizing autotransporter protein. By mass spectrometry Ag 43 was demonstrated to be glycosylated by addition of heptose residues at several positions in the passenger domain. Glycosylation of Ag 43 {{by the action of}} the Aah and TibC glycosyltransferases was observed in laboratory strains. Importantly, Ag 43 was also found to be glycosylated in a wild-type strain, suggesting that Ag 43 -glycosylation may be a widespread phenomenon. Glycosylation of Ag 43 <b>does</b> not seem <b>to</b> interfere with its self-associating properties. However, the glycosylated form of Ag 43 enhances bacterial binding to human cell lines, whereas the nonglycosylated version of Ag 43 <b>does</b> not <b>to</b> confer <b>this</b> <b>property...</b>|$|R
40|$|Plasticity induced damage {{evolution}} is considered using a thermodynamical approach. Different postulates {{on how to}} include the effects of damage in the constitutive equations have been studied. The results reveal that a mapping, {{similar to that of}} the stress, of both the kinematic and isotropic hardening variables is to be preferred. The undesired property that, irrespectively of the postulate employed, the elastic strain will not equal zero as failure takes place, is addressed and a simple modification of the postulate of strain equivalence that <b>does</b> not lead <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>property</b> is proposed. From the results it is also concluded that the postulate of (complementary) energy equivalence have some undesirable properties. A yield criterion for ductile porous materials is proposed based on the lower-bound solution for a cylindrical void model. Comparing the criterion with the Gurson yield criterion and cell model calculations for an axisymmetric cylinder with a spherical void shows good agreement. A constitutive model for porous materials is formulated using the proposed yield function. The corresponding thermodynamic formulation facilitates a natural modeling of damage, in which both the growth and the shrinkage of voids are allowed in the thermodynamic process. Both the elastic and the plastic properties in the model are dependent on the void-volume fraction. The model was found to fit naturally into the thermodynamical framework...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>this</b> thesis is <b>to</b> explore—from a {{managerial}} perspective—how IT-enabled change is designed, led, and sustained from-within an organisation. This {{is an issue}} of central concern because there is a considerable lack of research that directly incorporates IT in management and organisational change studies. In addition, earlier research has recurrently focused on abstract theorising, aggregated perspectives, and exploring organisational change from the outside, from-without. Consequently, the present body of research provides limited knowledge of how organisations in practice lead large-scale IT-enabled transformations. The thesis herein sets out <b>to</b> explore <b>this</b> question, and does so by following the change designers and agents of the telecommunications company Ericsson, that transformed its finance and accounting unit from a highly decentralised structure into a shared service centre structure (SSC) entitled: “The Global F&A Transformation Programme”. The formal transformation lasted three years, was enabled by an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and was driven in the majority of Ericsson’s sub-units situated in more than 140 countries. Theoretically, this thesis addresses the research question: how do actors and structures influence large-scale IT-enabled change? The principal finding of the thesis is a four-stage analytical framework built on the concepts of common ground, common meaning, common interest, and common behaviour: The Commonality Framework for IT-enabled Change. The value of the framework is that it depicts the interplay between actors and structures on a micro-level. In doing so, the framework explains the different levels of complexity in a transformation and how they require different structures to be used, different activities to be performed, different skills to be applied, and different roles to be played. The framework can be used by both academics and practitioners to develop, assess, and improve IT-enabled change projects. In a broader perspective, the findings further suggest that change comes about as an upward spiral, within which the moving targets of IT and organisation are intimately interconnected. This reciprocal interconnectedness between IT and organisation across time implies that if changes are <b>done</b> <b>to</b> technological <b>properties,</b> <b>this</b> necessitates changes <b>to</b> the organisational properties, and vice versa. Organisations at the hands-on-level more or less have to change {{to make use of the}} IT-enabled advantages. Thus, successful IT-enabled change is more than the technology artefact per se, and requires thoughtful attentiveness not only to the technological and material side, but also to the organisational, social and human side of change. The theoretical contribution of this thesis is the in-depth exposition of different aspects and interplays between the properties of actors and structures from-within the organisation. The empirical contribution is the description of how contemporary multinational organisations initiate, lead, and sustain large-scale IT-enabled change.
