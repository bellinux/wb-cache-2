30|$|It can {{be learned}} from Table  4 that THR for {{combustion}} to 180  s did not vary from the amount of <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> with the value below 1.5  MJ/m 2. Combusted for a longer time to 300  s, the THR of MUF 3 /APP increased by 13.6, 2.0 and 0.8  MJ/m 2, respectively, with additional amount of <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> from 200 to 400  g/m 2. When to 600  s, the THR difference with raising <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> amount was more significant. With the <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> amount from 200 to 400  g/m 2, the increased amount of THR from 180 to 600  s declined to 19.0, 2.9 and 4.0  MJ/m 2, respectively. It suggested that MUF 3 /APP not only suppressed the release of heat, but also gradually enhanced the persistence of the fire retardancy with the increasing <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> amount on the surface of MDF.|$|R
30|$|The {{fire-retardant}} {{capability of}} MUF/APP increased {{with the increasing}} amount of <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> on the material surface. However, the inhibiting heat release capability of MUF/APP would not increase significantly only when the amount of <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> exceeded 250  g/m 2.|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{bubbling}} on wine bottle labels {{is due to}} absorption {{of water from the}} glue, with subsequent hygroscopic expansion. Contrary to popular belief, most of the glue's water must be lost to the atmosphere rather than to the paper. A simple lubrication model is developed for <b>spreading</b> <b>glue</b> piles in the pressure chamber of the labelling machine. This model predicts a maximum rate for application of labels. Buckling theory shows that the current arrangement of periodic glue strips can indeed accommodate paper expansion. Some recommendations follow on the paper, the glue, the labelling rate and the drying environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Effects of <b>glue</b> <b>spread,</b> {{adhesive}} {{kind and}} curing agent ratio and FRP (Fiber Reinforced Plastic) on stiffness of wood-FRP bonding interface were investigated. Two {{different kinds of}} epoxy resin and one kind of curing agent were used to bond wood-wood and wood-FRP samples with three different <b>glue</b> <b>spread.</b> Shear modulus of samples were measured by compression shear test to represent the stiffness of bonding interface. The results indicated that curing agent ratio and <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> had significant effect on stiffness of wood-wood and wood-FRP bonding interfaces. In addition, the stiffness of wood-FRP interface was {{less than that of}} wood-wood interface...|$|R

The responses observed were the corrected absorption height measurement, depth of lathe check of veneers, veneers thickness, moisture content, specific gravity and plywood bonding strength.

The results showed that the effect of veneers thickness on plywood bonding strength was not significant, while the <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> have significant effecton the plywood bonding strength.

Four {{different kinds of}} fiber fabric were bonded into poplar sample with three different adhesives and three different <b>glue</b> <b>spread.</b> Shear modulus of samples were measured by compression shear test to represent the stiffness of bonding interface. The results indicated that stiffness of GFF (Glass Fiber Fabric) -wood and GFMa (Glass Fiber Mat) -wood interfaces was better than that of two other interfaces and shear modulus of CFF (Carbon Fiber Fabric) -wood samples were the least of all.

40|$|This {{reflection}} {{is inspired}} by from {{the recognition of the}} relationship between textuality and macro-textuality in picturebooks, where the story depends on the arrangement of a succession of verbal-visual elements - the <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> - that lead conceptually and rhythmically to the function of verses in poems. The recognition of the semantic and structural analogy between <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> and verse helps to identify four broad categories of structures: anaphoric simple, anaphoric articulated, irregular recursive and irregular free. These are of considerable heuristic effectiveness both for a reflection on picturebook conceived as complex and multifaceted textual machine, and for grasping important pedagogical implications. The closing of the essay highlights how the experience of reading picturebooks serves to foster a culture of listening and respect, and involves at least three aspects significantly interconnected: learning to observe, the mental habitus of reflective slowness and fostering reciprocal listening...|$|R

40|$|This thesis identifies, {{develops}} and applies {{methods for}} the decomposition of fading dispersive channels. Such channels arise in wireless communication {{as a result}} of multipath and relative motion of the transmitter, scatterers and receiver. The decompositions considered are the f-power series and Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansions. For the KL expansion generalisations to rapid time variation are possible with the separate options of single <b>spread</b> and <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> decomposition. The single spread decomposition involves a model of the instantaneous channel transfer function with time variation supported by sample spaced coefficients. The <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> decomposition employs a model of each received pulse and requires symbol spaced coefficients. The decompositions are applied to pulse shaping, channel modelling for equalisation and the determination of performance limits for linear modulation over fading dispersive channels. The results on pulse shaping show that, with moderate bandwidth expansion and appropriate design, it is possible to significantly lower the complexity of a mobile receiver. The approach suggests a way to move complexity and power consumption away from the mobile unit and into the base station. The effects of diversity on performance are investigated by assuming a single pulse from a linear modulation format. This removes the need to consider intersymbol interference and allows conclusions about the impact of fading and dispersion on the probability of error and the average mutual information...|$|R
