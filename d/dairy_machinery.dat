At Bear Wharf, adjacent to County Lock on the Kennet, a siding was built to allow transition of goods transported by rail and barge, with locomotives sometimes being used to tow vessels short distances against the current.

40|$|Citation: Clark, C. H. Building up a {{dairy herd}} in Kansas. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1902. Introduction: When we review the dairy {{interests}} of Kansas, noting the improved {{methods of the}} cheese factory, the skimming station and the creamery, and the increasing demand for milk in our cities, we turn naturally {{to the source of}} the raw material and inquire as to its permanence and whether it is equal to the demands made upon it. We all know that the cow, as a source of milk supply to the human race, is something of an abnormal creature, made possible only by a long and careful process of feeding, breeding, selection and milking, and that without due precautions she will gradually drift back to the natural conditions of giving only milk enough to supply the needs of her offspring. The possibility of not only maintaining the present high standard, but of further, and more rapid and wide spread improvement is clearly shown when we consider what has already been done under conditions less favorable than now exist. The Holstein-Friesian, Jersey, Guernsey and Ayrshire herds have become famous as milk producers, though many of the breeders of these cattle know little or nothing of the foundation principles of breeding, feeding and variation. They lacked the stimulus that has been given by the Babcock test and the invention of modern <b>dairy</b> <b>machinery</b> and methods. Knowledge was not so easily obtained as at present. There was no improved stock with which the early breeders could cross their common stock, for all cattle were wild originally. The dawn of the twentieth century certainly offers great encouragement to those who wish to continue the work so well begun...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisation}} of {{the dairy}} industry in New South Wales has proceeded gradually {{over the past}} fifty years; however, {{the rate of increase}} in the use of mechanised equipment during that period has been far from uniform. The introduction of milking machines {{at the turn of the}} century resulted in the first significant use of machinery in the dairy industry. Prior to 1900 the quantity and value of machinery on dairy farms was almost negligible, but by 1920 <b>dairy</b> <b>machinery</b> was valued at almost Â£ 1 million, the value having doubled between 1900 and 1910, while between 1910 and 1920 it almost doubled again. Nevertheless, during the twenties the use of machinery did not continue to expand at such a rapid rate as during the years prior to 1920, and with the onset of the depression of the early thirties there was a distinct falling off in new machinery purchases by dairy farmers. In some years of the early and mid-thirties the total value of machinery on dairy farms showed a fall, largely due, no doubt. to the fact that normal replacements were not being made owing to the depressed state of the industry. However, with the outbreak of World War II another period of rapid mechanised expansion began, and still continues. While milk and butter prices remain high and dairy farmers continue to enjoy the present relatively prosperous conditions it is likely that the use of machinery will continue to expand at a rapid rate. The two periods of rapidly increasing mechanisation differ, however, in at least one important respect. In the early part of the century the increased use of machinery was due primarily to the introduction of the milking machine. The present period of expansion is due in part to a further significant increase in the use of milking machines, and again this is the main factor, but also to a significant, and economically important, increase in the use of tractors by coastal dairy farmers. Prior to World War II the ownership of a tractor by the dairy farmer was rare; to-day it has become relatively common. Livestock Production/Industries, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

50|$|The first Dairy Show {{was held}} from 24 - 27 October 1876. Some 150 milch cows were shown; there were prizes of 100 guineas each {{for the best}} Channel Islands cow and for the best other-breed cow, which went to a Shorthorn.

50|$|The {{main focus}} of the area is Queen's Park itself: a park with an area of 30 acre. Queens Park Rangers {{originally}} came from here, but they now play nearby in Shepherd's Bush. In 1879 the Royal Agricultural Society chose Willesden {{as the site of}} its annual show. A 100 acre site was designated at Kilburn, and on 30 June the show was opened. Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales attended to view a working <b>dairy,</b> agricultural <b>machinery</b> and a wide range of farm animals. The show ran for a week, in extremely bad weather. Although it attracted 185,000 visitors, it made a loss of £15,000. It was decided to set up a permanent venue for the show, and the Society chose a place in Twyford. A public campaign was launched to try to secure the whole site (bounded by Salusbury Road to the east, Chamberlayne Road to the west, and railway lines to the north and south) as a park to retain some green space in a fast-developing part of London. In the end only {{the central part of the}} site (30 acres or 7 hectares) was purchased. The park opened in 1886 and was named Queen's Park in honour of the reigning monarch, who celebrated her Golden Jubilee the following year.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s, Martin {{developed}} {{a process in}} which empty metal cans were sterilized by treatment with superheated steam at 210°C prior to being filled with cold, sterile product. In 1950, the Dole Company bought the first commercial aseptic filling plant on the market. At the end of 1940, a <b>dairy</b> enterprise and <b>machinery</b> manufacturers in Switzerland (Alpura AG, Bern, and Sulzer AG, Winterthur) combined to develop UHT-sterilized, aseptically canned milk, which was marketed in Switzerland in 1953. However, this system was not economical mainly because {{of the cost of the}} cans. Long shelf life milk packaged in this manner was first sold in Switzerland in October, 1961. In the USA the first Aseptically canned milk was successfully packaged and sold by Real Fresh, Visalia, CA in 1951.|$|R
