40|$|Traditional {{placement}} of electrical components has been constrained to two dimensions and two and half dimensions for routing by vertical vias using traditional {{printed circuit board}} manufacturing technology. The consumer demand for miniaturization of electronic circuits with increased functionality is becoming increasing difficult. The current size reduction in CMOS technology has almost reached its potential. Continued size reduction may introduce new forms of transistor, which can affect the performance of electronics. At the device level, system in package (SiP) offers the ability to vertically stack die that are connected by wire bonds. SiP is limited to only die and does not offer complete system miniaturization. To achieve full system integration packaging, new technologies {{need to be developed}} that enable an additional dimension of design space to increase the ability to place components and routing in three dimensional off. Solid freeform provides the ability to manufacture complex 3 D structures that that are suitable to house electronics. <b>Direct</b> <b>print</b> is a technology that has the ability to dispense material on non-conformal surfaces. <b>Direct</b> <b>print</b> can be integrated with stereolithography to dispense conductive inks or epoxies into channels manufactured by stereolithography to fabricate 3 D electronics. This research describes the integration of stereolithography and <b>direct</b> <b>print</b> to demonstrate the capabilities of embedded 3 D electronics with off-axis components and routing to provide new levels of design freedom that off a complete system miniaturization for the implementation of electronics systems. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} realize truly {{three-dimensional}} electronic circuits is complicated {{if not impossible}} using traditional fabrication techniques. Such techniques are limited {{to the use of}} two dimensional printed circuit boards (PCBs), and require various dissonant processes which exhaust time, volume and cost. Due to the nature of Additive Manufacturing (AM) such problems are diminished and in some ways completely overcome. Additive Manufacturing allows for a higher range of design freedom along conformal surfaces, as well as unit level customization; it is the threshold for embedded electronics, allowing for three-dimensional circuitry in ways traditional fabrication is unfeasible. In such ways, additive technologies provide for a diverse range of optimization toward space applications, such as small satellites. Specific to this research is the CubeSat project, which is the use of small satellites to provide for low cost fabrication, as well as shared launches. The purpose of UTEP 2 Ì† 7 s collaboration with the CubeSat project is to prove not only the successful integration of additive technologies for low cost fabrication of small satellites but participate in the launch and prove the performance of such fabricated devices in space research. The Additive technologies described within this thesis are both Stereolithography and Fused Deposition Modeling. Also discussed are the <b>Direct</b> <b>Print</b> process used and the conductive ink required to fabricate the conductive traces of circuitry. The fabrication process and advantages of said technologies, {{as well as those of}} the materials required, are discussed in reference to space applications. The following research incorporates an avant-garde approach to fabricating small satellites, calling for the use of both additive technologies as well as <b>Direct</b> <b>Print</b> processes. Described herein is the process for creating such structures, the advantages Additive and <b>Direct</b> <b>Print</b> technologies offer toward the fabrication of said structures and the successful fabrication of a CubeSat module section, set to launch in 2012. ...|$|R
