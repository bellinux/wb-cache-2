5|$|Turnout <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> {{consistently}} {{every year}} since the first election, and from 1999 it has been below 50%. In 2007 both Bulgaria and Romania elected their MEPs in by-elections, having joined {{at the beginning of}} 2007. The Bulgarian and Romanian elections saw two of the lowest turnouts for European elections, just 28.6% and 28.3% respectively.|$|E

It <b>had</b> <b>dropped</b> into a watchful and {{brooding}} expression,--most likely when all the things about her had become transfixed,--and {{it looked as if}} nothing could ever lift it up again. Her chest <b>had</b> <b>dropped,</b> so that she stooped; and her voice <b>had</b> <b>dropped,</b> so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her; altogether, she had the appearance of <b>having</b> <b>dropped</b> body and soul, within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.|$|R
50|$|In February 2017, Telstra {{announced}} a disappointing financial result: Revenue <b>had</b> <b>dropped</b> 3.5%, Net Profit After Tax <b>had</b> <b>dropped</b> by over 14%. As a result, Telstra's share price dropped by 4.5% {{on the same}} day.|$|R
5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got {{bitten by a}} mosquito after arrival. It is estimated that the American crow population <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or {{the distance from the}} core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than the core radius.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 and 2002 Phoenix ranked {{first in}} the nation in vehicle thefts, with over 22,000 and 25,000 cars stolen each year respectively. It has {{declined}} every year since then, eventually falling to 7,200 in 2014, a drop of almost 70% during that timeframe. The Phoenix MSA <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> to 70th in the nation in terms of car thefts in 2012.|$|E

It has been ranked second best on numerous occasions, first behind The French Laundry and then behind El Bulli. In 2012, it was ranked in thirteenth place. In 2010, it was named the Best UK Restaurant in the Quintessentially Awards, a scheme run by the Quintessentially Group.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two centuries}} since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the {{wetlands}} around New Orleans have diminished, and the elevation <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> due to subsidence. These {{have increased the}} threat to the city of a significant hurricane strike. The 1812 hurricane was not a worst-case scenario for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E
5|$|While driving, {{after the}} Volt battery <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> to a {{predetermined}} threshold from full charge, a small naturally aspirated 1.4 L 4-cylinder gasoline fueled {{internal combustion engine}} (Opel's Family 0) with approximately , powers a 55kW generator to extend the Volt's range. The vehicle also has a regenerative braking system. The electrical power from the generator is sent primarily to the electric motor, with the excess going to the batteries, depending {{on the state of}} charge (SOC) of the battery pack and the power demanded at the wheels.|$|E

5|$|As {{the result}} of the {{accidents}} in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.|$|E
5|$|Bart is {{visited by}} Erman Millwood, whose company makes films out of web cartoon series. Millwood offers Bart {{a chance to}} make a film {{adaptation}} of the web cartoon Angry Dad. Bart accepts, and Millwood takes him to film studio animators. Homer is soon offered the opportunity to voice Angry Dad, as the voice actor from the original Angry Dad series <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> out of frustration of never being paid. The film is test screened to a horrible reception. Lisa convinces Bart to remove all of the parts the audience did not like, thus making the Angry Dad a short film. The film is shortly thereafter nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Short.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{successful}} contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design {{evolved from a}} straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become {{commonly referred to as}} the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker).|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, law {{enforcement}} in the counties of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued criminals. In 1740, the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier (Banal Frontier), specifically its Karlovac and Varaždin Generalcies. The role of the pandurs as security guards was extended to Dalmatia after the establishment of Austrian rule there in the early 19th century. The term <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> from official use for law enforcement officials, but it is still used colloquially in Croatia and the Western Balkans in a manner akin to the English word cop. The unit raised and led by Trenck is also referred to more specifically as Trenck's Pandurs, and less frequently in Croatia than elsewhere, as Croatian Pandurs.|$|E
5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} {{have one thing in}} common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long narrow strip of land that <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.|$|E
5|$|Most of the highest-scoring games {{happened}} before the 1995–96 season, when the average scoring (points per game) per team {{was always in}} the 100s. Since that season, the average <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> down to the 90s. Only two post-1995 games make the top-ten lists of both the regular season and playoffs: a May 10, 2003 game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Sacramento Kings and a December 7, 2006 game between the Phoenix Suns and New Jersey Nets. Both the Mavericks and the Suns were coached by Nelson and Mike D'Antoni respectively, both of whom also made use of the run and gun style.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts {{in the spring}} and early summer causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> considerably, and some smaller tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% of the flow above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder {{was built}} for {{commercial}} freight, and although the volume carried <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> significantly, particularly since coal deliveries to Ferrybridge power station by canal stopped, the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007, down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000. The Leeds to Castleford section {{and much of the}} Wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes, but below Castleford, the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious, and pleasure boats must give way to commercial vessels. 600 tonne vessels, designed to make maximum use of the locks, produce considerable wash, and are not as manoeuvrable as a narrow boat.|$|E
5|$|The Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) later {{released}} consolidated information {{stating that}} the first episode had received 8.31 million viewers on ITV, with a further 801,000 tuning in on ITV HD, and 310,000 on ITV1+1, totalling the viewing figures to 9.42 for the first episode. The episode was 2011's fourth highest-rating drama broadcast, {{as well as the}} highest-rating broadcast for a new drama. By episode two it was reported that Scott & Bailey <b>has</b> <b>dropped</b> nearly 1.8 million viewers from episode one, with overnight figures suggesting 6.14 million (23.6%) tuned in, though it was still the number one rated programme in its timeslot. The programme continued to outperform its competitors in its timeslot until its end, beating competition including BBC One dramas Case Histories and Stolen.|$|E
