40|$|A {{high fibre}} {{and a low}} fibre breakfast meal were given to eight non insulin {{dependent}} diabetics (NIDD), and eight controls. Blood glucose response was monitored continuously for three hours and characterized using a straight line model. After the <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>meal</b> the rates of increase and decrease in blood glucose concentration were slower both in diabetics and controls than after the low fibre meal. The delay time, however, i. e. the time from meal intake {{to the start of}} glucose increase, hypothetically corresponding to gastric emptying time, was the same after both test meals. The postprandial glucose increment calculated as the area under the 0 - 120 min curve was lower after the <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>meal</b> in the NIDD, but not in the controls. The two-hour C-peptide and gastric inhibitory polypeptide values were lower for the diabetics after the high fibre breakfast. The results indicate a prolonged carbohydrate digestion and/or absorption after high fibre breakfast...|$|E
40|$|Exogenous fibre {{added to}} liquid meals delays gastric {{emptying}}. Its effect on solid meals is uncertain, {{and nothing is}} known of the effect on gastric emptying of fibre naturally present in food. This study therefore looked at gastric emptying of two different solid meals in eight healthy subjects and their blood glucose responses. The meals were exactly equivalent except for the total dietary fibre content (high fibre 20 g, low fibre 4 g of dietary fibre per 1000 kcal) and supplied 870 kcal (700 kcal women), 47 % of which was from carbohydrates, 36 % from fats, and 17 % from proteins. Ultrasonography {{was used to measure}} antral diameters before the meal (basal), immediately after it (time 0), and at 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes. In addition, subjects filled in a questionnaire on their feelings of hunger, epigastric fullness, and satiety before the meal and at hourly intervals after it. Basal and maximal postprandial antral sections were similar for the two meals (basal section: 283. 9 (29. 5) v 340. 9 (44. 7) mm 2 for the low and the <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>meal,</b> NS; maximal postprandial section: 1726 (101. 9) v 1593 (120. 4) mm 2, NS). Total gastric emptying time was significantly reduced by fibre removal (186. 0 (15. 6) v 231. 7 (17. 3) minutes after the low and the <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>meal,</b> p < 0. 05). Blood glucose was higher after the low fibre meal, and the area under the glycaemic curve significantly greater (226 (23. 1) v 160 (20. 0) mmol/min/dl- 1, p < 0. 05). No difference was found in satiety or fullness feelings, but hunger returned more rapidly after the low fibre meal. In conclusion, fibre naturally present in food delays gastric emptying of a solid meal, reduces the glycaemic response, and delays the return of hunger...|$|E

40|$|The natural {{behavioural}} repertoire of the pig includes extensive foraging behaviour and long feeding times. Customary feed for growing pigs {{does not meet}} these requirements, resulting in unsatisfied feeding motivation. This may lead to behavioural disorders and reduces animal welfare. Studies on sows showed that by enhancing crude fibre content in the feed, satiety can be improved and the feeding motivation reduced. In growing pigs, however, studies are lacking, although abnormal behaviours are widespread. Therefore, we investigated the feeding behaviour of 56 castrated male pigs, who received either a standard compound feed or a <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> feed containing lignocellulosis. <b>High</b> <b>fibre</b> pigs feed less often but longer times than control pigs. The feeding rate of <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> pigs is clearly reduced, resulting in lower feed intake. Due to {{the composition of the}} fibrous feed, energy intake is less and crude <b>fibre</b> intake <b>higher</b> in <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> pigs. Those animals have lower daily weight gain than control pigs, the feed conversion, however, does not differ between diets. Our results indicate that fibrous feed increases satiety in growing pigs. Sufficient satiety reduces foraging and feeding motivation and related behavioural problems. <b>High</b> <b>fibre</b> feed is therefore suitable to improve the welfare of fattening pigs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Changes in the {{structure}} and integrity of the colon dependent on collagen content and crosslinkage occur with age. AIMS [...] This study using an animal model examines colonic collagen content and crosslinkage over the lifetime of rats on <b>fibre</b> deficient and <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diets. METHODS [...] Two groups of 20 rats were fed either a fibre deficient diet (1. 7 g NSP (non-starch polysaccharide) / 100 g) or a <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet (13. 3 g NSP/ 100 g) for 18 months. Diverticula were identified by postmortem examination. Caecal and colonic contents were weighed and assayed for short chain fatty acids. Collagen solubility in weak acid was measured to give {{an indication of the}} nature and amount of crosslinks in the collagen of the bowel wall. RESULTS [...] The incidence of colonic diverticula was greater (42. 1 % fibre deficient rats; 0 % <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> rats). Colonic collagen solubility index in fibre deficient rats was significantly lower than <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet fed rats (p < 0. 001 in all four sections of the large bowel). Rats with diverticula had the lowest solubility index (p < 0. 001 in all four sections of the large bowel). <b>Higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet rats had increased caecal and colonic contents, caecal and colonic tissue wet weights, and greater caecal short chain fatty acids. Fibre deficient diet fed rats had more pathological abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS [...] This animal model permits a study of the relation between collagen crosslinkage and the development of colonic diverticulosis. A <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet protects against collagen crosslinking and this is related to a decreased incidence of diverticula...|$|R

This study used the laboratory rat as an animal model to examine whether the fibre content of the maternal diet during pregnancy affected subsequent development of colonic diverticula in the offspring fed lifelong <b>fibre</b> deficient or <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diets. METHODS: The parents of experimental animals were fed either a diet that was known to predispose to colonic diverticulosis or a control diet for one month prior to mating. The offspring were fed one of these diets for 18 months. The incidence of colonic diverticulosis, submucosal collagen content, collagen solubility in weak acid, and the composition of intestinal contents were then measured. RESULTS: Offspring of rats fed a <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet from <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet fed parents had 0 % incidence of colonic diverticulosis. When offspring (regardless of parental diet) were fed a low fibre diet for life the acid solubility was lowered compared with rats fed lifelong <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet mean (SD) (0. 044 (0. 0007) v 0. 073 (0. 0015) sigmoid colon (ratio of soluble:insoluble collagen)); 21. 1 % had diverticulosis and there was reduced fibre fermentation.

SETTING [...] Teaching hospital diabetic clinics. PATIENTS [...] 33 patients who had had diabetes {{for at least two years}} and had haemoglobin A 1 concentrations over 10 % despite receiving nearly maximum doses of oral hypoglycaemic agents. No absolute indications for treatment with insulin. INTERVENTIONS [...] During the <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> diet daily fibre intake was increased by a mean of 16 g (95 % confidence interval 12 to 20 g.) Twenty five patients were then started on once daily insulin. After three months 14 patients were started on four injections of insulin daily. ENDPOINT [...] Control of diabetes (haemoglobin A 1 concentration less than or equal to 10 % and fasting plasma glucose concentration less than or equal to 6 mmol/l) or completion of six months on insulin treatment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] No change in weight, diet, or concentrations of fasting glucose or haemoglobin A 1 occurred during run in period. During <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> diet there were no changes in haemoglobin A 1 concentrations, but mean fasting glucose concentrations rose by 1. 7 mmol/l (95 % confidence interval 0. 9 to 2. 5, p less than 0. 01). With once daily insulin mean concentrations of fasting plasma glucose fell from 12. 6 to 7. 6 mmol/l (p less than 0. 001) and haemoglobin A 1 from 14. 6 % to 11. 2 % (p less than 0. 001). With insulin four times daily concentrations of haemoglobin A 1 fell from 11. 5 % to 9. 6 % (p less than 0. 02). Lipid concentrations were unchanged by <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> diet. In patients receiving insulin the mean cholesterol concentrations fell from 7. 1 to 6. 4 mmol/l (p less than 0. 0001), high density lipoprotein concentrations rose from 1. 1 to 1. 29 mmol/l (p less than 0. 01), and triglyceride concentrations fell from 2. 67 to 1. 86 mmol/l (p less than 0. 05).

Pathological and cell kinetic information together with details of certain faecal characteristics was collected when the animals were killed 4, 20, and 28 weeks after starting their experimental diet. Tumour induction was significantly influenced by diet. The highest risk of colorectal tumour development was found in groups fed diet 3 : <b>high</b> fat, low <b>fibre</b> (p less than 0. 03). In contrast, diet 2 : low fat, <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> {{was associated with the}} lowest risk. The proportion of histologically proven colonic tumours occurring in each dietary group was: diet 1 - 10. 9 %, diet 2 - 3. 6 %, diet 3 - 63. 7 %, diet 4 - 21. 8 %. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies done on selected samples indicated both dietary and azoxymethane related alterations in crypt unit integrity. The most marked surface architectural changes were seen in carcinogen treated animals maintained on diet 3 (<b>high</b> fat, low <b>fibre).</b> Stathmokinetic analysis revealed considerable intergroup variability. Both fat and fibre produced significant effects, principally during the preneoplastic phase of carcinogenesis. Faster proliferative activity tended to be found in animals at low risk of tumour induction (diet 2), slower proliferation being more characteristic of animals at high risk (p less than 0. 05).
