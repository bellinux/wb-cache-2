The SFM UI queue receives status updates from harvesters and exporters, and updates the {{records for the}} harvests and exports. Monitoring will make problems with SFM UI consuming messages more evident to admins. Warn admins on long queue lengths. Admins will now receive emails when queue lengths get too long. The queue lengths to trigger a warning are configurable. Prevents multiple users from entering the same credentials. Correctly handle quoted terms in search seeds (thanks Reed!) Enforce authorizations consistently in UI. This should not be noticeable in normal use of the application. Note that anyone assigned the staff role {{will be able to}} view all collections and exports, but only make changes based on her group membership. The SFM UI message consumer was moved into its own container from the container was runs the SFM UI application. This will make the logs for the message consumer more accessible and allow it to be automatically restarted by Docker. Added guidance when entering Flickr seeds, as determining the correct identifiers to enter is confusing...|$|E
