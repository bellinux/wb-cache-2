40|$|Abstract- Drying {{characteristic}} of Orthodox broken type tea was examined using a laboratory-scale <b>fluid</b> <b>bed</b> tea <b>dryer.</b> Drying experiments {{were carried out}} at loading of 29 kg/m 2 and moisture content of tea was reduced from 106 % to 7 % on dry basis. Hot air temperature was varied {{in the range of}} 108 - 127 °C as applicable for industrial type tea dryers. Semi-theoretical thin-layer drying models of Lewis, Henderson and Pabis, Logarithmic, Page, Modified Page and Two-term exponential model were tested. Page model gave better predictions than other models, and satisfactorily described drying characteristics of Orthodox broken type tea. Results suggested that internal mass transfer resistance has fully controlled the drying process after 4 minutes of drying. The effective diffusivity of water in tea during latter stage of drying was found to be 3. 796 x 10 - 11 (m/s) and 5. 062 x 10 - 11 (m/s) at hot air temperatures in the range of 108 – 121 °C and 124 – 127 °C respectively. An empirical model was proposed to describe the variation of moisture content with tea-bed temperature and the predicted values were in close agreement with the measured data. The bulk density of the tea bed was found to increase with time and that might have reduced the channeling effect during latter stages of drying.

40|$|In {{support of}} {{technology}} development to utilize coal for efficient, affordable, and environmentally clean power generation, the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF), located in Wilsonville, Alabama, routinely demonstrates gasification technologies using {{various types of}} coals. The PSDF is an engineering scale demonstration of key features of advanced coal-fired power systems, including a KBR Transport Gasifier, a hot gas particulate control device, advanced syngas cleanup systems, and high-pressure solids handling systems. This report summarizes the results of TC 25, the second test campaign using a high moisture lignite coal from the Red Hills mine in Mississippi as the feedstock in the modified Transport Gasifier configuration. TC 25 was conducted from July 4, 2008, through August 12, 2008. During TC 25, the PSDF gasification process operated for 742 hours in air-blown gasification mode. Operation with the Mississippi lignite was significantly improved in TC 25 compared to the previous test (TC 22) with this fuel due to {{the addition of a}} <b>fluid</b> <b>bed</b> coal <b>dryer.</b> The new dryer was installed to dry coals with very high moisture contents for reliable coal feeding.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this project}} was to {{optimize}} the clean-in-place program for a <b>fluid</b> <b>bed</b> <b>dryer</b> used after drying wet ferrous granules, with focus on shortening the total time used for the program. This clean-in-place program has two critical objectives; removing a hard to clean iron residue on the inside surface of the <b>fluid</b> <b>bed</b> <b>dryer</b> by using an acidic detergent and thereafter removing the acidic detergent by rinsing steps. Methods: The optimization was performed by down scaling the current clean-in-place program to laboratory scale, then varying the parameters volume and time by applying the statistical model Central Composite Circumscribe and use experimental design optimization to {{determine the influence of}} the parameters on the effect of cleanliness. Cleanliness in laboratory scale was assessed by visual inspection and UV/Vis spectroscopy. The cleanliness in production was determined by visual inspection, an iron test kit and a pH-meter. The results from the laboratory scale optimization lead to a new clean-in-place program that was evaluated twice in production after drying of ferrous batches. Results and conclusions: The hard to clean iron residue could be recreated in laboratory scale. The optimization in laboratory scale showed that the parameter water was the most significant parameter for removal of the iron residue. The new clean-in-place program evaluated in production was 40 % (approx. 110 min) shorter than the current clean-in-place program. The results of cleanliness varied after the new clean-in-place program had been used in production, not all hard to clean areas tested had approved results. Further optimization is needed to be able to clean after varying amount of granules in left in the <b>fluid</b> <b>bed</b> <b>dryer</b> after production ended. An interesting side results was that two steps dedicated to rinse out the detergent could be removed. This fact can lead to that even more rinsing steps can be excluded in the future clean-in-place programs...|$|E
40|$|A <b>fluid</b> <b>bed</b> <b>dryer</b> with inert {{particles}} {{was used}} for the drying of suspensions and pastes. The effects of the operating conditions on the dryer throughput and on the product quality were investigated. Experiments were performed in a cylindrical column 215 mm in diameter and 1200 mm in height with 0. 925 mm diameter glass spheres as the fluidizing media. Cineb fungicide, copper hydroxide and pure water were used as the feed material. With respect to the main efficiency criteria, i. e., specific water evaporation rate, specific heat consumption and specific air consumption, a <b>fluid</b> <b>bed</b> <b>dryer</b> with inert particles represents a very attractive alternative to other drying technologies. A high drying efficiency results from the large contact area and from the large temperature difference between the inlet and outlet air. A rapid mixing of the particles, due to aggregative fluidization and mechanical agitation, leads to nearly isothermal conditions throughout the bed. In our experiments, suspensions and very dense pastes were successfully treated.

In this paper, results of drying experi­ments with slurries of Zineb fungicide, copper hydroxide, calcium carbo­nate and pure water used as the feed material are presented. In our fluidized bed we successfully dried {{a number of other}} materials such as: fungicides and pesticides (Ziram, Propineb, Mangozeb, copper oxy-chloride, copper oxy-sulphate, Bordeaux mixture), other inorganic compounds (calcium sulphate, cobalt carbonate, electrolytic copper, sodium chloride), and a complex compound (organo-bentonite). The effects of operating conditions on dryer throughput and product quality were investigated. Main performance criteria, i. e. specific water evaporation rate, specific heat consumption and specific air consumption, were quantified. Temperature profile along the bed was mapped, and nearly isothermal conditions were found due to thorough mixing of the particles. Analysis of drying and energy efficiencies as a function of inlet and outlet air temperature difference was performed for deeper insight in dryer behavior and for optimizing dryer design and operation from an energy point of view.
