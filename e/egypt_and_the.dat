5|$|Although the mosque-school was {{the leading}} {{university}} in the Islamic world and had regained royal patronage, it did not overtake the madrasas as the favored place of education among Cairo's elite. Al-Azhar maintained its reputation as an independent place of learning, whereas the madrasas that had first been constructed during Saladin's rule were fully integrated into the state educational system. Al-Azhar did continue to attract students from other areas in <b>Egypt</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, far surpassing the numbers attending the madrasas. Al-Azhar's student body was organized in riwaqs (fraternities) along national lines, and the branches of Islamic law were studied. The average degree required six years of study.|$|E

Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century <b>Egypt</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rhineland had become noted for fine glass.|$|E

5|$|Egypt {{became a}} {{province}} of the Roman Empire in 30BC, following the defeat of Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from <b>Egypt,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Roman army, {{under the control of}} a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period.

5|$|Egyptian {{independence}} was limited severely by the continuing British {{occupation of the}} country.

5|$|The 1834 revolt and the {{immediate}} aftermath reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth. This decrease is attributed to {{the large numbers of}} peasants who were either deported to Egypt to work in manufacturing, drafted into Egypt's military, or abandoned their villages and farms to join the Bedouin nomadic populations. Around 10,000 peasants were deported to <b>Egypt</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> general population was disarmed. The conscription orders were extended beyond the Muslim population to the local Christians. Taxes were also extended from landed property to include livestock as well. As Ibrahim consolidated his hold over Palestine and disarmed the population, banditry by local tribesmen and civil strife was largely eliminated.|$|E
