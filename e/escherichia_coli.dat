5|$|The SOS {{response}} is {{the changes in}} gene expression in <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The prokaryotic SOS system is regulated by two key proteins: LexA and RecA. The LexA homodimer is a transcriptional repressor that binds to operator sequences {{commonly referred to as}} SOS boxes. In <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes.

We extend methods which {{have been developed for}} discrete sets of differentially expressed genes and apply them to the wild type and two mutant time-series for which the global transcriptional regulators fis and hns were inactivated. We test our continuous methods using simulated ‘expression profiles’ generated from random Boolean network dynamics where we observe a clear trade-off between maximum response and level of detail included. In the real time-course expression data, we find strong interdependent changes of digital and analog control during the exponential growth phase and a dominance of analog control during the stationary phase.|$|R

40|$|Four years ago, Sydney Kustu’s group {{reported}} their sur-prising discovery that <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli’s</b> well-studied genome contains a previously unrecognized seven-gene operon (rutABCDEFG) encoding a pathway to degrade pyrimidines, making the two ring nitrogen atoms available for assimila-tion (4).

Andrei Osterman said he had doubted that such a discovery was possible today: it was “too big a skeleton to be hidden in the closet ” (5). The surprises continued as we learned more: the pathway is different from either of the known pathways of pyrimidine degradation (oxidative and re-ductive) (7) : it makes the two ring nitrogen atoms available for assimilation but discards the four ring carbon atoms (one a...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{predicts the}} {{existence}} of barrierless protein folding. Without barriers, folding should be noncooperative {{and the degree of}} native structure should be coupled to overall protein stability. We investigated the thermal unfolding of the peripheral subunit binding domain from <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli’s</b> 2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (termed BBL) with a combination of spectroscopic techniques and calorimetry. Each technique probed a different feature of protein structure. BBLhas a defined three-dimensional structure at low temperatures. However, each technique showed a distinct unfolding transition. Global analysis with a statistical mechanical model identified BBLas a downhill-folding protein. Because of BBL’s biological function, we propose that downhill folders may be molecular rheostats, in which effects could be modulated by altering the distribution of an ensemble of structures. The accepted view in molecular and structural biology is that to perform their biological function, proteins must fold into uniqu...|$|R

40|$|The PII {{protein is}} <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli's</b> cognate {{transducer}} of the nitrogen {{signal to the}} NRII (NtrB) /NRI (NtrC) two-component system and to adenylyltransferase. Through these two routes, PII regulates both amount and activity of glutamine synthetase. GInK is the recently discovered paralogue of PII, with a similar trimeric x-ray structure. Here we show that PII and GlnK form heterotrimers, in E. coli grown in nitrogen-poor medium. In vitro, fully uridylylated heterotrimers of the two proteins stimulated the deadenylylation activity of adenylyltransferase, albeit to a lower extent than homotrimeric PII-UMP. Fully uridylylated GlnK did not stimulate, or hardly stimulated, the deadenylylation activity. We propose that uridylylated Pll/GlnK heterotrimers fine-regulate the activation of glutamine synthetase. The Pll/GlnK couple is a first example of prokaryotic signal transducer that can form heterotrimers. Advantages of hetero-oligomer formation as molecular mechanism for fine-regulation of signal transduction are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Bayesian {{network is}} one of the most {{successful}} graph models for representing the reactive oxygen species regulatory pathway. With the increasing number of microarray measurements, it is possible to construct the Bayesian network from microarray data directly. Although large numbers of Bayesian network learning algorithms have been developed, when applying them to learn Bayesian networks from microarray data, the accuracies are low due to that the databases they used to learn Bayesian networks contain too few microarray data. In this paper, we propose a consensus Bayesian network which is constructed by combining Bayesian networks from relevant literatures and Bayesian networks learned from microarray data. It would have a higher accuracy than the Bayesian networks learned from one database. In the experiment, we validated the Bayesian network combination algorithm on several classic machine learning databases and used the consensus Bayesian network to model the <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli’s</b> ROS pathway...|$|R

When exposed to temperatures above 45°C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration {{has also been shown}} to affect the stability of FourU.

40|$|RNA {{secondary}} {{structures of}} increasing complexity are probed combining single molecule stretching experiments and stochastic unfolding/refolding simulations. We find that force-induced unfolding pathways cannot usually be interpretated by solely invoking successive openings of native helices. Indeed, typical force-extension responses of complex RNA molecules are largely shaped by stretching-induced, long-lived intermediates including non-native helices. This is first shown {{for a set}} of generic structural motifs found in larger RNA structures, and then for <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli's</b> 1540 -base long 16 S ribosomal RNA, which exhibits a surprisingly well-structured and reproducible unfolding pathway under mechanical stretching. Using out-of-equilibrium stochastic simulations, we demonstrate that these experimental results reflect the slow relaxation of RNA structural rearrangements. Hence, micromanipulations of single RNA molecules probe both their native structures and long-lived intermediates, so-called "kinetic traps", thereby capturing -at the single molecular level- the hallmark of RNA folding/unfolding dynamics.

40|$|Recruiting complex {{metabolic}} reaction {{networks for}} chemical synthesis has attracted considerable attention but frequently requires optimization of network composition and dynamics to reach sufficient productivity. As a design framework to predict optimal levels for all enzymes {{in the network}} is currently not available, state-of-the-art pathway optimization relies on high-throughput phenotype screening. We present here the development and application of a new in vitro real-time analysis method for the comprehensive investigation and rational programming of enzyme networks for synthetic tasks.

40|$|A {{new group}} of {{pathogenic}} agents {{has appeared in the}} last 20 years -verotoxin-producing <b>Escherichiae</b> <b>coli</b> (VTEC), which cause increasing numbers of intestinal diseases in humans and animals. The reservoir for VTEC is the intestinal tract of domestic animals, primarily ruminants. It is believed that cattle are the principal reservoir for VTEC, because the biggest number of epidemics caused by these bacteria occurred through ground beef (hamburgers). Swine are also a significant factor of VTEC infections in humans, but these pathogenic agents are more frequently isolated from diseased animals than healthy ones, and most often from swine with a clinical picture of an endemic disease. Investigations in our geographic region have also demonstrated that domestic animals are a significant VTEC reservoir. In spite of this, sporadic diseases in humans caused by these agents are rare, and no epidemics have been registered so far. Such a characteristic of VTEC infections in our country imposes the need for further epidemiological and epizootiological research...|$|R
40|$|SummaryProgrammed ribosomal frameshifting {{produces}} alternative proteins from {{a single}} transcript. − 1 frameshifting occurs on <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli’s</b> dnaX mRNA containing a slippery sequence AAAAAAG and peripheral mRNA structural barriers. Here, we reveal hidden aspects of the frameshifting process, including its exact location on the mRNA and its timing within the translation cycle. Mass spectrometry of translated products shows that ribosomes enter the − 1 frame from not one specific codon but various codons along the slippery sequence and slip by not just − 1 but also − 4 or + 2 nucleotides. Single-ribosome translation trajectories detect distinctive codon-scale fluctuations in ribosome-mRNA displacement across the slippery sequence, representing multiple ribosomal translocation attempts during frameshifting. Flanking mRNA structural barriers mechanically stimulate the ribosome to undergo back-and-forth translocation excursions, broadly exploring reading frames. Both experiments reveal aborted translation around mutant slippery sequences, indicating that subsequent fidelity checks on newly adopted codon position base pairings lead to either resumed translation or early termination...|$|R

Phage crosses under conditions of a partial block to DNA replication have revealed the following: (1) In the presence of Orf, RecF pathway recombination is similar to λ Red recombination; (2) Orf is necessary for focusing recombination toward the right end of the chromosome as λ is conventionally drawn; (3) RecORF-mediated RecF pathway recombination is not focused toward the right end of the chromosome, which may indicate that RecORF travels along the DNA; (4) both Orf- and RecORF-mediated RecF pathway recombination are stimulated by DNA replication; and (5) low level recombination in the simultaneous absence of Orf and RecORF may occur by a break-copy mechanism that is not initiated by a double strand break.

AsnA+ asnB and asnA asnB+ strains were constructed, and the asparagine synthetic reaction was characterized in extracts. These studies revealed that the asnA gene codes for the enzyme previously described (H. Cedar and J. H. Schwartz, J. Biol.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of carbon sources and the regulatory adjustments to recognized changes {{are of particular}} importance for bacterial survival in fluctuating environments. Despite a thorough knowledge base of <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli’s</b> central metabolism and its regulation, fundamental aspects of the employed sensing and regulatory adjustment mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, using a differential equation model that couples enzymatic and transcriptional regulation of E. coli’s central metabolism, we show that the interplay of known interactions explains in molecular-level detail the system-wide adjustments of metabolic operation between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. We show that these adaptations are enabled by an indirect {{recognition of}} carbon sources through a mechanism we termed distributed sensing of intracellular metabolic fluxes. This mechanism uses two general motifs to establish flux-signaling metabolites, whose bindings to transcription factors form flux sensors. As these sensors are embedded in global feedback loop architectures, closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and therefore, metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously (not requiring upstream sensing and signaling) to fluctuating carbon sources. ...|$|R

In an effort to recruit these advantages for in vitro biotransformations, we have assembled a 10 -step catalytic system—a system of biotransformations (SBT) —for the synthesis of unnatural monosaccharides based on the versatile building block dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). To facilitate the assembly of such a network, we have insulated a production pathway from <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli’s</b> central carbon metabolism. This pathway consists of the endogenous glycolysis without triose-phosphate isomerase to enable accumulation of DHAP and was completed with lactate dehydrogenase to regenerate NAD+. It could be readily extended for the synthesis of unnatural sugar molecules, such as the unnatural monosaccharide phosphate 5, 6, 7 -trideoxy-D-threoheptulose- 1 -phosphate from DHAP and butanal. Insulation required in particular inactivation of the amn gene encoding the AMP nucleosidase, which otherwise led to glucose-independent DHAP production from adenosine phosphates. The work demonstrates that a sufficiently insulated in vitro multi-step enzymatic system can be readily assembled from central carbon metabolism pathways. ...|$|R
