5|$|Hypertension (HTN or HT), {{also known}} as <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> {{pressure}} (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. <b>High</b> <b>blood</b> pressure usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Another risk is {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{coronary}} artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most {{years of life}} lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates. U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.|$|E

5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (<b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure) may occur. Protein loss and <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E

5|$|DKA happens {{most often}} in those with type 1 {{diabetes}}, but can also occur in those {{with other types of}} diabetes under certain circumstances. Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> sugar, low blood pH, and ketoacids in either the blood or urine.|$|E

5|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{people with}} low levels of education living in poorer areas are most at risk for elevated lead.

Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.|$|E
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to determine {{the degree to which}} the effect of obesity on blood pressure was modified by sociocultural factors A measure of psychosocial resources incorporating both access to social supports and coping styles, was developed in research in St. Lucia, a West Indian culture. The study sample consisted of 98 40 - 49 -year olds randomly selected from a community. Obesity was measured by percent overweight using weight-for-height standards. Persons with lower psychosocial resources had <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressures; overweight persons had <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressures. Those persons greater than 10 % overweight with low psychosocial resources had significantly <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressures (p < 0. 05). Further analysis indicated that the direct effect of psychosocial resources was due primarily to the effect of social supports, while the interaction effect was due primarily to the effect of coping styles.

30|$|PET {{scanning}} {{experiments and}} ex vivo biodistribution in animals co-administered TATE peptide (blockade group) demonstrated that TATE peptide effectively blocks SSTR 2 receptor binding by [68 Ga(THP-TATE)], indicating in vivo specificity of [68 Ga(THP-TATE)] for SSTR 2. Significantly <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> and kidney {{activity in the}} blockade group was also observed, contrasting most [42, 45, 46] but not all [47] previous reports that compare preclinical biodistribution of SSTR 2 radiotracers in blockade and non-blockade groups of SSTR 2 -positive tumour-bearing mice. It {{is possible that the}} significantly <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> activity observed in the blockade group compared to the non-blockade group (4.7 [*]±[*] 0.7 vs 0.6 [*]±[*] 0.1  %ID g− 1, respectively) is in part a consequence of persistent presence of the radiotracer in circulation in the absence of receptors available for binding, rather than high non-specific organ uptake. In this scenario, <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> and kidney activity in the blocked group compared to that of the [68 Ga(THP-TATE)] group is a result of blocked SSTR 2 sites that are no longer able to function as a “sink” for [68 Ga(THP-TATE)] [48]. It is also possible that the observed <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> and kidney activity in the blockade group is a result of slower clearance of [68 Ga(THP-TATE)] from circulation via a renal route in the presence of excess TATE peptide.|$|R
