40|$|At {{the end of}} September 2002 the Court of Auditors {{issued a}} report on 'the <b>extensification</b> <b>premium</b> payment schemes (EPS) in the Common Organisation of the Market in Beef and Veal'. The report found that while the EPS {{provides}} extra income to extensive beef farmers it does little to encourage additional extensive farming and it provides little incentive to intensive farmers to switch to more extensive methods. In part this {{is a consequence of}} the fact that two-thirds of EU beef is produced from the EU dairy herd. The Court also found that the Agenda 2000 reforms had weaknesses in them which allowed producers to benefit from the EPS by simply adjusting their beef premium application details rather than changing their pattern of production. Comment: The EPS scheme appears to have allowed increased levels of payment to EU beef farmers without materially changing production practices. This raises the question as to whether some of these 'greener' schemes are simply a mechanism for increasing levels of direct aid payments to EU beef farmers.

A vizsgÃ¡lataink eredménye, hogy a hagyomÃ¡nyos technolÃ³gia mellett talÃ¡lhatÃ³ a legtÃ¶bb negatÃ­v externÃ¡lia, mÃ­g az extenzÃ­v, és az Ã¶kolÃ³giai tartÃ¡smÃ³d externÃ¡lis, valamint kÃ¶rnyezeti szempontbÃ³l is a legjobb megoldÃ¡st jelenti. [...] In {{our study}} we {{reviewed}} {{the conditions of}} extensive agricultural farming and its benefits based on environmental criteria. Furthermore we examined its external effects, which may affect the agriculture and the meat cattle breeding. Beef fattening, when done intensively, can cause huge environmental problems which may cause negative externalities for the society as well. To solve this problem, the European Union tries to steer this sector towards the grazing animal husbandry practice through an <b>extensification</b> <b>premium.</b> We used benchmarking to assess the cattle keeping methodologies. The aim of this method was to identify its external effects. Our examination found that the traditional technology accumulates most of the negative externalities, while the extensive and the ecological methods are the best solutions from {{the position of the}} environment. hÃºsmarha, extenzÃ­v, benchmarkig, kÃ¶rnyezet, externÃ¡lia, beef cattle, extensive, benchmarking, environment, externalities, Agribusiness, Environmental Economics and Policy, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E
40|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} parameter in measuring pro-duction efficiency in the beef cow herd is the calf output produced annually from each cow that is mated. This clearly implies {{that there is a}} need for effective repro-ductive management if production potential is to be realised. Cattle practitioners have long played an impor-tant role in the reproductive management of dairy herds and are well placed to take on the same role in beef herds. However, until recently, few beef herd farmers actively sought veterinary intervention in this aspect of herd management. This may be due to the low input nature of beef production, but perhaps of greater signifi-cance was the subsidy system that existed prior to January 2005, which did little to encourage production efficiency. This was paid on a per cow basis and, in 2004, the payment rate was £ 151 to £ 205 per cow, depending on the level of <b>extensification</b> <b>premium</b> that applied. Now, with support removed directly from the number of cows, there is a great need for beef farmers to examine their production system closely with the objec-tive of maximising reproductive efficiency. This has created an opportunity for cattle practitioners. The goal must be for planned intervention, but as there has been little uptake of this type of service previ-ously, few managers of beef cow herds will be immedi-ately convinced that their veterinary surgeon can provide the requisite level of support. Practitioners ’ main way into the herd will remain through the opportunities creat-ed by the problems their clients encounter. The key skills for a practitioner wishing to be involved in this area of work will therefore be the ability to demonstrate an F...|$|E
30|$|It {{was often}} {{claimed that the}} former system of CAP {{subsidies}} in the animal sector (i.e. on a headage basis) was impeding production optimization and biodiversity conservation. However, current CAP biodiversity support schemes (<b>extensification,</b> agro-environmental <b>premiums)</b> are also implemented at a very low level (e.g. {{due to a lack}} of official inspection) regardless of the farming practices actually used (Poux et al. 2006). These schemes have had, therefore, very limited effect in counteracting the intensification process observed in many Greek livestock farms or in promoting the utilisation of bigger pastoral areas or longer grazing periods. Since biodiversity is a complex concept, different indicators need to be pragmatically integrated into a common framework, which is essential for effective biodiversity monitoring and conservation and a basis for result-orientated subsidies (de Bello et al. 2010).|$|R
