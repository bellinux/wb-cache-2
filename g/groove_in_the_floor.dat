60|$|But as Angus {{closed the}} front door behind him he saw Smythe push back a button, {{and one of the}} {{clockwork}} images glided from its place and slid along a <b>groove</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> carrying a tray with syphon and decanter. There did seem something a trifle weird about leaving the little man alone among those dead servants, who were coming to life as the door closed.|$|E
60|$|The {{history of}} the {{development}} of any other vertebrate animal, Lizard, Snake, Frog, or Fish, tells the same story. There is always, to begin with, an egg having the same essential structure as that of the Dog:--the yelk of that egg always undergoes division, or 'segmentation' as it is often called: the ultimate products of that segmentation constitute the building materials for the body of the young animal; and this is built up round a primitive <b>groove,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of which a notochord is developed. Furthermore, there is a period in which the young of all these animals resemble one another, not merely in outward form, but in all essentials of structure, so closely, that the differences between them are inconsiderable, while, in their subsequent course, they diverge more and more widely from one another. And it is a general law, that, the more closely any animals resemble one another in adult structure, the longer and the more intimately do their embryos resemble one another: so that, for example, the embryos of a Snake and of a Lizard remain like one another longer than do those of a Snake and of a Bird; and the embryo of a Dog and of a Cat remain like one another for a far longer period than do those of a Dog and a Bird; or of a Dog and an Opossum; or even than those of a Dog and a Monkey.|$|E
6000|$|The {{progressive}} {{development of}} any vertebrate from the ovum or minute embryonic egg affords {{one of the}} most marvellous chapters in Natural History. We see the contents of the ovum undergoing numerous definite changes, its interior dividing and subdividing till it consists of a mass of cells, then a groove appears marking out the median line or vertebral column of the future animal, and thereafter are slowly developed the various essential organs of the body. After describing in some detail what takes place {{in the case of the}} ovum of the dog, Professor Huxley continues: [...] "The history of the development of any other vertebrate animal, lizard, snake, frog, or fish tells the same story. There is always to begin with, an egg having the same essential structure as that of the dog; the yelk of that egg undergoes division or segmentation, as it is called, the ultimate products of that segmentation constitute the building materials for the body of the young animal; and this is built up round a primitive <b>groove,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of which a notochord is developed.

50|$|Araki Murashige {{is said to}} {{have used}} a tessen to save his life when the great warlord Oda Nobunaga sought to assassinate him. Araki was invited before Nobunaga, and was {{stripped}} of his swords {{at the entrance to the}} mansion, as was customary. When he performed the customary bowing at the threshold, Nobunaga intended to have the room's sliding doors slammed shut onto Araki's neck, killing him. However, Araki supposedly placed his tessen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> blocking <b>the</b> doors from closing.|$|R
50|$|A pillar {{to which}} he was chained for the last ten years of his life can still be seen, with a {{circular}} <b>groove</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> around the pillar. His (alleged) mummified body could be seen in Fårevejle, in the church near the castle, until a few decades ago. In later decades his descendants have tried to get his body sent back to Scotland, but their request has not been granted. The identity of the body has never been conclusively proven; an 1858 investigation concluded that the remains were Bothwell's.|$|E
50|$|Silver was {{discovered}} in {{what would become the}} Hedionda mine, during the 17th century, by A.A. Barba, a Spanish priest. Carbon dioxide poisoning limited the exploitation of the silver though. Compania Minera de San Cristobal operated the Toldos mine from 1870 to 1921. The Polish engineer J. Jackowski operated the Hedionda mine from 1896 to 1901, and from 1927 to 1936, using a <b>groove</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> to channel carbon dioxide out of the mine. P. Zubrzycki operated the mine from 1963, before transferring rights to the Lipez Mining Co. in 1966. The Cooperativa Minera Litoral started operating the Animas mine in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Records {{indicate}} ongoing maintenance included {{painting in}} 1887-1889 and repainting again in 1890. <b>In</b> 1894, <b>the</b> conservatory’s surrounding landscaping saw numerous transformations <b>in</b> preparations for <b>the</b> California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894. The Conservatory again was repainted in 1899 and received new floors of grooved concrete. At this point, <b>the</b> old <b>floors,</b> some {{of wood and}} some of concrete, were replaced by new <b>grooved</b> concrete. <b>The</b> <b>grooves</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> were intended to carry off the surplus water and make {{a visit to the}} conservatory more comfortable and pleasant. Several wooden plant benches that had rotted out were replaced by benches made of concrete wire netting to stand the constant change of temperature better than wood.|$|R
50|$|The {{usefulness}} of {{this point is}} that it permits the stage designer to calculate the perspective angles of the scenes (decoration) on the stage, as viewed from a central place (the focal point). Beginning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century, Italian theatrical decoration became very influential <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of constructions in perspective, which added greater realism to depth perception by the audience. Thus, it satisfied the baroque ideal of opening towards the infinity. Sabbatini and others also invented the scene wings which run on <b>grooves</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> allowing a quicker change of decorations during the intermissions. These innovations produced {{what became known as}} the scènes à l’italienne in theatres in Italy, France and elsewhere in Europe.|$|R
50|$|New {{styles of}} scenery meant that new means of scene {{shifting}} were needed. Booth's Theatre, opened <b>in</b> 1869, was <b>the</b> first <b>in</b> {{a new generation}} of theaters built specifically to suit three-dimensional set pieces. It was the first theater to have a level stage floor (rather than a raked floor, as had been <b>the</b> standard <b>in</b> proscenium-arch theaters since the Renaissance) and no <b>grooves</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stage <b>floor</b> for shifting flats. This idea would become the standard {{by the end of the}} century. Elevators and equipment for flying scenery also complemented the space.|$|R
60|$|Then he led us {{away from}} the wall of the cavern, if such it was, for a {{distance}} of perhaps six or seven hundred paces. Here suddenly we came to a great <b>groove</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rocky <b>floor,</b> as broad as a very wide roadway, and mayhap four feet <b>in</b> depth. <b>The</b> bottom of this groove was polished and glittered; indeed it gave us the impression of being iron, or other ore which had been welded together beneath the grinding of some immeasurable weight. Just at the spot where we struck the groove, it divided into two, for this reason.|$|R

5000|$|The new theatre the Duke’s Playhouse {{opened on}} 28 June 1661 in Dorset Gardens, with the {{spectacular}} The Siege of Rhodes. The new theatre encompassed new {{possibilities for the}} company to create rich and dramatic theatre. [...] "A small stage and proscenium arch; the scenery consisted of wings fronting pairs of large painted flats which could be moved along <b>grooves</b> set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and flies of the stage". This was the first public playhouse in England to use such innovation and so impacted the choice of play. The plays became spectacles; the Siege of Rhodes being a [...] "magnificent production". Other productions such as Hamlet (1661), Love and Honour (1661) and The Tempest (1667) characterise the Company’s restoration spectaculars and operas. Downes remarked that the adaptation of Love and Honour, originally from 1643, in 1661 was [...] "Richly Cloth'd" [...] with Bretterton robed in fine garments and the set extraordinary.|$|R
50|$|Taking {{refuge in}} a cave, Cunningham watches his ship and his assistants {{as they attempt}} to repair it, welding up cracks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ship's hull. However, they only work during the day and return {{to the inside of the}} ship at night. By night, Cunningham kills animals and {{collects}} their blood <b>in</b> <b>grooves</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cave <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> blood freezes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold of the night and he attaches the resulting small bars of metal to <b>the</b> remaining cracks <b>in</b> his ship's hull. The next morning, his assistants emerge to continue welding, which melts the bars of blood. The smell attracts many local predators, and Cunningham makes his way onto <b>the</b> ship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> commotion. Although the assistants easily fight off the alien animals, Cunningham locks them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airlock {{as they attempt to}} return to the ship. He then sends out a distress call and sits back, as rescue will arrive in several hours.|$|R
25|$|The fangs, {{which are}} {{enlarged}} and hollow, {{are the first}} two teeth on each maxillary bone. Usually only one fang is in place on each side at any time. The maxilla is intermediate in both length and mobility between typical colubrids (long, less mobile) and viperids (very short, highly mobile). When the mouth is closed, the fangs fit into <b>grooved</b> slots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> buccal <b>floor</b> and usually below {{the front edge of}} the eye and are angled backwards; some elapids (Acanthophis, taipan, mamba, and king cobra) have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae and can make fast strikes.|$|R
60|$|The men of {{the first}} shift, {{stripped}} as usual to the waist, set to work without an instant's delay; and the vigour and swiftness with which the blows fell upon {{the face of the}} rock would have told experienced miners that the men who struck them were working for life or death. Those unemployed, Jack took into the adjacent stalls and set them to work to clear a narrow strip of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> next to <b>the</b> upper wall, then to cut a little <b>groove</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rocky <b>floor</b> to intercept <b>the</b> water as it slowly trickled in, and lead it to small hollows which they were to make <b>in</b> <b>the</b> solid rock. The water coming through the two stalls would, thus collected, be ample for their wants. Jack then started to see how the men at work at the doors were getting on. These had already nearly finished their tasks. On the road leading to the main workings choke-damp had been met with at a distance of fifty yards from the stall; but upon the upper road it was several hundred yards before it was found. On the other two roads it was over a hundred yards. The men had torn strips off their flannel jackets and had thrust them into the crevices of the doors, and had then plastered mud from the roadway on thickly, and {{there was no reason to}} fear any irruption of choke-damp, unless, indeed, an explosion should take place so violent as to blow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> doors. This, however, was unlikely, as, with a fire burning, the gas would ignite as it came out; and although there might be many minor explosions, there would scarcely be one so serious as the first two which had taken place.|$|R
