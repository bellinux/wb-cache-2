50|$|The {{extent of}} human {{trafficking}} in Australia {{is difficult to}} quantify. However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimates</b> that the number ranges between 300 and 1000 a year. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) lists Australia as one of 21 trafficking destination countries in the high destination category.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> {{that all}} of the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries {{resulted}} in fewer than 500 executions, so this one trial, with its 18 executions, accounted for 3.6% of that total.|$|E
5|$|Napoli is {{the fourth}} most {{supported}} football club in Italy with around 13% of Italian football fans supporting the club.

When Retraction Watch was launched, Marcus [...] "wondered if we'd <b>have</b> enough material". <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> that about 80 papers were retracted annually. However, in its first year, the blog reported on approximately 200 retractions.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> {{that about}} 292,700 people (1.8%) of the Chilean {{population}} had {{some type of}} auditory deficiency.

50|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1856 and closed by the Beeching axe on 7 September 1964, when <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> in 1962 {{that the line}} was losing £23,500 a year and rising, staff costs <b>had</b> <b>been</b> pared to the bone and an {{imminent}} track bill of £32,500 was to be faced.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part in the}} D-Day landings, it is not {{possible}} to determine the exact number involved. However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> that about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E
5|$|Global dimming is {{the gradual}} {{reduction}} {{in the amount of}} global direct irradiance at the Earth's surface that was observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> to be of the order of a 4% reduction over the three decades from 1960–1990. However, after discounting an anomaly caused by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, a very slight reversal in the overall trend has been observed.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> by E.O. Wilson {{that the}} total number of {{individual}} ants alive in the world at any one time is between one and ten quadrillion (short scale) (i.e. between 1015 and 1016). According to this estimate, the total biomass of all the ants in the world is approximately equal to the total biomass of the entire human race. Also, according to this estimate, there are approximately 1 million ants for every human on Earth.|$|E

50|$|It {{cost the}} state around $23,000 a year to operate the park. It was not {{regularly}} staffed, and the entrance fee was collected with a box at the gate that visitors were expected to place their fee into.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> that of 92 {{potentially}} possible {{modes of}} life – combinations of feeding style, tiering and motility — {{no more than}} a dozen are occupied {{by the end of the}} Ediacaran. Just four are represented in the Avalon assemblage. The lack of large-scale predation and vertical burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity; the emergence of these during the Early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> {{that the}} group {{containing}} the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire diverged from genera like Goura about 1.5 million years ago. However, that estimate appears highly unlikely. It was estimated that the relatives of the two species moved to the island about 35 million years ago, when a land bridge between Nazareth (Rodrigues) or St. Brandon banks and Mauritius formed.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> {{that the}} solid earth {{as a whole}} {{contains}} 730 ppm of carbon, with 2000 ppm in the core and 120 ppm in the combined mantle and crust. Since {{the mass of the}} earth is , this would imply 4360 million gigatonnes of carbon. This is much more than the amount of carbon in the oceans or atmosphere (below).|$|E

5|$|New {{species in}} the Russulaceae {{continue}} to be described from various regions, such as the US, Guyana, Brazil, Patagonia, Togo, Sri Lanka, or Thailand. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> that the real number of Russula species in North America alone (currently around 400 described) might {{be as high as}} 2000. Cryptic species may increase true diversity: some morphologically well-defined species, especially in Lactifluus, have been shown to actually encompass several phylogenetic species.|$|E
5|$|The {{freshwater}} {{islands in}} Scotland include those within freshwater lochs and rivers – including tidal areas, so the islands {{may not always}} be surrounded by freshwater. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> that there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs in Scotland and that 1.9% of the land surface is covered by fresh waters. The distribution has a north west to south east gradient with the highest concentrations occurring in the islands of the Outer Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} executions Calcraft carried out is unrecorded, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> at 450, of whom 35 were women, making {{him one of}} the most active of British executioners.

5|$|Within 100 {{years of}} the {{appearance}} of Mendeleev's table in 1869 <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> that around 700 different periodic table versions were published. As well as numerous rectangular variations, other periodic table formats have been shaped, for example, like a circle, cube, cylinder, building, spiral, lemniscate, octagonal prism, pyramid, sphere, or triangle. Such alternatives are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of French prisoners who escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> at around 70,000, {{representing}} approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans trying to escape were rarely severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 16 December 1941, Corregidor {{left its}} dock in Manila in total darkness, loaded to {{overcapacity}} with Filipino civilians seeking {{to escape to}} the southern Philippines after the war had started. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>estimated</b> that between 1,200 and 1,500 people were on board, including approximately 150 Philippine soldiers, 7 Americans, 5 Philippine legislators, and hundreds of college students who were traveling home after their schools had closed. Also aboard were military supplies as well the entire artillery complement of the Visayan-Mindanao Force of the Philippine Army.
