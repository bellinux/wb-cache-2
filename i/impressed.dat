40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{the design of}} a new collaborative system in distance education, e-Learning and online conferencing – collaborative <b>Impress</b> applications. <b>Impress</b> is a presentation application in Open Office/Star Office; it has similar functionality as Microsoft PowerPoint. Making <b>Impress</b> collaborative across computers is useful in e-Learning, web conference and distance education. We have developed collaborative <b>Impress</b> applications which make use of the functions of <b>Impress,</b> and collaborate between the Master and Participating clients so that they share the same presentation slide display. We use a common message broker, Narada Message Broker, as the underlying messaging environment to communicate messages between the clients in a session. We realize the shared event idea in the collaboration. It uses event messages in the controlling of a presentation process. Compared to shared display, the short text messages save great bandwidth over the Internet. This realization is fast and efficient. Shared event model should be a great paradigm in collaboration...|$|R
