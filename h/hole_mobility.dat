25|$|Having unique {{features}} of tunable resonances and unprecedented near-field enhancement, plasmon is an enabling technique for light management. Recently, performances of thin-film solar cells have been pronouncedly improved by introducing metallic nanostructures. The improvements are mainly {{attributed to the}} plasmonic-optical effects for manipulating light propagation, absorption, and scattering. The plasmonic-optical effects could: (1) boost optical absorption of active materials; (2) spatially redistribute light absorption at the active layer due to the localized near-field enhancement around metallic nanostructures. Except for the plasmonic-optical effects, the effects of plasmonically modified recombination, transport and collection of photocarriers (electrons and holes), hereafter named plasmonic-electrical effects, have been proposed by Sha, etal. For boosting device performance, they conceived a general design rule, tailored to arbitrary electron to <b>hole</b> <b>mobility</b> ratio, to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. The design rule suggests that electron to hole transport length ratio should be balanced with electron to <b>hole</b> <b>mobility</b> ratio. In other words, the transport time of electrons and holes (from initial generation sites to corresponding electrodes) should be the same. The general design rule can be realized by spatially redistributing light absorption at the active layer of devices (with the plasmonic-electrical effect). They also demonstrated the breaking of space charge limit in plasmonic-electrical organic solar cell.|$|E

2500|$|NPN {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of bipolar transistors, {{consisting}} of a layer of P-doped semiconductor (the [...] "base") between two N-doped layers. A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large collector and emitter current. That is, when there is a positive potential difference measured from the base of an NPN transistor to its emitter (that is, when the base is high relative to the emitter), as well as a positive potential difference measured from the collector to the emitter, the transistor becomes active. In this [...] "on" [...] state, current flows from the collector to the emitter of the transistor. Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as minority carriers in the P-type base region. To allow for greater current and faster operation, most bipolar transistors used today are NPN because electron mobility is higher than <b>hole</b> <b>mobility.</b>|$|E

In this paper, the carrier mobilities of HG/h-BN heterobilayer are investigated based on the first-principles calculations by considering the influence of stacking pattern between HG and h-BN, hydrogen coverage and hydrogenation pattern. With the same hydrogenation pattern, the electron mobility monotonously decreases when the hydrogen coverage increases. With the same hydrogen coverage, different hydrogenation patterns lead to significant changes of mobility. For 25 % and 6.25 % HGs, the μe (ΓK) of 25 % pattern I is 8985.85  cm 2 /(V s) and of 6.25 % pattern I is 23, 470.98  cm 2 /(V s), which are much higher than other patterns. Meanwhile, the h-BN substrate affects the <b>hole</b> <b>mobilities</b> significantly, but it has limit influences on the electron <b>mobilities.</b> The <b>hole</b> <b>mobilities</b> of stacking patterns I and II are close to that of HG monolayer, but much {{lower than that of}} stacking patterns III and IV.|$|R
