500|$|While he {{occasionally}} scripted certain pages or scenes, more frequently he did not, and often wrote dialogue only after having drawn the artwork. [...] Brown did not plan out the stories, {{though he might}} have certain ideas prepared. [...] Some ideas he found carried him {{for up to two}} to three issues of Yummy Fur. [...] Brown used of flashback scenes different perspectives to alter the story to his needs—for example, when Brown revisited the scene of Josie's murder, he placed Ed behind a bush, linking the two characters' fates. [...] When he had originally done the murder scene, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not [...] "know that Ed was over in the bushes a couple feet away".|$|E
500|$|In early 1975, Brando {{signed on}} as Jor-El with a salary of $3.7million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits, totaling $19million. He horrified Salkind by proposing in their first meeting that Jor-El appear as a green {{suitcase}} or a bagel with Brando's voice, but Donner used flattery to persuade the actor to portray Jor-El himself. Brando hoped {{to use some of}} his salary for a proposed 13-part Roots-style miniseries on Native Americans in the United States. Brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in 12 days. He also refused to memorize his dialogue, so cue cards were compiled across the set. Fellow Oscar winner Hackman was cast as Lex Luthor days later. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando's and Hackman's footage [...] "because they would be committed to other films immediately." [...] Though the Salkinds felt that Puzo had written a solid story for the two-part film, they deemed his scripts too long and so hired Robert Benton and David Newman for rewrite work. Benton became too busy directing The Late Show, so David's wife Leslie was brought in to help her husband finish writing duties. George MacDonald Fraser was later hired to do some work on the script, but <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> little.|$|E

2500|$|Nancy's {{relationship}} with Charlie is somewhat strained. Nancy is angry at Charlie's passivity. Her attempts to encourage Charlie to sink underwater {{as he did}} as a child meet with a negative response. This frustrates her.

Though she readily accepts his word when <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not, she does not think the [...] "good life" [...] they had together has been all that it could be. Still, Nancy remains loyal to Charlie. While she threatens to have adventures on her own, she does nothing about it.|$|E

60|$|James {{was sent}} over to England, {{and we now}} offer {{the results of his}} {{examination}} in London, on November 6, 1753. The following document deals with the earlier part of Mr. Macgregor's appalling revelations, and describes his own conduct on landing in France, after a tour in the Isle of Man and Ireland, in December 1752. That he communicated his Irish mare's nest to Charles, as <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> is very improbable. Like Sir Francis Clavering, as described by the Chevalier Strong, James Mohr 'would rather he than not.' However, he certainly gave a version of his legend to the Old Chevalier in Rome.|$|E
60|$|How will he {{prove that}} we have ever {{occupied}} a different position {{in regard to the}} Lecompton Constitution or any principle in it? <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not make his opposition on the ground as to whether it was a free or slave constitution, and he would have you understand that the Republicans made their opposition because it ultimately became a slave constitution. To make proof in favor of himself on this point, he reminds us that he opposed Lecompton before the vote was taken declaring whether the State was to be free or slave. But he forgets to say that our Republican Senator, Trumbull, made a speech against Lecompton even before he did.|$|E
60|$|Tanner {{was worried}} into marrying a young squaw (at least <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{it because the}} girl wanted it), and this led to all his sorrows--this and a quarrel with a medicine-man. The medicine-man {{accused him of being}} a wizard, and his wife got another Indian to shoot him. Tanner was far from surgeons, and he {{actually}} hacked out the bullet himself with an old razor. Another wounded Indian once amputated his own arm. The ancient Spartans could not have been pluckier. The Indians had other virtues as well as pluck. They were honest and so hospitable, before they knew white men's ways, that they would give poor strangers new mocassins and new buffalo cloaks.|$|E

6000|$|From these {{sober and}} unsensational reports, I derived the {{impression}} that this collision was a collision of the slowest sort.

And if {{the captain of the}} Storstad stopped his engines directly the fog came on (as <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did),</b> then taking into account the adverse current of the river, the Storstad, by the time the two ships sighted each other again, must have been barely moving over the ground. The [...] "over the ground" [...] speed {{is the only one that}} matters in this discussion. In fact, I represented her to myself as just creeping on ahead--no more. This, I contend, is an imaginative view (and we can form no other) not utterly absurd for a seaman to adopt.|$|E
