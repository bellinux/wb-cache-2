5|$|Liquid crystal {{materials}} {{became a}} focus {{of research in the}} development of <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.|$|E

Fluorescent lighting relies on mercury vapour for its operation. Ruby lasers generate deep red beams by exciting chromium atoms; the lanthanides are also extensively employed in lasers.

The P90 LV model projects an 8 mW visible laser intended {{to be used as a}} low-light shooting aid or for dissuasive effect, while the P90 IR model projects a 4.5 mW infrared laser that can only be seen with night vision equipment. Both laser systems are compact, consisting of a small, <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> integrated into the front end of the weapon's frame.|$|E
5|$|The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One {{racing car}} {{designed}} by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, for the 1978 Formula One season. The car featured several radical design elements, {{one of which}} was the use of <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> heat exchangers on the bodywork of the car to replace conventional water and oil radiators. This concept did not work in practice and was removed before the car’s race debut, never to be seen again. The cars, however, powered by a flat-12 Alfa Romeo engine, raced competitively with modified nose-mounted radiators for most of the year, driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson, winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA moving-least square mesh-free {{method that}} is based on the first-order shear {{deformation}} theory (FSDT) is introduced to investigate multi-panel plate structures under different loadings and boundary conditions. The structures are regarded as assemblies of <b>flat</b> <b>panels</b> that lie in different planes. The governing equations of the <b>flat</b> <b>panels</b> are given by the moving-least square approximation and the FSDT. A treatment is implemented to modify the equations, and the equations are then superposed to obtain the governing equation of the entire structure. Unlike the finite element methods, no mesh is required in determining the governing equations for the <b>flat</b> <b>panels,</b> which means time-consuming remeshing is entirely avoided for future study on the large deformation problems of the structures. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, several numerical examples are calculated. Good agreement is observed between the results given by the proposed method and the commercial finite element software ANSYS...|$|R

40|$|Experimentally {{determined}} axial compressive failure loads, strains {{and failure}} modes of composite <b>flat</b> <b>panels</b> and cylinders are presented. A comparison of {{two types of}} filament wound <b>flat</b> graphite-epoxy <b>panels</b> indicates that the winding pattern can influence structural response. A comparison of hand laid-up tape and filament wound composite cylinders indicates that fabrication method may not significantly influence the failure mode or average failure strain of thick-walled (radius-to-thickness ratio less than 15) graphite-epoxy cylinders. The interaction of manufacturing-induced features (fiber cross-overs) and low-speed impact damage for graphite-epoxy specimens is also presented. Filament would <b>flat</b> <b>panels</b> with many fiber cross-overs exhibited lower failure strains than filament wound panels without fiber cross-overs for all impact speeds examined.

25|$|A {{television}} set, {{also called}} a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or telly, is {{a device that}} combines a tuner, display, and speakers {{for the purpose of}} viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as VHS and later DVD. In the late 2000s <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced cathode ray tubes. Modern <b>flat</b> <b>panel</b> TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a USB device.|$|E
