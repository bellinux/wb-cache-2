The tourism industry has been at a healthy growth rate and has become one of the most performing sectors of Kingston.

Furthermore, in recent years, sustainability has become important. However, data center designers have little information on the sustainability impact of <b>data</b> center <b>availability</b> architectures. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate the sustainability impact of such architectures. Availability is computed using Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) models while an exergy-based life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach is used for quantifying sustainability impact. The approach is demonstrated on real life data center power infrastructure architectures. Five different architectures are considered and initial results show that quantification of sustainability impact provides important information to a data center designer in evaluating availability architecture choices...|$|R
