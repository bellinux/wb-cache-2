Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland.

[...] The report, which Gikow called [...] "a schematic for the show Sesame Street would become", described what the new show would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW). [...] Cooney later stated that her undergraduate training in Education helped her research and write the study, and that it, along with her Emmy, provided her with credibility in the eyes of both the experts she interviewed and the new show's funding sources. [...] Davis credited Cooney's motivation to be involved with the project with her journalism skills, learned early in her career, and her idealism, which drove her to want to, as she put it, [...] "make a difference". [...] She later told an interviewer, [...] "I could do a thousand documentaries on poverty and poor people that would be watched by a handful of the convinced, but I was never really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> influence on my times".

[...] The magazine also considered Chloe the [...] "complex Genoa City bad girl", and observed that [...] "viewers aren't exactly loving Chloe" [...] for driving a wedge between the popular pairing of Cane and Lily. Speaking of the character's pregnancy, Allison Waldman of TV Squad was unconvinced of Chloe's schemes regarding the child's paternity, writing, [...] "I'm having doubts about Chloe's bun in the oven. She claims that Cane's the father, based on one drunken night in a car that he has blacked out of his memory. Chloe's hardly a reliable source, especially since it's just been revealed that she's Kate, Esther's daughter. Yes, Esther, Kay's maid for the last 20 years or so.

Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E
