40|$|In {{software}} system development, domain-specific visual notations are increasingly used and need a tool environment consisting of visual editors, simulators, model transformers, etc. Several Eclipse projects {{head for a}} meta technology to define domain-specific modeling languages. The Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) [4] {{can be used to}} define the underlying models of visual editors. A visual editor may be generated using the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) [3] which started recently as Eclipse technology subproject aiming at providing an infrastructure for generating visual editors in Eclipse. In essence, GMF forms a bridge between EMF and GEF [2], whereby a diagram definition is linked to a domain model which serves as input to the generation of a visual editor. GMF-generated editors offer basic <b>editing</b> <b>commands</b> to create, <b>edit,</b> move and delete single model elements (basic editing). Graph transformation-based editors (see e. g. Tiger [6]) show that the generation of editors with complex <b>editing</b> <b>commands</b> is also possible. Editing e. g. activity diagrams, there might be <b>editing</b> <b>commands</b> available which insert or delete a complete decision structure in one step. In this paper, we describe how meta model-based editor design and generation performed by GMF [3], can be extended by graph transformation concepts to define and generate complex <b>editing</b> <b>commands</b> to be used in GMF-generated visual editors...|$|R
40|$|Domain {{specific}} modeling {{languages are}} of increasing {{importance for the}} development of software and other systems. Meta tools are needed to support rapid development of domain-specific solutions. Usually, domainspecific modeling languages are defined by providing a meta model using the MOF/EMF approach. The language definition can be used to generate a corresponding editor using meta tools such as Eclipse GMF. The meta model defines all symbols and relations of the domain-specific model which can be used to provide an editor with basic <b>editing</b> <b>commands.</b> In addition, further language properties can be formulated by OCL constraints which form the input to a syntax checker. If the modeling language has not only simple syntax structures, syntax-directed editing would increase the convenience. Up to now, meta CASE tools being based on EMF do not provide support for the definition of complex <b>editing</b> <b>commands.</b> A natural way to define <b>editing</b> <b>commands</b> is the formulation by transformation rules, specifying the pre- and post-conditions of each command. The background for this approach is the grammar-based definition of visual modeling languages. While the transformation rules for simple commands can be generated automatically, complex commands are defined by the language designer. The formal basis for this kind of editor definition is given by graph transformation. A meta model-based editor specification extended by such rules shall be used to generate Eclipse plug-ins for domain-specific editing with complex <b>editing</b> <b>commands.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Composing {{text on the}} {{computer}} is usually heavily dependent on editing, such as moving text around, correcting spacing, and inserting punctuation characters. Dictation systems, based on automatic speech recognition, are not known for their efficiency as an editing tool—something that significantly reduces their potential for freeing the user from the keyboard. Speech recognition has almost invariably been tied to natural language, but we {{point out that this}} approach is inherently disadvantageous in important ways. Instead, given the evidence that humans routinely become experts at sequencing signs not related to natural language, we propose that <b>editing</b> <b>command</b> languages should rely on symbolizations {{similar to that of the}} keyboard. We introduce ShortTalk, an <b>editing</b> language whose <b>command</b> sequences are primitive symbol combinations that are not confusable with dictation. We argue that ShortTalk by construction may solve common editing situations much more efficiently than by use of keyboard and mouse. Our experimental results for ShortTalk indicate that an average information rate of about 16 bps for <b>editing</b> <b>commands</b> is achievable. Thus, editing by speech may be more efficient than by non-verbal means. 1...|$|R
50|$|CRT-based editing terminals, {{which can}} work compatibly {{with a variety}} of {{phototypesetting}} machines, were a major technical innovation in this regard.

Storing the text magnetically for easy retrieval and subsequent editing also saves time.|$|R

30|$|In {{the context}} of digital TV systems, we can {{intuitively}} see the influence of incremental validation in the conventional process of authoring, {{but this is not}} the only situation where such validation can offer performance gains. The fact that set-top boxes (device that executes interactive applications) are environments with limited computing resources raises the need for validation techniques that avoid redundant checks in such a limited hardware. A particular case of this need is the validation of applications created within the set-top box in TV viewers’ households (Social TV) [7], since this validation must be done without affecting performance. On the other hand, systems such as ISDB-Tb [4] allow broadcasters to send <b>editing</b> <b>commands</b> to applications while they are being displayed, allowing what is known as live editing of content [8]. Before applying such edits, first it is necessary to validate them in order to make sure that the <b>editing</b> <b>commands</b> will result in consistent, accurate and coherent documents. From the above discussion, we can notice that the need for incremental validation mechanisms is present in various circumstances.|$|R

50|$|In computing, a {{line editor}} is a text editor {{in which each}} <b>editing</b> <b>command</b> applies {{to one or more}} {{complete}} lines of text designated by the user. Line editors predate screen-based text editors and originated in an era when a computer operator typically interacted with a teleprinter (essentially a printer with a keyboard), with no video display, and no ability to move a cursor interactively within a document. Line editors were also a feature of many home computers, avoiding the need for a more memory-intensive full-screen editor.|$|R
