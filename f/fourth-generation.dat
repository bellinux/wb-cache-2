5|$|Benchmark tests {{conducted}} by SlashGear {{concluded that the}} SoC of the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad is able to perform CPU-reliant tasks {{more than twice as}} fast as that of the third-generation iPad. A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, Nexus 10 and third-generation iPad. The performance increase of the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the battery of the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad is able to last longer than its predecessor. However, the battery of the updated iPad 2 is able to outlast the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the iPad Air on October 22, 2013, sales of the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad were discontinued. The <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad was reintroduced on March 18, 2014, following the discontinuation of the iPad 2. In order to make its reintroduction a low-end device to the iPad Air, its price was cut by 20% over its original launch price. On October 16, 2014, the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad was discontinued in favor of the iPad Air 2; the iPad Air took its place as the entry-level iPad at that time.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad {{received}} primarily positive {{reviews and}} was praised for its hardware improvements {{as well as}} the Retina display, which was also featured in the device's predecessor. Furthermore, benchmarks reveal that the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad is able to perform CPU-reliant tasks twice as fast as its predecessor. During the first weekend of sales, an aggregated amount of 3 million <b>fourth-generation</b> iPads and iPad Minis were sold.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} weekend of sales of the iPad Mini and <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad, Apple {{reported}} that it sold an aggregated number of 3 million units. TechRadar noted that {{the first weekend}} sales figures for the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad are lower than corresponding figures for the third-generation iPad, which sold 3 million units in its first weekend. Subsequent reports and analysis such as that from David Hsieh, a technology analyst, suggest that the iPad mini is selling better than the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad. Despite the noted slump in sales, Apple's stock price, in direct response to the figures released, rose by 1.4% to $584.62 on November 5.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad (marketed as iPad with Retina display, colloquially {{referred}} to as the iPad 4) is a tablet computer produced and marketed by Apple Inc. Compared to its predecessor, the third-generation iPad, the <b>fourth-generation</b> iPad maintained the Retina Display but featured new and upgraded components such as the Apple A6X chip and the Lightning connector, which was introduced on September 12, 2012.

5|$|The plan to {{relocate}} the Central Ferry Piers {{dates back to}} July 1999, when proposed amendments to the draft Central District (Extension) Outline Zoning Plan covering the Central Reclamation III area were published. Both the third generation Star Ferry Pier and Queen's Pier would be demolished and 16 hectares of land {{directly in front of}} the <b>fourth-generation</b> pier reclaimed to make way for a six-lane road and a low-rise shopping centre. The cost was estimated at HK$3.5 billion. The Government said that the historical significance of the third-generation pier would be recognised and promised to recreate the landmark on the new waterfront.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Morenz {{became an}} {{apprentice}} with the Canadian National Railways (CNR) factory in Stratford. When not playing hockey, Morenz bet avidly on horse races and played the ukulele. In 1926 he married Mary McKay; together, they had three children: Howie Jr. in 1927 (d. 2015), Donald in 1933 (died 1939), and Marlene in 1934. Marlene later married Bernie Geoffrion, who played for both the Canadiens and Rangers from 1950 to 1968. Their son, Morenz's grandson Dan, played for the Canadiens in 1979-80. Dan's son, Blake, played with the University of Wisconsin and won the Hobey Baker Award as best collegiate player in 2010. Selected in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators, he made his debut with the Predators in 2011, becoming the first <b>fourth-generation</b> NHL player. Blake was traded to Montreal in 2012, meaning that all four generations of the Morenz-Geoffrion family have played within the Canadiens organization.|$|E
5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or <b>fourth-generation</b> progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|With {{the need}} to update Russia's ageing fleet of Su-27 aircraft, Sukhoi and KnAAPO in 2002 started {{integrating}} glass cockpits and improved weapons-control systems (to accommodate {{a greater variety of}} weapons) to existing air force aircraft. The Su-27SM, as the modified aircraft is called, made its first flight in December 2002. The initial success of this project led Sukhoi in December 2003 to proceed with a follow-up modernization programme. Known internally as T-10BM, the programme was aimed at a more thorough redesign of the airframe to narrow the qualitative gap between Russian aircraft and foreign so-called <b>fourth-generation</b> aircraft. The resultant design, also designated Su-35, would serve as an interim solution pending the introduction of the Sukhoi Su-57 fifth-generation fighter, many features of which the aircraft would incorporate. Additionally, the aircraft was to be a single-seat alternative to the two-seat design of the Su-30MK on the export market.|$|E
5|$|Robert Cade {{was born}} in San Antonio, Texas on September 26, 1927. He was a <b>fourth-generation</b> Texan. Cade took an early {{interest}} in athletics, and ran the mile in four minutes, twenty seconds at Brackenridge High School, a very respectable time for a high school athlete in the early 1940s. He graduated from Brackenridge High School in May 1945, and served in the U.S. Navy as a pharmacist's mate during {{the last months of}} World War II through 1948. After being discharged from the navy, he enrolled in the University of Texas. He completed four years of undergraduate coursework in two calendar years, and graduated with his bachelor's degree in 1950. In 1953, he married Mary Strasburger, a nurse from Dallas, Texas, whom he had met while he was in medical school. After graduating with his doctor of medicine degree from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas in 1954, Cade completed his internship at the Saint Louis City Hospital in Saint Louis, Missouri and did his residency at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. He also served fellowships at his alma mater, Southwestern Medical School, and Cornell University Medical College in New York City. In 1961, Cade joined the faculty of the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville, Florida, as an assistant professor of internal medicine in its renal division.|$|E
