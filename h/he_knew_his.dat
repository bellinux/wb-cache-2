5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, Krichell {{discovered}} Hank Greenberg while on a scouting trip in Massachusetts. Krichell believed Greenberg {{would be the next}} Lou Gehrig. Krichell offered Greenberg a $10,000 contract ($ in 2010) on the spot based on his potential and knowing the Yankees were looking for Jewish players to increase their Jewish fanbase. Greenberg discussed the deal with his father but declined it because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> opportunities would be limited by the presence of Gehrig as first baseman. Subsequently, he signed with the Detroit Tigers.|$|E

Though he quit his job, he kept the pretense of working until his album was released. Then he broke the news and sought his parents’ blessings. Thus began his journey.|$|E

He wanted and had to sell his paintings to make a living, and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> clientele well enough: his patrons were unlikely to decorate their homes with unadorned copies in oil of his field sketches; they demanded something more presentable {{and closer to the}} generally Eurocentric expectations of the time.|$|E

25|$|Wallace, who had {{returned}} to active duty on March 12, 1864, assumed command of VIII Corps, which was headquartered in Baltimore. On July 9, a combined Union force of approximately 5,800 men under Wallace's command (mostly hundred-days' men from VIII Corps) and a division under James B. Ricketts from VI Corps encountered Confederate troops at Monocacy Junction between 9 and 10 a.m. Although Wallace was uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington, D.C. was the Confederate objective, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> troops would have to delay the advance until Union reinforcements arrived. Wallace's men repelled the Confederate attacks {{for more than six}} hours before retreating to Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|Fassbinder {{used his}} {{theatrical}} {{work as a}} springboard for making films; {{and many of the}} Anti-Theater actors and crew worked with him throughout his entire career (for instance, he made 20 films each with actresses Hanna Schygulla and Irm Herrmann). He was strongly influenced by Brecht's Verfremdungseffekt (alienation effect) and the French New Wave cinema, particularly the works of Jean-Luc Godard. Fassbinder developed his rapid working methods early. Because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> actors and technicians so well, Fassbinder was able to complete as many as four or five films per year on extremely low budgets. This allowed him to compete successfully for the government grants needed to continue making films.|$|E

25|$|Egypt {{went to war}} for a {{different}} reason than Syria did. While Assad wanted to regain lost Arab territory, Sadat wished to strengthen Egypt's position in its peace policy toward Israel. The Syrians were deceived by Sadat and the Egyptians, which would {{play a major role in}} the Arab defeat. Egyptian Chief of Staff Shazly was convinced from the beginning that Egypt could not mount a successful full-scale offensive against Israel; therefore, he campaigned for a limited war. Sadat knew that Assad would not participate in the war if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> real intentions. Since the collapse of the UAR, the Egyptians were critical of the Ba'athist government; they saw it as an untrustworthy ally.|$|E

Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and Major General Philip Sheridan were convinced that Lee's army would not remain at Amelia Court House another night, but Army of the Potomac commander Major General George Meade thought that they would. Meade ordered the II Corps, V Corps and VI Corps to move toward Amelia Court House at 6:00a.m. and Grant did not order him to do otherwise, only to move swiftly. Sheridan did not move with the infantry but sent his cavalry to follow a road parallel and {{to the south of}} Lee's line of march to try to intercept the Confederates.|$|E
25|$|When {{there was}} not enough money to buy food for the yeshiva students, Rabbi Wasserman {{traveled}} to America {{to raise money for the}} yeshiva. Rabbi Wasserman made an impression on many young Jews that he met while in the United States. Rabbi Wasserman returned to Poland although <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> life was in danger by returning. This was partly because he did not want to abandon his students, and partly because he took a dim view of American Jewry. In 1939, just before the Nazi invasion, he even forbade his students from accepting visas to the United States to study at Yeshiva University and what is now the Hebrew Theological College due to what he perceived as a spiritually dangerous atmosphere in these two institutions.|$|E

25|$|On March 10, 1993, Bresciano {{was found}} shot dead. He was 44 years old. He {{was hit by}} 17 bullets, 7 to the head and 10 to the torso, while {{watching}} hockey in his Vimont, Laval, Quebec home. His alleged role in illegal cigarette smuggling in Canada is popularly believed to have led to his officially unsolved murder. Colleague Rick Martel has stated that because of Bresciano's notoriety from being a popular professional wrestler, {{he was able to}} attract many customers (particularly natives), thus crossing the Mafia. According to former opponent Bret Hart, Bresciano confided to friends shortly before his death that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> days were numbered. He was a nephew by marriage of Montreal crime boss Vic Cotroni, and was believed by authorities to be involved in his organization for some time. Bresciano's remains are in a mausoleum at Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal, Quebec.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above {{the roar of the}} water she heard him call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of the}} river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E
25|$|Defeated in the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 30, Union Maj. Gen. John Pope {{ordered his}} Army of Virginia {{to retreat to}} Centreville. The {{movement}} began after dark, with Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell's III Corps providing cover. The army crossed Bull Run and the last troops across, Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel's I Corps, destroyed Stone Bridge behind them. Gen. Robert E. Lee decided not to press the advantage gained that day, largely because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> Army of Northern Virginia was exhausted from two weeks of nearly constant marching and nearly three days of battle, so the Union retreat went unmolested. Lee's decision also allowed the Army of Virginia's II Corps, under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, to consolidate with the bulk of Pope's army, marching in from Bristoe Station, {{where they had been}} guarding the army's trains. More importantly, Lee's decision bought time for the Union to push to the front the Army of the Potomac's II, V, and VI Corps, which had been brought from the Peninsula andmuch to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's dismayplaced under Pope's command.|$|E

25|$|Learning of the Noldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies {{from his}} {{fortress}} of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in Mithrim. This battle {{was called the}} Battle under the Stars, or Dagor-nuin-Giliath, for the Sun and Moon {{had not yet been}} made. The Noldor managed to win the battle, and destroy Morgoth's armies. Fëanor, still in a great rage, pressed on toward Angband with his sons. He came even within sight of Angband, but was ambushed by a force of Balrogs, with few elves about him. He fought mightily, hewing even after receiving several wounds from Gothmog, captain of the Balrogs. His sons came upon the Balrogs with a great force of elves, and were able to drive them off. However, as Fëanor was being escorted off the battlefield, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> wounds were fatal. He cursed Morgoth thrice, but with the eyes of death, he knew that his elves, unaided, would never throw down the dark towers of Thangorodrim. Nevertheless, he told his sons to keep the oath and to avenge their father. At the moment of his death the passing of his fiery spirit reduced his body to ashes.|$|E
25|$|Ruault {{was soon}} {{reinforced}} to 25,000 men, a force considerably outnumbering the besiegers. By 3 October the Austrian bombardment began to noticeably taper off. On 3 October, the citizen captain Charlemagne Ovigneur continued {{to serve his}} gun even though <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> house was burning and his wife {{was going to give}} birth. On 4 October, Saxe-Teschen's wife, Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen appeared in the Austrian camp and the bombardment was redoubled. By this time, Saxe-Teschen became aware of Brunswick's retreat as well as the increasing numbers of French troops opposing him. On 6 October the Austrian commander directed that the heavy siege guns be removed from the batteries. By this time 60,000 shot and shell had been fired into Lille. The Austrians evacuated the trenches on 8 October and withdrew almost unmolested {{in the face of a}} weak pursuit led by Félix Marie Pierre Chesnon de Champmorin. The inhabitants of Lille emerged from their town and, in their rage at the destruction, leveled the Austrian siege works. The victory was celebrated throughout France and caused many men to enlist in the armies.|$|E
25|$|In early 1917, Allenby {{was ordered}} by Haig to start {{preparations}} {{for a major}} offensive around the city of Arras. During his planning Allenby insisted upon putting into practice many of the ideas that his staff officers had offered. Allenby rejected the normal week-long bombardment of the German trenches before making an assault, instead planning on a 48-hour bombardment before the assault went ahead. In addition, Allenby had made careful plans to control traffic in the rear to prevent traffic jams that would block his logistics, a second echelon behind the first echelon that would only be sent in to exploit successes, tunnels to bring up new divisions behind the German lines while avoiding German fire and finally new weapons like tanks and aircraft were to play prominent roles in the offensive. In March 1917, the Germans pulled back to the Hindenburg Line, which led Allenby {{to argue that the}} planned offensive in the Arras sector in April would be changed, a request Haig refused. Despite refusing Allenby's refusal for more time to change his plans, Haig informed him that the entire responsibility for the failure of the Arras offensive would rest with him. As the Zero Hour for the offensive at 5: 30 am on 9 April 1917 approached, Allenby was thus unusually worried as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>his</b> entire career was in the balance.|$|E
