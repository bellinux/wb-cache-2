The Swedes <b>got</b> <b>very</b> close to Nyboder {{and were in}} the process of crossing the moat, when they fell victim to a well-conducted ambush, and withdrew with heavy losses. Around 6 in the morning, Charles X of Sweden knew that all attacks had failed. He ordered a retreat to the outskirts of the city, back to the starting position.|$|E
5|$|Three organisations {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} location of Tito's headquarters and the disposition of Partisan forces in Drvar. The first of these was the Benesch Special Unit of Section II of the Abwehr (the Wehrmacht intelligence service), some members {{of which had been}} involved in identifying Tito's presence in the town of Jajce prior to the German offensive to retake the town. The Benesch Special Unit was part of the Brandenburg Division, and was staffed by ethnic Germans who spoke local languages. The unit had many contacts with both the Chetniks and Ustaše Militia, and had been tracking Tito since October 1943. Leutnant Kirchner of that unit had been responsible for locating Tito prior to the re-capture of Jajce, and he established a patrol base near Bosansko Grahovo. He <b>got</b> <b>very</b> close to the Drvar cave, and located the Allied military missions, but despite German radio intercepts confirming that Drvar was the site of Tito's headquarters, Kirchner was unable to pinpoint the cave as the location of the headquarters. Kirchner was attached to the 500th SS Parachute Battalion for the operation.|$|E
25|$|While the soft, muddy {{sea floor}} likely <b>got</b> <b>very</b> little sunlight, it teamed with life due to steady rains of organic debris from {{plankton}} and other organisms {{up the water}} column. The bottom was dominated by large Inoceramus clams which were covered with oysters and there was little biodiversity. Clam shells would have accumulated over the centuries in layers under the floor surface, these would have provided shelter for small fish. Other invertebrates known to have lived the sea include cephalopods, like squids and ammonites, and Baculites and the crinoid Uintacrinus.|$|E

Olympiacos went as far as the fourth round of the UEFA Cup. Despite these good results, he quit, mainly due to the pressure from Gate 7 fans who were not satisfied with the team's way of playing, although the majority of the fans were on his side.|$|E
25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and I asked him if he really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. Now, when I was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone <b>got</b> <b>very</b> upset.|$|E
25|$|The Halifax Borough Committee and Watch Committee had {{complete}} {{control over the}} Force at this time. There {{was a great deal}} of discontent in the Halifax Force and Richardson thought his men were getting a raw deal from the Borough Watch Committee but got short shrift from them when he tried to improve their working life. Apparently he <b>got</b> <b>very</b> tenacious about their working hours and would not back down after repeated attempts to get them a better deal got dragged out over a period of time. In the end, however, he won the day. His men were very grateful for his efforts and a brass plaque was cast in 1910 and erected in the entrance hall of Harrison Road Police Station from 1910 until 1985. When the Station moved to a new location it was re-erected at the new station at Richmond Close, Halifax. Both Alfred Richardson and his brother Ernest Frank Richardson were involved in improving the indexing of police procedures on identifying past law-breakers by fingerprints and body measurements. Alfred Richardson tended to favour the Bertillon (1853–1914) method which involved several body measurements being recorded. His brother, Frank Richardson preferred indexing the records after photographing on-site fingerprints. (He had been working in conjunction with the Home Office, London, for many years on experimenting to find the best method.) Alfred Richardson gave lectures locally on the differences between the Bertillon method and photographic fingerprinting.|$|E

At this point the group <b>got</b> <b>very</b> motivated, and incorporated the word [...] "zigazig-ha" [...] into the lyrics. Chisholm told Billboard magazine: [...] "You know when you're in a gang and you're having a laugh and you make up silly words? Well we were having a giggle and we made up this silly word, zigazig-ha.

The men had no trouble in catching punts, and football was played on its merits, without the handicaps of a wet field or a strong wind.

[...] Neilson played in City's {{first game of the}} League Two campaign – only his second under Taylor – but City lost 3–1 to Shrewsbury Town with Neilson replaced by debutant Louis Moult in the second-half. Neilson was substituted at half-time in the club's next game and then dropped for the next league match, before he was sold to Conference side Crawley Town for officially an undisclosed five-figure sum, although it was reported to be anywhere from £15,000 to £50,000. Neilson had played 30games for Bradford in all competitions.|$|E

[...] "I <b>got</b> <b>very</b> {{fed up with}} them, always finding fault with any arrangement or orchestrations that I made ... 'spoiling the original' etc. etc.", and so Wood passed off his own orchestration of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, as a transcription by a Russian composer called Paul Klenovsky. In Wood's later account, {{the press and the}} BBC [...] "fell into the trap and said the scoring was wonderful, Klenovsky had the real flare [...] for true colour etc. – and performance after performance was given and asked for." [...] Wood kept the secret for five years before revealing the truth. [...] The press treated the deception as a great joke; The Times entered into the spirit of it with a jocular tribute to the lamented Klenovsky.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{was not a}} [...] "walker"; he {{believed}} in waiting for the umpire to make a decision, once telling the English cricketer Arthur Gilligan, [...] "The more you play this game, the more you will find out that will be given out many times when you are not out and vice versa". [...] English professional cricketers took {{a dim view of}} Armstrong's approach to the game. [...] Jack Hobbs, describing one instance said, The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong, who <b>got</b> <b>very</b> nasty and unsportsmanlike, refusing to accept the umpire's decision. That upset me. I did not know if was standing on my head or my heels with the consequence that two balls later I let one go, never even attempting to play it; and it bowled me. I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of {{media coverage of}} the event was deferential. Most major news organizations broadcast the various events live multiple times; during the week, the cable channel C-SPAN broadcast uninterrupted coverage of the funeral ceremonies. A few complained, however, that the television coverage was excessive and preempted coverage of other events. CBS News anchor Dan Rather was quoted as saying: [...] "Even though everybody is respectful and wants to pay homage to the president, life does go on. There is other news, like the reality of Iraq. It <b>got</b> <b>very</b> short shrift this weekend." [...] Throughout the week, media experts reported that the national mourning, televised nearly non-stop on many television networks, provided Americans welcome respite from unhappy reports that American troops were being killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, giving them a sense of good news they had been desperate for since the September 11 attacks.|$|E

500|$|... "Climbing Up the Walls" [...] – {{described}} by Melody Maker as [...] "monumental chaos" [...] – is layered {{with a string}} section, ambient noise and repetitive, metallic percussion. The string section, composed by Jonny Greenwood and written for 16 instruments, was inspired by modern classical composer Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima. Greenwood said, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>very</b> excited {{at the prospect of}} doing string parts that didn't sound like 'Eleanor Rigby', which is what all string parts have sounded like for the past 30 years." [...] Select described Yorke's distraught vocals and the atonal strings as [...] "Thom's voice dissolving into a fearful, blood-clotted scream as Jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo." [...] For the lyrics, Yorke drew from his time as an orderly in a mental hospital during the Care in the Community policy of deinstitutionalizing mental health patients, and a New York Times article about serial killers.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think the}} movie is about mothers and sons," [...] Spacey said, {{referring}} to Darin's relationship with his mother Polly and sister Nina. Spacey's mother, Kathleen Fowler, died of brain cancer just before production started. [...] "I made the movie for all mothers, but especially for my mother. She introduced me to Bobby Darin. When she <b>got</b> <b>very</b> ill in 2002, I stopped everything {{and took care of}} her. We constantly played Bobby Darin records, and I'd let her listen to the tracks I was recording. I'm glad she passed knowing this was the movie I was going to make." [...] After his award-winning performances in The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, Spacey [...] "chose to move away from dark, sarcastic characters, and instead play damaged but good-hearted men" [...] in films like Pay It Forward, K-PAX and The Shipping News. The actor was criticized for his career move; Spacey acknowledged the similarities when Darin integrated into folk music and protest songs.|$|E
