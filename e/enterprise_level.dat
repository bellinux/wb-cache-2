5|$|The {{value of}} all {{consumer}} goods manufactured in 1972 in retail prices was about 118 billion rubles ($530 billion). The Era of Stagnation, a term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, is considered by several economists {{to be the worst}} financial crisis in the Soviet Union. It was triggered by the Nixon Shock, over-centralisation and a conservative state bureaucracy. As the economy grew, the volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. As a result, labour productivity decreased nationwide. The cumbersome procedures of bureaucratic administration did not allow for the free communication and flexible response required at the <b>enterprise</b> <b>level</b> to deal with worker alienation, innovation, customers and suppliers. The late Brezhnev Era also saw an increase in political corruption. Data falsification became common practice among bureaucrats to report satisfied targets and quotas to the government, and this further aggravated the crisis in planning.|$|E

40|$|Using an {{expected}} mean-variance model {{the changes in}} farm <b>enterprise</b> <b>levels</b> and indirect utility were examined under conditions of risk aversion, budget constraints and gross margin variance. An extension of the comparative statics of the expected mean-variance model was adopted by introducing a budget constraint into the constrained optimisation problem. A 10 -year expected mean-variance whole-farm model was solved for a farm in the wheat-sheep zone of Australia to provide an empirical example. Results were obtained using no planning horizon (the static model) {{and then with a}} five-year rolling planning horizon (the dynamic model). In addition, <b>enterprise</b> <b>levels</b> were constrained to match levels observed on the farm so as to compare incomes between the constrained and unconstrained models. For a cash constrained, risk averse, farmer it was found that they are likely to have larger expenditures than less risk averse operators in order to obtain the same indirect utility. <b>Enterprise</b> <b>levels</b> differed between the dynamic and static models, and a dynamic model was used to help explain inter-temporal decision-making. Risk aversion reduced the set of possible welfare improving production activities available to a farmer. Whole-farm modelling, enterprise selection, risk., Farm Management, Q 12, C 61,...|$|R

[...] In 1978, Vietnam became fully integrated into the Communist world planning and development structure, and its five-year plans were coordinated with those of its Communist partners. Planned Soviet outlays for the 1986–90 period totaled some $11–13 billion. This aid and trade waned with {{the decline of the}} USSR, with the full cutoff occurring in 1991. [...] The country's new economic emphasis, Doi Moi, was instituted by Nguyễn Văn Linh following the sixth national party congress in 1986. [...] His plan included policy and structural reforms for a market-based economic system: price decontrol (liberalized prices), currency devaluation, private sector expansion by de-collectivizing agriculture, legal recognition of private business, new foreign investment laws, autonomy of state enterprises, business accounting methods, devolution of government decision-making in industry to <b>enterprise</b> <b>level,</b> and limiting government participation to macroeconomic issues.

Using the <b>enterprise</b> credit <b>level</b> score, it is possible to connect them. Second, this study showed that HRD area and HRM area had a different effect on the <b>enterprise</b> credit <b>level.</b> Especially almost all items in HRD area such as education and training and so on had a significant correlation with the <b>enterprise</b> credit <b>level.</b> This result can give a stimulus to investment in enterprise on HRD. Third, with consideration that the <b>enterprise</b> credit <b>level</b> {{can be one of the}} indicators of future value of enterprise and the solution leading investment of enterprise on HRD is the reflection of future value on the present value, it is critical to find a relationship between the HR activity and the <b>enterprise</b> credit <b>level</b> in policy making.

2500|$|Geodatabases in ArcGIS can {{be stored}} in three {{different}} ways – as a [...] "file geodatabase", a [...] "personal geodatabase", or an [...] "ArcSDE geodatabase". [...] Introduced at 9.2, the file geodatabase stores information in a folder named with a [...]gdb extension. The insides look similar to that of a coverage but is not, in fact, a coverage. Similar to the personal geodatabase, the file geodatabase only supports a single editor. However, unlike the personal geodatabase, there is virtually no size limit. By default, any single table cannot exceed 1TB, but this can be changed. [...] Personal geodatabases store data in Microsoft Access files, using a BLOB field to store the geometry data. [...] The OGR library is able to handle this file type, to convert it to other file formats. [...] Database administration tasks for personal geodatabases, such as managing users and creating backups, can be done through ArcCatalog. [...] Personal geodatabases, which are based on Microsoft Access, run only on Microsoft Windows and have a 2 gigabyte size limit. [...] Enterprise (multi-user) level geodatabases are handled using ArcSDE, which interfaces with high-end DBMS such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, DB2 and Informix to handle database management aspects, while ArcGIS deals with spatial data management. [...] <b>Enterprise</b> <b>level</b> geodatabases support database replication, versioning and transaction management, and are cross-platform compatible, able to run on Linux, Windows, and Solaris.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the strike}} broke out, Ceaușescu {{and his wife}} Elena were on a Black Sea vacation. At Verdeț' insistence, he hastily came to Petroșani on August 3. 35,000 (some sources say 40,000) came to see him [...] to be sure, not all had come to hold a {{dialogue}} with him, but went out of curiosity or carried away by events, but the audience was nonetheless impressive in size.

[...] (in reference to the Lupeni Strike of 1929, enshrined in the mythology of the Romanian Communist Party), {{in an effort to}} add legitimacy to their cause. Dobre read the list of grievances to Ceaușescu, presenting 26 demands related to work hours, production targets, pensions, supplies, housing and investments. They asked for a restoration of the status quo ante in social legislation, the guarantee of adequate food supplies and medical care, the establishment of workers’ commissions at the <b>enterprise</b> <b>level</b> empowered to dismiss incompetent or corrupt managers, and a pledge of no reprisals against the strikers. After that, Dobre recalled, [...] "While my name was being shouted, I turned toward Ceaușescu, gave him the list from which I had read and he said to me: 'Thank you for informing me, comrade'. Once in front of the microphones, Ceaușescu was not allowed to speak. Some were booing him, others shouted that they wouldn't go into the mine, and from afar one could hear my name. In vain the appeals for quiet with raised arms from the activists on the podium".|$|E
