50|$|On 1 June 2005 {{a number}} of news laws such as a new penal code (Law 5237), a new code of {{criminal}} proceedings (Law 5271) and new law on the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentences</b> (Law 5275) entered into force. Articles 45 to 52 of the Turkish Penal Code (TPC) of 2005 divide sentences into strict imprisonment, ordinary imprisonment, and fines. Imprisonment is divided into aggravated life imprisonment, life imprisonment and termed sentences of imprisonment. Indefinite sentences besides life imprisonment and aggravated life imprisonment do not exist in Turkey. Article 47 TPC states that aggravated life imprisonment will last for a whole life.|$|E

Answering a parliamentarian's request, Justice Minister Sadullah Ergin stated in August 2009 that the reconstruction of the prison to a closed high security institution for the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentences</b> had been finished.

5000|$|In {{the same}} report the CPT drew special {{attention}} to people sentenced to aggravated life imprisonment who, according to Article 25 of Law 5275, must be held in individual cells. The report stated inter alia: The three F-type prisons visited in December 2005, were accommodating {{a small number of}} prisoners serving a sentence of aggravated life imprisonment. Their only out-of-cell activity, apart from a visit every 15 days and a fortnightly telephone call, was outdoor exercise in the courtyard adjoining their cell. The application of an isolation-type regime is a step that can have very harmful consequences for the prisoner concerned and can, in certain circumstances, lead to inhuman and degrading treatment. Beyond this, the CPT considers that the very philosophy underlying Article 25 of the Law on <b>Execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sentences</b> should be reconsidered.|$|E
50|$|Carromero's {{trial in}} Cuba began and ended on October 5, 2012. The Cuban Attorney General's office sought {{to impose a}} penalty of seven {{years in prison for}} Carromero, however, he was {{ultimately}} given a sentence of four years, which, owing to a bilateral convention on the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentences</b> existing between Cuba and Spain, could be served in the latter country. Ángel Carromero arrived in Spain on December 29, 2012 and was temporarily held at the Centro Penitenciario de Segovia. Since mid-January 2013 he is serving the remainder of his sentence under open-regime detention: At first he had to spend the nights from Monday to Thursday in a supervised reintegration center in Madrid. During working days, he was able to move freely and follow his daytime work, and was allowed to spend the weekends at his own home. In mid-February 2013 he was granted additional freedom of movement by way of an ankle monitor, making the overnight stays at his reintegration center unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|Article 107 of the Law on the <b>Execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sentences</b> (LES) {{provides}} that {{in case of}} good conduct (tr: iyi hâl) prisoners may be released on condition. In cases of rehabilitation, ill health, or permanent disability, the President of the Republic may pardon inmates. Prisoners sentenced to aggravated life imprisonment can be paroled after serving at least 36 years, or 40 years if given more than one sentence. For those convicted of terrorism, there is no parole, and thus they will {{spend the rest of}} their lives in prison. In addition, they can be pardoned or have their sentenced reduced by the President. Inmates sentenced to ordinary life imprisonment can be paroled after serving 30 years, or 36 years if given more than one sentence. However, parole is not mandatory, and if rejected, inmates can reapply every 3 years. All other people sentenced to terms of imprisonment can become paroled for good behavior after they serve two thirds of their sentence, or three fourths if sentenced in cases of terrorism or sex crimes, in prison. However, parole is only possible if the inmate made no violations of prison rules. For those sentenced to less than one year in prison, they can be released after serving half the sentence.|$|E

50|$|The Law 5275 on the <b>Execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sentences</b> {{provides}} that prisoners sentenced to aggravated life imprisonment {{are held in}} rooms for one person and are allowed one hour of open air or sports per day. Under subparagraph c), prisoners serving aggravated life imprisonment may have their daily one-hour open-air exercise and sports period extended and may be allowed to engage in limited contact with prisoners accommodated in the same unit, depending on the risk factors, security requirements and the efforts and good behaviour they demonstrate in rehabilitation and educational activities. Under subparagraph d), such prisoners may engage in a trade or occupational activity considered suitable by the administrative board, if conditions {{in the place where}} they are held so permit. They can make phone calls of 10 minutes length every fortnight and receive visits of one hour's length every two weeks. The Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) considers that the very philosophy underlying Article 25 of Law 5275 should be rethought. The decision whether or not to impose an isolation-type regime should lie with the prison authorities and always be based on an individual risk assessment of the prisoner concerned; further, the regime should be applied for as short a time as possible, which implies that the decision imposing it should be reviewed at regular intervals.|$|E
40|$|Historically, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentences</b> passed at the level of international courts and tribunals. Capital punishment was still used, and custodial sanctions were imposed in the relevant states. It was not until the 1990 s, with the creation of the ad hoc tribunals, that the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentences</b> also became a task for international tribunals, in cooperation with, and by means of transferring the sentenced person to, a state which had committed itself to executing the sentence. The basic principles of these vertical transfer, or execution of sentence, procedures, as is also the case {{at the level of the}} ICC, are characterized by a system logic, with a limited role for the sentenced person. Nonetheless, minimal human rights and international standards for the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentences</b> (as agreed upon at the level of the UN) are respected. The authors investigate if and to what extent the interests of the sentenced person could be better pursued and enhanced during vertical procedures for the execution of sentences; they therefore take a clear-cut rehabilitation and social integration perspective. Given the dominant representation of EU member states among states willing to execute sentences passed by international tribunals and courts, the authors moreover wonder whether practice should not evolve towards reflecting the obligatory compliance of these states with, besides the UN standards, additional (sometimes wider, more precise and higher) Council of Europe and EU standards. This would be reflected in the policies of the tribunals and courts (especially the ICC) relating to the conclusion of sentence execution agreements with states, as well as in the actual case-based decisions in which particular sentence execution states are chosen. The authors further plead for the conclusion of a bilateral EU-ICC agreement on the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentences,</b> since this would constitute an important contribution to international justice, and one that is likely to make the reintegration and rehabilitation of offenders (a greater) part of it...|$|E
