50|$|The road passes {{just south}} of the {{historical}} Miller Town Hall, in the community of Miller Beach. After the community of Miller Beach, the highway enters the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The road passes through woodland and parallel to the South Shore tracks, before leaving the National Lakeshore west of Ogden Dunes. In Ogden Dunes the highway becomes a four-lane divided highway, passing through woodland with some houses. After Ogden Dunes the road has a folded diamond interchange with the north terminus of SR 249 and George Nalson <b>Dirve,</b> which heads into the industrial complex at Burns Harbor. The industrial complex at Burns Harbor includes a NIPSCO power plant and a steel mill. After SR 249, the route has an intersection with SR 149 and a folded diamond interchange at an access road into Burns Harbor. After this interchange the highway narrows to a two-lane highway again.|$|E
50|$|Hunter-Reay {{began to}} compete in A1 Grand Prix during the 2006-07 season. Hunter-Reay would {{represent}} the United States with Phil Giebler and Jonathan Summerton for A1 Team USA in a team entered by West Surrey Racing. Hunter-Reay would <b>dirve</b> a A1 Team USA Lola B05/52-Zytek V8 (the series did not use numbers for the individual cars). Hunter-Reay was originally going to make his debut in the series at the A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Beijing, China on the Beijing International Streetcircuit. During practice for the race there was problems with a turn of the track that was 180 degrees. The track was eventually changed and Hunter-Reay never got to drive in the event. Hunter-Reay would make his debut at the sixth round of the season (the eleventh and twelfth races of the season), the A1 Grand Prix of Nations, New Zealand at Taupo Motorsport Park. In the sprint race Hunter-Reay started in 16th place and finished in 11th place. In the feature race the starting line up {{was determined by the}} results of the sprint race. As a result, Hunter-Reay started in 11th place and would finish in 10th place. Hunter-Reay would not compete in any other A1 Grand Prix races during the season. The A1 Grand Prix team would finish in 9th place in the point standings with 42 points.|$|E
40|$|Between {{the local}} and the global: climate, local governments, {{networks}} The notion of an ongoing global warming is shared by {{a large number of}} researchers and decision-makers around the world. Through the act of signing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change a majority of the world's naitons have accepted the idea of human induced climate change, and to develop national climate change mitigation programmes. The Kyoto protocol later quantified the commitments made by the nations. The issue of climate change has become a political issue of its own. In the European Union as well as in Sweden and other nations, climate mitigation goals, programmes and strategies are developed. This is also the situation on the local level, for example in Swedish municipalities, which is the context of this study. Local goverment is an important actor in climate mitigation, both as a political organization in its own right and as an arena involving actors from different sectors in society. Climate change mitigation measures conducted by local governments re partly shaped by national grant programmes. The study shows, however, that the local context - the palce - with its natural prerequisites, economic structures and composition of actors, is just as decisive for how the local climate policies are developed and implemented. It also shows that although responsibility for the environment is an important driving force in local climate mitigation {{there are at least two}} other <b>dirving</b> forces; local and regional development and the symbolic valute of being in the forefront of climate change mitigation. Another arena where actors in climate change mitigation meet is the network. Together wiht actors from different sectors and levels many municipalities participate in various networks, with local to global extension. The fact that the netsorks like climate change in inself transcends political and administrative borders, is als√∂ addressed theoretically in the study, focusing upon the concepts of re-scaling, multilevel governance and network governance, which constitute the theoretichal fram of the thesis...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Johnson Westropp, a {{prolific}} purveyor of antiquities {{on the western}} seaboard, who visited the Erris area in the early 20th century wrote the following of Glencastle in 1911. [...] "It is a beautiful spot, especially after the dreary <b>dirve</b> through barren moors from Crossmolina through Bangor. We suddenly dip into a stream runnel and, without preparation drop into a lovely wooded glen, at first so narrow that there is barely room for {{the road and the}} brook; we pass a regular brown dyke of volcanic rock and a thickly-wooded hillside, hovered over by hawks, and reach the more open valley, the [...] "Gates of Erris'. In its centre a grassy moat-like mass of rock was upheaved by some remote eruption. The east face is covered with hazels and birch, the upper trees growing out of the side to keep the shelter of the fort rising over 90 feet above the stream. To the north, a great mountain swells up for 760 feet facing the glen and its keeper. A second mound, like an overturned boat lies further down the valley" [...] Unfortunately, due to 21st century quarrying on a massive scale, this former 'beauty spot' is barely recognisable as the entire hillside on the left hand side as described above has been mechanically removed to the dismay of visitors to Erris.|$|E

40|$|The belt {{conveyor}} {{is the main}} transport equipments in coal field, and its controllable <b>dirve</b> system directly impacts on the running safety reliability and cost in coal production. Starting speed is unsmoothed in the traditional electrical drive system, which causes the belt off tracking or split and even safty accident. Therefore it is theory and practical significant to introduce a novel direct torque control (DTC) system of AC machine to the {{belt conveyor}} for solving the problem in coal mine. In allusion to the optimization of PID parameters in the speed regulators of the belt conveyor, the paper presents the improved genetic algorithm based on genetic algorithms and tabu search {{for the design of}} variable parameters of PID controller, and its ability of stronger climbing and faster finding the global optimum results are verified through the De Jong function. Compared with the traditional means, the rise time of the suggested system is faster, overshoot and regulating time is shorter, anti-disturbance is stronger, robust is better. So the optimization performance of control system is improved greatly...|$|E
