5|$|The {{historian}} R. R. Darlington {{argued that}} the Vita was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote that <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it {{more likely to have}} been written shortly after Æthelwig's death. The work itself is not a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.|$|E
25|$|The namesake of Frederick County and its {{county seat}} is unknown, but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> either Frederick, Prince of Wales or Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|The krater {{was made}} of seven or more {{individual}} pieces with alphabetical markings, indicating that <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> transported to Burgundy in pieces and assembled in situ.|$|E
50|$|Whether Cupressus funebris {{naturally}} occurs also {{in northern}} Vietnam is uncertain; if so, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> the most threatened conifer of that country.|$|R
5000|$|NCG 1087 lies {{near the}} small M77 (NGC 1068) galaxy group that also {{includes}} NGC 936, NGC 1055, and NGC 1090. However, because of its distance, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> not an actual group member.|$|R
6000|$|Lobelia ramosa. (5/22. I {{have adopted}} the name given to this plant in the 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1866. Professor T. Dyer, however, informs me that <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> a white variety of L. tenuior of R. Brown, from W. Australia.) ...|$|R
25|$|Ecgwynn's {{own family}} {{background}} {{and social status}} cannot be identified with any certainty. What little evidence there is appears in the main to be coloured by a controversy which surrounded Æthelstan's succession, contested as <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> by supporters of Edward's sons by Ælfflæd.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{the bones}} of the rear half of the animal found are not {{particularly}} diagnostic in ceratopsians and Agathaumas remains a nomen dubium. No other remains have been found in the area, but based on its size and age of the rocks, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> a Triceratops.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} start of the Easter Fair of 1734, Zedler again tried to run down his {{inventory}} by low offers. At the end of 1734 he ran ads for a magazine project called News worth reading for the city and the new University of Göttingen, but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> never published.|$|E
60|$|Everything {{neat and}} trim and clean like the town. The loveliest {{trees and the}} {{greatest}} variety I have ever seen anywhere, except approaching Darjeeling. Have not heard anyone call Natal the garden of South Africa, but that <b>is</b> what <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> should <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> {{noted that}} except for Albert, the critics are Marxists.|$|R
50|$|The chief {{threats to}} the Beira toad are over-extraction of surface waters, and from {{conversion}} of certain lands to agriculture <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> found within several protected areas, notably the Kafue National Park and South Luangwa National Park of Zambia. <b>Its</b> true range <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> underestimated as {{this is a difficult}} species to record.|$|R
25|$|In 1988, Maccabi Haifa {{decimated}} Maccabi Tel Aviv 10–0 to earn {{its biggest}} win ever. That game, {{one of the}} more famous in Israeli's football lore, wasn't even televised. Furthermore, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> the beginning of the intense rivalry between the two clubs. In 1989, under the capable hands of Amazzia Levkovic, the club won another championship.|$|E
25|$|The {{court found}} no {{evidence}} of error by the Swedish crew, although it noted that the erroneous QFF may have caused the altimeter to be wrong by one millibar. Although there was evidence of a failure to adhere to proper radio communications procedure, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> not a factor in the accident. The report stated there was {{reason to believe that the}} York's altimeters were set a lot higher than the Regional QFF. This may have been caused by using the wrong QFF sent earlier by the controller or that the altimeters were still set to the standard mean sea level barometric pressure.|$|E
25|$|Crazywell Cross is {{an ancient}} cross close to Crazywell Pool in {{southern}} Dartmoor. Like the cross pattée, {{the arms of the}} cross grow wider as they move away from the centre. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> used as a marker for the track (Monks' Path) from Buckfast Abbey to Tavistock Abbey. The head of the cross was found close to the north-east side of the pool by William Crossing. He believed that its original site was nearer to the track and it was fitted with a new shaft and set up there. In 1952 it was reported to the Dartmoor Preservation Association that the cross had been damaged again and it was repaired and the base made more secure.|$|E
5000|$|The Symphony in G Major ("Mannheim No. 1") is a Mannheim symphony {{that was}} {{proposed}} {{to be by}} Johann Stamitz, but probably written (but not proven to be) by Antoine Mahaut, a close contemporary of the composer. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> written from 1741 to 1746, {{and if it is}} truly a symphony by Stamitz, it could be his first. But if it <b>is</b> by Mahaut, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> his first. <b>It</b> is formed with the standard 3-movement symphonic scheme of the time: ...|$|R

50|$|Gardner's short-tailed opossum inhabits the montane forests on {{the eastern}} slopes of the Andes Mountains in Peru. It was found in dense to semi-open forests or even at the edge between forest and an open {{sphagnum}} bog in thickets of dense brush and bamboo. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> terrestrial and does not climb trees.|$|R
25|$|Lessuden village, as it {{was then}} known, {{consisted}} of one long street, now Main Street, and a narrow back-road which ran along Braeheads, on the high banks of the river. Several paths connected Braeheads to the main street. The form of the old village remains pretty much today {{as it was}} in times gone past. <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> not much different in 1544 when the army of Henry VIII of England under the Earl of Hertford razed the Border Abbeys and caused destruction of dwellings in the village including Lessuden House, which was later rebuilt. Nearby this house stood the original village church called St Mary's which was established in the 12th century in the reign of David I. Through time the worshippers moved to a church erected at Benrig near St Boisil's Chapel which, with repeated repairs and reconstructions, stood until 1952 when it was finally demolished.|$|E
500|$|Wansdyke, {{an early}} medieval {{defensive}} linear earthwork, runs from south of Bristol to near Marlborough, Wiltshire, passing {{not far from}} Bath. [...] <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> built in the fifth or sixth centuries, perhaps by Ceawlin.|$|E
500|$|In 1845, Swiss {{zoologist}} Johann Jakob von Tschudi {{described the}} new species Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata among other species he had collected in Peru. The species was recorded as being from the [...] "forest region" [...] (Amazonia) of Peru and was known {{from a single}} specimen, the holotype. In 1887, G.A. Boulenger placed it at an uncertain position within the genus Mabuia, which included Tschudi's Trachylepis. In a 1907 reappraisal of some of Tschudi's reptiles and amphibians, J. Roux redescribed punctata under the name [...] "Mabuia punctata", but did not comment on its affinities. In 1935, E.R. Dunn reviewed some American Mabuya and commented that {{he was unable to}} tell the identity of punctata, but that <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> not a true Mabuya.|$|E
5000|$|Haplogroup K2b (P331), {{also known}} as MPS [...] is a human {{y-chromosome}} haplogroup that {{is thought to be}} less than 3,000 years younger than K, and less than 10,000 years younger than F, meaning <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> around 50,000 years old, according to the age estimates of Tatiana Karafet et al. 2014.|$|R
5000|$|The {{poems of}} Ibrahim al-Sha'ir had been {{collected}} and compiled by his former student al-Nadhir Tag al-Sirr al-Bashir (النذير تاج السر البشير). The compilation comprises his life's work and is called [...] "The Genius Diwan of the Manasir" [...] (ديوان عبقرية المناصير). <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> the only literary document from within Dar al-Manasir.|$|R

500|$|Upon its release, {{consumer}} {{magazines and}} newspapers generally gave Gone with the Wind excellent reviews. However, while its production values, technical achievements, and scale of ambition were universally recognized, some reviewers of the time found the film to be too long and dramatically unconvincing. Frank S. Nugent for The New York Times best summed up the general sentiment by acknowledging that while {{it was the most}} ambitious film production made up to that point, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> not the greatest film ever made, but he nevertheless found it to be an [...] "interesting story beautifully told". Franz Hoellering of The Nation was of the same opinion: [...] "The result is a film which is a major event {{in the history of the}} industry but only a minor achievement in motion-picture art. There are moments when the two categories meet on good terms, but the long stretches between are filled with mere spectacular efficiency." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in The New York Times, Richards Vidmer {{opened his}} account of the game as follows: [...] "The {{greatest}} naval disaster of them all took place on Ferry Field today when a hungry pack of Wolverines set upon the Navy eleven from Annapolis, snarled and snapped, chewed and clawed, and finally buried the Easterners under a defeat of 54 to 0. [...] <b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> the worst defeat the Navy ever has suffered on land or sea." [...] Vidmer added that the Michigan squad played [...] "like one big monster" [...] and opined that the team would probably {{go down in history as}} Fielding Yost's masterpiece. [...] Writing in the Chicago Daily Tribune, James Crusinberry also employed a naval metaphor: [...] "Under a maze of forward pass plays, double passes, delayed passes, and criss-cross, Uncle Sam's proud gridiron dreadnaught, rocked by a great Michigan tidal wave, limped into port tonight on the leeward side of a 54 to 0 score." [...] Crusinberry opined that Michigan had [...] "played more new football [...] [...] [...] than any team ever did in one game" [...] and declared quarterback Benny Friedman the star of the game:"If any one man stood out, it was Benny Friedman, who hurled forward passes with accuracy and abandon time after time[...] [...] [...] Besides that, Benny was a regular whirligig in carrying the ball. [...] And it was Benny who was the field general. [...] His selections of plays was something that would make any general envious." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> an {{interesting}} meeting. [...] Chief Moses probably {{thought that the}} verdict in his upcoming murder trial would depend upon whether he agreed {{to give up his}} land.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{there is}} little recent {{information}} about this species, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as [...] "Data Deficient". Threats to it <b>are</b> unknown, but <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> threatened by mining on Mount Nimba. It occurs in the Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve, but is absent from Comoé National Park.|$|R
5000|$|Monobaatar is a genus of extinct mammal {{from the}} Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia. It {{was within the}} also extinct order Multituberculata, and lived during the [...] "age of the dinosaurs".

2500|$|The U.S. army used waterboarding, {{called the}} [...] "water cure", during the Philippine–American War. It {{is not clear}} where this {{practice}} came from; <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> adopted from the Filipinos, who themselves adopted it from the Spanish. Reports of [...] "cruelties" [...] from soldiers stationed in the Philippines led to Senate hearings on U.S. activity there.|$|E
2500|$|The Poison Strip Sandstone {{was named}} for prominent, cliff-forming {{sandstones}} in the Poison Strip uranium district north of Arches National Monument. It is actually a series of sandstones that were deposited in river channels, and lesser amounts of mudstones and limestones that were deposited on the flood plain and small ponds. The [...] Poison Strip Sandstone may represent a meandering river complex. Based on {{the position of the}} Poison Strip between the Yellow Cat and Ruby Ranch members, <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> latest Barremian to earliest Aptian. Carbonate growths appear on bones in the quarry from which Venenosaurus was extracted.|$|E

The presence of the sacoglossan Placida cremoniana (Trinchese, 1892) in the Azores is confirmed. Pleurobranchus sp. from the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands is compared with P. garciagomesi Cervera et al. 1996; <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> an undescribed species...|$|R
