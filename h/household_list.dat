The evidence shows that Lady Bryan was succeeded by Lady Herbert of Troy; Prince Edward was also placed in her charge when he grew older for Lewys Morgannwg states that she was [...] "in charge of his (Prince Edward’s) fosterage." [...] Lady Herbert of Troy’s position is confirmed by lists of personnel for Lady Elizabeth in the Letters and Papers of Henry VIII. Internal evidence suggests a range of dates for these lists from before 1536 to 1546. Lady Herbert of Troy’s name heads the earlier lists, followed by Kate Champernon who was appointed in 1536 as a governess. In 1545 Roger Ascham (whose page was John Whitney, possibly a relation of Blanche Milborne) wrote to Champernon asking that she commend him to [...] "my good Lady Troy and all that company of gentlewomen." [...] However, the c.1546 <b>household</b> <b>list</b> for Lady Elizabeth does not mention Lady Herbert of Troy indicating that she retired from her position in late 1545 or early 1546; Elizabeth was then twelve years old.|$|E

This grim scenario of urban health exists despite the fact that urban poor enjoy physical proximity to private, charitable as well as public municipal health centres. To understand this paradox and further probe the health issues of the urban poor, a survey of 544 households living in 22 lowincome settlements was carried out in 2006. The survey was sponsored by the Self Employed Womenâ€™sâ€™ Association (SEWA) as a baseline study to understand the health needs in these low-income settlements.

Written informed consents were obtained from all the respondents. Relevant clinical examination for chronic harmful alcohol-use was done according to the AUDIT clinical screening procedures. The results revealed that 65. 8 % (150 / 228) were current consumers of alcohol; 14 % were alcohol-dependents; 8 % were hazardous or harmful consumers, and 78 % were non-hazardous non-harmful consumers. The mean age of the respondents at the initiation of drinking alcohol was 20. 8 + 5. 9 years. Eighty-six percent of dependents (n= 21) took both Indian-made foreign liquor and locally-made alcoholic beverages. The proportions of alcohol consumers who drank alone among alcohol-dependents, hazardous or harmful consumers, and non-hazardous non-harmful consumers were 71. 4 %, 50 %, and 7. 7 % respectively, and the difference was significant (p< 0. 01). Forty-one percent of the consumers drank at public places and workplaces, which may be socially harmful. About 38 % of the dependents purchased alcohol from unlicensed liquor shops. Only 16 % expressed concerns for their drinking habit mainly to the past illness. The proportion of the concerned respondents was higher in the hazardous and harmful drinking patterns than in the non-hazardous non-harmful drinking pattern, and the difference was significant (p< 0. 05). About 62 % of the dependents had clinical signs of chronic alcohol consumption. The presence of a considerable proportion of alcohol-dependents, the low mean age at initiation of drinking alcohol, and the habit of drinking in public places and workplaces are the main areas that need special emphasis by intervention programmes...|$|E
50|$|The 1838 Nova Scotia Census shows James Franey and Patrick Franey {{enumerated}} in Sherbrooke Settlement, Lunenburg Co. They {{are listed}} as {{the second and third}} household respectively. The first head of <b>household</b> <b>listed</b> in Sherbrooke is John Butler who was the father of Mary Butler, wife of the above Patrick Franey. Nearby Butler Lake was named after John Butler. The fourth head of <b>household</b> <b>listed</b> is John Connell, husband of James Franey's daughter Ann. The fifth head of <b>household</b> <b>listed</b> is William Tobin, husband of James Franey's daughter Margaret. The Franey name was also given to nearby Franey Lake, Franey Brook, and Franey Hill. The Franey family originated in New Ross, County Wexford, Ireland, arriving in Nova Scotia supposedly around 1824 when Patrick was a boy aged ten years. Patrick had two other sisters - Margaret who married Patrick Donnellan in Newfoundland before being one of the original settlers in Dalhousie Settlement in 1817, and Mary who married Charles McClintock in 1835. Donnellan Stillwater in East Dalhousie and McClintock Brook on the Dalhousie Road are named for those two families. Donnellan Brook on the Bay of Fundy is named after Patrick and Eleanor's son John Donnellan who married Anne Ogilvie. By the taking of the 1911 census, the Franeys had all left Franey Corner. Patrick Franey had eleven children. Of his sons, Martin's family were living in East Dalhousie, John's family was living in Weston, David and Albert were in Kentville, James, Ned, and Will were living in Aylesford, and Robert had moved to Washington State.|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The research in this thesis was motivated by an interest in understanding the work and effort that goes into organising family homes, {{with the aim of}} informing the design of novel information technology for the home. It was undertaken to address a notable absence of in-depth research into domestic information and communication technology in the fields of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). To that end, this thesis presents an ethnographic study of everyday routines in thirteen family homes. Following an established tradition within HCI and CSCW, the study applies qualitative fieldwork methods as a means to investigate and interpret the empirical materials. Periods of extended observation and semi-structured interviews with the thirteen families over a three-year period form the basis of the empirical material. The materials are analysed using a hybrid perspective composed of a combination of influences from the study of material culture, to interaction analysis and ethnography. The hybrid analytical perspective draws out insights regarding the families’ mundane practices and the artfully devised solutions they use to organise daily life. Four household activities and artefacts are given specific focus: (i) <b>household</b> <b>list</b> making, (ii) the display qualities of refrigerator doors, (iii) the organisation of household clutter, and (iv) the devising of bespoke solutions in organising home life. Broader findings include the observations that people tailor solutions to meet their needs, that optimum efficiency is not the pre-eminent determinant in what method or artefact people choose to organise themselves and their homes, and that homes determine their individual characters in part by how everyday tasks and organisation are accomplished. In short, the personal qualities of these mundane practices are part of what makes a home a home. These findings are used to elicit implications for information technology design, with the aim of encouraging designers of domestic technology to be aware of and respectful towards the idiosyncratic nature of the home, and, wherever possible, to design {{in such a way as}} to allow the technology to be appropriated for families’ bespoke tailoring. To evaluate and address this point, two design projects, one on augmented magnets and another on a “media bowl”, are used to develop and test out this approach. Both projects are critically examined to reflect on the efficacy of the design approach and what lessons might be learnt for future studies and design exercises. The combination of detailed ethnographic fieldwork on family homes combined with the development of experimental design projects is intended to deepen the understanding of the mundane behaviours and everyday routines of family homes, in order to better inform the design of information technology for the home...|$|E

30|$|To {{precisely}} {{estimate the}} impact of the proximity to the payment date on labor supply outcomes we need a representative sample of all municipalities which are beneficiaries from Juntos. By 2009, 638 municipalities were part of the program. Given that the ENAHO follows a stratified sampling procedure, this survey collected information in 260 municipalities enrolled in Juntos in this particular year. This represents roughly 40.8 % of the municipalities in which the Juntos program was present in 2009. Nevertheless, when expanding the sample using the survey weights from the sampling design, Perova and Vakis (2012) find that the number of households which report receiving cash transfers from Juntos surveyed in the ENAHO 2009 is very close to the actual number of beneficiary <b>households</b> <b>listed</b> in the program’s official records. We therefore use sample weights in all of our regressions and correct standard errors taking into account ENAHO’s sampling design.|$|R
