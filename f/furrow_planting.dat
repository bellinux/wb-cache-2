40|$|Introduction Maize (Zea mays L.) which {{belongs to}} the Poaceae family is the third {{important}} cereal crop of the world after wheat and rice. Salinity {{is one of the}} major environmental factors limiting plant growth and productivity. Maize is sensitive to salinity. Planting method is a crucial factor for improving crop yield. Planting methods in saline and non-saline conditions are different. Kinetin is one of the cytokinins known to significantly improve the growth of crop plants grown under salinity. Indole acetic acid (IAA) is also known to play a significant role in plant tolerance to salt stress. However, little information appears to be available on the relationship between salinity tolerance and auxin or cytokinins levels in plants. In this respect, the objective of this study was to study the effects of foliar applications of cytokinin and auxin hormones on yield and yield components of grain maize under different planting patterns in saline conditions. Materials and Methods The experiment was carried out at Bushehr Agricultural and Natural Resources Research Center, Dashtestan station with 29 ° 16 ´ E latitude and 51 ° 31 ´ N, longitude and 70 m above the see surface during the 2013 growing season. Dashtestan region is a warm-arid region with 250 mm precipitation per year. The field plowed by April 2013 and then prepared and sowed by August 2013. There were five rows with 75 cm distance. The experiment was conducted as a split-plot factorial design based on complete randomized blocks with three replications. Planting pattern (ridge planting, double rows of planting on a ridge in zigzag form and <b>furrow</b> <b>planting)</b> as the main factor and time of cytokinin (0 as a control, V 5 - V 6 stage and V 8 - V 10 stage) and auxin (0 as a control, silking stage, two weeks after silking stage) foliar-applied was considered in a factorial. Cytokinin (Benzyl Adenine, Merck) and Auxin (Indole- 3 -Butiric Acid, Merck) were sprayed on the entire plant in the evening with concentration of 50 and 10 g. l- 1, respectively. All morphological and yield component traits measured on 10 randomly selected plants of each plot. Yield was measured in 9 m 2 for each treatment. Data analyzed using the SAS (Ver. 9. 1) and comparing of the means was conducted using Duncan’s multiple range test. Results and Discussion Results showed that the planting pattern had a significant effect on plant height, ear (cob) length, ear diameter, kernel row number, per ear, kernel number per row, 1000 - kernel weight, biological yield, grain yield and harvest index. The highest and the lowest yield obtained through <b>furrow</b> <b>planting</b> and conventional planting, respectively. Applying <b>furrow</b> <b>planting,</b> resulted in water use improvement and reducing side effects of saline soils Cytokinin application in V 8 - V 10 stage produced the highest plant height and row number per ear and the highest 1000 - kernel weight and harvest index was belong to the application of cytokinin in V 8 - V 10 stage. The maximum kernel number per row was obtained without cytokinin. Auxin effect on 1000 - kernel weight, biological yield, grain yield and harvest index were significant (p≤ 0. 01). The highest grain yield by a mean of 6. 57 tons. ha- 1 produced by time of auxin foliar-applied in the silking stage. It has been found that both auxin and cytokinin may have a role in mediating cell division in the endosperm during the grain-filling stage. Therefore, these hormones might regulate the grain capacity (sink size) for the accumulation of carbohydrates. It has been found that IAA actively participated in the mobilization and accumulation of carbohydrates in seeds. Auxin and cytokinins hormones are also thought to be involved in regulating the sink strength either by mediating the division and enlargement of endosperm cells or by controlling the import of assimilates to the sink. Conclusions The results indicated that the foliar application of cytokinine and auxin hormones counteracted some of the salt induced adverse effects and improved the maize yield. Due to its effect on diminishing salt aggregation in relation to ridge planting, <b>furrow</b> <b>planting,</b> prepare semi saline and saline areas for growing crops. It is concluded that <b>furrow</b> <b>planting</b> with CK application in V 8 - V 10 stage (50 g. l- 1) and IBA in silking stage (10 g. l- 1) reduced the effects of salinity on plant and produced the highest grain yield...|$|E

The present study aimed to evaluate soil, nutrients and organic carbon losses occasioned by water erosion in eucalyptus planted forests (EPF) at different development stages (2, 3 and 7 years old). Soil erosion sediments were measured and sampled from standard erosion plots installed on Red Argisol-RA (Ultisol) and Haplic Cambisol-HC (Inceptisol). Soil loss decreased as {{the age of}} plants increased; {{at the beginning of}} plant development, the canopy barely covered the soil surface, exposing the soil to higher erosion at young EPF plantations. <b>Furrow</b> <b>planting</b> system was used in the Red Argisol area and caused higher soil losses (1. 1 to 6. 2 Mg ha- 1 year- 1) as compared to pit planting system that was used in the Cambisol area (1. 1 Mg ha- 1 year- 1). It is known that Cambisol is less resistant to erosion than Argisol. However, using pit system in this EPF, resulted in lower erosion and, therefore, nutrients and carbon losses than the traditional furrow system used in Argisol.

Spunta), and to evaluate the spacial variability of production in a plot of the green belt of Cordoba, Argentina, was discussed. While fRFAI showed greater ability to explain the variability of tuber yield at harvest, using ground cover duration, the f accumulated until 60 days after planting reached an R² of 0. 77 (P < 0. 01) in 2009, which increased to 0. 95 in 2010 70 days after planting from a more intensive sampling (f was obtained from an average of nine photographs taken at 2. 5 m height). The use of a single value of f obtained near maximum coverage reduces the predictive power of cumulative values. Based on a 5 x 5 grid sampling in 2009 it was found that there is a significant component of the variability associated with <b>furrow</b> <b>planting...</b>|$|E
40|$|Resource-conserving {{agriculture}} (RCA) aims {{at improving}} soil quality and crop yield whilst maintaining or improving soil health by minimizing soil disturbance, retaining crop residue, using crop rotations and adding in situ {{soil and water}} conservation tillage practices (terwah and derdero) in crop fields. In Ethiopia, intensive mining of soil resources using repeated tillage, complete crop residue removal at harvesting, overgrazing and biomass burning in croplands have aggravated soil degradation. We studied the impact of two RCA (derdero+ (DER+) and terwah+ (TER+) on long-term soil quality and crop productivity in permanently kept plots in northern Ethiopia 7 years after its inception. The two RCA practices: (i) DER+ is a bed and <b>furrow</b> <b>planting</b> system, where beds remain unploughed, furrows are tilled once at planting time and 30 % of crop residue is retained. (ii) TER+ is ploughed once at planting, furrows are made at 1. 5 m intervals, creating fresh broad beds, and 30 % crop residue is retained. These RCA practices were compared against conventional tillage (CT) characterized by a minimum of three tillage operations and complete removal of crop residues. Among the several assessed soil properties, soil organic C (SOC), total soil N, available P, soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), time of ponding, aggregate stability index (SI), consistency index (CI), cone index, air capacity and macroporosity were shown to increase significantly in soils subjected to DER+ planting system compared to CT. On average, crop yields under DER+ and TER+ increased by 30 % and 16 %, respectively, as compared to CT. Thus, from an agro-ecological point of view, adopting improved local practices such as DER+ and TER+ planting systems that employ conservation agriculture principles proved to be sustainable, resource conserving alternatives and incentives should be provided to facilitate larger adoption by farmers in Ethiopia...|$|E
40|$|Influence of {{existing}} methods and technologies of soil processing for forest crops on establishment {{and growth of}} cultivated tree species was studied. It was found that furrow plough processing of soil can interfere with the cultivated trees’ ecological peculiarities, because the furrow floor, where trees are planted, often constitutes {{the lower part of}} the turf or the upper part of the ashen-gray layers having unfavorable water-physical conditions and decreased crop-producing power. Whenever conifer trees grow on the bottom of a furrow excavated in medium and heavy clay loam, their growth is significantly decreased and accompanied by remarkable changes in morphology. Processing of shallow humus thickness soil with multiple cutter results in mixing of A 0, A 1 and A 2 (ashen-gray) layers. Consequently, the processed horizon obtains a lower amount of fertile substances than the vegetable soil on non-processed places. An apparatus for graded soil tillage, its construction, working principle and usage technology are described. The major peculiarity of the device consists in the ability not to crumbl the soil, but to shake down vegetable earth cut by subsurface plow from beneath. The technology involves removing roots and grass outside cultivated land, so that it cannot be then overgrown with weeds. It was found that exploitation of the device improves soil pulverization quality, enhances percentage of separates less than 10 mm and 10 – 50 mm, decreases content of the separate larger than 50 mm, and reduced specific energy output almost three-fold. Vertical displacement of control particles while soil processing with common cutter machines and the suggested device was studied. Establishment and growth of Siberian pine was determined in experimental productive cultures at different planting technologies. It was shown that under the suggested technology, forest <b>plants</b> <b>furrow</b> sowing can be done while soil processing, so that making nurseries becomes unnecessary, and cleaning, ploughing <b>furrows,</b> <b>planting</b> and further tending seedlings are not needed. Soil layers are not mixed, as within usual tillage. Rich soil layer is not withdrawn, so that germination ability of target seeds increases, and growth of seedlings in enhanced. The entire process takes much less energy compared to traditional technologies. Application of the device increases the quality of forest regeneration and reduces labor input owing to the new technology...|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the local}} common practice of handpicking {{did not significantly}} reduce white grub populations. This {{might be due to}} the fact that the grubs were collected only from a small proportional area of the field, such as from the opened <b>furrow</b> for <b>planting.</b> At that time period, grubs are still not aggregated around crop roots or tubers as there is still no crop. And later, during mechanical weeding and during earthing up of potatoes, only between-row soil was searched. But at this time, grubs are expected feeding on the tubers and roots. Consequently, handpicking likely misses a large part of the pest population; thus, the effect of this method is limited.|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} {{quality and}} yield of the sugarcane crop can be prejudiced by {{expansion of the}} crop to areas of low fertility, which usually present low zinc contents in the soil. The deficiency of this nutrient can result in the reduction of tillering, shorter internodes and thinner stem. Thus, {{the objective of this}} work was to evaluate the effect of doses and sources of zinc applied in the <b>planting</b> <b>furrow,</b> in the technological quality and agroindustrial yield of the sugarcane (cane-plant and first cane-ratton) cultivated in a sandy texture soil with low zinc content, in Northwest of São Paulo state. The experiment was accomplished in an eutroferric Alfisol, in an agricultural area administered by Usina Vale do Paraná Sugar and Alcohol, in Suzanápolis - SP, Brazil. A randomized complete blocks design, with 4 repetitions, disposed in a factorial scheme 5 x 3, being: five doses of Zn (0; 2. 5; 5. 0; 7. 5 e 10. 0 kg ha- 1) and three sources of Zn (FTE, Zn chelate and Zn sulfate) applied in the <b>planting</b> <b>furrow.</b> In the first cane-ratton, there were larger percentages of sucrose concentration (pol cane and pol juice) and juice purity for the chelate and sulfate of Zn, and larger percentage of juice reducing sugars for the FTE and sulfate of Zn.

Based on the indicators of technological quality (sucrose concentration, brix cane and total recoverable sugar) of the first cane-ratton, would be interesting the application between 4. 0 and 5. 0 kg ha- 1 of Zn in the <b>planting</b> <b>furrow,</b> in the form of chelate or sulfate of Zn...|$|R
40|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{the increase in}} winter wheat yield was not the deficiency of light radiation but the low radiation use efficiency (RUE). In 2004 - 2005 and 2005 - 2006, an experiment was conducted at the Agronomy Station of Shandong Agricultural University to {{study the effects of}} irrigation and different planting patterns on the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) capture ratio, PAR utilization, and winter wheat yield. In this experiment, winter wheat was planted in four patterns as follows: uniform row planting (U; row spacing, 30  cm), " 20 +  40 " wide-narrow row planting (W), " 20 +  40 " <b>furrow</b> <b>planting</b> (F), and " 20 +  40 " bed planting (B), which are very popular in North China. The results showed that under different irrigation regimes, {{there was no significant difference}} (less than 15. 93 %) between any of the planting patterns with respect to the amount of PAR intercepted by the winter wheat canopies. However, significant differences were observed between different planting patterns with respect to the amount of PAR intercepted by plants that were 60 - 80  cm above the ground surface (53. 35 - 225. 16 %). This result was mainly due to the changes in the vertical distributions of leaf area index (LAI). As a result, the effects of the planting patterns on RUE and the winter wheat yield were due the vertical distribution of PAR in the winter wheat canopies. During the late winter wheat growing season, irrespective of the applied irrigation, the RUE in case of F was higher than that in case of U, W, and B by 0. 05 - 0. 09, 0. 04 - 0. 08, and 0. 02 - 0. 12 g/mol, respectively, and the yield was higher by 238. 39 - 693. 46, 160. 02 - 685. 96, and 308. 98 - 699. 06 kg/ha, respectively.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the integration of different chemical and agro management practices for a cost-effective weed control in cotton. The experiments were conducted at Central Cotton Research Institute, Multan during 2006 - 2009. The chemical (No chemical, Pendimethalin @ 2. 5 L ha- 1, and Glyphosate @ 4. 7 L ha- 1) and mechanical (No inter-culturing, Interculturing, Hand-weeding, and Inter-culturing + Hand-weeding) treatments were used in a split-plot arrangement in cotton sown either under a conventional flat, bed-furrow or alternate <b>furrow</b> <b>planting</b> techniques. Results showed that the chemical and mechanical treatments significantly reduced the weed density and weed dry weights in all planting techniques. However, maximum weed control was found with Pendimethalin + Inter-culturing + Hand weeding treatment, irrespective of the sowing technique. This treatment combination provided a season long control of weeds as compared to other treatments. This treatment combination also produced the maximum increase in seeds cotton yield and different yield components over other treatments in all sowing techniques. Comparison of the different planting methods with reference to weed control and yield output showed that the cotton planted on bed-furrow produced significantly higher seed cotton yield than the cotton sown on flat or alternate furrow. Variations in characteristics of fiber quality i. e. GOT(%), staple length (mm), and micronaire (Ã¬g inch- 1) in response to different weed control treatments were either non significant or significant with very little practical importance. Economic analysis showed that Pendimethalin + Inter-culturing + Hand weeding produced the maximum average net benefit and marginal rate of return than other treatment combinations. Results {{of the present study}} confirm previous findings that a timely and effective weed control in cotton is compulsory to achieve the maximum yield potential. It is further concluded that cotton sowing on bed furrow is more beneficial towards obtaining higher seed cotton yield as compared to flat or alternative planting methods. Pendimethalin (pre-em.) + Inter-culturing + Hand weeding treatment should be used for effective control of weeds in cotton. Results of this study will also be important in guiding weed control in cotton under different agroecological conditions in Pakista...|$|E
40|$|Aims A new drought-resistance farming {{technology}} of double {{ridges and furrows}} mulched with plastic film and <b>furrow</b> <b>planting</b> (PMF) is widely applied on rain-fed agriculture {{in the middle and}} eastern part of Gansu Province, China, to increase crop yield and water use efficiency. However, its impacts on seasonal and annual soil water dynamics are not well understood. Our objectives were to (a) investigate seasonal and annual changes in soil water content, corn yield and water use efficiency of different mulching methods and (b) evaluate the ecological impact of PMF on rain-fed cropland in semi-arid areas. Methods We studied three treatments: PMF, whole field surface sand mulching and flat planting (SM) and uncovered and flat planting (CK). Using oven-drying and neutron-probe methods, we observed soil water in the 0 – 200 cm layer from 2009 to 2010. Important findings PMF could improve soil water storage in the 0 – 200 cm layer significantly before corn jointing and improve corn development in the early growth period. With corn growth, {{there was a significant difference}} in water consumption among the three treatments in the sequence PMF > SM > CK. Conversely, the sequence of change of soil water storage was CK > SM > PMF. Under the same precipitation, soil water restoration depth of PMF was deepest and CK was shallowest (in the 0 – 200 cm soil layer). The quantity and depth of soil water consumption increased with increases of corn planting years in PMF treatment, e. g., depth of water consumptiondeepened from 20 – 120 cm to 120 – 200 cm from 2009 to 2010. After two years of continuous cropping of corn, soil water content in the 40 – 120 cm layer was < 9. 0 % in all three treatments, the soil water content of PMF treatment decreased to 7. 9 % (which is close to the wilting coefficient of 7. 2 %) and corn development depended on rainfall in the growing season. This indicates that continuous corn cropping with PMF would result in a dry soil layer in semiarid areas. Water consumption, corn yield and water use efficiency were highest in PMF treatment, but lowest in CK in both years. Therefore, PMF could improve corn yield significantly, but continuous cropping may result in significant reduction of soil water storage and was disadvantageous to sustainable development capacity of cropland...|$|E

Organic matter amendment of soil {{at a rate of}} 1 % dry weight has been shown to reduce the host finding activity of P. teres under laboratory conditions. In a field containing viruliferous P. teres dahlia, italian ryegrass, white mustard and fodder radish were grown or the soil was kept fallow and the resulting TRV-IPS prior to the bulbous test crops was measured by a soil dilution bait test method. The application of organic matter was tested after dahlia as pre-crop.
