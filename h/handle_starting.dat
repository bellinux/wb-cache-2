5000|$|The {{following}} year Frank DeFrancis purchased the racetrack from National Bank of Washington. The first thing DeFrancis did was {{change the name}} to Freestate Raceway. Before Freestates first meet under DeFrancis, he {{did a lot of}} work to track, including fixing up the grandstand, creating a driver's lounge, and promoting under the slogan [...] "Where Fun Comes in First". After losing money for the first few years, DeFrancis persuaded the Maryland General Assembly to lower the tax on the track's <b>handle.</b> <b>Starting</b> in 1982, Freestate Raceway began to host the Potomac Stakes, Maryland's most successful race. Each time this race happened, the attendance and handle rose dramatically; in 1984, a record $1,094,054 was wagered on the night of that race. In his first six years of operations, Freestate's average attendance increased from 4,477 to 5,453. In 1988, Roosevelt Raceway, which hosted the Messenger Stakes, closed operations, and the race way given to Freestate for the remainder of Freestate's history. In 1989, DeFrancis died, and Freestate was sold to become an industrial park the {{following year}}. The park is a 320,000-square-foot shopping center with a grocery store and an adjacent Carmax dealership.|$|E

40|$|Oxidative {{addition}} of CH 3 I to (d t bpe) Ni(C 2 H 4) (d t bpe = t Bu 2 PC 2 H 4 P t Bu 2) affords (d t bpe) Ni(I) CH 3 (1). The reaction of (d t bpe) NiCl 2 or 1 with the stoichiometric quantity of (tmeda) Mg(CH 3) 2 yields (d t bpe) Ni(CH 3) 2 (2). (d t bpe) Ni(I) CD 3 (1 -d 3) and (d t bpe) Ni(CD 3) 2 (2 -d 6) {{have been prepared}} analogously. Thermolysis of 2 in benzene affords {(d t bpe) Ni} 2 (μ-η 2 :η 2 -C 6 H 6) (4). The reaction of either 2 or 4 with hydrogen (H 2, HD, D 2) gives {(d t bpe) Ni} 2 (μ-H) 2 (3) and the isotopomers {(d t bpe) Ni} 3 (μ-H) (μ-D) (3 -d) and {(d t bpe) Ni} 2 (μ-D) 2 (3 -d 2). According to the NMR spectra, the structure of 3 is dynamic in solution. The crystal structures of 2 and 3 have been determined by X-ray crystallography. Solution thermolysis of 2 or reduction of (d t bpe) NiCl 2 with Mg* {{in the presence of}} alkanes probably involves σ-complex-type intermediates [(d t bpe) Ni(η 2 -R‘H) ] (R‘ = e. g. C 2 H 5, A). While the nonisolated [(d t bpe) Ni 0] σ-complexes A are exceedingly reactive intermediates, isolated 3 and 4 represent easy to <b>handle</b> <b>starting</b> complexes for [(d t bpe) Ni 0] reactions. Partial protolysis of 2 with CF 3 SO 3 H affords (d t bpe) Ni(CH 3) (OSO 2 CF 3) (5). Complex 5 reacts slowly with 2 equiv of ethene to give equimolar amounts of [(d t bpe) Ni(C 2 H 5) ] + (OSO 2 CF 3 -) (6) and propene. The reaction is thought to be initiated by an insertion of ethene into the Ni−CH 3 bond of 5 to form the intermediate [(d t bpe) Ni(C 3 H 7) (OSO 2 CF 3) ] (G), followed by elimination of propene to give the hydride intermediate [(d t bpe) Ni(H) (OSO 2 CF 3) ] (H), which on insertion of ethene into the Ni−H bond affords 6...|$|E

During the processing of operation by the clients, the server waits until a group of operations, which only have logical meaning together (all crossings and mutations in the genetic algorithm case), are completed and then proceed with the primary optimization process.|$|R
