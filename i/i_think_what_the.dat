It's the sea we enter, as the mythology goes, where we enter once on the night when we are born, once on the night when we first kiss, and {{fall in love with the}} world, and once at the time we die. At the most serious and profound moments in our lives, we are given a moment to enter this place of pure dreaming, and that's fascinating, my fascination with dreaming. My dreams are mirrors of my soul. I'm hoping that will all be reflected in the third and final book. Clive Barker ...|$|E

5000|$|The tomb of Queen Hatshepsut was {{discovered}} by Howard Carter early in 1903, {{the same year as}} the publication of The Jewel of Seven Stars, in the Valley of the Kings—similar to the Valley of the Sorcerer, where Tera is found in the novel. The similarities between the two, Hebblethwaite states, are [...] "almost too overt to be mere coincidence"; both are extremely powerful female rulers who take on the role of men. Just as Hatshepsut commanded and transfigured her masculine image, it is found in Tera’s tomb that [...] "prominence was given to the fact that she, though a Queen, claimed all the privileges of kingship and masculinity. In one place she was pictured in man’s dress, and wearing the White and Red Crowns. In the following picture she was in female dress, but still wearing the Crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, while the discarded male raiment lay at her feet". Both Tera and Hatshepsut also seemed to possess some awareness that their legacy would be destroyed. In the novel, Tera leaves an inscription stating her plans for resurrection, as well as that [...] "the hatred of the priests was, she knew, stored up for her, and that they would after her death try to suppress her name". A similar inscription was found on an obelisk at Hatshepsut’s memorial: [...] "Now my heart turns this way and that, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> people will say—those who shall see my monuments in years to come, and who shall speak of what I have done".|$|E
5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} to Llewyn Davis' musicality is his desire to maintain authenticity as an artist. Despite being partially based on Dave Van Ronk, some reviewers noted several distinctions between the two in their artistry: [...] "It’s been bandied about that the character of Llewyn is based on Dave Van Ronk, [...] "The Mayor of Macdougal Street," [...] a mainstay and centerpiece of the Greenwich Village folk scene. This is nonsense. Llewyn shares one or two biographical details with Van Ronk, but has none of his personality. More importantly, he has none of Van Ronk’s expansiveness, his desire to reach out, to promote, to connect. Llewyn is a very inward singer, up in his own head. He demands that the audience comes to him. That demand, in fact, is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> protagonist wants. Llewyn Davis wants success, craves it, but insists that it be on his own terms." [...] Robert Christgau {{also noted that the}} character desired authenticity as among the most important and valued aspects of being a musician: [...] "We know that when Jean warns him to plan for his future, Llewyn equates that inescapability with flying cars and Tang and brands Jean [...] "careerist," [...] "square," [...] and [...] "suburban" [...] for thinking about it. We also know Llewyn's definition of a folk song because it's damn near the first words out of his mouth that don't have a tune attached: [...] "If it's never been new and it never gets old, it's a folk song." [...] However, Christgau notes that his desire for authenticity is hypocritical, calling Davis an [...] "angry character", while pondering the cause of the character's anger. Christgau continued, [...] "We don't know reason for the character's anger—lots of men are angry. But maybe, the film suggests, that's what drives his passion for his incoherent notion of authenticity. After all, the worst tirade of his bad week by far is the sexist bile he spews at the most certifiably [...] "authentic" [...] musician we get to see: autoharp-strumming Elizabeth Hobby from Arkansas, played by Missouri-born modern folk performer Nancy Blake.

The Holocaust itself was but {{one of a number of}} massacres carried out in the 20 th Century (including, for example, the Turkish slaughters of Armenians during and after World War I, the Stalinist Great Terror of 1937 - 1938, and the mass executions by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia in the 19702 ̆ 7 s.)

40|$|The {{importance}} of ownership Cue: Ownership has {{in recent years}} become a key feature of most development programmes. Too often in the past projects failed because all the ideas, resources and staff were supplied by an outside agency, and the capabilities of local people were ignored. In supplying credit to poor communities, it is frequently observed that when those people are themselves the source of funds and managers of the scheme, there is greater commitment to making the programme work, and greater sustainability once external support ends. The following two reports come from Zimbabwe and The Gambia, and focus on schemes which have been largely funded by local contributions. First Busani Bafana talks to Inviolatta Moyo of the Western Region Foundation in Zimbabwe, an organisation that puts great emphasis on training its project holders in business skills. IN:		?<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> foundation? OUT:		?and men will follow after. ? DUR?N	 2 ? 46 ? Transcript Moyo	<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> foundation has done to assist the rural communities in successfully implementing their income generating projects, is that the foundation offers training, even prior to giving the grant. The foundation facilitates in the process technically in terms of monitoring and evaluating {{the success of the}} projects. The groups that are engaged in income generating activities are also helped in training in skills such as project cycle management, financial management and so forth. Bafana	And has this training helped in the way they actually use the credit that they get from the foundation? Moyo	I definitely would say this training has helped a lot in facilitating the groups? day-to-day running of the projects very well. Bafana	Whereas banks or commercial or otherwise would ask for collateral security before they actually give credit have you had any problems with people defaulting on the grants that you give them? And how have you got around that problem? Moyo	Well thank you for that question. Fortunately we have rarely had problems {{in the sense that we}} make sure that these project holders own the projects and they?ll have contributed substantially before they come to seek for any assistance from the foundation. As such it assures ownership and you find that there is very little defaulting among the project holders. Nonetheless we have had a problem with one or two. Sometimes we discover they need more training in leadership skills, in the project cycle management and we undertake to find those organisations that are into training, to facilitate that kind of situation together with the community leadership. Bafana	And lastly Mrs Moyo, most beneficiaries of your scheme under the foundation have been women. Does this mean less men are keen to take credit risks in areas you are operating in than women? Moyo	Well women are the backbone of the economy, particularly the rural economy. I would say men sometimes are reluctant until they realise, you know, profits, or profit within the activities that women are engaged in. Only then do they want to join in. I would say generally women take the lead and men will follow after. End of tape. LINKING ANNOUNCEMENT to 2 nd interview: Inviolatta Moyo explaining why Zimbabwe?s Western Region Foundation targets women rather than men. Our second report comes from The Gambia, where Ismaila Senghore spoke to Fatou Sarr, a training officer at the Promotion Centre of the Village Indigenous Savings and Credit Associations, commonly called VISACAs. He discovered that the associations had a strong sense of ownership, not least because all the staff in the credit offices were recruited in the villages.
