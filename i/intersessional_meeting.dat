50|$|The First <b>Intersessional</b> <b>Meeting</b> of the IMO Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships {{took place}} in Oslo, Norway on 23-27 June 2008. It was tasked with {{developing}} the technical basis for the reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future IMO regime to control greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping, and {{a draft of the}} actual reduction mechanisms themselves, for further consideration by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).|$|E
50|$|The Community's {{efforts to}} boost {{development}} {{through the use}} of (ICT) would be undertaken in tandem with the Reform Process for the years 2014-2019, Dr. Gonsalves said {{at the conclusion of the}} 25th <b>Intersessional</b> <b>Meeting.</b> Developing a Single CARICOM ICT Space to enhance the environment for investment and production was identified as one of the key areas that the Community should undertake in the short-term to become competitive. As envisioned by its framers, the Single ICT Space will encompass the management of Regional information, human resources, legislation and infrastructure in the sector to elicit maximum benefit for the Region's populace.|$|E

40|$|Dr Bill Hogarth of the USA was the Chairman of the International Whaling Commission from 2006 to 2009. In {{a typical}} {{masterpiece}} of understatement, {{at the beginning}} of his term, he launched an initiative to reform the IWC with the words "it would be useful for the Commission to have a general discussion concerning the future of the IWC, given [...] . the number of issues for which polarisation rather than consensus appears to be the norm". This paper follows his initiative through three annual, and two <b>intersessional</b> <b>meetings</b> of the IWC, commenting on the major issues and events as well as the actions of the main players. It concludes with an analysis of the results of the initiative, and makes some predictions for the future of the IWC. Whaling International Whaling Commission...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{collapse}} of negotiations around a protocol to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) in 2001, states parties have begun to discuss several novel issues linked to the broader implementation of the BWC {{as part of a}} series of <b>intersessional</b> <b>meetings.</b> While initially fruitful, this approach has generated diminishing returns in the last five years. Moreover, in addressing these broader issues of implementation, biological disarmament diplomacy has largely neglected the thorny issue of compliance. Compliance with the BWC is more than a simple binary choice to sign a commitment not to develop or produce biological weapons. It requires the adherence to all the obligations, both negative and positive, undertaken by BWC states parties in signing and ratifying the convention. In the BWC context, this is complicated by the ambiguity surrounding certain obligations, changes in science and security, and the limited resource capacity of some states to fulfill their obligations. Under such circumstances, without episodically revisiting compliance, there remains the risk that BWC will become ever more fragmented, outmoded and poorly implemented. Although many states insist strengthening the convention can only be achieved through a multilaterally negotiated, legally binding verification protocol, this is not politically feasible for the foreseeable future. Nor is this necessarily true; an incremental approach to strengthening the convention could be pursued, dealing with mutually reinforcing components of the regime in a balanced manner and laying the foundations for future work, if and when it becomes politically expedient to proceed. This Occasional Paper proposes a number of activities that could be pursued as part of an incremental approach to revisiting compliance with the BWC...|$|R
5000|$|ICRI was {{established}} in 1994 at the initiative of eight founding nations: Australia, France, Japan, Jamaica, the Philippines, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It was launched at the First Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity, held in the Bahamas in December 1994, and subsequently announced at the high level segment of the <b>Intersessional</b> <b>Meeting</b> of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development in April 1995. The first General Meeting of members was held in Dumaguete, Philippines, in June 1995 where ICRI's foundational documents were adopted: its [...] "Call to Action" [...] and [...] "Framework for Action" [...] for achieving sustainable management of coral reefs and related ecosystems. The [...] "Call to Action" [...] was renewed in 1998 at the first International Tropical Marine Ecosystems Management Symposium held in Townsville, Australia and endorsed by over 300 delegates from 49 nations.|$|E
5000|$|The IMO {{has a role}} in {{tackling}} international climate change. The First <b>Intersessional</b> <b>Meeting</b> of IMO's Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships {{took place}} in Oslo, Norway (23-27 June 2008), tasked with developing the technical basis for the reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future IMO regime to control greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping, and {{a draft of the}} actual reduction mechanisms themselves, for further consideration by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC). The IMO participated in the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris seeking to establish itself as the [...] "appropriate international body to address greenhouse gas emissions from ships engaged in international trade". Nonetheless, there has been widespread criticism of the IMO's relative inaction since the conclusion of the Paris conference, with the initial data-gathering step of a three-stage process to reduce maritime greenhouse emissions expected to last until 2020. The IMO has also taken action to mitigate the global effects of ballast water and sediment discharge, through the 2004 Ballast Water Management Convention, which will enter into force in September 2017.|$|E

Since then, progress has been made on conditioning that set of trials. An assessment of the preliminary conditioning results is presented here, with a focus on five trials that were not able to mimic the available data as well as the remaining trials.

40|$|The Sixth Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) {{ended on}} December 8 th, 2006 with a consensual {{agreement}} on a Final Declaration, something the BWC regime had not seen since 1996. This document represents a comprehensive and thorough review of the BWC. It reaffirms some important understandings, most notably the prohibition of biological weapons use and the comprehensive scope of the BWC; it also contains an updated reflection {{on the role of}} the BWC regarding non-state actors and bioterrorism, an increased emphasis on national implementation, and a recognition of synergies with international organisations and civil society. States parties agreed on several additional measures: they decided on a new intersessional process with annual meetings and a work programme for 2007 - 2010; they established a small Implementation Support Unit (ISU) in Geneva that will provide administrative support, facilitate communication among states parties and manage the confidence-building measures (CBMs); and they decided to promote universality of the BWC. The working atmosphere had improved significantly since the previous review conference, and there was a willingness to work constructively and pragmatically throughout much of the negotiations. Of the two basic conflicts in the regime, the one concerning cooperation, technological exchange and export controls permeated the negotiations again but did not block consensus in the end. The other one around verification and a legally binding document to strengthen the BWC did not come to bear directly, as there was a tacit agreement not to include these issues in the negotiations, but it was nevertheless palpable in the background. Likewise, general political tensions, especially between Iran and the USA, impacted on the deliberations but did not prevent a substantive consensual outcome. What does this outcome mean for the BWC regime? Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Considering the difficult political situation in the regime since 2001, when the efforts to strengthen the BWC through a legally binding compliance protocol failed, and applying a pragmatic viewpoint, the answer is yes. Viewing the results from a more conceptual arms control perspective, however, the assessment must be somewhat more sober. In the political situation prior to the review conference, the conditions for success were far from ideal: Given the desolate state of the regime after 2001, it was no matter of course that a meaningful outcome could be achieved at all. But the full review and the new understandings contributed to solidifying the regime, and the conference results provide a good starting point for pragmatic steps to tackle issues such as national implementation, prevention of bioterrorism and misuse of biological agents, awareness-raising, domestic preparedness and surveillance of infectious diseases. There was also a sense of activism, ownership of the BWC and a convergence of views on some problems that bodes well for the new intersessional process and the future work in the regime. However, the focus is currently only on one dimension of the BWC regime, namely on problems that affect all states parties but that are exogenous to state-to-state relationships. II If, in a conceptual view, the function of arms control is seen in stabilising inter-state relations, preventing armaments, and building confidence between states, the review conference was much less successful in these respects. To fulfil this function, there needs to be a stable, reliable framework for state interaction with a certain degree of predictability and trust in the other parties’ compliant behaviour. But the Final Document remains weak on procedural issues, and there could be no {{agreement on a}}ny new binding obligations, not even in connection with the intersessional topics. Transparency measures like the CBMs could not be significantly improved, and compliance and verification were left aside completely. The latter strategy was essential to avoiding exacerbation of the tensions and to achieving the above-mentioned successes. Nevertheless it means that a whole dimension of the BWC as an arms control instrument is being neglected. The assessment of the conference from these two perspectives leads to recommendations that reflect the same two-pronged approach. In the current situation, the primary focus will be on the work in the new intersessional process. Most of the topics of 2007 and 2008 – national implementation, biosafety, biosecurity, codes of conduct – were already discussed in the last process, so that there is ample material available for substantive discussions. All these topics could be translated into action more effectively if states parties could agree on a systematic reflection and on introducing binding recommendations. If effective follow-up action can be induced, this could address important problems and mitigate some of the deficits of the regime as regards implementation, preparedness against bioterrorism and prevention of the misuse of biotechnology. The topics for 2009 – international cooperation, technological exchange and capacitybuilding to counter infectious diseases – and 2010 – assistance and preparedness in the case of biological weapons use – are new in the intersessional discourse and will require thorough preparation. Both contain areas that have long been of concern to developing countries in the Non-Aligned Movement. The <b>intersessional</b> <b>meetings</b> will provide an important opportunity to discuss the perceived problems and different views around technological cooperation and development. Contrary to some concerns expressed during the review conference, such a discussion could actually contribute to de-politicising and de-ideologising this issue, as it forces states to reflect on and express their expectations, define their needs, and recognise what is already being done. If the discussions can be conducted as factually and pragmatically as in the last intersessional process, they could not only tackle problems of development, public health and disease surveillance, but might even contribute to objectifying a long-standing conflict in the regime. With a longer-term view to the arms control dimension of inter-state relations, several ideas could be considered that go beyond the topics of the intersessionals but are based on existing measures and thus do not require new negotiations. States parties could review and make use of the consultation procedures under Article V to address not only grave compliance concerns, but also other problems. This would provide for an additional framework with regular procedures in which states parties can discuss specific problems, e. g. issues related to development and technological cooperation, or the CBMs. Collective action on CBMs might not be possible until the next review conference, at the earliest, but III states parties could individually explore the scope for improvements and increased transparency. Moreover, states parties could support the UN’s efforts to strengthen the Secretary General’s mechanism to investigate alleged biological or chemical weapons use, for example through training sessions for the experts. Especially if combined with procedures for assistance, this would enhance the ability of states parties to respond to the gravest compliance concerns possible. Finally, making the BWC norms universally binding through international customary law could be considered as a parallel strategy to universalising treaty membership. This would provide for a more solid normative basis for action against proliferators and would enhance the role of the UN Security Council and Secretary General in connection with biological weapons proliferation. The first set of recommendations could bring real progress in the current situation and to the dimension of practical and shared “biological problems”. The second set could pave the way for some modest improvements to the arms control dimension of state-to-state relations and compliance. While the constant interaction in the regime may contribute to improving state relations, this cannot be taken for granted, especially should more confrontational situations arise. In the long term, it would therefore be necessary that states initiate a new discourse on compliance and verification and consider new approaches to these issues, as a return to the protocol approach would be neither feasible nor desirable. Until political circumstances allow for this, strengthening the procedures available in the BWC right now could mitigate some deficits in the regime. Only if both dimensions are addressed – not necessarily in a one-in-all approach, but in the same framework of action – will the regime be truly strengthened and the potential of the BWC as an arms control instrument and core of the regime be fully exploited...|$|R

40|$|I {{traveled}} over to London {{in early}} March with {{high expectations for}} the <b>intersessional</b> <b>meeting</b> {{on the future of}} the International Whaling Commission (IWC). This special meeting had been scheduled as a result of Commission discussions {{on the future of the}} IWC at the 59 th Annual Meeting of the IWC in Anchorage in June 2007. The current perception of the IWC is that the organization is deadlocked. Talks between the “pro-whaling ” and “anti-whaling ” members have reached an impasse, with neither side seen to be moving on contentious issues like small-type coastal whaling, whale watching, sanctuaries, small cetaceans and the always controversial Conservation Committee. After Japan announced in December that they would delay killing humpback whales in th...|$|E

40|$|Objectives (ii) and (iii) of the ICCAT seabird {{assessment}} are {{to collate}} the at-sea distribution of seabird {{species in the}} ICCAT area, and to analyse the spatial and temporal overlap between seabird distribution and ICCAT longline fishing effort. The four seabird populations assessed so far exhibit seasonal variation in their overlap with fishing effort, which {{is a function of}} seasonal shifts in seabird distribution. The calculated index of overlap is as much as 3 - 10 times higher in the southern hemisphere winter (Q 2, Q 3) compared to the southern hemisphere spring (Q 4). As would be expected, total overlap is highest for a species whose breeding and non-breeding distribution overlaps with the ICCAT area (e. g. Tristan Albatross). The aim at this <b>intersessional</b> <b>meeting</b> is to (i) simplify the method for estimating the distribution of species for which there are no tracking data and (ii) identify if there are more sophisticated methods for calculating overlap.
