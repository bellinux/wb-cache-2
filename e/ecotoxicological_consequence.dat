We used visual and olfactory tasks to test whether MeP had a detrimental effect on the acquisition of new knowledge when this new knowledge contradicts previously acquired one.

For this end, zebrafish embryo tests combined with {{an analysis of the}} stress protein Hsp 70 in newly hatched larvae were conducted. Additionally, measurements of physico-chemical parameters were carried out in order to provide basic information about the limnological conditions at the river sections. Our goals are, on the one hand, the evaluation of early developmental responses of zebrafish to native environmental samples at the whole organism level {{as well as on the}} cellular level and, on the other hand, the assessment of the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>consequences</b> of small-scale time and spatial variation in a model aquatic system.|$|R
30|$|Extreme {{hydrodynamic}} {{events such}} as flood events or dredging activities bear the risk of eroding sediments in rivers, reservoirs, harbour basins or estuaries. One of the key concerns associated with these erosion processes is the re-mobilisation of sediment-bound pollutants in highly contaminated sediments. To date, much {{research has been conducted}} to characterise flow and sediment processes associated with hydrological {{events such as}} floods. Furthermore, there is a large body of literature describing the interaction of contaminants associated with particulate matter to aquatic biota. However, there is little knowledge regarding interactions between hydro-sedimentological and ecotoxicological processes. Understanding of the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>consequences</b> and associated risks to aquatic wildlife associated with hydraulic events can provide critical information to regulatory bodies or managing authorities. Specifically, it will aid in assessing risks associated with current management practices and will aid in developing more sustainable future management practices for waterways or harbours. Therefore, a combined experimental methodology between hydraulic engineers and ecotoxicologists was developed to investigate the ecological and toxicological relevance of sediment re-suspension and transport during erosion. An overview of this methodology is given in the present paper.|$|R
40|$|Cadmium {{pollution}} has clear <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>consequences</b> as it {{is readily}} bio-available and has a reported tendency to bio-accumulate in soil biota. Understanding the mechanisms of cadmium trafficking pathways within sentinel terrestrial invertebrates, such as the earthworm, is therefore considered to be of importance. Using X-ray microanalysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemical techniques, {{we were able to}} demonstrate that the earthworm has the intrinsic capacity to efficiently sequester and compartmentalize cadmium via a metallothionein-mediated trafficking pathway. There is evidence that wMT- 2, rather than wMT- 1, is the major isoform implicated in the detoxification of cadmium and the identification of three independent wMT- 2 loci (totalling over 25 kb of genomic sequence) has revealed a complex genomic organization. Complementary in silico analysis of over 6500 expressed sequence tags has identified a third metallothionein isoform, wMT- 3, found to be highly enriched in embryonic tissue. In summary, this paper provides a detailed dissection of the genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of a sophisticated pathway that facilitates the uptake, accumulation, transport, and excretion of cadmium...|$|R

Reactions of molecular oxygen (O 2) with sparingly soluble CrIII(OH) 3 (s) may generate {{the far more}} soluble and transportable chromate ion (HCrVIO 4 -, CrVIO 42 -). ii) Combustion of gasoline containing the anti-knocking agent MMT (methylcyclopentadienyl manganese(I) tricarbonyl) forms a fine aerosol consisting of MnIII,IV (hydr) oxide solids. When inhaled, biofluids convert the oxidized manganese to soluble MnII. Within the nose, subsequent translocation of MnII along olfactory neurons leads to elevated manganese in a region of the brain called the olfactory bulb (1). A Parkinson's-like condition termed manganism can result. iii) Water supply plants maintain a disinfectant residual to ensure the deactivation of pathogenic bacteria.

40|$|Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) play a {{key role}} in risk {{assessment}} of chemicals in sediments and soils. For hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs), BAFs are, however, difficult to determine and values are mostly obtained by modeling. Apart from a lack of reliable data, the applicability of lab-derived values in the field situation is unknown, as exposure conditions (e. g., temperature, pH, salinity, test species, number of chemicals) are standardized in the lab, whereas they may vary in the field. In this study, the effect of temperature on the bioaccumulation of a series of moderate to very hydrophobic PAHs in aquatic worms was studied by using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) -coated solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers. The results indicated that bioaccumulation of nonmetabolizable HOCs is an exothermic, enthalpy-driven process, thus decreasing with increasing temperature. As such, biotic concentrations may be several times higher in winter than in summertime, which could have <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>consequences.</b> A two-parameter linear free energy relationship was derived with which PAH bioaccumulation can be predicted from temperature and the chemicals' hydrophobicities. Comparing the determined (thermodynamics of) PAH partitioning into organisms and PDMS indicated that the latter phase cannot be used as a surrogate phase for animal lipids. Still, SPME provides an appropriate analytical tool for the measurement of aqueous concentrations, from which bioaccumulation can subsequently be estimated by using BAFs...|$|R

40|$|The {{involvement}} of the cholinergic system in learning and memory in honeybees has been well established using olfactory conditioning. We examined the effect of Methyl Parathion (MeP), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor of the organo-phosphate family, on the learning and recall of visual and olfactory discrimination tasks in honeybees. One of our expectations was to observe the effects induced by both the nicotinic and muscarinic systems, as the blocking of acetylcholinesterase should induce {{an increase in the}} activity of both systems. We were also interested in knowing whether the type of tasks could influence the results. The visual tasks involved learning to discriminate the orientation of gratings in a Y-maze; the olfactory task involved learning to discriminate odours in a proboscis extension reflex (PER) paradigm. The results indicate that MeP treatment enhances recall of learned tasks in the visual and olfactory domains, but it does not affect the acquisition phase in either domain. Surprisingly, MeP treatment led to muscarinic-like effects but failed to mimic the nicotinic-like effects already described in relation to learning phases in honeybees. Implications for the role of cholinergic pathways in learning and memory and the nature of their involvement are discussed, and a hypothesis relating to the organisation of the cholinergic system and the relationship between the nicotinic and muscarinic systems in honeybees is proposed.

40|$|Fipronil is an {{effective}} insecticide widely used in agriculture with potential <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>consequences.</b> The median lethal dose (LD 50) and concentration (LC 50) of fipronil in 16. 3 Â g Caspian white fish, Rutilus frisii kutum fingerlings were determined. To determine the LD 50, a total of 133 fish were assigned to 19 tanks (7 fish/tank) including one control and 6 treatment groups (300, 450, 550, 650, 750, 850 Â mg/kg). Fish were injected intraperitoneally and monitored at 96 Â h. The LD 50 of fipronil was 632 Â mg/kg suggesting it was slightly toxic to the Caspian white fish. To determine LC 50, 114 fish were assigned to 19 tanks (6 fish/tank) including one control and 6 treatment groups (300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 Â Î¼g/L). The LC 50 of fipronil was 572 Â Î¼g/L, which was highly toxic to the fish. The degree of tissue change (DTC) in vital organs from moribund fish exposed via waterborne exposure showed severe damage (DTC: 71 Â Â±Â  52 for 700 Â Î¼g/L) in the gill, including aneurisms, extensive fusion and necrosis. The fish exposed through the intraperitoneal route seemed to have severe lesions (DTC: 66 Â Â±Â  50 for 750 Â mg/kg) in the kidney, involving hemorrhage, tubular degeneration and necrosis. The liver had {{no significant differences in}} DTC values between the two routes and showed pyknosis and sinusoid dilation. Hematoxylin and eosin staining did not show any histological alterations in the brain but nissl staining showed some alterations in distribution of purkinje cells. Generally, this study showed that the route of exposure to fipronil not only affects its acute toxicity but also determines the main target organs of toxicity and histopathological alterations in Caspian white fish.

40|$|The CeO₂ NPs are {{increasingly}} {{used in industry}} but the environmental release of these NPs and their subsequent behavior and biological effects are currently unclear. This study evaluates {{for the first time}} the effects of CeO₂ NPs on the survival and the swimming performance of two cladoceran species, Daphnia similis and Daphnia pulex after 1, 10 and 100 mg. L⁻¹ CeO₂ exposures for 48 h. Acute toxicity bioassays were performed to determine EC₅₀ of exposed daphnids. Video-recorded swimming behavior of both daphnids was used to measure swimming speeds after various exposures to aggregated CeO₂ NPs. The acute ecotoxicity showed that D. similis is 350 times more sensitive to CeO₂ NPs than D. pulex, showing 48 -h EC₅₀ of 0. 26 mg. L⁻¹ and 91. 79 mg. L⁻¹, respectively. Both species interacted with CeO₂ NPs (adsorption), but much more strongly in the case of D. similis. Swimming velocities (SV) were differently and significantly affected by CeO₂ NPs for both species. A 48 -h exposure to 1 mg. L⁻¹ induced a decrease of 30 % and 40 % of the SV in D. pulex and D. similis, respectively. However at higher concentrations, the SV of D. similis was more impacted (60 % off for 10 mg. L⁻¹ and 100 mg. L⁻¹) than the one of D. pulex. These interspecific toxic effects of CeO₂ NPs are explained by morphological variations such as the presence of reliefs on the cuticle and a longer distal spine in D. similis acting as traps for the CeO₂ aggregates. In addition, D. similis has a mean SV double that of D. pulex and thus initially collides with twice more NPs aggregates.

40|$|For in situ {{remediation}} {{of groundwater}} contaminated by halogenated hydrocarbons Carbo-Iron®, {{a composite of}} microscale activated carbon and nano Fe 0, was developed. Against the background of intended release of Carbo-Iron into the environment in concentrations in the g/L-range, potential <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>consequences</b> were evaluated in the present study. The nano Fei 0 in Carbo-Iron acts as reducing agent and is oxidized in aqueous systems by chlorinated solvents, groundwater constituents (e. g. dissolved oxygen) and anaerobic corrosion. As Carbo-Iron is generally oxidized rapidly after application into the environment, the oxidized state is environmentally most relevant, and Carbo-Iron was used in its oxidized form in the ecotoxicological tests. The amphipod Hyalella azteca was selected as a surrogate test species for functionally important groundwater crustaceans. Effects of Carbo-Iron on H. azteca were determined in a 10 -d acute test, a 7 -d feeding activity test and a 42 -d chronic test. Additionally, a 56 -d life cycle test was performed with a modified design to further evaluate effects of Carbo-Iron on adult H. azteca and their offspring. The size of Carbo-Iron particles in stock and test suspensions was determined via dynamic light scattering. Potential uptake of particles into test organisms was investigated using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. At the termination of the feeding and acute toxicity test (i. e. after 7 and 10 d of exposure, respectively), Carbo-Iron {{had a significant effect}} on the weight, length and feeding rate of H. azteca at the highest test concentration of 100 mg/L. While an uptake of Carbo-Iron into the gut was observed, no passage into the surrounding tissue was detected. In both chronic tests, the number of offspring was the most sensitive endpoint and significant effects were recorded at concentrations ≥ 50 mg/L (42 -d experiment) and ≥ 12. 5 mg/L (56 -d experiment). Parental exposure to oxidized Carbo-Iron significantly exacerbated the acute effects of the nanocomposite on the subsequent generation of H. azteca by a factor > 10. The present study indicates risks for groundwater species at concentrations in the mg/L range. Carbo-Iron may exceed these effect concentrations in treated aquifers, but the presence of the pollutant has most likely impaired the quality of this habitat already. The benefit of remediation has to be regarded against the risk of ecological consequences with special consideration of the observed increasing sensitivity of juvenile H. azteca...|$|R
40|$|In {{polluted}} areas {{organisms are}} generally exposed to mixtures {{of toxic chemicals}} rather than a single toxicant only. Since the number of mixture toxicity studies with regard to soil systems is limited, the research in this thesis was focused on investigating <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>consequences</b> of combined exposure for soil invertebrates. Two topics were studied: i) population-level consequences of chronic combined exposure of individual organisms, and ii) the influence of interactions between the toxic compounds in the soil matrix on their joint toxicity. The soil dwelling, free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was chosen as test species. A quantitative description procedure was proposed for interpreting the joint toxicity of chemical mixtures, compared to the toxicity of the individual components. It enabled the identification of four biologically relevant deviation patterns from either the additive or the independent reference model, by means of likelihood analysis: i) no deviation, ii) synergism/antagonism, iii) toxicant ratio- and iiii) effect level dependent deviation. Using these models, sublethal effects of chronic stress of binary mixtures of copper and cadmium, and copper and carbendazim on life cycle events of the nematode C. elegans were studied. The cadmium-copper effect on reproduction was transient: it changed from synergistic, to a toxicant ratio dependent deviation from additivity. The effect of copper-carbendazim was synergistic at low effect levels and antagonistic at high effect levels. The juvenile period was a relatively non-sensitive parameter, whereas {{the length of the}} reproductive period was relatively more sensitive. In conclusion, it should be realised that mixture toxicity may be transient and that interactions may differ among life history traits. It was discussed that the effect translation of combined effects to the population level depended on three factors: i) the sensitivity of each life history trait to each of the toxicants, ii) the combination effect of the toxicants on each life history trait, iii) the sensitivity of to changes in each life history trait. A detailed analysis of mixture effects on the life history of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans showed that synergistic effects on reproduction were transferred to the population level, despite the low sensitivity of λ to changes in this trait. Subsequently single and combined toxicity of copper-zinc, copper-cadmium, cadmium-lead, copper-carbendazim and copper-carbendazim-iprodione to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were studied in LUFA 2. 2 soil, and the one-week population increase was estimated as toxicity endpoint. Metals with the highest partition coefficient affected the sorption of metals with the lowest partition coefficient when both were combined. However, comparing soil sorption characteristics with joint toxicity patterns did not give general results. Nevertheless, it was discussed that for identifying fundamental principles of joint toxicity in ecotoxicology, and for developing predictive models, ecological "mechanisms" should be investigated...|$|R
30|$|After a short welcome by the {{director}} of the Ecotox Centre, Inge Werner, a series of presentations were given by national and international experts as well as regulators from federal and cantonal agencies. Emmanuel Frossard (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Zurich) provided a short summary on the national research project 68 (NRP 68 “Soil as a Resource”) [5] of the Swiss Science Foundation on the multifunctionality of soil. As mentioned before, soil fulfills a broad spectrum of functions and agricultural cultivation techniques should consider their potential adverse effects on these soil functions. He also stressed the need for the nationwide collection of soil information for reaching the goal of a more sustainable use of soil. Bettina Hitzfeld (FOEN) reported on future challenges regarding soil quality and which measures are required by the National Action Plan for Plant Protection Products. It aims at the reduction of the environmental risks posed by PPP and at promoting their sustainable use. Challenges for the execution of the Action Plan include (a) the lack of monitoring data and (b) the need for bioindicators to evaluate soil quality and fertility. Next, Katja Knauer (FOAG) gave an overview about the current risk assessment and risk management processes for PPP. She mentioned that data of chronic tests are primarily used in the risk assessment for soil organisms. Also, in the EFSA Scientific Opinion [6], it was recommended to adapt the predatory soil mite Hypoaspis aculeifer test {{to take into account the}} uptake of contaminated food and to develop a standardized test using isopods to include exposure via leaf litter. For microorganisms, it was proposed to advance the N-transformation test and to add a test using mycorrhizal fungi. In the presentation “Towards a better consideration of the effect of pesticides on soil organisms in the registration process of plant protection products in Europe”, Fabrice Martin-Laurent (Department of Agroecology, INRA, Dijon, France) highlighted the ecological importance of soil microorganisms and the protection of soil functions. Soil microorganisms, as all other soil fauna, are currently only considered in prospective PPP risk assessment. However, they are not considered in retrospective risk assessment in EU regulations, as the soil protection directive has not been adopted. There is an urgent need for standards to evaluate the effects of pesticides on microorganisms and their <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>consequences</b> on soil functions. Sébastien Gassmann from the Geology, Soil and Waste Department of the Canton of Geneva presented a summary of measures taken for pesticide risk reduction in Geneva, where about 40 % of the agricultural area is in close proximity of residential areas, which entails a large potential of conflict. A working group was formed to develop a PPP monitoring program, and to increase awareness among farmers regarding the use and potential effects of PPP. Daniel Wächter from the Swiss National Soil Monitoring program (Nationale Bodenbeobachtung; NABO) of Agroscope (Zurich, Switzerland) provided insights into data gained from a study on 90 PPP in Swiss agricultural soils. Residues of the majority of substances were detected in soil samples, even if the time of application was more than a year before the samples were taken.|$|R
40|$|Wood is {{very diverse}} and has {{specific}} features making it easily distinguishable from other materials. Due to its properties {{it can be}} applied both inside and outside, making it a rewarding material to work with. However, when applied outside it is liable to weathering, inducing changes to the wood, like i. e. surface discolouration, dimensional changes or even wood rot, which are not appreciated by end-users. Therefore wood constructors are looking for protection methods of wood, leading to longer service life of their wood products. Since pressure is put on traditional wood preservation due to environmental and health considerations, new treatment technologies aiming at improved wood properties are launched. Besides wood modification technologies, treatments with organosilicon compounds were proposed. These chemicals proved to be suitable {{for the protection of}} other building materials like concrete and might therefore also be suited for wood. To be able to optimise the treatment process and perform quality control afterwards, detection techniques of organosilicons in treated wood could be very helpful. Visualisation combining several scanning techniques proved to be suitable for this purpose and with new, more precise technologies being developed, the possibilities will only grow. However, before quantitative determination will be useful for these purposes obstacles related to the accuracy of the chemical analysis need to be overcome. Since fungal attack is of major concern for the performance of a specific element, research was done to determine the fungal resistance of organosilicon treated wood and on methodology how to properly interpret the results. Furthermore care must be taken with the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>consequences</b> of the applied products. Therefore a study was devoted to developing a methodology determining on one hand the fungal efficacy of a certain treatment, while on the other hand the impact to the environment of this treatment was estimated. It was found that improving one parameter was often {{at the expense of the}} other parameter. Addition of a biocide improved fungal resistance, but increased the ecotoxicological risk of the leachates of the treated wood. Organosilicons are known as water repellents and are assumed to interfere in the wood-water relationship. Whatever laboratory test performed, this assumption could not be corroborated when organosilicons were applied at concentrations supposed to be economically feasible. When evaluating high retentions to the envelope of the material, better performance was achieved and this both for solid wood and plywood. However, the efficacy was reduced due to weathering. It can be stated that none of the laboratory tests was very hopeful for the application of organosilicons at economically feasible concentrations for wood used outdoors, out of ground contact. It was also demonstrated several times that the standard evaluation methods available are not really suitable for the evaluation of newly developed wood treatments. Therefore small-scaled wooden elements were constructed and exposed to accelerated natural weathering. This time organosilicon impregnated wood behaved much better than the untreated Scots pine sapwood reference material. Due to the treatment fungal discolouration, mass loss and moisture content could be reduced, without the application of a biocide. Further adding a biocide enhanced the first two parameters. Concluding it can be said that organosilicons seem to have certain potential in improving wood characteristics like moisture balance and fungal resistance, as shown in field experiments. Nevertheless it remains doubtful whether that will be sufficient to protect wood in the long term. It is more likely that organosilicons will become one of the components in a more complex formulation than that they will be applied on their own...|$|R
40|$|The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) {{oil spill}} in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 {{was one of the}} largest oil spills in history. For three months, oil leaked from the Macondo well at 1, 500 m depth into the Gulf. As one of the spill responses, an {{unprecedented}} amount of dispersants were applied, both at the sea surface and, for the first time ever, directly injected into the wellhead. During the spill, unusually large amounts of marine snow, including Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS), were formed. Oil-contaminated marine snow aggregates were formed by aggregation of EPS with suspended solids, phytoplankton cells due to the spring bloom, and the dispersed oil droplets. The marine snow sank through the water column and settled on the ocean floor. This process was named MOSSFA: Marine Oil Snow Sedimentation and Flocculent Accumulation. MOSSFA was an important pathway of transferring oil to the deep-sea, and 14 - 21 % of the total discharged oil is estimated to have settled on the sediment, where it impacted the benthic ecosystem. This thesis focused first on the mechanism of EPS snow formation, and then more in depth on the additional <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>consequences</b> of marine snow formation during oil spills for the benthic ecosystem. Chapter 2 describes the role of chemical dispersants in the presence of phytoplankton in the formation of EPS, one of the main ingredients of marine snow. Results show that phytoplankton-associated bacteria were responsible for the EPS formation, and the symbiosis between the phytoplankton and its associated bacterial community provided the bacteria with energy to produce the EPS. The microcosm experiment in Chapter 3 investigated the effect of marine snow on oil biodegradation in microcosms without benthic macroinvertebrates. Results showed that marine snow hampers oil biodegradation: the presence of marine snow reduced the depletion of oil alkanes by 40 %, most likely due to the high biodegradability of marine snow organics compared to the oil. Biodegradation of marine snow resulted in anaerobic conditions {{in the top of the}} sediment layer. This reduced the oil biodegradation. Marine snow thus prolongs the residence time of oil in the benthic ecosystem. The next microcosm experiment, described in Chapter 4, investigated the effects of oil-contaminated marine snow on benthic macroinvertebrates, and the effect of macroinvertebrates on oil biodegradation. Bioturbation by the invertebrates increased the oxygenated top layer of the sediment and partly counterbalanced the inhibition of oil biodegradation due to oxygen consumption by marine snow. Survival of three benthic invertebrate species was reduced by (oil-contaminated) marine snow. Oxygen depletion near the sediment surface seemed to be the main reason for the observed adverse effects of the marine snow. In addition, indications were found that some species used the marine snow as food source, even when it was oil-contaminated. In the last microcosm experiment, described in Chapter 5, two benthic invertebrate species were monitored over a period of 42 days after which new animals were introduced and observed for an additional period of 22 days. Marine snow degradation again resulted in lower dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column, which inhibited oil biodegradation on the sediment compared to oil in combination with clay. The oxygenated top layer of the sediment disappeared, and recovered after ~ 20 days. At the end of the experiment, mudsnails from the treatments with oiled marine snow had higher PAH concentrations in their tissues than the animals from the treatments with the same amount of oil in clay only, confirming the use of marine snow as food source. Overall, oil-contaminated marine snow on the ocean sediment can negatively affect benthic ecosystems, and can hamper oil biodegradation and ecosystem recovery. The additional consequences of MOSSFA during oil spills and spill responses should be taken into account in oil spill response planning...|$|R
40|$|The waterflea Daphnia magna is {{a widely}} used test {{organism}} in ecotoxicological studies. Acute and chronic laboratory tests yield basic information {{for the development of}} water quality standards, assessment of potential hazards of (new) chemicals, waste water licences and sanitation measures for contaminated sediments. Environmental risk assessment also includes extrapolation from laboratory to field, for which theoretical models are applied. Reliable results can only be obtained if:toxicity test results are both accurate and reproducible, andextrapolation models take account of major ecological processes. It has been recognized that under current international guidelines for Daphnia toxicity tests interlaboratory variation of test results is disappointingly large (Cowgill, 1987; Baird et al., 1989 a). Differences in test conditions and culture techniques are regarded as a main source of variation, but their relative contributions are largely unknown. The distance between a single-species test under laboratory conditions and the response of an aquatic ecosystem is enormous, in terms of complexity. A first step has been made by Kooijman, who developed a model to predict effects of toxicants on Daphnia populations from effects on individuals (Kooijman, 1986; Kooijman et al., 1989). From comparisons between experimental and simulated population dynamics research questions regarding critical model assumptions were derived. The present study focuses on food availability, which plays {{a central role in the}} life history of D. magna. Its development and reproduction are dependent on food level, as well as its sensitivity to toxic stress. The importance of food for the culture of test animals was investigated, as a contribution to standardisation of toxicity tests. Besides, assumed relationships between food level and Daphnia growth and reproduction are validated, in order to support development of extrapolation models. The experimental approach has been chosen to address the research questions related to both toxicity testing and extrapolation models. New techniques were developed for that purpose. Cadmium, chromium and lead, which are designated as priority pollutants by the International Rhine Committee (1987), have been applied as model substances. The investigations have been carried out at the Instute for Inland Water Management an Waste Water Treatment in Lelystad. New experimental methodsLength measurements are basic to fife history research. Therefore, electronic sizing of living D. magna was pursued by development of a computer program, which was based on an existing image processing system. This method, which is described in chapter 2 , was much more rapid than manual measurements with a microscope, although it was less precise. Image analysis is recommended for determination of large samples, e. g. length frequency distributions of populations. Debris in the size range of the objects has to be removed. When it comes to precision, for instance determination of growth curves, the manual method should be used. Competition mechanisms within a Daphnia population were investigated with a newly developed culture system (chapter 6 ). it consisted of two interconnected culture vessels, each holding a cohort. An air-driven flow of medium plus algae circulated between these vessels, hence allowing the cohorts to share the same food conditions. The system proved to be a useful tool for competition studies. It enables detailed studies of the exploitation of a common food source by competitors that are similar in morphology, or should be kept apart for other reasons. Different, externally driven food dynamics can be simulated. With a few adaptations the system can easily be extended to hold three or more competing groups. StandardizationCurrent international guidelines predominantly aim at standardisation of conditions during toxicity tests. Therefore, culture methods, i. e. pre-test conditions, differ among research laboratories. As an example, methods practised at the Institute for Inland Water Management and Waste Water Treatment (RIZA) are described in chapter 2 . The experiments in the present study were conducted with D. magna cultered in natural water from Lake Ijssel. The green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa was used to feed the Daphnia. Transfer cultures were supplied with constant daily food rations, and young were removed three times a week. Hence, the density of algae varies with cumulative filtration rates of the mother cohort and the progeny which has not yet been removed. This may carry over into the results of ecotoxicological studies, as maternal feeding conditions can affect the quality of the young. Cowgill et al. (1985) showed an inverse relationship between brood size and weight of newborn D. magna in a laboratory population. They suggested the existence of a reproductive strategy, which earlier had been proposed by Hutchinson (1951) on the basis of field observations. According to this strategy females spread their genes around under favourable conditions by producing many small, 'cheap' neonates, while heavy, stress-resistent young are born when food is sparse. An important objective of the present thesis was to test the validity of this strategy and to explore <b>ecotoxicological</b> and ecological <b>consequences</b> by experimentation (chapters 3 and 4 ). It could be demonstrated in our studies that reproduction of females, which were exposed to an abrupt increase or decrease of food ration between the third and the fourth brood, was fully adapted to the new situation in three instars, or c. eight days at 20 °C (standard laboratory temperature). Brood sizes ranged from 7 to 76 and neonate carapace lengths from 1. 1 to 0. 92 mm. The smallest young (0. 80 mm) were observed in the first brood. The latter is a well-known phenomenon that is accounted for in toxicity test guidelines (e. g. OECD, 1984) by discouraging the use of the first brood. The main reason for this advice is reduced survival in controls, which may invalidate the test (e. g. Cowgill et al., 1986). The present study shows that large neonates contained more lipid reserves than small ones. Therefore we may expect a positive correlation between survival at starvation and body size. This was confirmed in the starvation experiments described in chapter 5 and Enserink (1989), but not in similar experiments in chapter 4 . In connection with unfed 48 h toxicity tests it is worth noting that median survival times never fen below 4 d, even for the smallest (0. 77 mm) neonates. An even more important reason to pay attention to neonate size is that small neonates can be more sensitive to toxicants than large young in acute (48 h) tests (chapter 3 ). When exposed to cadmium there was a threefold difference between the LC 50 's for small and large animals. However, no such effect was found in toxicity tests with chromium(VI), i. e. LC 50 's were similar in all tests, which probably relates to different modes of action of these two metals. In chronic (21 d) toxicity tests the initial size of test animals appeared to be less important (chapter 4 ). Whereas the trends observed in acute tests were consistent in several trials (e. g. Enserink, 1989), this was not the case in chronic tests. The results suggest that environmental conditions during the test mask subtle differences in neonate size and lipid reserves. The variation in effect concentrations caused by non-simultaneous replication was in the same order of magnitude, i. e. a factor of 2, as the effects of initial body size. Probably, food supply during these tests was inadequately controlled. The most conspicuous conclusion of the present studies is that maternal food ration is of paramount importance to neonate fitness and hence to the results of acute toxicity tests, at least for some chemicals (Enserink, 1989; Enserink et al., 1990). Similar results were obtained independently by Baird et al. (1989 b). More recently, a number of other investigators have confirmed these findings. The reproductive strategy in D. magna was also observed by Cox et al. (1992), Naylor et al. (1992) and Viganò (1993). According to Naylor et al. (1992) the inverse relationship between maternal food level and neonate size also holds for dry weight, although this parameter appeared to be more variable than body length. Even under normal culture conditions, when food level is not purposely varied, brood to brood oscillations of neonate weight and length were inversely related to oscillations of mean clutch size (Viganò, 1993; Lazorchak & Waller, 1993). Such variation can be caused by unstable quality or quantity of food supply, increased grazing capacity owing to body growth and periodic presence of neonates. The results of the current studies suggest that the influence of maternal food conditions on the results of acute (48 h) toxicity tests depends on test substance. Cadmium toxicity was modified by neonate size, but the toxicity of chromium remained unaffected. The largest influence was reported for 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, i. e. a factor of 6 (Baird et al., 1991). A significant positive correlation between neonate size and LC 50 was found for sodium bromide and 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (Naylor et al., 1992), and copper (Lazorchak & Waller, 1993). Viganò (1993) found no effect of neonate size on LC 50 's for ethylbenzene and n -butylbenzene, but the variation of test results was very limited, as was the size range of the test animals. For cadmium however, the effect of maternal ration was confirmed (Baird et al., 1991), but neonate length showed no correlation with LC 50 in the experiments of Naylor et al. (1992), which is inconsistent with the results of the present studies. Several differences between our study and that of Naylor et al. (1992) might account for these results, e. g. the presence of food during the test, the use of another clone and a different test medium. It is of interest to note that both studies were carried out|$|R
