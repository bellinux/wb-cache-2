5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is passed through the mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cervical injuries include low heart rate, low blood pressure, problems regulating body temperature, and breathing dysfunction. If the injury is high enough in the neck to impair the muscles involved in breathing, the person {{may not be able to}} breathe without the help of an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> and mechanical ventilator.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} to report a high rate of success for the use of direct {{laryngoscopy}} as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation, the Magill forceps, the Magill laryngoscope blade, and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is also named for Magill. Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) introduced a curved laryngoscope blade in 1943; the Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} inserted into the <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E

5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E

In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a gum elastic urinary catheter as an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation. Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Bros. & Walsh, Ltd.) set about developing an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and {{what became known as the}} Eschmann <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> introducer went into production later that year. The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from polyester threads and an outer resin layer.

25|$|Disadvantages of a naso-enteric {{feeding tube}} include {{increased}} risk of sinusitis (especially if the tube remains in place greater than two weeks) and a still-present risk of accidentally intubating the trachea even in intubated patients (contrary to popular belief, the <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> cuff alone is not always sufficient to prevent NG tube entry into the trachea).

40|$|Bacterial glycocalyx {{formations}} on {{the inner}} lumens of <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> may be dislodged into the lower airway by suction catheter insertions or saline instillations.

A range of 0 - 62, 000 (mean 26, 980) viable bacterial colonies per milliliter was dislodged from freshly removed <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> by either catheter insertion or saline instillation. There {{was no significant difference}} in numbers of viable bacteria dislodged from <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> by catheter insertion versus a 5 milliliter saline instillation. The large numbers of coated bacteria dislodged could be an underestimated infectious hazard, particularly as endotracheal suctioning is generally performed multiple times each day for intubated patients. As optional saline instillations have not improved endotracheal suctioning outcomes in previous studies, caregivers should consider deleting saline instillation during endotracheal suctioning...|$|R
40|$|Background: Polyvinylchloride (PVC) {{is often}} adopted for making medical devices. Objective: Testing the {{hypothesis}} that materials degradation occurs in PVC <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> during infant ventilation, thus releasing the known toxic plasticizer di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Materials and Methods: <b>Endotracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> degradation was assessed by: (1) analysis of color and spectral changes in <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> after use in the 400 - to 700 -nm range and compared to virgin samples. Color changes were expressed as euclidean distances in the Commission International de l'Eclairage Laboratory and Lightness-Chroma-Hue (Munsell's) color spaces (i. e., Delta E, Delta L, Delta a, Delta b, Delta C, and Delta H units); (2) DEHP leakage was assessed by thermal characterization by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Data from used tubes were compared with those from either virgin devices or submitted to artificial aging, including O(2) -induced oxidation, washing, UV photodegradation and exposition to acid solutions. Results: Significant color differences of 13. 33 +/- 0. 85 Delta E were evidenced in used <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tubes,</b> as compared to virgin samples (p < 0. 0001). Chromatic changes were independent from intubation duration. DSC and TGA analyses showed a loss of DEHP from used tubes, as indicated by increase of the glass transition temperature (Tg) and DEHP weight loss. In vivo application of tubes was associated with an aging process whose effects on the optical and spectral properties {{were similar to those}} observed following artificial aging processes. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that significant spectrocolorimetric, DSC and TGA changes occur in <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> after application, thus demonstrating {{for the first time the}} occurrence of in vivo materials degradation and DEHP leakage from medical devices worldwide used for neonatal ventilatio...|$|R
30|$|We {{included}} 52 patients (34 male) of median (1 st- 3 rd quartiles) age 68 (61 - 78) years. The {{median duration}} of intubation was 5.5 (2 - 9) days (min 1 - max 19 days). <b>Endotracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> were from Mallinckrodt (n = 45), TaperGuard (n = 4) or Rush (n = 3) brands and internal diameter 7.0 (n = 10), 7.5 (n = 39), 8.0 (n = 3) mm.

25|$|After World War I, further {{advances}} {{were made}} in the field of intratracheal anesthesia. Among these were those made by Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986). Working at the Queen's Hospital for Facial and Jaw Injuries in Sidcup with plastic surgeon Sir Harold Gillies (1882–1960) and anesthetist E. Stanley Rowbotham (1890–1979), Magill developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation. Magill devised a new type of angulated forceps (the Magill forceps) that are still used today to facilitate nasotracheal intubation {{in a manner that is}} little changed from Magill's original technique. Other devices invented by Magill include the Magill laryngoscope blade, as well as several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is also named for Magill.|$|E
25|$|Until 1913, {{oral and}} maxillofacial surgery was {{performed}} by mask inhalation anesthesia, topical application of local anesthetics to the mucosa, rectal anesthesia, or intravenous anesthesia. While otherwise effective, these techniques did not protect the airway from obstruction and also exposed patients {{to the risk of}} pulmonary aspiration of blood and mucus into the tracheobronchial tree. In 1913, Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that had a light source at the distal tip, rather than the proximal light source used by Kirstein. This new blade incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> or bronchoscope.|$|E
500|$|A {{tracheal}} tube is a catheter that is {{inserted into the}} trachea for {{the primary purpose of}} establishing and maintaining a patent (open and unobstructed) airway. Tracheal tubes are frequently used for airway management in the settings of general anesthesia, critical care, mechanical ventilation and emergency medicine. Many different types of {{tracheal tube}}s are available, suited for different specific applications. An <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal). It is a breathing conduit designed to be placed into the airway of critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients in order to perform mechanical positive pressure ventilation of the lungs and to prevent the possibility of aspiration or airway obstruction. The <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> has a fitting designed to be connected to a source of pressurized gas such as oxygen. At the other end is an orifice through which such gases are directed into the lungs and may also include a balloon (referred to as a cuff). The tip of the <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is positioned above the carina (before the trachea divides to each lung) and sealed within the trachea so that the lungs can be ventilated equally. A tracheostomy tube is another type of tracheal tube; this [...] curved metal or plastic tube is inserted into a tracheostomy stoma or a cricothyrotomy incision.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to cuffed or uncuffed, preformed <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> are also available. The oral and nasal RAE tubes (named after the inventors Ring, Adair and Elwyn) {{are the most}} widely used of the preformed tubes.|$|R

500|$|The {{tip of a}} {{correctly}} positioned {{tracheal tube}} {{will be in the}} mid-trachea, between the collarbones on an anteroposterior chest radiograph. The correct diameter of the tube is that which results in a small leak at a pressure of about [...] of water. The appropriate inner diameter for the <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is estimated to be roughly the same diameter as the child's little finger. The appropriate length for the <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> can be estimated by doubling the distance from the corner of the child's mouth to the ear canal. For premature infants [...] internal diameter is an appropriate size for the tracheal tube. For infants of normal gestational age, [...] internal diameter is an appropriate size. For normally nourished children 1year of age and older, two formulae are used to estimate the appropriate diameter and depth for tracheal intubation. The internal diameter of the tube in mm is (patient's age in years + 16) / 4, while the appropriate depth of insertion cm is 12 + (patient's age in years / 2).|$|E
500|$|Since {{mechanical}} ventilation can worsen a pneumothorax, it can force {{air into the}} tissues; when subcutaneous emphysema occurs in a ventilated patient, it {{is an indication that}} the ventilation may have caused a pneumothorax. It is not unusual for subcutaneous emphysema to result from positive pressure ventilation. [...] Another possible cause is a ruptured trachea. [...] The trachea may be injured by tracheostomy or tracheal intubation; in cases of tracheal injury, large amounts of air can enter the subcutaneous space. An <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> can puncture the trachea or bronchi and cause subcutaneous emphysema.|$|E
500|$|Fiberoptic layngoscopes {{have become}} {{increasingly}} available since the 1990s. In contrast to the conventional laryngoscope, these devices allow the laryngoscopist to indirectly view the larynx. This provides a significant advantage in situations where the operator needs to see around an acute bend in order to visualize the glottis, and deal with otherwise difficult intubations. Video laryngoscopes are specialized fiberoptic layngoscopes that use a digital video camera sensor to allow the operator to view the glottis and larynx on a video monitor. Other [...] "noninvasive" [...] devices which can be employed to assist in tracheal intubation are the laryngeal mask airway (used as a conduit for <b>endotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> placement) and the Airtraq.|$|E
