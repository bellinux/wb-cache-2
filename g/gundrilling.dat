40|$|Abstract. The {{information}} about machinability of two steel – with calcium additives and without in <b>gundrilling</b> are given. Experimentally determined technological characteristics of calcium steel AC 41 Cr 4 machinability in {{deep hole drilling}} with the gun drills of diameter 2. 05 mm. The results of measurement fluctuation of average diameters of holes and surface roughness are given. Microphotographs of different forms of chips after <b>gundrilling</b> are presented. Information about steel with calcium additives machinability was described...|$|E
40|$|In 2006 the <b>gundrilling</b> oil used at Honeywell FM&T (Federal Manufacturing and Technology) {{was known}} as 50 - 50. This name was {{selected}} because the oil {{is a mixture of}} two machining oils, Milpro 634 and Pennex N 47. Unfortunately, Honeywell FM&T was notified that one component, Pennex N 47, would be discontinued by the manufacturer. At this point the Honeywell FM&T team decided to select a single oil to eliminate mixing and procurement of two products. In addition, the team also wanted to select new oil with lower viscosity than the 50 - 50 mixture. Lower (than 50 - 50) viscosity oil was recommended by Nagel the manufacturer of the new TBT <b>gundrilling</b> machines. To this end Honeywell FM&T evaluated seven cutting oils in order to select a substitute that would achieve acceptable <b>gundrilling</b> results. This work resulted in the selection of Castrol Ilocut 334 based on cutting performance and human factors. The Castrol oil can easily achieve up to 8 holes per drill at a feed rate 30 % greater than that achieved by the 50 - 50 oil. Once design agency approval is received, this oil will be installed as the drilling oil for all FM&T stems. This oil will also be used for other reservoir machining operations where appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Drill wear {{monitoring}} is {{a challenging}} task and sensing the wear of a deep-hole drill even more demanding. An economical tool life cannot be obtained without tool wear monitoring. <b>Gundrilling</b> is a deep-hole drilling process much used in mass production, e. g. in the automotive industry. It is gererally known that cutting forces indicate {{what is going}} on in the drill during the drilling process. This study concentrates on examining how the feed force and torque change when the gundrill wears. In the tests, feed force and torque signals were collected during the drilling and tool wear was measured regularly. Single flute gundrills with a solid carbide tip and standard grinding were used. The test material was microalloyed steel. Based on these tests, the wear of the gundrill and tool condition can be discovered from the feed force and moment behavior; changes in the curves and statistical parameters. Keywords: Gundrill, tool life, feed force, torqu...|$|E

The sensor is mounted without having to <b>gundrill</b> the piston rod, yet its small size and location protect it from potential environmental damage.|$|R
40|$|AbstractStraightness {{control in}} deep hole <b>gundrilling</b> of Inconel- 718 is challenging. In this study, the drills {{are found to}} degrade rapidly on the cutting edges, bearing pads and side margins, {{largely due to the}} extreme heat {{resistivity}} of the high temperature superalloys. Severe adhesive wear developed on the rake and flank faces deteriorates cutting efficiencies of the cutting edges while diffusive wear on the bearing pads and side margins deteriorates self-piloting efficacies of the drill. Coupled with highly irregular wear rates on the inner and outer cutting edges, the drills are forced against the hole at high rotational speeds – leading to escalations in frictional contact, heating and thermal damage on the bearing pads and side margins. As a consequence, the drills are deflected from the designated drilling course and resulted in straightness deviation on the part of hole drilled. Through the accumulation of partial straightness deviation over the course of high aspect ratio drilling, the final hole produced is deflected in a constant trend as governed by the rate and behaviour of tool degradation...|$|E
