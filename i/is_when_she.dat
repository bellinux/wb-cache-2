5|$|The {{only time}} in the year when {{separate}} food is cooked for the goddess <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> is offered non-vegetarian offerings. During Durga Puja, Vimala is offered non-vegetarian food and animal sacrifice, traditionally offered to the Hindu Mother Goddess. The goddess is considered to assume a destructive form during the festival and the meat is considered necessary to placate her. In strict secrecy during the pre-dawn hours, animal sacrifice of a he-goat is offered in the temple, while fish from the sacred Markanda temple tank are cooked and offered to Vimala, as per Tantric rituals. The rituals have to be completed before {{the doors of the}} main sanctum of the vegetarian Jagannath are opened at dawn and the first morning aarti is offered to the god. Vaishnava devotees of Jagannath are debarred from the temple. Only a few who witness the ceremony are given the Bimala parusa (Vimala's cuisine) as prasad. The animal sacrifice and the non-vegetarian offerings to Vimala produced protests.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Herod sees Cort's busted {{hand and}} gives Ratsy twenty seconds to leave town. He offers to face Cort left-handed, which Herod is equally fast at drawing with. Herod kills Ratsy {{with a rifle}} and then squares off to fight Cort. Herod then {{secretly}} tells his guards to kill Cort if he is the winner. At the moment Herod draws, several buildings explode on the street. Herod's house and the clock tower are also blown up, and through the smoke and flames, Ellen walks back into town, having faked her death {{with the help of}} Cort, Doc Wallace, the Blind Boy, and the Kid's stash of dynamite. Cort tells Herod that from now on all fights in town will be fair, and proceeds to kill Herod's men who were stationed around town. Ellen and Herod face off, and she finally reveals to him who she <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> throws her father's old badge at Herod's feet. They draw on each other; Herod shoots Ellen in the arm and she fires a shot though Herod's chest. Herod raises his gun to fire again but Ellen shoots him in the eye, finishing him for good. She throws her father's badge to Cort and names him as the new Marshal before saddling up and riding out of the town.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, when Elsa {{becomes a}} young adult, she {{is set to}} be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously {{preparing}} for her coronation day. Anna is flushed with excitement as the castle gates are opened {{for the first time}} since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' (including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, determines to find her sister and bring her back, leaving Hans in charge of Arendelle.|$|E

Fumiko Orikasa, Rukia's Japanese voice actor, liked how Rukia was developed while {{fighting against the}} arrancar, noting {{her to be a}} hero during her introductions. However, she was saddened by how after Rukia defeats the first arrancar,(Di Roy Rinker) she is instantly stabbed by the arrancar Grimmjow. Michelle Ruff, Rukia's English voice actress, found Rukia to be a [...] "survivor", due to how lonely she initially was and how she has been developed through the anime series as she had to start trusting people. She also liked how cool Rukia <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> is fighting but noted it challenging how to voice Rukia due to her various attitudes.

500|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe called [...] "Get Back" [...] a [...] "welcome girl-rock hit". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included the song at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and said, [...] "She wrote {{this with the}} Jonas Brothers, but it sounds more like a Tommy Tutone B-side from the early '80s or {{the sort of thing}} Greg Kihn was pining for when he sang, 'They don't write 'em like that anymore'". Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does [...] "nearly everything Lovato touches". Masley concluded, writing, [...] "When she sings 'I {{want to get back to}} the old days,' what she means <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older days than that." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails." [...] Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an [...] "insidious, Go-Go's-like single".|$|E

Shuichi knows Yu Himura and Chihiro as well, but she forgets Shuichi due to her condition. He meets the main heroine from the fourth chapter of the story named [...] after being introduced by Renji's mother. She goes to an affiliated school and admires Kei greatly {{as someone who is}} older than she is; in fact, Mizuki is also on her school's girls' basketball team. She greatly enjoys reading sh≈çjo manga. She has a straightforward attitude and likes to be frank towards others, especially to Kei. She initially comes to Otowa to visit her older cousin Renji, and this <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> meets Shuichi. Shuichi keeps to himself that he is dying of a special case of neurosis, of which Mizuki is aware of, but even though she tries to get closer to him, he forcibly pushes her away and rejects her affections. Mizuki becomes depressed and obtains Chihiro's diary. Casually reading it, she finds Yu's name which she recognizes from her past. Mizuki goes to the church to find Yu, but the chapter ends shortly after.|$|E

On such songs, Allen still sounds like a real person telling us the most intimate details of her real life, only with better hooks." [...] McCormick also praised the lead single as [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "an ironic declaration of celebrity superficiality set to a pulsing, sleekly modern electro dance backing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sylvan Barnet {{believes}} {{that in this}} adaptation, [...] "Kate and Petruchio fall in love {{almost as soon as}} they see each other." [...] Barbara Hodgdon has also pointed out that several times, Katherina can be seen gazing longingly at Petruchio. Critics have also noted that Katherina twice consciously makes the decision to go along with Petruchio. The first moment is behind the stained glass window, when she silently decides to marry him. The second <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> follows him after he leaves her at the gates of Padua. In this version, Katherina delivers her final speech seemingly without irony. Zeffirelli and Burton both wanted Elizabeth Taylor to deliver the speech ironically, a la Mary Pickford, but Taylor felt {{it would be better to}} speak seriously, and then undermine that seriousness by leaving the banquet without Petruchio, thus subverting his apparent authority over her. However, Elizabeth Schafer calls the film [...] "intensely conservative," [...] citing the controversial advertising blurb; [...] "A motion picture for every man who ever gave the back of his hand to his beloved...and for every woman who deserved it. Which takes in a lot of people! Russell Jackson argues the film [...] "offers a 1960s liberation more likely to appeal to Lawrentians than present-day feminists." [...] However, Schafer does go on to acknowledge that [...] "because of the sheer power of Taylor's presence, Katherina occupies a far more memorable filmic space than the dramatic space she has in the original play.|$|E
2500|$|Regaining {{her gown}} also brought back her memory {{and she was}} {{eventually}} found by the King and Syndra. [...] Oran was {{allowed to return to}} Avalon, provided that she kill no humans, despite her hatred, and that Pain and Fanta must be taken back with her to heaven. Though Oran expresses a desire to rid herself of her children, she is unable to kill them because she had developed human compassion and found that, at some degree, she did love them. Bitter with her fall from the graces of the higher echelon, Oran took a new name, Oreadia, and grew to resent her children, who were a constant reminder of her relations with a human. [...] She appears to have her own agenda concerning Fanta, who can drain her mother's own power when she is fully awakened as a faerie, in opposition to the King's own plan. In volume 18, it is revealed that she has taken revenge on faerie Seraphina, who is responsible for disgracing Oran, using Fanta's powers to absorb outer energy and change them into her own power. Oran cunningly implants fear and discomfort in Fanta towards Seraphina when Fanta is only a child, then persuades Seraphina to teach Fanta about faerie magic. During the lesson, Fanta feels threatened by Seraphina and she unconsciously attacks her, knocking her out. Oran steals the body of another faerie (Seraphina's best friend and minion, Melinda) and visits injured Seraphina. She casts a curse there that sends Seraphina to human world - she is to live perfectly ordinary human life until her fifteenth birthday, when all her memories as faeries come back to her. This <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> made a contract with Sanjae (King of Avalon) that if he overlooks this revenge and claims Oran not guilty of Seraphina's banishment, she will serve as a source of Fanta's powers - which means that every time Fanta unlocks the seal that prevents her from absorbing outer forces, all energy she draws will be drawn from Oran. In volume 19, Oran dies in front of Fanta as Fanta unknowingly unlocks her seal to help her mother.|$|E
