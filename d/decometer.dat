5000|$|Early Decca {{receivers}} were {{fitted with}} three rotating Decometers that indicated the phase difference for each pattern. Each <b>Decometer</b> drove a second indicator that counted {{the number of}} lanes traversed [...] - [...] each 360 degrees of phase difference was one lane traversed. In this way, assuming the point of departure was known, {{a more or less}} distinct location could be identified.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain more {{fundamental}} information for the evaluation test at sea on Kita Kyushu Decca Chain, the <b>Decometer</b> readings were carried out periodically for 3 days every month from Nov. 1969 to Oct. 1970 at Nagasaki Harbor. The data obtained showed that each pattern was almost stable during the daylight and the 99 % confidence interval of annual mean were ± 1. 6 ～ 3. 7 cel. This indicates that fairly precise lines of position are available. Monthly means of each pattern showed some difference by month, but the difference {{seemed to have no}} connection with season. Red and Purple <b>Decometer</b> readings fluctuated at night. In the case of Purple, the annual standard deviation increased remakably (± 36. 5 cel) and its fluctuation began before sunset being about one and half hours in winter and one hour in summer. It would be the limitation time to determine the precise line of position in the sea area near the station. 1969 年 11 月以来長崎港に於いてデッカ・システムに関する基礎的な知見を得るため定期的な測定を行なって来た。測定点の立地条件や測定日数,時間等本問題の解析には充分とはいい難いが,今回の 1 年間の測定結果は次の様である。 1) 各パタンのうち最も安定しているのは緑パタンで,昼夜を通じて高精度のL. O. P. を得られる。 2) 赤パタンは夜間の変動がやや大きく, 99 %信頼区間は± 228 mとなるが,他の航法システムに比べれば十分よい精度といえる。 3) 紫パタンは昼間では赤パタンとほぼ同じ精度であるが,夜間は変動が大きく測定点附近での使用に適しない。 4) 紫パタンは日没前から変動が増大し使用に価しなくなるが,その開始時刻は冬季と夏季では時間差がみられ,それぞれ日没の 1 ～ 1. 5 時間前頃からである。今後の問題点として,更に実用的な精度,定偏差,夜間の変動パタン,日出後の使用可能時刻等について解析し,加えて地域的な特性の解明のために,昼夜連続測定と海上実験を行なう必要がある...|$|E
5000|$|As each {{master and}} {{secondary}} signal was sent {{on a different}} frequency, any number of delays could be measured at the same time; in practice a single master and three secondaries were used to produce three outputs. As each signal was sent on a different frequency, all three, known as [...] "green", [...] "red" [...] and [...] "purple", were simultaneously decoded and displayed on three <b>decometers.</b> The secondaries were physically distributed at 120 degree angles from each other, allowing the operator to pick the pair of signals on the display that were sent from stations as close to right angles to the receiver as possible, further improving accuracy. Maximum accuracy was normally quoted as 200 yards, although that was subject to operational errors.|$|R
5000|$|Decca solved {{this problem}} though {{the use of}} an odometer-like display known as [...] "decometers". Prior to leaving on a trip, the {{navigator}} would set the <b>decometer's</b> lane counter to their known position. As the craft moved the dial's hand would rotate, and increment or decrement the counter when it passed zero. The combination of this number and the current dial reading allowed the navigator to directly read the current delay and look it up on a chart, a far easier process than Gee or LORAN. It was so much easier to use that Decca later added an automatic charting feature that formed a moving map display. Later additions to the signal chain allowed the zone and lane to be calculated directly, eliminating the need for manually setting the lane counters and making the system even easier to use.|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} paper, the authors {{reported on the}} precision of Decca LOP at the fixed measuring sites in Nagasaki Harbor. In this study, we extended our measuring area to the eastern sea of Goto-Nada (western coast of Nagasaki Prefecture), selecting ten sites. <b>Decometer</b> readings and measurements of ship's position by horizontal sextant angle were conducted at 3 or 4 points in each site in October 1973 and on the bimonthly basis from April to November 1974. Even in this limited area, the deviation of each pattern showed the considerable variation of about 0. 1 ～ 0. 2 lane by site and season, but the seasonal variation was not regular. The pair to obtain the most accurate position differed by site. However, since the angle of intersection of LOP and the Purple Pattern often fluctuated by more than 1. 0 lane at night, the Red and Green pair is generally used. The difference of mean fix by the Red and Green pair was about 500 m (0. 28 ') {{in the direction of}} SW and the radius of the circle of 68 % (1 σ) confidence interval was about 170 m (0. 09 '). 本海域における定偏差は観測点の地理的条件によって 0. 1 ～ 0. 2 レーンの差があり,その変化傾向もパタンにより一定でない。赤緑の両パタンは+ 0. 1 ～ 0. 4 レーン,紫パタンは± 0. 1 レーンの幅をもつ。最適ペアによるデッカ位置は,ほゞ南西方向に 200 ～ 500 m偏位しているが,本海域で一般的に使用されるR-Gペアによれば南西方向へ約 500 m(変緯約 0. 1 浬,東西距約 0. 2 浬) 偏位し,その 68 %(1 σ) 信頼区間は半径約 170 mの円となる。本システムの誇る高精度の船位を得るためには,更に広範囲の海域における評価を行い,定偏差の把握と補正が不可欠である...|$|E
