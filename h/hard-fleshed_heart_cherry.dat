They told him where to find Mogarzea's soul, and he brought it back to him. Then he and Mogarzea brought the tree with the elves back to Mogarzea's father's court.|$|R

In March 1970 Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs {{consisted}} of Thorpe on lead vocals and guitar, Jimmy Thompson on drums, Paul Wheeler on bass guitar and Lobby Loyde (ex-Purple <b>Hearts,</b> Wild <b>Cherries)</b> on lead guitar. They released a cover version of Willie Dixon's [...] "Good Mornin' Little School Girl". They {{had developed a}} heavier sound and in July that year, Warren `Pig' Morgan (piano, backing vocals) had joined and the band recorded, The Hoax Is Over, which was released in January 1971. Thorpe described their sound [...] "was like we were standing {{on a pair of}} Boeing 747 engines. It cracked the foundations and broke windows in neighbouring buildings".By early 1971 Blackfeather consisted of Neale Johns on lead vocals, John Robinson on lead guitar (ex-Lonely Ones, Monday's Children, Dave Miller Set), Robert Fortesque on bass guitar and Alexander Kash on drums. Their debut album, At the Mountains of Madness, appeared in April 1971. In May they had a hit with [...] "Seasons of Change", which peaked at No. 15 on the Go-Set National Top 40 Singles Chart. Buffalo formed in August 1971 by Dave Tice on co-lead vocals (ex-Head) with Paul Balbi on drums, John Baxter on guitar, and Peter Wells on bass guitar.

Thorpe had {{recorded}} no new material for over two years, but he emerged after a spell of bankruptcy in 1969, with [...] "Good Mornin' Little School Girl", a Willie Dixon cover, as a single in March 1970. With the encouragement of Loyde, Thorpe's 'new' Aztecs developed a heavier sound and established themselves as one of Australia's premier hard rock groups. By July, Warren 'Pig' Morgan (piano, vocals) had joined and the band recorded, The Hoax Is Over, which was released in January 1971. Loyde left to reform Wild Cherries (later called Lobby Loyde & the Coloured Balls).
