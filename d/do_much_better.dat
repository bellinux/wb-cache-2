5|$|Even in {{reporting}} the election result, newspapers suggested that Diefenbaker would soon call another election and seek a majority. Quebec Tory MP William Hamilton (who would soon become Postmaster General under Diefenbaker) predicted {{on the evening}} of June 10 that there would soon be another election, in which the Tories would <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> in Quebec. The Tory government initially proved popular among the Canadian people, and Diefenbaker called a snap election. On March 31, 1958, the Tories won the greatest landslide in Canadian federal electoral history in terms of the percentage of seats, taking 208seats (including fifty in Quebec) to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning eight and none for Social Credit.|$|E

Mahesh too confirmed the same in late January 2012 during the scripting stage of the sequel titled Businessman 2. It was planned as a bilingual film to be shot in Telugu and Hindi simultaneously. Ram Gopal Varma also {{expressed interest}} after listening to the script and felt that the sequel would <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> business that the original. However, Jagannadh shelved the sequel in early August 2012 and opted to direct Mahesh in an original film.|$|E

25|$|The Ram defense held Dallas to only 85 rushing yards; Dallas' {{defense was}} equally stingy, {{allowing}} 120 rushing yards but the Rams needed 49 attempts to achieve this. Constant Ram pressure caused Staubach {{to have one}} of his worst playoff games ever as he was 15 of 37 for 150 yards; he was sacked 4 times and threw 3 interceptions. In addition, Staubach, who had hurt the Rams the year before with his scrambling runs, gained only 8 yards rushing. Ram QB Pat Haden couldn't <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> vs. Dallas' tough defense; he was 10 for 21 for 152 yards and also threw 3 interceptions.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 2007, Brownback {{finished}} third in the Ames Straw Poll with 15.3 percent of all votes cast. Fundraising and visits to his website declined dramatically after this event, as many supporters had predicted Brownback would <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>better,</b> and speculation began that the candidate was considering withdrawing from the campaign. This sentiment increased after his lackluster performance in the GOP presidential debate of September 5, broadcast from New Hampshire by Fox News Channel. He dropped out of the race on October 18, 2007, citing a lack of funds. He formally announced his decision on October 19. He later endorsed John McCain for president.|$|E
25|$|New leader, John Alderdice, polled 32.0% of {{the vote}} in East Belfast, while Alliance came within 15,000 votes of both the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin across Northern Ireland. In 1988, in Alliance's keynote post-Anglo Irish Agreement document, Governing with Consent, Alderdice called for a devolved power-sharing government. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, Alliance's vote stabilised at between 7% and 10%. After the IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994, Alliance became the first non-nationalist party to enter into talks with Sinn Féin, as an active {{participant}} in the Northern Ireland peace process negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement, which it strongly supported. Alliance polled poorly in the 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum, and the 1998 election for the Northern Ireland Assembly winning around 6.5% {{of the vote}} each time. This did enable the party to win six seats in the Assembly, although this was somewhat of a let-down given that it had been expected to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E

500|$|William Godwin's {{theories}} of biographical writing significantly influenced Shelley's style. Her father believed that biography {{could tell the}} history of a culture as well as serve a pedagogical function. Shelley felt that her nonfiction works were better than her fiction, writing in 1843 to publisher Edward Moxon: [...] "I should prefer quieter work, to be gathered from other works—such as my lives for the Cyclopedia—& which I think I <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than romancing." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Music Week magazine awarded [...] "Did It Again" [...] {{three stars}} out of five, stating that Minogue's vocals [...] "takes a stroppy edge", but [...] "it's {{not strong enough}} to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than the modest performance of Some Kind Of Bliss." [...] Natasha Tripney from musicOMH said: [...] "'Did It Again' reminds you of her valiant but wildly misjudged attempt to morph into Indie Kylie circa 1997, only really serving to highlight the limitations of her voice in the process." [...] Michael R. Smith from Daily Vault felt the song represented the album [...] "perfectly" [...] and had labelled the songs as [...] "undiscovered gems". Smith felt the song was [...] "another underrated song" [...] from the Impossible Princess album and labelled it an [...] "indie classic". In the annual 1997 Triple J Hottest 100 list, [...] "Did It Again" [...] was eighty-one. At the 1998 ARIA Music Awards, [...] "Did It Again" [...] was nominated for Single of the Year but lost to Natalie Imbruglia's single [...] "Torn" [...] respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Trevelyan's own {{personality}} is enigmatic, with its undertones of racial prejudice and authoritarianism. He could defend his emigrants against the criticisms of Robert Lowe and {{the critics of}} his schemes in New South Wales, but he could also contemplate with satisfaction [...] "the prospect of flights of Germans settling here in increasing numbers - an orderly, moral, industrious and frugal people, less foreign {{to us that the}} Irish or Scotch Celt, a congenial element which will readily assimilate with our body politic". He certainly believed that he was benefiting both Britain and the Highlanders, for he wrote on another occasion, [...] "The Irish and Scotch, especially the latter, <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> when they have a fresh start in other countries, and become mixed up with other people, than when they stay at home".|$|E

2500|$|According to Abram Hoffer, orthomolecular {{medicine}} {{does not}} purport to treat all diseases, {{nor is it}} [...] "a replacement for standard treatment. A proportion of patients will require orthodox treatment, a proportion will <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> on orthomolecular treatment, and the rest will need a skillful blend of both." [...] Nevertheless, advocates have said that nutrients can prevent, treat, and sometimes cure {{a wide range of}} medical conditions, including: acne, alcoholism, allergies, arthritis, autism, bee stings, bipolar disorder, burns, cancer, the common cold, depression, drug addiction, drug overdose, epilepsy, heart diseases, heavy metal toxicity, acute hepatitis, herpes, hyperactivity, hypertension, hypoglycemia, influenza, learning disabilities, mental and metabolic disorders, migraine, mononucleosis, mushroom poisoning, neuropathy & polyneuritis (including multiple sclerosis), osteoporosis, polio, an hypothesised condition called [...] "pyroluria", radiation sickness, Raynaud's disease, mental retardation, schizophrenia, shock, skin problems, snakebite, spider bite, tetanus toxin and viral pneumonia.|$|E
2500|$|An {{unlikely}} romance was scripted into Mel's narrative {{when she}} began dating her boss Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). The pairing {{has been described as}} one of [...] "the most unbelievable soap couples", but Outwaite defended it in 1999, saying [...] "I know I've fancied some not particularly attractive men in my time, but I don't think Ian is actually ugly. He has a vulnerable side and that's what is attractive. When he is being all hot-headed and gets above himself then I personally don't like Ian. But when he is being vulnerable I can see the attraction. People talk to me about it all the time. I have taxi drivers telling me I could <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than Ian. The other day someone shouted that I should go back with [...] Steve Owen. It's incredible, they'd rather [...] went out with [...] a murderer than with [...] a hard-working father raising three children." [...] Their relationship was the focus of the storyline that aired to mark the Millennium celebrations, when Ian emotionally blackmailed Mel into marrying him by claiming that his daughter was dying of cancer; storylines {{in the latter part of}} 1999 focused on the build-up to a joint Millennium wedding on New Year's Eve 1999 with Barry (Shaun Williamson) and Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed). The wedding went as planned; however, Mel and Ian's marriage ended hours later as the clock struck midnight to signify the beginning of the New Year after Mel discovered Ian's lie. The Millennium Eve episodes drew in 20.89 million viewers – the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in EastEnders precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An EastEnders spokeswoman commented: [...] "This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of EastEnders that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square." [...] The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical “haunt for New Year's Eve revelers”.|$|E
