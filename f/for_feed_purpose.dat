40|$|Sorghum is {{a unique}} crop {{produced}} for domestic and export markets with multiple uses as food, feed, fodder, fuel and fi ber grown globally. The sorghum grain is the major ingredient in cattle feed, poultry and swine around the globe. Stover is an important fodder source for both milch and draft animals in mixed crop-livestock systems. Sorghum provides raw material to many industrial uses like potable alcohol, transport grade ethanol malt, beer, liquids, gruels, starch, adhesives, core binders for metal casting, ore refi ning and grits as packaging material. Spatial distribution shows that it is grown on 40. 5 M ha in 98 countries of Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Nigeria, India, the USA, Mexico, Sudan, China and Argentina are the major producers of sorghum. The crop is adapted {{to a wide range}} of temperatures, including high elevations in East Africa. In South Asia, where adoption rates are high, the most signifi cant adoption constraints are specifi c varietal traits (e. g., disease resistance, duration, yield, stover quality). In Africa, where adoption rates are lower, the most signifi cant adoption constraints are access to seed and information, bird damage (associated with early-maturing varieties) and poor soil fertility/lack of fertilizer. Recent global trends also show that both grain yield and production increased refl ecting increase in use of improved varieties, increased demand due to population growth and higher world prices for major cereals. The area under sorghum is increasing gradually in West and Central Africa (WCA) while in other regions it’s area is showing a declining trend over last few decades. In general, the grain is grown in more economically advanced countries <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> <b>purpose</b> and in less developed countries for food purpose.

The reconnaissance is based on over 100 fathometer echograms and 100 trawls which fished for a period of one hour with an opening and closing Tucker midwater trawl. Echograms of two fathometer frequencies (30 Kc and 11 Kc) indicated that two latitudinal scattering zones may exist. Temperature, oxygen, light intensity, faunal composition, and swimbladder morphology were investigated with relation to the DSL. The oxyclines associated with the eastern Pacific oxygen minimum zone seemed to have little effect on the DSL.

Species richness was greater at night, whereas fish number, weight, and richness (cornmunity indicators) were all {{influenced by the}} tidal state. Samples from rising tides were more representative, probably due to onshore fish movements <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>purposes.</b> However, lower catches were associated with high tides, mainly through net avoidance, indicating that sampling in these conditions is not highly informative. Clupeoids exhibited greater variation in a 24 h period, and the night occurrence of A. tricolor and daylight shoaling of Harengula clupeola, Anchoa parva and Sardinella brasiliensis suggested distinct strategies for avoiding daylight predators. In some species, this behaviour may have been induced by the bottom morphology and tidal state, facilitating nearshore grouping. In addition to being caught at night, the occurrences of Menticirrhus littoralis, Pomadasys corvinaefórmis, Umbrina coroides and Hyporhamphus unifasciatus indicated a spatial niche partition according to tidal state.
