25|$|There {{are several}} logos and emblems spread {{throughout}} its body. “GT-H” logos also {{featured on the}} grille, rear faux gas cap and on the trunk lid. Further, Shelby replaced its front splitter and rear spoiler with elements made with carbon-fiber. The <b>engine</b> <b>hood</b> is also specially crafted with vents and a big bulge at the center, same as the Shelby GT. The exterior upgrades {{is a set of}} 19-inch aluminum wheels which are wrapped in high-performing Michelin rubber (255/40s at the front and 275/40s at the rear.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{outside of}} the engine were less extreme, but with a {{distinction}} between the third and fourth generation, with changes of the <b>engine</b> <b>hood.</b> The Tremec T56 transmission was replaced with a new Tremec TR6060 with triple first-gear synchronizers and doubles for higher gears. The Dana M44-4 rear axle from the 2003–2006 model now has a GKN ViscoLok speed-sensing limited-slip differential that greatly helps the tires in getting grip under acceleration. Another performance upgrade was the removal of run-flat tires; the new Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tires increased grip and driver feedback and, along with revised suspension (springs, anti-roll bars, and shock valving), made the Viper more neutral in cornering.|$|E
50|$|This {{modification}} was successful, but it {{was noted}} that the <b>engine</b> <b>hoods</b> were a potential constraint. All further DSC class locomotives equipped with the refuges had their <b>engine</b> <b>hoods</b> shortened by 500mm, necessitating the relocation of the radiator header tanks to their present 'east-west' alignment.|$|R

2500|$|Presented at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Super Trofeo Stradale was {{a limited}} (150 units) {{version of the}} LP570-4 Superleggera. Boasting a dry weight of , it is [...] lighter than a comparably {{equipped}} LP570-4 Superleggera. Essentially a road version of the Super Trofeo race car, equipped with the same adjustable rear spoiler that offers an aerodynamic load 3 {{times that of the}} standard Gallardo LP 560-4 for increased dynamic stability during tight, high-speed driving. Another element taken directly from the racing version was the removable <b>engine</b> <b>hood</b> with quick-release system. The vehicle included Rosso Mars (red) body colour, 6-speed E-gear transmission, carbon fibre and Alcantara interior upholstery with red stitching, double-A-arm suspension, 19-inch wheels, titanium bearing and bolts, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. Optional equipment included carbon-ceramic brake discs, a tubular interior roll cage, 4-point safety belts and fire extinguisher, satellite navigation, with Bluetooth connection for mobile phones, an anti-theft system, and a lifting system that raises the front axle, grey or white brake caliper.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Warren Commission, {{a second}} shot that struck the President was {{recorded}} at Zapruder film frame 313. The Commission made no conclusion {{as to whether}} {{this was the second}} or third bullet fired. The presidential limousine then passed in front of the John Neely Bryan north pergola concrete structure. The two investigative committees concluded that the second shot to hit the president entered the rear of his head (the House Select Committee placed the entry wound four inches higher than the Warren Commission placed it) and passed in fragments through his skull; this created a large, [...] "roughly ovular" [...] hole on the rear, right side. The president's blood and fragments of his scalp, brain, and skull landed on the interior of the car, the inner and outer surfaces of the front glass windshield and raised sun visors, {{as well as on the}} front <b>engine</b> <b>hood</b> and the rear trunk lid. His blood and fragments also landed on the follow-up Secret Service car and its driver's left arm, as well on the motorcycle officers who were riding on both sides of the President just behind his vehicle.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the 'classic' Saab 900 with its longitudinally mounted <b>engine</b> and front-hinged <b>hood</b> (bonnet), the NG900 had a more-common transversely mounted <b>engine</b> with rear-hinged <b>hood</b> (bonnet).|$|R

50|$|The {{process was}} spread {{out from the}} late 1970s into the early 1980s. As part of this, some {{locomotives}} were repainted in the International Orange livery but with their pre-TMS numbers instead of the later TMS numbers. As a result of this, the locomotives were equipped with new radiator header tanks which were mounted behind the radiator {{on top of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>hoods</b> in a 'north-south' alignment. Later the tanks were relocated to an 'east-west' alignment.|$|R

50|$|The {{appearance}} of the car has changed, with the most obvious being the open top (hence the Roadster name). This part of the vehicle is also its key element. The design of the rear changes, with new eyelid-like fixed flaps that continue with the design and eventually end on the rear lights. The rear <b>engine</b> <b>hood</b> also has a new shape {{to adapt to the}} roadster form. It also, unlike the Coupe, does not include a black carbon-fiber stripe across it. The <b>engine</b> <b>hood</b> also now has grilles. The wheels also change, with a new set specifically constructed for the Roadster model. There is now also a front spoiler. The doors are no longer gull-wings, as this is a convertible version of the Huayra.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s more {{trucks were}} required, and the Army wanted {{to replace the}} multifuel engines with a {{standard}} diesel. AM General (successor of Kaiser-Jeep) developed an updated and redesigned version of the M39 series. Standardized as the M809 series, the primary difference was the <b>engine.</b> The <b>hood,</b> frame, and fenders were lengthened {{to make room for}} the larger engine, and it had a redesigned grille. All had an air cleaner on the left front fender, a quick visual way to tell them from the earlier M39 series. Jeep/AM General built all M809s between 1969 and 1982.|$|R
5000|$|The 539 {{engine was}} {{developed}} {{in response to the}} perceived drawback that Alco's line of diesel switchers had a restricted field of vision because of the high hood. Both Baldwin and EMC were offering diesel switchers with a lower <b>engine</b> <b>hood</b> that the trainmen could see over. The 539 engine was developed from the 538 engine, both had the same cylinder dimensions. The engine base of the 538 was flat and rode on a flat underframe. The change that the 539 offered was to lower the base of the engine into the frame. This was done with revised mounting lugs and a modified oil pan. The modified 538 became known as the 539 and the change allowed the <b>engine</b> <b>hood</b> to be lowered two feet three inches.|$|E
50|$|The Ruf R Kompressor {{is built}} {{in much the}} same way as Rufs always have. The <b>engine</b> <b>hood</b> and spoiler are made of both kevlar and carbon fiber. As is typical of Ruf, the {{interior}} is very conservative. It is powered by a supercharged 3.8 liter flat-6 engine.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 1930s and 1940s a {{wide range}} of fire engines, {{including}} articulated ladder trucks were made, with power coming mostly from Hercules or Waukesha engines. All these had their <b>engines</b> under <b>hoods,</b> and the first cab forward model came in 1961 with a flat-fronted cab which is still used today. Conventionals and cab-forwards were made through the 1960s with little change, and Pirsch were also offering their specialties on other chassis such as Ford and Mack CF. Very few conventionals were made after 1970, and current production centers on rigid and articulated cab-forward units, mostly with diesel engines.|$|R

40|$|National audienceSmall reverberant {{rooms are}} usually {{used in the}} {{automotive}} industry, like the well-known Alpha Cabin, for diffuse field absorption coefficient measurements of porous materials. The advantage is that rather small flat samples are necessary here, typically 1, 2 m by 1 m. Real parts can be measured as well, like <b>engine</b> <b>hoods,</b> in sufficient quantity close the 1, 2 m² area. With a Schroeder frequency of 1250 Hz, the simulation of the Alpha Cabin is rather problematic. There are diffusivity issues in the middle frequency range that are varying {{with the level of}} absorption of the sample. Moreover, critical diffractions due to the finite size effects of the 1, 2 m² flat sample occur and must be taken into account. Different simulation approaches of small reverberant rooms are investigated in this paper and compared to the large reverberant rooms situation (with 12 m² material in that case). The first approach, for solving the diffraction issues, consists in applying recent spatial windowing techniques combined with the efficient Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) for porous materials, sometimes called Finite Transfer Matrix Method (FTMM). The second approach, for solving the diffusivity issues, consists in modelizing the Alpha Cabin with the Ray-Tracing Methods with statistical prolongations and compare directly the reverberation times with measurements. In order to take into account both issues {{at the same time and}} potentially strong coupling between the porous domain and the fluid domain in the middle frequency range, a complete FEM model, as third approach, is built using poro-elastic finite elements with the (u,p) formulation. All simulation techniques will be compared with oneanother and correlated with measurements carried out in small and large reverberant rooms showing the advantages and limitations of each approach...|$|R

50|$|Consider the {{assembly}} of a car: assume that certain steps in {{the assembly}} line are to install the <b>engine,</b> install the <b>hood,</b> and install the wheels (in that order, with arbitrary interstitial steps); {{only one of these}} steps can be done at a time. In traditional production, only one car would be assembled at a time. If engine installation takes 20 minutes, hood installation takes five minutes, and wheels installation takes 10 minutes, then a car can be produced every 35 minutes.|$|R
