5|$|On August 23, 1954, a D train {{relaying}} east of {{the station}} overshot the bumper blocks {{at the end of}} the track, crashing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{at the end of the}} line. The train motorman was trapped in the tunnel for seven hours, and when he was freed, his left foot had to be amputated.|$|E
5|$|On lap167, {{the thirteenth}} caution {{was caused by}} Keselowski colliding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> The {{accident}} also involved Smith and Logano. At the lap170 restart, Hamlin was the leader, but on the following lap he was passed by Earnhardt, Jr.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{rather than}} {{inducting}} a player <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> of Fame, the Phillies selected their Centennial Team, commemorating {{the best players}} of the first 100 years in franchise history. The Centennial Team includes players from several periods in Phillies history. The team is honored with a plaque listing {{the names of all}} players selected at the left end of the Wall of Fame. 11 members of the Centennial Team also have their own individual plaques on the Wall; those not otherwise included on the Wall are Manny Trillo, Jim Konstanty, and Pete Rose.|$|E

5|$|Kasey Kahne {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner, followed by Carl Edwards, who started second. On the following two laps, Jimmie Johnson took over the fourth position. On the fourth lap, Edwards passed Kahne for the first position. After starting from 37th, Denny Hamlin had moved to 27th by lap six. Eleventh-placed qualifier Jeff Gordon joined team-mate Johnson in the top ten four laps later. Johnson passed A. J. Allmendinger on lap 12 to claim the third position, as David Reutimann and Kurt Busch collided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Five laps later, the first caution was given after Reutimann collided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> again. Most of the front runners made pit stops, except for J. J. Yeley, who didn't pit until the following lap. At the lap 22 restart, Edwards was first, ahead of Kahne, Allmendinger, and Johnson. Hamlin turned sideways and drove through the grass in the infield, prompting the second caution on the following lap. Hamlin only sustained minor damage to his splitter. Edwards remained the leader during the restart, while Allmendinger took over second from Kahne.|$|E
5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of a burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Davidson {{missed out}} on the second session of qualifying, putting his Super Aguri in 17th position, 3 places behind his {{teammate}} Sato. Ralf Schumacher and his team were disappointed with qualifying in 18th. Heikki Kovalainen crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> at turn 5, damaging his rear suspension and losing his rear wing, resulting in the session being stopped temporarily. Once the debris had been cleared, Kovalainen in his repaired car managed one impressive lap that put him in 13th, after which six drivers outqualified him. Kovalainen then had to make an engine change due to an engine failure and was demoted {{to the back of}} the grid. Wurz, Sutil and Albers qualified in 19th, 20th and 21st respectively after being pushed up a place by Kovalainen's engine change.|$|E

5|$|At the lap140 restart, Bowyer was the leader, {{but after}} one lap, Truex passed him. On lap143, the {{eleventh}} caution was given following contact between Greg Biffle and Montoya. More {{of the front}} runners made pit stops again during the caution. At the lap146 restart, Truex was the leader. One lap later, Earnhardt, Jr. claimed the lead for six laps before Newman passed him. On lap158, a record twelfth caution was given, as Kvapil collided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Most of the drivers made pit stops during the caution, with Newman the leader. At the lap163 restart, Newman was the leader ahead of Hamlin and Earnhardt. On the following lap, Hamlin became the leader, as Montoya moved up to third.|$|E
5|$|Goss darted inside, but Hays {{slipped and}} fell {{before he could}} enter the blockhouse. As he fell, three musket balls lodged {{themselves}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{where he had been}} standing moments before. While the attackers reloaded, Hays slipped inside and for about an hour an exchange of heavy gunfire erupted between the parties before the attackers withdrew. A fourth man, Upton, was out hunting nearby; when he was discovered by the attackers he was chased throughout the afternoon. Upton escaped the attackers injury-free. In fact, no person was killed or injured during the Plum River raid. The small raiding party escaped with three horses, but two horses were badly wounded by gunfire, and the other shot dead by the settlement's defenders.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti {{accepted}} {{the commission and}} created plaster models of the reliefs. He installed one of the models in his ch√¢teau in France, where it remains today, while the other was set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of a gardener's cottage adjoining his French estate. The bronze relief of the deathbed scene {{was added to the}} pedestal in August 1866, while the Taking of Ascalon was installed in March 1867. The Art Journal criticised the deathbed scene as being excessively stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in the Houses of Parliament, created by John Cross, that depicted the same subject.|$|E
50|$|A {{memorial}} slab built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> north <b>wall</b> of <b>the</b> sanctuary is {{the oldest}} memorial in the church (1482).

5|$|Nearly 78 {{percent of}} the {{estimated}} 26,000 trees harvested for use at Chetro Ketl were felled between 1030 and 1060. More than 7,000 trees were felled for kiva (round room) construction alone, with approximately 750 used in the great kiva. Roofs typically consisted of primary beams, secondary beams, {{and one or two}} layers of split shakes, probably of a juniper species or pinyon pine, which were locally available. Most of the primary and secondary construction beams were of ponderosa pine. In addition to bulk materials, construction required other items in smaller quantities. Cordage was used for lashing roof elements together, and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting mortar and rock. Other tools, such as digging sticks and hammerstones, were used in quantity; many discarded hammerstones have been found built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> interiors.|$|E
5|$|On lap 152, Johnson fell to seventh, after McMurray passed him. On the {{following}} lap, Ryan Newman {{moved to the}} sixth position, as McMurray moved to fifth. By the 158th lap, Truex, Jr. had a 1.2 second lead over Edwards. Six laps later, Kevin Conway spun sideways, prompting the sixth caution to be given. Most of the front runners made pit stop during the caution. At the lap 168 restart, Edwards was first, ahead of Kyle Busch, Harvick, and Truex, Jr. Two laps later, Hamlin moved to ninth, after passing Almirola. On lap 175, Tony Stewart moved to sixth, after starting the race in 31st. Five laps later, Harvick moved into the third position, as Truex, Jr. was moving toward Edwards. During the 183rd lap, Jeff Burton collided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> On {{the following}} lap, Hamlin moved into sixth. On lap 186, the seventh caution was given because of debris. Most of the front runners made pit stops during the caution. Harvick became the leader under the caution, but was given a pit road speeding penalty, resulting in him starting {{in the rear of}} the grid. Truex, Jr. led to the restart, as Edwards was second. The eighth caution was given two laps later because Dave Blaney collided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Harvick made pit stops during the caution, while the front runners stayed on the track. On lap 198, Edwards was first, ahead of Kenseth, Truex, Jr. and Stewart.|$|E
5|$|On the 118th lap, Bowyer and Menard {{moved to}} the first two positions. By lap120, the race had {{experienced}} 47 lead changes among 18 different leaders. Two laps later, Truex reclaimed the first position, as the ninth caution was given for Kvapil. During the caution, most of the front runners made pit stops. At the lap127 restart, Truex led the grid to the green flag, but on the following lap, Bowyer passed him. Seven laps later, the tenth caution was given after Kenseth collided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Some of the front runners made pit stops during the caution.|$|E

5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled {{kitchen garden}} {{was built in}} the early 1700s to provide fruit and {{vegetables}} for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is built into the southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held {{before the race}} on Friday. The first session lasted 80 minutes long, while the second was 85 minutes long. Kurt Busch was quickest {{with a time of}} 26.366 seconds in the first session, more than five-tenths of a second faster than Jeff Burton. Denny Hamlin was just off Burton's pace, followed by Kevin Harvick, Kyle Busch, and Brad Keselowski. Kasey Kahne was seventh, still within a second of Kurt Busch's time. Also in the session, Trevor Bayne collided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> so the team had to go to their back-up car. In the second practice session, Kyle Busch was fastest with a time of 26.454 seconds, only one-hundredth of a second quicker than second-placed David Ragan. Edwards took third place, ahead of Jamie McMurray, Greg Biffle and Martin. Newman only managed seventh place.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{finding the}} girl, the bishop summoned his council and it {{decided that the}} girl should be immured in {{the wall of the}} chapel and the canon was to be put in prison where he was starved to death. The {{builders}} left a cavity <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and the poor girl with a piece of bread and a mug of water was walled in. For some time her cries for help were heard. Yet her soul could not find the peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery‚Äôs window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E

60|$|We wandered {{from room}} to room, looking up and seeing in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>the</b> desolate fireplaces, tier over tier, {{the places where the}} beams of the floors had gone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> and still <b>the</b> birds {{continued}} their singing every where.|$|R
5|$|After {{a two-hour}} delay, {{the race was}} restarted. Rahal {{suffered}} clutch problems on the restart, which placed him two laps down, while the other drivers ran behind the safety car, during which the marshalls showed {{the areas in which}} repair work had been conducted. Just prior to the restart, there was a short rain shower which made the track slightly slippy. Power lost one position on the restart, dropping to third. Franchitti, who was the closest driver to the front to have the softer compound red tires fitted gained two positions on the restart, moving up to fourth. The restart only lasted for six corners, before Castroneves spun in the wet conditions, and was then struck by Ed Carpenter. On the next corner, Josef Newgarden had slid <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and stalled, and a full-track caution was again called. The race was restarted with nine laps remaining, and Franchitti once more gained a position, passing Pagenaud to gain second. However, the race was almost immediately under a yellow flag again as E.J. Viso was spun by Marco Andretti, and stalled in the middle of turn four. From the ensuing restart, Dixon managed to maintain the lead from Franchitti, and the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers completed a second successive one-two finish.|$|E
5|$|An iron hook is affixed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the Castellania {{close to}} the pillory. According to tradition, the hook might {{have been used to}} lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now {{regarded}} as unlikely. The hook was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through the hook in a dare, and the hook became known as Nelson's Hook after the Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet and buy drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through the hook. Junior officers allegedly had a good chance of promotion if they passed through the hook. Brockman further claims that the hook was used to lift a cage at the pillory, with a person condemned to stay inside for public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. The hook by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{retained}} the {{lead from the}} pole position throughout the beginning lap. On the second lap, Brendan Gaughan collided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> prompting the first caution to be given. On the lap six restart, Edwards remained the leader. On the following lap, Kurt Busch passed Edwards to become the leader. On lap 7, Biffle had fallen two positions as David Reutimann overtook him. Three laps later, Johnson moved up to the 13th position. By the fourteenth lap, Harvick had moved up eight positions {{since the beginning of}} the race. Harvick continued to move forward while Busch maintained the lead. On lap 28, Edwards claimed the first position from Busch. By the 30th lap, Hamlin moved up to fifth on the grid after passing Reutimann. The next lap, Kyle Busch, Kurt's younger brother, hit the wall, but sustained minor damages. On lap 41, Hamlin moved up to third as Edwards maintained a 1.5-second lead. Three laps later, Hamlin passed Kurt Busch to claim second.|$|E
