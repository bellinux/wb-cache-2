In this short report, we summarize the causal dissipative hydrodynamics, so-called "Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics" (EIT), with a supplemental comment of which the original works of EIT are not aware, and then show two theorems about relativistic dissipative flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. By these theorems, a significant property of EIT in contrast with classic laws of <b>dissipations</b> is clarified, and a dissipative instability of an exact solution of relativistic perfect fluid flow is also obtained.

5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat <b>dissipation</b> can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat <b>dissipation.</b> The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E
