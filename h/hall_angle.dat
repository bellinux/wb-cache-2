40|$|Using two {{approaches}} to strongly correlated systems, the extremely correlated Fermi liquid {{theory and the}} dynamical mean field theory, we compute the transverse transport coefficients, namely the Hall constants R_H and <b>Hall</b> <b>angles</b> θ_H, and also the longitudinal and transverse optical response of the U=∞ Hubbard model {{in the limit of}} infinite dimensions. We focus on two successive low-temperature regimes, the Gutzwiller correlated Fermi liquid (GCFL) and the Gutzwiller correlated strange metal (GCSM). We find that the <b>Hall</b> <b>angles</b> θ_H ∝ T^ 2 in the GCFL regime, on warming into the strange metal regime, it passes through a downward bend and continues as T^ 2. Equivalently, R_H is weakly temperature dependent in the GCFL regime, and becomes strongly T-dependent in the GCSM regime. Drude peaks are found for both the longitudinal optical conductivity σ_xx(ω) and the optical <b>Hall</b> <b>angles</b> tanθ_H(ω) below certain characteristic energy scales. By comparing the relaxation rates extracted from fitting to the Drude formula, we find that in the GCFL regime there is a single relaxation rate controlling both longitudinal and transverse transport, while in the GCSM regime two independent relaxation rates emerge. We trace the origin of this behavior to the dynamical particle-hole asymmetry of the Dyson self-energy, arguably a generic feature of doped Mott insulators. Comment: 12 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

Due to its exceptionally low damping, Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 (YIG) is an important and widely used FM for microwave devices and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spin pumping.

From enhanced Gilbert damping obtained from the frequency dependence of FMR linewidths and ISHE signals, the spin <b>Hall</b> <b>angles</b> and YIG/NM interfacial spin mixing conductances are quantitatively determined for these metals.

50|$|Extraordinary {{magnetoresistance}} (EMR) is a geometrical magnetoresistance effect {{discovered in}} 2000, where {{the change in}} electrical resistance upon {{the application of a}} large magnetic field can be greater than 1,000,000% at room temperature (orders of magnitude greater than other magnetoresistance effects such as GMR and CMR). The effect occurs in semiconductor-metal hybrid systems when a transverse magnetic field is applied. Without a magnetic field the system is in a low-resistance state with most of the current flow directed through the metallic region. Upon the application of a large magnetic field the system switches to a state of much higher electrical resistance, due to the <b>Hall</b> <b>angle</b> approaching 90°, with the current flow inside the metallic region dramatically reduced. The effect is influenced greatly by the system geometry, with an enhancement of over four orders of magnitude shown to be possible with an alternative branched geometry. Since the EMR effect occurs at room temperature and does not rely on magnetic materials it has many possible benefits for applications including in the read heads of future hard disk drives.|$|E

40|$|Berry {{curvature}} {{hot spots}} in two-dimensional materials with broken inversion symmetry {{are responsible for}} the existence of transverse valley currents, which give rise to giant nonlocal dc voltages. Recent experiments in high-quality gapped graphene have highlighted a saturation of the nonlocal resistance {{as a function of the}} longitudinal charge resistivity ρ_ c, xx, when the system is driven deep into the insulating phase. The origin of this saturation is, to date, unclear. In this work we show that this behavior is fully compatible with bulk topological transport in the regime of large valley <b>Hall</b> <b>angles</b> (VHAs). We demonstrate that, for a fixed value of the valley diffusion length, the dependence of the nonlocal resistance on ρ_ c, xx weakens for increasing VHAs, transitioning from the standard ρ^ 3 _ c, xx power-law to a result that is independent of ρ_ c, xx.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} and velocity-force curves of a skyrmion moving over a two-dimensional periodic substrate using simulations of a particle-based skyrmion model, {{focusing on the}} role of the non-dissipative Magnus term. In the overdamped limit, the skyrmion depins into a sliding state with a <b>Hall</b> <b>angle</b> of zero. When a Magnus term is included, the <b>Hall</b> <b>angle</b> is nonzero in the absence of a substrate. On a periodic substrate, the <b>Hall</b> <b>angle</b> varies with the drive amplitude. Due to the substrate symmetry the <b>Hall</b> <b>angle</b> does not change continuously with drive, but forms a series of discrete steps at rational ratios of the skyrmion velocity components perpendicular and parallel to the drive direction, when the skyrmion motion locks to symmetry directions of the substrate for fixed intervals of the drive amplitude. On each step, the <b>Hall</b> <b>angle</b> is constant and the skyrmion motion is orderly. Transitions between locked phases generate pronounced cusps in the velocity-force curves, as well as regions of negative differential mobility. The number of observable locking steps increases when the relative strength of the Magnus term increases. We find an overshoot phenomena where the <b>Hall</b> <b>angle</b> exceeds the clean limit value, as well as an acceleration effect where the skyrmion moves faster over a substrate than through a clean sample. These effects are robust for different types of periodic substrates. With a simple model for a skyrmion interacting with a single pin, we can capture the behavior of the <b>Hall</b> <b>angle.</b> The Magnus term induces a curvature in the skrymion orbit as it moves through the pin, resulting in a side step phenomenon that decreases with increasing drive. When the Magnus term is large, the range of impact parameters that permit the skyrmion to be trapped by the pin is small, which is a reasons that strong Magnus force effects reduce the pinning in skyrmion systems.
