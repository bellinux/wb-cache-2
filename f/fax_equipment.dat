50|$|Making {{phone calls}} over the Internet (Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP) has become {{increasingly}} popular. Compressing fax signals is different from compressing voice signals, so a new standard (T.38) has been created for this. Using a (sending) VoIP adapter and (receiving) gateway which are both T.38 compliant, most fax machines can be plugged into the VoIP adapter {{in the same way}} as to a regular phone line. Not all <b>fax</b> <b>equipment</b> claiming T.38 compliance works reliably. In particular communicating with older fax machines is problematic.|$|E
50|$|Facsimile {{machines}} {{are commonly used}} tools of business, whenever a client requires a hard copy of a document. They can also be simulated using web services, and made untraceable {{by the use of}} prepaid phones connected to mobile fax machines or by use of a public fax machine such as one owned by a document processing business like FedEx Office/Kinko's. Thus, scammers posing as business entities often use fax transmissions as an anonymous form of communication. This is more expensive, as the prepaid phone and <b>fax</b> <b>equipment</b> cost more than email, but to a skeptical victim it can be more believable.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{voice over}} IP (VoIP) vendors have used one central, {{remotely}} located fax server {{as a means}} of offering Internet fax service to their clients. In theory, standards such as T.38 should have allowed VoIP subscribers to keep their existing <b>fax</b> <b>equipment</b> working locally; in practice, T.38 at the subscriber's site offers no benefit if the upstream provider is least-cost routing to gateways that don't support T.38 and cannot reliably send or receive fax/modem traffic. A fax server at a central location, connected directly to public switched telephone network (PSTN) T-carrier primary rate interface lines and using direct inward dial to identify the intended addressee can convert an incoming fax to an electronic document (such as [...]tif or [...]pdf) for web or e-mail delivery. The fax traffic never passes through the VoIP infrastructure as a dial-up modem call and therefore arrives reliably even if T.38 is not properly supported at some points in the network.|$|E

The measures employed were based on recommendations made by Scotland Yard personnel. Security is not limited to the terminal; access to Gibraltar Harbour is restricted. In addition to security on the land side of the harbour, the waters are patrolled by a combination of Gibraltar Port Authority, Royal Gibraltar Police, and Ministry of Defence (Gibraltar Defence Police and Royal Navy) vessels.|$|E
40|$|Fax Technology Necessary for Healthcare Industry Despite the strides we {{have made}} in {{technology}} with electronic mail and other web capabilities, faxing is very much still a necessity for today’s healthcare industry. Kissimmee, FL, Friday, June 9, 2017 —Unlike what many of us thought when technology started dominating our lives, {{the need for the}} use of paper hasn’t changed that much at all. In fact, it almost seems as though there is more paper stacking up in our lives and in offices than before. Sure, paperless options are readily available for many services but there are still quite a few companies and sectors, both public and private, that {{have not been able to}} find a way to operate on a paperless system. Since fax and paper has always dominated the exchange of patient information, running on a paperless type system is especially difficult in the healthcare field. Surprising to many, paper and faxing actually accounts for about 90 % of all patient information exchanges in the healthcare world. With that in mind, it is definitely safe to assume that healthcare facilities go through countless amounts of paper. Many people believe that faxing actually saves healthcare facilities money and increases efficiency. This could not be further from the truth as paper is most likely a very high expense considering the amount of paper they use. Also, it actually takes a lot more time to send and receive faxes using outdated equipment compared to using other methods of exchanging patient information. Since faxing is considered to be much more secure for the exchange of information, the use of a fax system is still an important part of how healthcare facilities exchange sensitive patient details and information. Thanks to cloud technology there are some solutions available for sending virtual faxes without the use of a manual fax machine. However, hospitals and other similar facilities require more security than the cloud typically offers. Some facilities have deployed the use of an on-premises fax server that operates using a cloud-based transmission. This is becoming a more popular way to send and receive faxes while keeping sensitive and private details safe, but many clinics and hospitals are still using their old fax machines and are still manually handling their transmission of information. While it may take some time to integrate, cloud-based faxing is definitely the way to go if a clinic is considering cutting down on costs, both in paper and in manpower. Really, what cloud technology does is it allows us to focus our efforts on the really important aspects of running a business or facility and helps us better manage and maintain administration. Perhaps many organizations are not totally aware that faxes can be transmitted using the cloud. Cloud technology has advanced so much that we can now send a fax using Google in a matter of seconds without the need for paper or having to worry about maintaining old-school <b>fax</b> <b>equipment.</b> Now, we can literally just click and send in minutes and possibly even seconds. Hopefully all healthcare industries will transition to cloud-based faxing capabilities as the health industry continues to grow...|$|E
