The power cars were given the coaching stock numbers 43000 and 43001.

25|$|The 1970s saw British Rail {{successfully}} introduce <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>diesel</b> train services, as well {{as major}} resignalling projects designed to increase operational efficiency. In 1976, the InterCity 125 High Speed Train (HST) was introduced on some services and the InterCity brand was adopted. This created an increase in passengers using the railways and improved British Rail's finances. British Rail also started development of the world's first tilting train – the Advanced Passenger Train (APT). However, lack of money, political pressure and {{the launch of the}} prototype into passenger service before technical problems were fully overcome lead to the project being cancelled in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The {{propulsion}} {{system of the}} RN ships will have a gas turbine direct drive and four <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>diesel</b> generators driving two electric motors in a combined diesel-electric or gas (CODLOG) configuration. In 2012 Rolls Royce repackaged the MT30 used in the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers {{so that it would}} fit into smaller ships. The MT30 will be used in the Type 26. BAE Systems have suggested that some customers will install gas turbine engines and others will prefer to sacrifice 2–3 knots of speed by choosing cheaper diesel engines. The CODLOG configuration for propulsion is a simpler version of the Combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) propulsion used on the Type 23 which this ship is to replace, and both of the Global Combat Ship's design contemporaries – the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier and the Type 45 destroyer – use integrated electric propulsion (IEP).|$|E

40|$|The {{diesel engine}} {{is one of}} the most {{efficient}} thermal engine known to man. Even though these engines are efficient they usually suffer from severe problems that result to either engine failure or low power output affecting seriously the vessel speed. The problem is severe especially in the case of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> marine <b>diesel</b> engines which because of their <b>high</b> operating <b>speed</b> are very sensitive to adjustments and the condition of their subsystems.

In the present work a different approach is presented for the purpose of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> marine <b>diesel</b> engines diagnosis and condition monitoring. The method is based on a thermodynamic simulation model which makes use of measured engine data. The method provides the current engine condition and determines the required engine tuning for optimum performance. In the present work the results obtained from the application of the method on a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> marine <b>diesel</b> engine used to power a small vessel are presented.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with aspects of gasoline spray droplet impingement simulation, for which an improved model has been developed for predicting the outcomes of spray droplets impacting on a wall.

40|$|The {{supercharging}} system {{investigated in}} this study is made up of a traditional turbocharger, coupled with a Roots-type positive displacement compressor. An electrically actuated clutch allows the compressor to be disengaged from the engine at <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> and under partial load steady operations (such as the ones occurring in a driving cycle). This concept of supercharging has been applied to the downsizing of a reference engine (a 2. 5 litre, turbocharged, four cylinder, <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> DI <b>Diesel</b> engine), without penalization on the maximum brake power (110 kW) and transient response. For such a purpose, a “paper” engine has been theoretically characterized. The gross engine parameters have been optimised by means of 1 -D numerical simulations, using a computational model previously validated against experiments. Performances of the reference and the downsized engine have been compared, considering both steady and transient operating conditions, full and partial load. The two-stage supercharging system allows the “paper” engine to provide higher values of torque at low engine speed and full load, and to perform slightly better in terms of transient response. Furthermore, when considering operating conditions occurring in the European Driving cycle (Roots compressor disengaged), the downsized engine shows lower fuel consumption (from 6 to 24 %), and lower pollutant emissions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} {{efforts in the}} direction of internal combustion engines functional cycle simulation, particularly for small capacity diesel engines, are justified by shortening the path between the new conceptual solution and its effects and also to reduce research costs. There can be adopted new organizational and management solutions for the combustion process after these, for example, confirm at the model level. This paper proposes an unizonal physico-mathematical combustion model in <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> small <b>Diesel</b> engines, based on a Vibe-type law and on the heat transfer through the combustion chamber walls modelated after Woschni. The complexity of the model justifies the name of „virtual engine”. This allows to determine the functional parameters as instantaneous and average values, at any engine operating regime. The simulated experiment takes place in perfectly controlled conditions and leads to good results. There are obtained, during the combustion process, dynamics of parameters concerning the vaporization characteristics, combustion characteristics and combustion kinetics, for any operating regime. The parameters are evolving in a predictable way, being experimentally confirmed...|$|R
