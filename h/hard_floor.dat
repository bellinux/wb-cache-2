25|$|All of {{the most}} common types of acro {{footwear}} provide both traction and cushioning. In addition, acro performance surfaces are frequently rough, so acro footwear must protect the bottom of the foot from skin abrasion. Abrasion protection is particularly important on the ball of the foot, which is subjected to a great deal of friction during dance turns and leaps. Traction is essential to prevent lateral slipping that could result in dangerous falls to the <b>hard</b> <b>floor.</b> Cushioning serves to soften the impact when performing tricks such as tucks and layouts, in which a dancer's feet may strike the floor at high velocity. Cushioning is especially important when a Marley floor is unavailable, because uncovered performance surfaces have no cushioning whatsoever and thus may be extremely hard and unyielding.|$|E
25|$|McMahon {{then began}} a feud with Kurt Angle. By the King of the Ring, on June 24, McMahon's feud with Angle had culminated. After already {{participating}} in two tournament matches that night, Angle wrestled McMahon in a Street Fight. After a suplex on the <b>hard</b> <b>floor,</b> Angle {{was thought to}} have cracked his tailbone. Angle also delivered an overhead belly to belly suplex through the plated glass stage set, but McMahon did not break through on the first attempt, causing him to fall head-first onto the concrete floor. After a successful second attempt, Angle was to put him through a second plate {{back out to the}} stage and again failed two more times. The match also had Shane missing a shooting star press and ended with Angle performing the Angle Slam off the top rope before scoring the victory over a bloodied McMahon.|$|E
2500|$|Gymnastics {{came of age}} in India when, at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Ashish Kumar won {{the first-ever}} medal in {{gymnastics}} for India and also won a bronze medal. However, soon after the win, the president of the Gymnastics Federation of India, controversially asked Kumar's chief coach from the Soviet Union, Vladimir Chertkov, [...] "Is this all that you can deliver, a bronze?" [...] The comment was widely reported in the press. Later, the coach revealed that, [...] "In August 2009, we had no equipment. Ashish trained on <b>hard</b> <b>floor</b> till February 2010, and then we got equipment around 20 years old." [...] The federation announced that no Indian team would travel to Rotterdam for the World Championships in October, which would mean that Indian gymnasts would not have the opportunity to qualify as a team for the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E
40|$|The energy, {{time and}} water usage {{required}} for cleaning carpets and <b>hard</b> <b>floors</b> (solid vinyls, wood and wood laminates) in commercial buildings are compared. The electrical energy requirements for {{both types of}} flooring are similar for areas with heavier traffic volumes. For all other areas, carpets require slightly more electrical energy, but less human energy, water and time to clean than <b>hard</b> <b>floors.</b> The greatest difference is in the consumption of water, with <b>hard</b> <b>floors</b> requiring up to 40 times more than carpet, depending {{on the amount of}} traffic.

40|$|Claw health, an {{important}} dairy cow welfare parameter, {{may be affected}} by early-life foot/leg stresses. To investigate this, groups of pregnant heifers were allocated to deep straw bedding (Soft) or cubicles (Hard), both with scraped concrete feeding alleys. After the grazing season, they were re-housed in cubicle systems, half on slatted concrete (Hard) and half on slatted rubber (Soft) alleys. Claw measurements, contact area and pressure distribution claw/flooring, claw disorders and leg lesions were recorded at the start and end of each housing season. Locomotion and leg lesions were also scored monthly after calving. Prevalence of sole haemorrhages was higher among pregnant heifers in cubicles than in deep straw. After calving, first-calvers on <b>Hard</b> <b>floors</b> had higher odds for lameness (OR = 3. 6; P < 0. 01), sole haemorrhages/ulcers (OR = 2. 2; P < 0. 05), white-line haemorrhages (OR = 2. 8; P < 0. 01) and leg lesions (OR = 2. 6; P < 0. 02) than those on Soft floors. Lowest prevalence and severity of sole and white-line haemorrhages (non-significant) in first-calvers was found in those on Soft floors and reared on <b>Hard</b> <b>floors</b> and the highest prevalence and severity on those on <b>Hard</b> <b>floors</b> reared on Soft floors.
