40|$|This is {{the final}} {{technical}} report for a three-site project {{that is part of}} an overall program funded by the U. S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE/NETL) and industry partners to obtain the necessary information to assess the feasibility and costs of controlling mercury from coal-fired utility plants. This report summarizes results from tests conducted at MidAmerican's Louisa Generating Station and Entergy's Independence Steam Electric Station (ISES) and sorbent screening at MidAmerican's Council Bluffs Energy Center (CBEC) (subsequently renamed Walter Scott Energy Center (WSEC)). Detailed results for Independence and Louisa are presented in the respective Topical Reports. As no full-scale testing was conducted at CBEC, screening updates were provided in the quarterly updates to DOE. ADA-ES, Inc., with support from DOE/NETL, EPRI, and other industry partners, has conducted evaluations of EPRI's TOXECON II{trademark} process and of high-temperature reagents and sorbents to determine the capabilities of sorbent/reagent injection, including activated carbon, for mercury control on different coals and air emissions control equipment configurations. An overview of each plant configuration is presented: (1) MidAmerican's Louisa Generating Station burns Powder River Basin (PRB) coal in its 700 -MW Unit 1 and employs hot-side electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) with flue gas conditioning for particulate control. This part of the testing program evaluated the effect of reagents used in the existing flue gas conditioning on mercury removal. (2) MidAmerican's Council Bluffs Energy Center typically burns PRB coal in its 88 -MW Unit 2. It employs a hot-side ESP for particulate control. Solid sorbents were screened for hot-side injection. (3) Entergy's Independence Steam Electric Station typically burns PRB coal in its 880 -MW Unit 2. Various sorbent injection tests were conducted on 1 / 8 to 1 / 32 of the flue gas stream either within or {{in front of one of}} four ESP boxes (SCA = 542 ft{sup 2 }/kacfm), specifically ESP B. Initial mercury control evaluations indicated that although significant mercury control could be achieved by using the TOXECON II{trademark} design, the sorbent concentration required was higher than expected, possibly due to poor sorbent distribution. Subsequently, the original <b>injection</b> <b>grid</b> design was modeled and the results revealed that the sorbent distribution pattern was determined by the grid design, fluctuations in flue gas flow rates, and the structure of the ESP box. To improve sorbent distribution, the <b>injection</b> <b>grid</b> and delivery system were redesigned and the effectiveness of the redesigned system was evaluated. This project was funded through the DOE/NETL Innovations for Existing Plants program. It was a Phase II project with the goal of developing mercury control technologies that can achieve 50 - 70 % mercury capture at costs 25 - 50 % less than baseline estimates of $ 50, 000 -$ 70, 000 /lb of mercury removed. Results from testing at Independence indicate that the DOE goal was successfully achieved. Further improvements in the process are recommended, however. Results from testing at Louisa indicate that the DOE goal was not achievable using the tested high-temperature sorbent. Sorbent screening at Council Bluffs also indicated that traditional solid sorbents may not achieve significant mercury removal in hot-side applications...|$|E
40|$|Compliance {{with the}} Clean Air Mercury Rule will require {{implementation}} of dedicated mercury control solutions at {{a significant portion}} of the U. S. coal-fired utility fleet. Activated Carbon Injection (ACI) upstream of a particulate control device (ESP or baghouse) remains one of the most promising near-term mercury control technologies. The DOE/NETL field testing program has advanced the understanding of mercury control by ACI, but a persistent need remains to develop predictive models that may improve the understanding and practical implementation of this technology. This presentation describes the development of an advanced model of in-flight mercury capture based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The model makes detailed predictions of the induct spatial distribution and residence time of sorbent, as well as predictions of mercury capture efficiency for particular sorbent flow rates and <b>injection</b> <b>grid</b> configurations. Hence, CFD enables cost efficient optimization of sorbent injection systems for mercury control to a degree that would otherwise be impractical both for new and existing plants. In this way, modeling tools may directly address the main cost component of operating an ACI system – the sorbent expense. A typical 300 MW system is expected to require between $ 1 and $ 2 million of sorbent per year, and so even modest reductions (say 10 - 20 %) in necessary sorbent feed injection rates will quickly make any optimization effort very worthwhile. There are few existing models of mercury capture, and these typically make gross assumptions of plug gas flow, zero velocity slip between particle and gas phase, and uniform sorbent dispersion. All of these assumptions are overcome with the current model, which is based on first principles and includes mass transfer processes occurring at multiple scales, ranging from the large-scale transport in the duct to transport within the porous structure of a sorbent particle. In principle any single one of these processes could limit the overall capture of mercury. For example, capture may be severely limited in situations where the dispersion of sorbent is poor, or where adsorption rates are low because of relatively high temperatures. Application examples taken from the DOE/NETL field test program were considered. The sites considered include Brayton Point, Meramec, Monroe, and Yates. Some general lessons learned concerning the impact of turbulence and flow stratification on dispersion and capture will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Brayton Point Unit 1 was {{successfully}} tested for applicability of activated carbon injection as a mercury control technology. Test {{results from this}} site have enabled a thorough evaluation of the impacts of future mercury regulations to Brayton Point Unit 1, including performance, estimated cost, and operation data. This unit has variable (29 - 75 %) native mercury removal, thus {{it was important to}} understand the impacts of process variables and activated carbon on mercury capture. The team responsible for executing this program included: (1) Plant and PG&E National Energy Group corporate personnel; (2) Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI); (3) United States Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE/NETL); (4) ADA-ES, Inc.; (5) NORIT Americas, Inc.; (6) Apogee Scientific, Inc.; (7) TRC Environmental Corporation; (8) URS Corporation; (9) Quinapoxet Solutions; (10) Energy and Environmental Strategies (EES); and (11) Reaction Engineering International (REI). The technical support of all of these entities came together to make this program achieve its goals. Overall, the objectives of this field test program were to determine the impact of activated carbon injection on mercury control and balance-of-plant processes on Brayton Point Unit 1. Brayton Point Unit 1 is a 250 -MW unit that fires a low-sulfur eastern bituminous coal. Particulate control is achieved by two electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) in series. The full-scale tests were conducted on one-half of the flue gas stream (nominally 125 MW). Mercury control sorbents were injected in between the two ESPs. The residence time from the <b>injection</b> <b>grid</b> to the second ESP was approximately 0. 5 seconds. In preparation for the full-scale tests, 12 different sorbents were evaluated in a slipstream of flue gas via a packed-bed field test apparatus for mercury adsorption. Results from these tests were used to determine the five carbon-based sorbents that were tested at full-scale. Conditions of interest that were varied included SO{sub 3 } conditioning on/off, injection concentrations, and distribution spray patterns. The original test plan called for parametric testing of NORIT FGD carbon at 1, 3, and 10 lbs/MMacf. These injection concentrations were estimated based on results from the Pleasant Prairie tests that showed no additional mercury removal when injection concentrations were increased above 10 lbs/MMacf. The Brayton Point parametric test data indicated that higher injection concentrations would achieve higher removal efficiencies and should be tested. The test plan was altered to include testing at 20 lbs/MMacf. The first test at this higher rate showed very high removal across the second ESP (> 80 %). Unlike the ''ceiling'' phenomenon witnessed at Pleasant Prairie, increasing sorbent injection concentration resulted in further capture of vapor-phase mercury. The final phase of field-testing was a 10 -day period of continuous injection of NORIT FGD carbon. During the first five days, the injection concentration was held at 10 lbs/MMacf, followed by nominally five days of testing at an injection concentration of 20 lbs/MMacf. The mercury removal, as measured by the semi-continuous emission monitors (S-CEM), varied between 78 % and 95 % during the 10 lbs/MMacf period and increased to > 97 % when the injection concentration was increased to 20 lbs/MMacf. During the long-term testing period, mercury measurements following EPA's draft Ontario Hydro method were conducted by TRC Environmental Corporation at both 10 and 20 lbs/MMacf test conditions. The Ontario Hydro data showed that the particulate mercury removal was similar between the two conditions of 10 or 20 lbs/MMacf and removal efficiencies were greater than 99 %. Elemental mercury was not detected in any samples, so no conclusions as to its removal can be drawn. Removal of oxidized mercury, on the other hand, increased from 68 % to 93 % with the higher injection concentration. These removal rates agreed well with the S-CEM results...|$|E

So, new management strategies are needed to integrate local electricity production into the grid. Indeed, depending on the <b>grid</b> load, <b>injection</b> of local production can impact positively or negatively the grid. Thus, sometimes, the grid could not accept all the decentralized production and an important risk of instability or blackout exists. The objective of the present work is to propose and validate, in simulation, a predictive strategy to manage the electricity consumption and production of multi-energy buildings. This approach is composed of a prediction tool, developed to forecast four variables: the electricity consumption of the house, the local production of electricity, the grid load {{and the price of}} electricity. The strategy uses the models of the local microgrid to manage efficiently the electricity. It decides if electricity has to be stored, unload or consumed according to the predictions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{health risk}} {{associated}} with human exposure to pollutants while using biogas for cooking was assessed following the methodology described by the US - National Research Council. Information of hazardous compounds and compositions of several biogas types were extracted from scientific literature. Compositions were dependent on the biogas origin (production process). First, a quantitative approach was conducted to identify substances with a high health risk based on their Human Toxicity Values. Then, a subsequent qualitative analysis was performed to complete the health risk assessment based on other toxicology data, effectiveness of purification processes, variability of the waste materials used for biogas generation and, when possible, a comparison with natural gas. The main conclusion {{of the study was}} that the <b>injection</b> in the <b>grid</b> of upgraded biogas originating from household and organic waste landfills, did not present an increase of health risks when compared to the domestic use of natural gas...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) is {{the most}} popular wind power generator. Wind power <b>injection</b> into the <b>grid</b> affects the power quality, {{stability}} and voltage regulation. This machine can be operated either in grid connected or standalone mode. A Static Compensator (STATCOM) is used to enhance the reactive power capability of the system. Battery energy storage system (BESS) is integrated to sustain the real power source under fluctuating wind power. A control scheme based on injecting current into the grid using bang-bang controller is presented. Unity power factor is maintained at the grid side. Rotor speed is maintained constant irrespective of the change in wind speed and grid power is maintained constant. This scheme is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Keywords—Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); Rotor side converter (RSC); Grid side converter (GSC); Battery energy storage system (BESS) STATic COMpensator (STATCOM); Reactive power compensation.

40|$|Despite their {{ever-increasing}} power <b>injection</b> {{into power}} <b>grid,</b> wind turbines play {{no role in}} frequency control. On the other hand, power network frequency is mainly adjusted by conventional power plants. DFIG-based wind turbines not only are able to produce power in various mechanical speeds, {{but they can also}} reduce speed instantaneously which, in turn, leads to mechanical energy release. Thus, they can aid conventional units in system frequency control. In this paper, the effect of wind energy conversion systems, especially variable speed DFIG-based wind turbines, in controlling and tuning of frequency is investigated when different penetration coefficients are considered in a isolated microgrid comprising of conventional thermal and non-thermal generating unit. To do this, optimal tuning of DFIG's speed controller is performed in different penetration levels using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. In addition, optimum penetration of wind energy conversion system is studied considering frequency change parameters in a microgrid...|$|R
