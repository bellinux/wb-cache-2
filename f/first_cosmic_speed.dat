40|$|We {{show that}} quantum decoherence, {{in the context}} of {{observational}} cosmology, can be connected to the cosmic dark energy. The decoherence signature could be characterized by the existence of quantum entanglement between cosmological eras. As a consequence, the Von Neumann entropy related to the entanglement process, can be compared to the thermodynamical entropy in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The corresponding cosmological models are compatible with the current observational bounds being able to reproduce viable equations of state without introducing a priori any cosmological constant. In doing so, we investigate two cases, corresponding to two suitable cosmic volumes, V∝ a^ 3 and V∝ H^- 3, and find two models which fairly well approximate the current <b>cosmic</b> <b>speed</b> up. The existence of dark energy can be therefore reinterpreted as a quantum signature of entanglement, showing that the cosmological constant represents a limiting case of a more complicated model derived from the quantum decoherence.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new statistic to measure more accurately the <b>cosmic</b> sound <b>speed</b> of clusters of galaxies at different redshifts. This statistic is evaluated by cross-correlating cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations caused by the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect from observed clusters of galaxies with their redshifts. When clusters are distributed in redshift bins of narrow width, one could measure the mean squared cluster peculiar velocity with an error σC 2 S clusters of flux above 200 mJy which will be detected by PLANCK, coupled with high resolution microwave images to eliminate the cosmological part of the CMB fluctuations.
