5|$|Kubrick {{shared a}} love of film with his school friend Alexander Singer, who {{after graduating from high}} school had the {{intention}} of directing a film version of Homer's The Iliad. Through Singer, who worked in the offices of the newsreel production company, The March of Time, Kubrick learned that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cost</b> $40,000 to make a proper short film, money he could not afford. However, he had $1500 in savings and managed to produce a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer. He began learning all he could about filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, laboratories, and equipment rental houses.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Mayor's {{official}} residence is 3 Elliot Terrace, {{located on the}} Hoe. Once a home of Waldorf and Nancy Astor, it was given by Lady Astor to the City of Plymouth as an {{official residence}} for future Lord Mayors and is also used today for civic hospitality, as lodgings for visiting dignitaries and High Court judges {{and it is also}} available to hire for private events. The Civic Centre municipal office building in Armada Way became a listed building in June 2007 because of its quality and period features, but has become the centre of a controversy as the council planned for its demolition estimating that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cost</b> £40m to refurbish it, resulting in possible job losses.|$|E
25|$|The Highways Agency is the {{executive}} agency responsible for trunk roads and motorways in England apart from the privately owned and operated M6 Toll. The Department for Transport states that traffic congestion {{is one of the}} most serious transport problems and that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cost</b> England an extra £22billion in wasted time by 2025 if left unchecked. According to the government-sponsored Eddington report of 2006, congestion is in danger of harming the economy, unless tackled by road pricing and expansion of the transport network.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} findings was that a new measles vaccine used in low-income countries was associated with a two-fold increase in mortality among girls. This discovery led to the withdrawal of the vaccine. Had it not been withdrawn, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have <b>cost</b> at least ½ million additional female deaths per year in Africa alone.|$|R
50|$|SSJID {{recently}} (dedicated July 18, 2008) {{completed a}} 1.4 megawatt solar farm that provides {{nearly all of}} the electricity to run its water treatment plant, saving the district over $400,000 annually in power costs. SSJID’s solar farm is recognized as the world’s first single-axis solar tracking system featuring thin-film photovoltaic cells. The tracking system was developed by Conergy, the premier leader in the solar technology field. The District recognized that through this technology, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not only reduce the electricity costs of its customers, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> stabilize <b>costs</b> which usually fluctuate seasonally.|$|R
25|$|The site of {{the closed}} Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital has on-site contamination—it is not {{considered}} a Superfund clean-up site. Mayor Jonathan Hornik estimates <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cost</b> more than $11 million to clean up. Mayor Jonathan Hornik stated that the state clearly has the responsibility for cleaning up the site. He however, stated that {{in the interest of}} getting it done, the township may have to show some flexibility in helping the state defray the costs. In addition to the contamination on the site, the old buildings from the hospital are now in a state of decay and are being demolished.|$|E
25|$|Lehmann {{subsequently}} {{had to wait}} {{nearly four}} months to make another competitive appearance for Arsenal, which came in their final Champions League group match against Steaua Bucharest. Nearly one month later, he played only his fifth competitive {{game of the season}} for Arsenal, against Burnley in the third round of the FA Cup; meanwhile third-choice goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański was selected for the League Cup games. Lehmann expressed frustration at being number two to Manuel Almunia fearing <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cost</b> him the number one jersey in the German national team for the European Championship 2008. However, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger described Lehmann's attitude as “super-professional”.|$|E
500|$|The third {{method is}} the {{input-output}} cost method. [...] This looks {{at both the}} costs of inputs and includes any value added by the household. [...] "For instance, the value of time devoted to cooking a meal can be determined by asking what <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cost</b> to purchase a similar meal (the output) in the market, then subtracting {{the cost of the}} capital goods, utilities and raw materials devoted to that meal. This remainder represents the value of the other factors of production, primarily labor." [...] These types of models try to value household output by determining monetary values for the inputs [...] in the dinner example, the ingredients and production of the meal [...] and compares those with market equivalents.|$|E
50|$|Marketing theorist Alderson in 1950 was {{the first}} to create the concept of postponement. He stated that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> reduce <b>costs</b> from a {{marketing}} point of view by postponing to as late as possible the product differentiation. The theorist believes that the closer the product is to its consumer, the more differentiated it becomes due to changes in unique tastes and demands. In this situation, both the consumer and producer benefit, as there is less risk from uncertainty for a producer leaving the consumer satisfied with a product.|$|R
5000|$|A {{study by}} Oxford Economics for the Law Society of England and Wales has {{suggested}} that Brexit would have a particularly large {{negative impact on the}} UK financial services industry and the law firms that support <b>it,</b> which <b>could</b> <b>cost</b> the law sector as much as £1.7bn per annum by 2030. The Law Society's own report into the possible effects of Brexit notes that leaving the EU would be likely to reduce the role played by the UK as a centre for resolving disputes between foreign firms, whilst a potential loss of [...] "passporting" [...] rights would require financial services firms to transfer departments responsible for regulatory oversight overseas.|$|R
5000|$|Office-based {{physicians}} in particular may see no benefit if they purchase such a product—and may even suffer financial harm. Even though {{the use of}} health <b>IT</b> <b>could</b> generate <b>cost</b> savings for the health system at large that might offset the EMR's cost, many physicians {{might not be able}} to reduce their office expenses or increase their revenue sufficiently to pay for it. For example. the use of health <b>IT</b> <b>could</b> reduce the number of duplicated diagnostic tests. However, that improvement in efficiency would be unlikely to increase the income of many physicians. ...Given the ease at which information can be exchanged between health IT systems, patients whose physicians use them may feel that their privacy is more at risk than if paper records were used.|$|R
2500|$|In her {{capacity}} as Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in 2012, Foster oversaw {{the establishment of}} a green energy scheme, which led to the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. [...] The scheme gave a perverse incentive to use more energy and increase their carbon footprint to those who signed up to it since they could claim £1.60 for every £1 spent on heating with, for example, wood pellets. [...] With no cost controls, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cost</b> the public purse up to £490 million.|$|E
2500|$|Ribbentrop's {{inability}} {{to achieve the}} alliance {{that he had been}} sent to conclude frustrated him, as he feared <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cost</b> him Hitler's favour, and it made him a bitter Anglophobe. As the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, noted in his diary in late 1937, Ribbentrop had come to hate Britain with all the [...] "fury of a woman scorned". Ribbentrop (and Hitler for that matter) never understood that British foreign policy aimed at the appeasement of Germany, not an alliance.|$|E
2500|$|In New York, {{surgical}} {{abortion in}} 1800s carried a death rate of 30% regardless of hospital setting, the AMA launched an anti-abortion campaign {{that resulted in}} abortion becoming the exclusive domain of doctors [...] A paper published in 1870 on the abortion services {{to be found in}} Syracuse, New York, concluded that the method most often practiced there during this time was to flush inside of the uterus with injected water. The article's author, Ely Van de Warkle, claimed this procedure was affordable even to a maid, as a man in town offered it for $10 on an installment plan. Other prices which 19th-century abortion providers are reported to have charged were much more steep. In Britain, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>cost</b> from 10 to 50 guineas, or 5% of the yearly income of a lower middle class household.|$|E

50|$|The cost {{of funds}} is the amount that the {{financial}} institution must pay to borrow the funds that it then lends out. For a commercial bank or deposit taking microfinance institutions this is usually the interest that it gives on deposits. For other institutions <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be the <b>cost</b> of wholesale funds, or a subsidised rate for credit provided by government or donors. Other MFIs might have very cheap funds from charitable contributions.|$|R

5000|$|Often {{the demand}} for [...] "labour market flexibility" [...] is {{combined}} with {{the demand for}} strong immigration controls, to block any movement of labour which would be only a burden for capital accumulation. The term [...] "flexibility" [...] is used because, while capital {{must be able to}} move freely around the globe, the movement of labour must be strictly controlled. If that control does not exist, it is argued, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> mean additional <b>costs</b> to employers and taxpayers.|$|R
2500|$|How {{exactly the}} average {{industrial}} rate of profit will evolve, is either uncertain and unpredictable, {{or it is}} historically contingent; {{it all depends on}} the specific configuration of costs, sales and profit margins obtainable in fluctuating markets with given technologies. This [...] "indeterminacy" [...] criticism revolves around the idea that technological change could have many different and contradictory effects. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> reduce <b>costs,</b> or <b>it</b> <b>could</b> increase unemployment; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be labor saving, or <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be capital saving. Therefore, so the argument goes, it is impossible to infer definitely a theoretical principle that a falling rate of profit must always and inevitably result from an increase in productivity. Perhaps the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall might be true in an abstract model, based on certain assumptions, but in reality no substantive empirical predictions can be made. In addition, profitability itself can be influenced by an enormous array of different factors, going far beyond those which Marx specified. So there are tendencies and counter-tendencies operating simultaneously, and no particular empirical result necessarily follows from them.|$|R
