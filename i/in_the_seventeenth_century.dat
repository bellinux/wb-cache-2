5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, most Russian churches from before the Petrine period had bulbous domes. The largest onion domes were erected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> in the area around Yaroslavl, {{incidentally}} famous for its large onions. Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with Ukrainian Baroque, while cone-shaped domes are typical for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E
5|$|In 1743 the Cameronians {{established}} {{themselves as}} the Reformed Presbyterian Church, remaining largely separate from religious and political debate. Of independent churches from England that were established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> only the Quakers managed to endure in to the eighteenth century. Baptist chapels were re-established {{in the middle of}} the century and, although Scotland initially appeared fertile ground for Methodism, it failed to expand as quickly as elsewhere in the Great Britain and Ireland. A number of minor Scottish sects developed, such as the Bereans, Buchanites, Daleites and Glassites.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{religion}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> {{includes all}} forms of religious organisation and belief in the Kingdom of Scotland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century.</b> During the sixteenth century, Scotland had undergone a Protestant Reformation that created a predominately Calvinist national kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook. James VI favoured doctrinal Calvinism, but also episcopacy. His son Charles I authorised a book of canons that made him head of the Church and enforced {{the use of a}} new liturgy, seen as an English-style Prayer Book. In the resulting rebellion the Scottish bishops were formally expelled from the Church and representatives of various sections of Scottish society drew up the National Covenant. In the subsequent Bishop's Wars the Scottish Covenanters emerged as virtually independent rulers. Charles I's failure led indirectly to the English civil war (1642–46). The Covenanters intervened on the side of Parliament, who were victorious, but became increasingly alienated from the Parliamentary regime. The Scottish defeats in the subsequent Second and Third civil wars, led to English occupation and incorporation in a Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland led by Oliver Cromwell from 1652 and the imposition of religious toleration for Protestants. The Scottish Covenanters divided into parties of Resolutioners and Protesters.|$|E

5|$|Beginning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century,</b> composers began {{creating}} {{works of}} a more emotional style. They felt that a monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice. As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm. Bowed instruments such as the violin, viola, baryton, and various lutes dominated popular music. Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions {{in favor of the}} rising popularity of the guitar. As the prevalence of string orchestras rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few centuries in particular, little is known of the popes and their tombs, and {{available}} information is often contradictory. As with other religious relics, multiple sites claim to house the same tomb. Furthermore, many papal tombs that recycled sarcophagi and other materials from earlier tombs were later recycled for their valuable materials or combined with other monuments. For example, the tomb of Pope Leo I was combined with Leos II, III, and IV circa 855, and then removed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> and placed under his own altar, below Alessandro Algardi's relief, Fuga d'Attila. The style of papal tombs has evolved considerably throughout history, tracking trends {{in the development of}} church monuments. Notable papal tombs have been commissioned from sculptors such as Michelangelo and Gian Lorenzo Bernini.|$|E

By November 2014, it was also confirmed that Garfield would join the cast of Hacksaw Ridge, a war drama about Desmond Doss, a Seventh-Day Adventist Christian and the first conscientious objector in US history to be awarded the Medal of Honor. The film was released in November 2016; Mel Gibson directed and Garfield starred alongside Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington.|$|E

5|$|Pickingill {{was also}} known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was {{believed}} that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that he could do things faster than ordinary human beings, and that he could do an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing that he got his imps—his familiar spirits—to do the job for him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Santa María de la Cabeza castle is {{a colonial}} castle built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> by the Spanish monarchy {{in the center}} of the city of Cumaná, Venezuela. It was built as a {{replacement}} for the San Antonio de la Eminencia castle. Its construction was ordered by Sancho Fernando de Angulo y Sandoval, governor of the Province of Cumaná. The building was designed using the trace italienne style popular during the seventeenth century, with a proportional geometric floor design. Bastions were used as the main defensive elements. The castle housed a garrison of 250 soldiers, and was the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Protestantism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> {{was highly}} {{focused on the}} Bible, which was seen as infallible and {{the major source of}} moral authority. In {{the early part of the}} century the Genevan {{translation}} was commonly used. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the Authorised King James Version and the first Scots version was printed in Scotland in 1633, but the Geneva Bible continued to be employed into the late seventeenth century. Many Bibles were large, illustrated and highly valuable objects. They often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination. Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters. Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{improvements}} {{were made}} to the river in the 1660s, when a new cut with 10 locks was constructed between Stamford and Market Deeping, and two locks were built on the river section below Market Deeping. The canal section was known as the Stamford Canal, and was the longest canal with locks in Britain when it was built. The river provided the final outlet to the sea for land drainage schemes implemented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century,</b> although they were not completely successful until a steam-powered pumping station was built at Pode Hole in 1827. Navigation on the upper river, including the Stamford Canal, had ceased by 1863, but Spalding remained an active port {{until the end of the}} Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Small Jewish {{communities}} {{arose in}} Beverly, Doncaster, Grimsby, Lancaster, Newcastle, and York {{in the wake}} of the Norman Conquest but suffered massacres and pogroms, of which the largest was the York Massacre in 1190.

Manchester also has a long-standing Jewish community: the now-demolished 1857 Manchester Reform Synagogue was the second Reform synagogue in the country, and Greater Manchester has the only eruv in the United Kingdom outside London. In total, there are 84 synagogues in Northern England registered for marriages.|$|E
5|$|The French Revolutionary Wars, {{which began}} in 1792, {{following}} the French Revolution, expanded in January 1793, when the French Republic declared war on the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of Great Britain. This brought the war to the Indian Ocean, where both Britain and the Netherlands maintained lucrative empires. Trade from these empires was menaced by French privateers and warships operating from Île de France, (now Mauritius) but it was protected in the waters off Southern Africa {{by the presence of}} the Dutch Cape Colony. Situated at the Cape of Good Hope, the Cape Colony had been established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> to offer a harbour for shipping traveling between Europe and the East Indies, and in the 1790s it remained the only such station between Rio de Janeiro and British India.|$|E

5|$|The Invasion of the Cape Colony was a British {{military}} expedition {{launched in}} 1795 against the Dutch Cape Colony at the Cape of Good Hope, {{the southern tip}} of Southern Africa. The Dutch colony at the Cape, established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century,</b> was at the time the only viable South African port for ships making the journey from Europe to the European colonies in the East Indies. It therefore held vital strategic importance, although it was otherwise economically insignificant. In the winter of 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, French troops entered the Dutch Republic, which was reformed into the Batavian Republic. In response, Great Britain launched operations against the Dutch Empire to use its facilities against the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|The baroque alto {{recorder}} (blockflöte in German) {{enjoyed a}} period of popularity in Europe as an orchestral instrument <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century,</b> starting with Monteverdi in his opera L'Orfeo. By {{the middle of the}} eighteenth century it had been displaced by the transverse flute. In France the transition was more marked, since cultural life centred on Paris; it was more gradual in Germany, made up of many separate principalities, all with their own court or municipal musicians. The baroque recorder was used in orchestral music in association with death and the supernatural; to express tenderness; in pastoral scenes (as the shepherd's pipe); and to imitate bird song.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Palladian country house <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> separated {{the family of the}} householder from the servants. Previously sharing the hall, and bedding down at a master's feet, or door, servants were now given separate small chambers. Sometimes these were placed on a mezzanine floor, as at Kinross. Servants were less visible, using backstairs that kept them away from members of the family and guests and they fulfilled necessary and sometimes unpleasant tasks. They were also fewer in number, of lower social status and predominately female. A country house could have 10 to 20 servants and large houses had more. A hierarchy of positions developed from the butler and housekeeper to footmen and maids. The sexes were increasingly segregated into their own quarters.|$|E
