In <b>insert</b> <b>editing</b> clips are generally placed tightly after other clips {{when they are}} inserted on the Timeline.

50|$|Since the {{erase head}} erases the old signal {{right before the}} video heads write onto the tape, there is no remnant of the old signal to cause visible {{distortion}} at and after the moment a cut is made, resulting in a clean edit. In addition, the ability of flying erase heads to erase old video off the tape right before recording new video on it allows the ability to perform <b>insert</b> <b>editing,</b> where new footage can be placed within an existing recording with clean cuts {{at the beginning and}} end of the edit.|$|E

50|$|When {{recorded}} to tape, DVCAM uses 15 μm track pitch, {{which is}} 50% wider compared to baseline. Accordingly, tape is transported 50% faster, which reduces recording time by one third compared to regular DV. Because {{of the wider}} track and track pitch, DVCAM {{has the ability to}} do a frame-accurate <b>insert</b> <b>edit,</b> while regular DV may vary by a few frames on each edit compared to the preview.|$|R

50|$|With {{the popular}} {{success of the}} Betacam system as a news {{acquisition}} format, the line was soon extended to include the BVW-15 studio player, and the BVW-40 Studio Edit Recorder. The BVW-15 added Dynamic Tracking, which enabled clear still frame and jog playback, something the BVW-10 could not deliver. The BVW-40 enabled {{for the first time}} editing to a Betacam master, and if set up and wired correctly, true component video editing. It was also possible to do machine to machine editing between a BVW-10/15 and BVW-40 without an edit controller—a single serial cable between the units was all that was required to control the player from the recorder in performing simple assemble and <b>insert</b> <b>editing.</b> Additionally there were two field models introduced, the field recorder BVW-25, and the BVW-21 play only portable field deck.|$|E

50|$|By <b>inserting</b> <b>edits,</b> {{which are}} operationalized {{by the process}} of {{switching}} cameras or transitions in visual or audio media, media producers can elicit orienting responses in attentive viewers. This is accomplished because the mechanism of allocating resources to memory message processing is effective in low, medium, and high edit conditions. Therefore, retrieval is also possible and is measured via recognition testing. However, unlike related editing cues, unrelated cuts do not make it into memory, especially when the cuts are coming at the message processor rapidly. This is important, secondarily, because the entire illusion of a commercially driven media system is premised on the concept that advertising sells products. More importantly, this article's primary concern is to instruct media producers—who are concerned with generating public information, the importance of editing cues, and the deleterious uses of disparate advertising and its ineffectiveness.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{possible}} to create interactive, responsive web applications that allow user-generated contributions. However, the relevant technologies have to be explicitly deployed by {{the authors of the}} web pages. In this work we present the concept of parasitic and symbiotic web applications which can be deployed on arbitrary web pages by means of a proxy-based application platform. Such applications are capable of <b>inserting,</b> <b>editing</b> and deleting the content of web pages. We use an HTTP proxy in order to insert JavaScript code on each web page that is delivered from the web server to the browser. Additionally we use a database server hosting user-generated scripts as well as high-level APIs allowing for implementing customized web applications. Our approach is capable of cooperating with existing web pages by using shared standards (e. g. formatting of the structure on DOM level) and common APIs but also allows for user-generated (parasitic) applications on arbitrary web pages without the need for cooperation by the page owner. ...|$|R

[...] The {{reason to}} edit to the Exif data could {{be as simple as}} to add copyright information, an Exif comment, etc. [...] In some cases, camera vendors also store important information only in proprietary makernote fields, instead of using available Exif standard tags. An example for this is Nikon's ISO speed settings tag.|$|R
40|$|The Ister (Ross and Barison, 2003) —part documentary, travelogue and {{philosophical}} meditation supplementing Heidegger’s meditation on Holderlin’s poem about the Danube—opens and closes with sequences of a duck waddling {{along the bank}} of the river. The intervening film, all 3 hours of it, is in effect a large <b>insert</b> <b>edit</b> between these two sequences, or rather, this single sequence. Seen in this way, and given the significant involvement in and engagement with Bernard Stiegler’s thinking of technology that The Ister evinces (interviews with Stiegler, among others, take up much of the time of this insert), the film invites consideration in terms of his theorisation of cinema as key representational technology of the Twentieth century. His published work on cinema postdates the film but it nonetheless represents an intriguing anticipation of and in some ways response to his both theoretical and polemical approach to cinema. This paper will outline and examine some major tenets of Stiegler’s account of cinema by trying to time the momentary duck’s walk that is the extended duration of The Ister. This will involve an editing project of its own that cuts between analysis of the film, theories and practices of editing and Stiegler’s post-phenomenological account of consciousness...|$|R

BASIC's file and programming commands could be entered in direct mode to load and execute software.

The readers of the bookare supposed to have been literary figures, and it is noted that they were enjoying waka ascultivation.
