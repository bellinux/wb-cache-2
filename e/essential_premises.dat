40|$|Thomas Pogge has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} way in which research and development of essential medicines is incentivized, under existing World Trade Organization rules, should be supplemented with an additional incentivizing mechanism. One might hold a stronger view than the one that Pogge currently holds, namely that patent rights for essential medicines are morally unjustified per se. Throughout this paper, ‘the strong view’ refers to this view. The strong view is one that enjoys considerable support both within and outside the academic community. This paper critically discusses one specific argument in favor of the strong view. This argument is named the ‘Poggean argument’. This denominator is appropriate because a number of the <b>essential</b> <b>premises</b> of the argument are constituted by propositions that Pogge at some point has defended. The Poggean argument is valid, and defenders of the strong view also have some grounds for believing that the argument is sound.

40|$|City {{infrastructures}} {{are essential}} for the sustainable growth {{as well as for}} the economic, social and territorial cohesion. Health, resilience and proper operation of city infrastructures are <b>essential</b> <b>premises</b> to ensure the long-term public safety as well as to ensure economic growth, productivity and environmental sustainability. In this perspective, the sensing system is the heart of all smart city infrastructures because it allows the monitoring of the structures and enables their intelligent adaptation to changing conditions. Moreover, the data collected from several city infrastructures can be elaborated in order to estimate the resilience or the residual fragility after extreme events at different spatial scales (i. e., either for the single city infrastructure or a network of city infrastructures). Realizing the importance of installing large arrays of sensors to achieve these goals, the inherent scalability, flexibility and minimum interference with the construction make wireless technologies an appealing solution for smart city infrastructures. With the deployment of large wireless networks in smart cities, however, replacing the batteries in all devices becomes a problematic task. Conversely, harvesting the energy from alternative sources in the surrounding environment would be greatly beneficial. Examples of these alternative energy sources include thermal, light (solar), wind, mechanical (vibration). Amongst them, harnessing energy from ambient vibrations is probably the most attractive approach for smart bridges, but its feasibility strongly depends on the use of low power technologies as well as on the capability of generating as much energy as possible. Within this framework, the present contribution considers a new class of piezoelectric textiles to scavenge the energy required for the wireless structural monitoring of smart bridges from ambient vibrations. Specifically, the devised energy harvester exploits a power generator built using arrays of electrospun piezoelectric nanofibers. Numerical analyses have been performed using experimental data in order to demonstrate that it provides higher energy levels than a standard scavenger employing a conventional piezoelectric film. Finally, the output energy levels have been discussed to assess the potentialities of such energy harvesting strategy for wireless structural health monitoring of smart bridges...|$|E
40|$|European {{integration}} {{theory is}} currently in a stage of evolution in which {{the validity of the}} traditional theoretical approaches, neofunctionalism and neorealism is increasingly questioned as a consequence of their inability to explain and predict EU developments successfully. The two theories, longtime rivals derived from International Relations (IR) scholarship, are now challenged by an emergent critique grounded in comparative politics theory. Within the IR camp, attempts to bolster the orthodox theories through their synthesis have been unsuccessful. The neofunctionalist-neorealist rivalry continues unproductively despite the advent of a rival paradigm. John Peterson's framework of European Union (EU) decision making, the focal theory of this thesis, seeks to provide a means of marrying IR and comparative political concepts, but requires (and fails to make) a choice between the two IR theories in order to function. The aim of this thesis therefore, is to shed new light on the neofunctionalist-neorealist debate by applying literature to an analysis of the Committee of the Regions. This new EU body affords actors from subnational government their first formal rights in EU policy making, thereby significantly altering the range of actors involved in that process. In order to meet this objective, an original investigation of the Committee was undertaken. It involved research interviews with a series of key actors as well as analysis of the available literature, and concluded that the Committee is having a limited but identifiable impact on the EU policy. The thesis argues that neither neofunctionalism nor neorealism is able to encompass this due to their respective <b>essential</b> <b>premises.</b> It therefore proceeds to propose amendments to the Peterson framework, drawing on its advocacy of a composite model of EU decision making to advance a new framework. The latter harnesses insights obtained from confederal, multi level governance, policy network and new institutionalist theories, and thereby lends support to the burgeoning paradigm shift in favour of comparative politics...|$|E

40|$|Background: Guinea-Bissau {{is one of}} {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s poorest and least {{developed}} countries. Amid poverty, political turmoil and state withdrawal, its health workforce (HW) has been swamped for the last four decades in a deepening crisis of under-resourcing, poor performance and laissez-faire. Methods: The present study aimed at analysing the human resources for health (HRH) situation in Guinea-Bissau in light of the recent literature on distressed health systems, with the objective of contributing to understanding the ways health workers react to protracted turmoil, the resulting distortions and the counter-measures that might be considered. Through document analysis, focus group discussions, 14 semi-structured and 5 in-depth interviews, we explored patterns as they became visible on the ground. Results: Since independence, Guinea-Bissau experienced political events that have reflected on the healthcare arena and on the evolution of its health workforce, such as different coup attempts, waves of diaspora and shifting external assistance. The chronic scarcity of funds and a 2 ̆ 7 stable political instability 2 ̆ 7 have lead to the commercialisation of public health services and to flawed mechanisms for training and deploying health personnel. In absence of any form of governance, health workers have come to own and run the health system. We show that the HRH crisis in Guinea-Bissau can only be understood by looking at its historical evolution and at the wider socio-economic context. There are no quick fixes for the deterioration of HRH in undergoverned states; however, the recognition of the ingrained distortions and an understanding of the forces determining the behaviour of key actors are <b>essential</b> <b>premises</b> for the identification of solutions. Conclusions: Guinea-Bissau 2 ̆ 7 s case study suggests that any policy that does not factor in the limited clout of health authorities over a effectively privatised healthcare arena is doomed from the start. Improving health system governance and quality of training should take precedence over expanding HRH. A bloated and ineffective workforce must be managed through incentives rather than administrative orders, in order to improve skills and productivity against higher remuneration and better working conditions. Donor support might be crucial to trigger positive changes, through realistic and sustained investments...|$|E

A financial audit, which aims at an integrated control, provides conclusions on the entire activity. It fully characterizes the efforts and the results and it can also show faults, deficiencies and frauds in their entirety. The stocks cannot be simply taken into account as they are in a balance sheet and say straight away that the entity has sufficient stocks and it is performant. It is necessary to have a stock audit in order to highlight the accordance between the records and the physical stocks or their movement. The same reasoning also applies to outstanding debts, purchase/selling of real estate, rents of real estates, verification of contractual obligations, declarations regarding and actual payment of taxes to the state budget and the state social security budget etc. The relationship between audit and the benchmarking plan is given precisely by the final result of a performance evaluation and {{in order to get to}} a correct result it is necessary to have correct data and financial indicators. Otherwise, the risk is to evaluate an entity as performant and shortly after that it goes into bankruptcy. Benchmarking is a support instrument for decision-making, a continuous evaluation process, a mean of looking for the most performant methods to do a given activity. It is a system of information that allows an entity to show its development strategy, a technique for determining its competitive advantages and to learn about its products, services and operations by comparing them with the best ones. This instrument is part of the flexible management techniques that are based on learning, on initiative, together with ABM, reengineering, value analysis, process performance tracking. P. Drucker (considered the founder of management principles) said that “there are few things that are as important for a company’s performance as measuring performance is”.

40|$|The Multi-Factor Productivity Measurement Model (MFPMM) {{has long}} been {{implemented}} for assessment of profitability for several well-known corporations such as Phillips Petroleum, General Foods, and so on. The <b>essential</b> <b>premise</b> for the model is {{that the increase in}} profitability is based on the improvement of two areas: productivity and price-recovery. On the other hand, there have been suggestions that the model should be tested for its ability and robustness for budgetability evaluation and measurement for non-profit organizations. The paper presents results and roadblocks with respect to the model's application for budgetability assessment at the Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University. The MFPMM is a dynamic and comprehensive approach to track the performance in the areas of profitability, productivity, and price-recovery. Its focus is on changes in the inputs with respect to the outputs from the system under study. This focus includes the aspects of quantity, price and cost per unit, and the values of revenues and costs. The model's application is designed to be at the organizational level. The <b>essential</b> <b>premise</b> of the model is that profitability is a function of productivity and price-recovery (Sink, 1984). In other words, the ability to generate profit depends on productivity improvement and/or price-recovery. For this model, the term productivity is defined as the relationship of the inputquantity used with respect to the output-quantity generated from the system. On the other hand, price-recovery indicates the relationship between the unit price of outputs and the unit cost of inputs.
