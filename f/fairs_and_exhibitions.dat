25|$|In 1938, for {{the purpose}} of hosting Belgrade Fair, a complex of {{buildings}} was erected next to the already existing community. Spread over 15 thousand square metres, it hosted <b>fairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhibitions</b> designed to show off the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's developing economy. Also this year, the municipality of Belgrade signed a contract with two Danish construction companies, Kampsax and Højgaard & Schultz, to build the new neighbourhood. Engineer Branislav Nešić was entrusted with leading the project. He even continued his involvement on the project after 1941 when the Nazis conquered, occupied, and dissolved the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Because of this, the new communist authorities who came to power after 1945 put Nešić on trial as a collaborator. As the complex never hosted any fairs again and the new Belgrade Fair was built across the river, the area became known as Staro Sajmište ("Old Fairground").|$|E

At maximum extent in the late 19th century it had its own dairy and large numbers of glasshouses and hothouses. At {{the time it was}} the largest nursery in the southern hemisphere. Newman renamed it in 1875 to 'Newman's Model Nursery', probably for promotional purposes. In 1889 plant stocks included over 100,000 orange trees, the same number of mostly muscatel grape vines and 500,000 other fruit trees. It grew 300 varieties of orchids, 350 of chrysanthemums and 700 of roses. The nursery was a frequent prize winner at agricultural <b>fairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>exhibitions.</b> At the Great Exhibition for the Queen’s Jubilee in 1887, the Newmans won two [...] "First Orders of Merit", the exhibition's highest award, and all three [...] "Exhibition Diplomas" [...] on offer.
