500|$|Etty {{felt that}} the work {{illustrated}} the moral that women are not chattels, and were entitled to punish men who violated their rights. He made little effort to explain this to his audience, and thus Candaules appeared morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges. From the moment it was unveiled Candaules was condemned as a cynical mix of a distasteful narrative and pornographic images, and there was near-unanimous consensus that it was inappropriate for public exhibition. The piece remained controversial long after Etty's death; Alexander Gilchrist's overwhelmingly flattering 1855 biography of Etty described it as [...] "almost the only instance among Etty's works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject", while as late as 2011 Sarah Burnage of the University of York wrote of Candaules that [...] "it is perhaps <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise". Candaules was bought by wealthy collector Robert Vernon, {{who was in the}} process of building a major collection of British art and was to become one of Etty's most important customers.|$|E
500|$|From its unveiling, Candaules was {{condemned}} {{by the press}} as a cynical combination of a pornographic picture and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and there was near-unanimous consensus that the picture was inappropriate for public exhibition. The Literary Gazette condemned the work as [...] "against decency and good taste", and Etty as tending in Candaules towards the type of [...] "debasing sensuality" [...] one would expect from a foreigner, not the [...] "purer" [...] British school of painting. The reviewer also criticised {{the theme of the}} painting, saying that [...] "as an academic study, the central figure of this group might be admissible; but, in [...] with the disgraceful story, it deserves to be warmly reprehended". La Belle Assemblée, one of Britain's most influential women's magazines, praised Etty's other exhibits at the Summer Exhibition but refused to review Candaules altogether, saying that [...] "to us the subject is so offensive that we pass it over". Even Alexander Gilchrist, generally one of Etty's strongest supporters, in his 1855 biography of Etty described Candaules as [...] "almost the only instance among Etty's works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject", while Sarah Burnage of the University of York says that [...] "it is perhaps <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise".|$|E

500|$|A few {{critics were}} {{negative}} about Metroid Prime Pinball. The reviewer from the Electronic Gaming Monthly video game magazine found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> pinball while playing the game, {{especially when it}} was in the area between the top and bottom Nintendo DS screens. With a limited selection of game modes, GamePros Rice Burner was disappointed with the game, and concluded that because every game mode features the same tabletops, Metroid Prime Pinball lacked variety, which Game Informers reviewer agreed with, noting that he would have had more fun with the game if he [...] "had access to a little more content". The minigames were criticized by Game Revolution, which claimed that there were too many minigames that were only of average quality. Furthermore, it asked the game's developer, Fuse Games, to spend more time making a great pinball game rather than several minor minigames, requesting [...] "a character-based game that's great at pinball rather than a fence-riding jack of all trades that is master of none". Eurogamer had a different experience, finding that the minigames provided more entertainment than the main game, which they remarked was a [...] "cardinal sin in pinball". They also criticized the tilt feature for being unintuitive and difficult to use. The reviewer for GamesMaster felt that Metroid Prime Pinball was directed more towards Metroid fans than pinball aficionados, calling it a [...] "flashy but insipid" [...] game.|$|E
500|$|... "There's {{a spirit}} there that's just very {{interesting}} to me. She was charming {{and there was something}} about her so intriguing to watch", stated Rhimes in response to Pomepo's portrayal of her character. Executive producer Betsy Beers stated that the writing staff was going to focus on the balance between her vulnerability and her courage, also dealing with changes in the relationship with her friends. Pompeo noted that the uncertainty of her character's fate is what helped her evolve into a more adaptable actor. Rhimes also disclosed that an episode with Ellis Grey's unexpected lucidity and eventual death was in plans {{since the beginning of the}} series. Rhimes described how Pompeo got through the challenge of sending Meredith in the afterlife: [...] "It was an exciting place to take her. Exciting to watch her find her way back." [...] In response to Izzie's arc, Shonda Rhimes discussed the impact Denny Duquette's death will have on her, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Katherine Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the third season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> best in people." ...|$|E
500|$|Heigl {{believes}} that the Grey's Anatomy writers incorporate much of the actors' personalities into their roles, and that Izzie is a [...] "super moral" [...] version of herself. Episode [...] "Bring the Pain", which aired as the fifth episode of the second season, was originally intended {{to be the final}} episode of the first season. Rhimes explained that Izzie's character in this episode came [...] "full circle" [...] from her role in the pilot: [...] "Izzie, so vulnerable and underestimated when we first meet her, is the girl who removes her heart from her sleeve in [...] "Bring the Pain"." [...] Discussing Izzie's personality in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that she is [...] "immensely kind" [...] and patient. When Denny died in the season two episode [...] "Losing My Religion", Rhimes discussed the impact it had on Izzie, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the [...] season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> best in people." [...] In order to demonstrate Izzie's dislike of George's love-interest Callie, Rhimes penned a scene which she deemed one of her favorite moments on the show, in which Callie urinates in front of a stunned Izzie and Meredith. Rhimes assessed that: [...] "I love that Mer and Izzie respond with all the trauma of having viewed [...] a car crash [...] the point is Callie pees and Izzie tortures her a tiny bit about the hand washing and that made me overjoyed because that’s the kind of thing people do." ...|$|E

2500|$|This was {{the first}} matchup between Eastern Washington and BYU. [...] Corby Hodgkiss took a 39-yard {{touchdown}} interception on Eastern Washington's first drive. [...] Bryan Kehl and Quinn Gooch also came away with an interception each. Due to weather and an early defensive touchdown, BYU went away from the pass fairly early. The final quarter {{was one of the}} shortest in recent memory as the refs were very liberal with the clock. This was mostly due to the fact the score was 42-7 and there was a blizzard. The last 10 minutes in the game it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> field yet the cougar faithful cheered loudly until the end.|$|E
2500|$|Santa Maria Maggiore has a {{large area}} of mosaics, {{probably}} of 432-440. They cover the apse, the [...] "triumphal arch" [...] (equivalent to the chancel arch), and sections, originally much larger, of the nave walls, where 27 of an original 42 panels remain from a sequence of scenes from the Old Testament. They are {{right at the top}} of the wall and <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>The</b> apse mosaic is now mostly a Coronation of the Virgin of 1295 by Jacopo Torriti; probably it was originally all composed of the giant foliage scrolls that remain to the upper sides. San Clemente retains a similar apse mosaic, now a reworking of 1299, following the 5th century original. [...] The triumphal arch has the earliest surviving monumental cycle of the Life of the Virgin, dedicatee of the church, and is thought to have been put up by Pope Sixtus III (432-40) to celebrate the Council of Ephesus, where Marian doctrine triumphed over the Nestorians.|$|E
2500|$|Three of {{her more}} notable works {{are from a}} much later period, during the 1970s: [...] She {{constructed}} two collages, and one painting. Her first collage is simply entitled, “The Holocaust”. [...] Jewish life, Jewish culture, and Jewish communities are burned to ash and destroyed. Two hands hold the word “Yiskor”, which means, “Do not forget. Remember.” One can also see the prayer for the dead. It is not <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> various atrocities that occurred – how all life was ruined. The second collage with a large Jewish star in the middle is called, “The Rebirth of Israel”. This collage {{is a testament to}} the elements that pushed towards the climax of returning to the Jewish homeland – the living Bible, the Balfour Declaration, overwhelming support for Israel, the shofar, and winning the 1967 War when Jerusalem was reunited. The third work, a painting, is of a fish in murky waters. For her, this represents the loneliness she felt after the war – a single fish in murky water with no vision of where to turn next.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was born}} in the outer {{district}} of Kath, the capital of the Afrighid dynasty of Khwarezm (now a part of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan) (or Chorasmia). The word Biruni means [...] "from the outer-district" [...] in Persian, and so this became his nisba: [...] "al-Bīrūnī" [...] = [...] "the Birunian". Al-Biruni's relatives also took interest in the studies of science as well, so he grew up in an environment encouraging to his interests. He even had ties to royalty as there are links in his family to the families of prestigious elites. To conduct research, Al-Biruni used different methods to tackle the various fields he studied. Many consider Al-Biruni one of the greatest scientists in history, and especially of Islam because of his discoveries and methodology. He lived during the Islamic Golden Age, which promoted astronomy and encouraged all scholars to work on their research. Al-Biruni spent the first twenty-five years of his life in Khwarezm where he studied Islamic jurisprudence, theology, grammar, mathematics, astronomy, medics, philosophy and also dabbled in the field of physics and most other sciences as well. The Iranian Khwarezmian language, which was the language of Biruni, survived for several centuries after Islam until the Turkification of the region, and so must some at least of the culture and lore of ancient Khwarezm, for it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> commanding figure of Biruni, a repository of so much knowledge, appearing in a cultural vacuum. He was sympathetic to the Afrighids, who were overthrown by the rival dynasty of Ma'munids in 995. He left his homeland for Bukhara, then under the Samanid ruler Mansur II the son of Nuh. There he corresponded with Avicenna and there are extant exchanges of views between these two scholars.|$|E
