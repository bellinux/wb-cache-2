40|$|The United States Army's {{end-to-end}} logistical network {{during times}} of conflict {{is made up of}} two separate networks. One network, managed by the Department of Defense, controls the shipment of supplies from the manufacturing facility to the theater of conflict. The other network managed by the Army, receives these supplies and distributes them to the units within the theater of operation. The synchronization between these two networks impacts the ability of Army logistical planners to efficiently manage the in-theater supply chain. Past operations demonstrate that Army planners have minimal visibility into the supplies entering the theater of operation. This causes units to become dangerously low on supplies, compromising their ability to successfully complete missions. This thesis evaluates the impact this lack of visibility has on the performance of the in-theater supply chain. A logistical planner is developed, modeled after current operating procedures, to maximize a unit's satisfaction, by keeping their supply levels within an acceptable range. Using mixed linear programming the planner determines the amount of each supply and the numbers of vehicles required to transport the supplies. Results confirm that increasing the visibility of <b>incoming</b> <b>supplies</b> improves the performance of the planner. The amount of improvement is dependent on the selection of specific parameters. Additionally, the variation in the amount of supplies entering a theater has an effect on the planner's performance. We conclude that there is an operational benefit in having future knowledge of <b>incoming</b> <b>supplies.</b> by Michael A. Giordano. Thesis (S.

5000|$|For this reason, the UK {{domestic}} water system has traditionally (prior to 1989) employed a [...] "cistern feed" [...] system, where the <b>incoming</b> <b>supply</b> {{is connected to}} the kitchen sink and also a header/storage tank in the attic. Water can dribble into this tank through a 12 mm pipe, plus ball valve, and then supply the house on 22 or 28 mm pipes. Gravity water has a small pressure (say ¼ bar in the bathroom) so needs wide pipes allow higher flows. This is fine for baths and toilets but is frequently inadequate for showers. A booster pump or a hydrophore is installed to increase and maintain pressure. For this reason urban houses are increasingly using mains pressure boilers (combies) which {{take a long time to}} fill a bath but suit the high back pressure of a shower.|$|E
50|$|Advances include use of {{occupancy}} {{sensors to}} turn off lights when spaces are unoccupied, and photosensors to dim or turn off electric lighting when natural light is available. In air conditioning systems, overall equipment efficiencies have increased as energy codes and consumer information have begun to emphasise year-round performance rather than just efficiency ratings at maximum output. Controllers that automatically vary the speeds of fans, pumps, and compressors have radically improved part-load performance of those devices. For space or water heating, electric heat pumps consume roughly half the energy required by electric resistance heaters. Natural gas heating efficiencies have improved through use of condensing furnaces and boilers, in which the water vapor in the flue gas is cooled to liquid form before it is discharged, allowing the heat of condensation to be used. In buildings where high levels of outside air are required, heat exchangers can capture heat from the exhaust air to preheat <b>incoming</b> <b>supply</b> air.|$|E
40|$|Although {{fluorescent}} lamp {{is a very}} efficient lighting device in daily life, still the high harmonic distortion and low power factor cause unnecessary energy consumption. In today’s environment demanding energy efficiency, {{it is important to}} reduce this energy loss by integrating an energy saving controller in the electromagnetic ballast of {{fluorescent lamp}}s. The research presented in this thesis investigates the design and implementation of a new energy saving controller for electromagnetic fluorescent lamp network. The newly developed controller attempts to reduce power losses in both the electromagnetic ballasts and fluorescent lamps by regulating the <b>incoming</b> <b>supply</b> voltage to an optimum level. In addition, the new controller is able to adjust the illuminance level of working environment lightings under either dark or bright condition. Moreover, the function of the new controller is extended with time scheduling control capability, where the switching of lighting systems can be controlled at predetermined times based on occupancy schedule. Both simulation and practical results show that the implemented controller reduces energy consumption by at least 37. 5 %, by reducing the <b>incoming</b> <b>supply</b> voltage by 15 %. In addition, it is desirable to have variable illuminance level control to decrease the energy losses. The experimental results show that the illuminance output level of electromagnetic ballast fluorescent lamps can be decreased by 50 % using the new controller while maintaining unity power factor. Integration of the new energy saving controller into electromagnetic ballast fluorescent lamps impressively outperforms the existing electronic dimmable ballast. This new controller brings great ideas for energy saving in the use of fluorescent lamps...|$|E

The level of reliability of the enterprise’s relationships with counterparties is not only represented in the estimation of an interface security of the enterprise, but also indicates the changes in financial and tax constituent of economic security at machine-building enterprises. Reliability of counterparties enables {{to meet the demands of}} an enterprise (the quality of goods, the volume of deliveries, the level of prices of goods, the level of service, reliability), and on the other hand – to manipulate the level of profit. The subject of the research is the methodological basis of analysis of an interface constituent of economic security at machine-building enterprises. The purpose of the article is the analysis of the estimation of an interface constituent of economic security at machine-building enterprises in the following section: choosing suppliers, management of <b>incoming</b> <b>supplies</b> and identification of risky operations of a taxpayer. For achieving the objectives of the article a complex of the following complementary methods is used: the methods of systems analysis, comparative analysis, causal analysis. It is necessary to estimate an interface constituent of economic security taking into account indicators of controlling <b>incoming</b> <b>supplies</b> of an enterprise and reliability of contractors, which allows to minimize the risk of operations and prevent the enterprises from using typical schemes of tax avoidance, while providing a high level of not only interface, but also financial and tax constituents of economic security at machine-building enterprises.

The simulations are based 011 solving ordinary loadflow cases augmented with dynamic models of the system elements. Motor loads were modelled in detail incorporating their dynamic characteristics. 75 % of the Sasol Three system load constitute induction motors and 25 % is constant impedance and constant current load models.
