5000|$|A jack is {{properly}} {{described as a}} connector {{that is designed to}} be fixed on the surface of a bulkhead or enclosure; [...] "The stationary (more <b>fixed)</b> <b>connector</b> of a mating pair shall be designated J or X" [...] where J means jack. Its counterpart, the [...] "plug," [...] is designed to attach to a wire, cable or removable electrical assembly; [...] "The movable (less <b>fixed)</b> <b>connector</b> of a mating pair shall be designated P" [...] where P means plug. This convention is currently defined in ASME Y14.44-2008 which is the current actively maintained follow on to the withdrawn IEEE 200-1975; IEEE 200-1975 was derived from the long withdrawn MIL-STD-16 which dates back at least to the 1950s which highlights the heritage of this connector naming convention. IEEE 315-1975 works alongside ASME Y14.44-2008 to define J, P and X references.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To combine {{capillary}} electrophoresis (CE) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) to setup CE-IMS coupling technique, an effective sheathless electrospray interface {{was developed in}} the paper. The capillary was rotated on a <b>fixed</b> <b>connector</b> and tapered by manual gridding on the emery paper to obtain tapered capillary tip with the polyimided layer, geometric symmetry. And then the tapered tip was coated with nickel by a simple electrode-less plating procedure to be electrically conductively, so as to generate the electrospray on the tip. Finanlly, three different ways were evaluated for coupling CE with IMS, and get the relatively more effective interface to combine CE and IMS. ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{more common}} IP44 variant {{features}} a spring-loaded hinged cap over the socket. When a plug is inserted, the cap hooks over a lug on the plug and retains it in place. <b>Fixed</b> <b>connectors</b> are usually installed angled downward to prevent water entering.|$|R
50|$|Crimp {{connections}} are used typically to <b>fix</b> <b>connectors,</b> such as BNC connectors, to coaxial cables quickly, {{as an alternative}} to soldered connections. Typically the male connector is crimp-fitted to a cable, and the female attached, often using soldered connections, to a panel on equipment. A special power or manual tool is used to fit the connector. Wire strippers which strip outer jacket, shield braid, and inner insulation to the correct lengths in one operation are used to prepare the cable for crimping.|$|R
40|$|The orthobiom™ non-fusion {{scoliosis}} correction system {{consists of}} two longitudinal rods, polyaxial pedicle screws, mobile and <b>fixed</b> <b>connectors</b> and a cross-connector. The mobile connectors can move along and around the rod, thus allowing length adaptation during growth. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of different features of this novel implant on intervertebral rotations, to calculate the movement of the mobile connectors along the rods for different loading cases and to compare the results with those of a rigid implant construct. A finite element analysis was performed using six versions (M 1 –M 6) of a three-dimensional, nonlinear model of a spine ranging from T 3 to L 2. The models were loaded with pure moments of 7. 5  N m in the three main anatomical planes. First, the validated intact model (M 1) was studied. Then, the orthobiom™ implant system was inserted, bridging the segments between T 4 and L 1 (M 2). The effect of pedicle screws only in every second vertebrae was investigated (M 3). For comparison, three connection variations of screws and rods were investigated: (1) an implant with rigid screws and mobile connectors (M 4), (2) an implant with non-locking polyaxial screws and <b>fixed</b> <b>connectors</b> (M 5) and (3) a completely rigid implant construct (M 6). For flexion, extension and lateral bending, intervertebral rotation was reduced at all implant levels due to the implants. A rigid implant construct (M 6) and an implant with non-locking polyaxial screws and <b>fixed</b> <b>connectors</b> (M 5) led to the strongest reduction of intervertebral rotation. The orthobiom™ non-fusion implant system (M 2, M 3) allowed much more intervertebral rotation than a rigid implant (M 6). Differences in intervertebral rotations were small when polyaxial screws were placed at every second level only (M 3) instead of at every level (M 2). For axial rotation, intervertebral rotation was strongly reduced by a rigid implant construct (M 6) and by an implant with rigid screws and mobile connectors (M 4). For rotation, an implant with non-locking polyaxial screws (M 2, M 3, M 5) led to nearly the same intervertebral rotations as in an intact spine without an implant (M 1). The predicted maximum translation of the mobile connectors along the rod was 4. 2  mm for extension, 3. 1  mm for lateral bending, 1. 6  mm for flexion and 0. 8  mm for axial rotation. The movement of the connectors was highest for those closest to the ends of the rods. With rigid screws, the maximum translation was significantly reduced. This study, conducted under a load-controlled loading protocol, showed that intervertebral rotation was reduced much less by the non-fusion orthobiom™ system than by a rigid implant. The mobile connectors moved considerably along the rod when the spine was bent. It can be expected that the connectors also move along the rod as the adolescent grows, possibly leaving the discs intact until the patient is fully grown...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{junction}} between two solid objects, formed by polymer connectors which {{are supposed to}} freely explore the two grafting surfaces. We focus on the sphere [...] plane and sphere [...] sphere geometries. Because the chains are mobile, {{they are able to}} adapt both the local grafting density and their conformation to the position of the surfaces. Using a scaling approach, we show that, in chemical equilibrium, local grafting density is non-monotonic, and the junction can be divided in two different regions: the center, where connectors are compressed and exert a repulsive force between the objects (high excluded volume interactions) and an external corona, where chains are stretched and attract the two objects. The relative importance of these regions varies for different separations and depends on surface geometries. When an external force is applied, this spatially inhomogeneous constraint exerted by the junction leads to specific force [...] distance profiles, which differ from profiles in the case of <b>fixed</b> <b>connectors.</b> An effective interaction potential and the adhesion energy are computed, showing a strong dependence with the geometry of surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Architecture-based {{software}} development has shown great promise in increasing the flexibility, adaptability, and reusability of software systems. A popular {{definition of a}} software architecture partitions a system into three key elements: components, connectors, and configurations. The connectors in a software architecture {{play an important role}} in determining how flexible and adaptable a software system is. A system with only <b>fixed,</b> static <b>connectors</b> cannot be changed at runtime to allow the addition of new components. Connectors that only connect components in a single language or that run in a single environment can constrain the implementation language and platform of components in a system. As such, building diverse, standards-compliant multilanguage and multi-platform connectors allows software architects to greatly expand the capabilities of their systems. Single-process, single-machine connectors have been shown to provide a measure of dynamic adaptability for software systems. For instance, the developers of ArchStudio, the C 2 design environment, have used the Jav...|$|R

However, on 23 February, CERN stated in a press release that the results were flawed due to an incorrectly connected GPS-synchronization cable. In March 2012, the ICARUS Collaboration reported that the measurement would be reproduced by both OPERA and ICARUS. Further tests, after <b>fixing</b> the GPS <b>connector,</b> showed speed measurements consistent with the speed of light (or slightly below it) from four experiments at Gran Sasso, including OPERA.|$|R

30|$|We {{fabricated}} {{the soft}} actuators (Fig. 5) using the Objet 350 Connex 3 and Agilista printers. It takes around one and half hours for Objet 350 Connex 3 and around two hours for Agilista to print the soft actuators. The connectors and base were printed by Objet 350 Connex 3. After printing, the actuators fabricated by Agilista were put inside water {{to dissolve the}} support materials. For the actuator fabricated by Objet 350 Connex 3, we removed the support material inside the groove at the bottom side (Fig. 2 b) to allow air passing through. Since the support material is granular and not very sticky, we could easily separate the support material from the chamber walls by simply pressing the chambers from external surfaces. Therefore, we did not remove all the support materials from the chambers and the actuator could be inflated. In fact, the actuator responded faster with support material inside the chambers compared to the actuator with empty chambers because less air was required to inflate the chambers. After <b>fixing</b> the <b>connector</b> on the soft actuator, we assembled the gripper. To compare the performance with and without support material, we also fabricated the same actuator by Objet 350 Connex 3 without using support material as shown in Fig. 12 a.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—There are two {{tasks in}} the design of {{linguistic}} fuzzy models for a concrete application: The derivation of the linguistic rule base and the setup of the inference system and the defuzzifica-tion method. Traditionally, the derivation of the linguistic rule base has been considered the most important task, but the use of the ap-propriate aggregation connectors in the inference system and the defuzzification interface can improve the fuzzy system behavior. In this paper, we take in consideration this idea, we propose an evo-lutionary learning method to learn a linguistic rule base and the parametric aggregation connectors of the inference and defuzzifi-cation in a single step. The aim of this methodology is to make pos-sible a high level of positive synergy between the linguistic rule base and the aggregation connectors, improving the accuracy of the lin-guistic Mamdani fuzzy systems. Our proposal has shown good re-sults solving three different applications. We introduce a statistical analysis of results for validating the model behavior on the appli-cations used in the experimental study. We must remark that we present an experimental study with a double intention: a) to com-pare the behavior of the new approach in comparison with those ones that first learn the rule base and then adapt the connectors, and b) to analyze the rule bases obtained with <b>fixed</b> aggregation <b>connectors</b> and with the adaptive ones for showing the changes on the consequent rules, changes on labels that produce a better be-havior of the linguistic model than the classic ones.
