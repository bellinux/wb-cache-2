5|$|Following his release, Melvin {{served as}} an {{adjutant}} {{until the end of}} the war in 1865. That year, he was honorably discharged as a brevet colonel from the Union Army in recognition of his meritorious services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} teeth involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture, clinically and radiographically, and their associated complications so as to indicate if they should be managed conservatively or extracted. Materials and Methods: Data were collected from patients records treated of mandibular fractures. It was included pre and postoperative panoramic radiographs, information such as demographic data, age, and sex, fracture location, mobility, and vitality <b>of</b> teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture, teeth stabilizing the fracture segment. Results: The sample presented 25 patients with teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> mandibular fractures. A total of 16 patients teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture were vital during the 6 th week postoperative follow-up and 9 patients with their teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture were nonvital of which 4 were endodontically treated and the rest 5 patients teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture were extracted as they showed signs of infection. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the presence <b>of</b> teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture is not a limiting factor for the treatment. Despite the risk of complications, tooth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fracture <b>line</b> should be preserved for its merits. A regular clinical and radiological follow-up should be mandatory for at least a period of 1 year...|$|R

5|$|The {{lowering}} {{of the state}} and U.S. flags to half-mast is left at the discretion of local entities, but may be ordered by the Governor of Washington during the observance of memorial days, {{as well as in the}} event of the death of prominent government officials, state employees, public safety servants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> and members of the United States Armed Forces from Washington.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, CAP {{was seen}} as a way to use America's {{civilian}} aviation resources to aid the war effort instead of grounding them. The organization assumed many missions including anti-submarine patrol and warfare, border patrols, and courier services. During World War II CAP's coastal patrol flew 24 million miles, found 173 enemy U-boats, attacked 57, hit 10 and sank two, dropping a total of 83 bombs and depth charges throughout the conflict. By the end of the war, 64 CAP members had lost their lives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|E

50|$|Anthony Haden-Guest, {{the current}} baron's older half-brother, was {{born out of}} wedlock hence was not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> succession. As <b>the</b> current baron's {{children}} are adopted (and likewise not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> succession), <b>the</b> heir presumptive is the present holder's brother, The Hon.

25|$|In 1973, Märtha Louise's {{younger brother}} was born Haakon Magnus. <b>In</b> 1990 <b>the</b> Norwegian {{constitution}} was altered, granting full cognatic primogeniture to the Norwegian throne, {{meaning that the}} eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> succession. This change only affects those born in 1990 or later. Females born between 1971 and 1990 (i.e. only Märtha Louise), were given succession rights, but their brothers would be before them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> succession, meaning that Prince Haakon still took precedence over Märtha Louise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> succession.|$|R
5|$|In 2006, {{the section}} of PA 263 through Hatboro was named the Roy W.

5|$|Mark Kellogg (March 31, 1831 – June 25, 1876) was a {{newspaper}} reporter killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Kellogg rode with George Armstrong Custer during the battle and was evidently {{one of the first}} men killed by the Sioux and Cheyenne. His dispatches were the only press coverage of Custer and his men {{in the days leading up}} to the battle. As {{a newspaper}} stringer whose reports were picked up around the country, Kellogg is considered the first Associated Press correspondent to die <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2008, the United States Department of Defense {{confirmed}} that Michael Monsoor would posthumously receive the Medal of Honor from the President of the United States, George W. Bush. Monsoor's parents, Sally and George Monsoor, received the medal {{on his behalf}} at an April 8, ceremony at the White House held by the President. Monsoor became the fourth American servicemember and second Navy SEAL — each killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> — to receive the United States' highest military award during the War on Terrorism.|$|E
25|$|The law, {{which passed}} with 85.4% {{of the popular}} vote, {{eliminates}} male-preference primogeniture in favour of absolute primogeniture, resulting in sons losing precedence over daughters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> succession. <b>The</b> law did not affect anyone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> succession at <b>the</b> time of the election: the Queen's two children are both male, as is the Crown Prince's eldest child, born in 2005. However, had the referendum not been successful, Prince Vincent, {{who was born in}} 2011, would have been higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> succession than Princess Isabella, born in 2007.|$|R

Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) and Michael Scott (Steve Carell) fire Roy, and Jim, feeling guilty about all of his pranks over the years, tries to show his {{appreciation}} to Dwight for saving him, but each gesture is coolly rejected, as Dwight believes he only acted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> and is undeserving of any special praise.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago Union Stock Yards Fire {{started on}} December 22, 1910, {{destroying}} $400,000 {{of property and}} killing twenty-one firemen, including the Fire Marshal James J. Horan. Fifty engine companies and seven hook and ladder companies fought the fire until it was declared extinguished by Chief Seyferlich on December 23. In 2004, a memorial to all Chicago firefighters who have died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> was erected just behind the Union Stock Yards Gate {{at the intersection of}} Exchange Avenue and Peoria Street.|$|E
5|$|The Memorial {{contains}} an inscribed roll of honour behind a glass panel, containing {{the names of}} approximately 1600 officers killed whilst on duty, {{in the course of}} effecting an arrest or whilst carrying out hazardous duties. The earliest entry is that of an unknown constable killed in 1680. The book is compiled from the approximately 4000 names recorded by the Police Roll of Honour Trust, listing all officers who have died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|E

5|$|Engine Co. 22's {{vehicle was}} blown across Broad Street and {{eventually}} burned. Several {{members of the}} company were injured. Hart was thrown across a rooftop by the explosion but only sustained a minor ankle injury. Augustus L. Cowdrey of Engine Co. 42 and Dave Van Winkle of Engine Co. 5 were throwing water on an adjacent building when a second explosion occurred in the warehouse. The explosion threw Van Winkle into the street. Cowdrey was killed, his body never found. His company continued to search for him amid the rubble for two days. His name appears along with many others on a memorial in Trinity Churchyard in New York for volunteer firefighters who died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee {{were buried}} at Arlington National Cemetery.

President Jimmy Carter awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor posthumously to Grissom on October 1, 1978. President Bill Clinton awarded it to White and Chaffee on December 17, 1997.|$|E
5|$|Lands {{that were}} exempt from taxes were called manya and {{sometimes}} consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without {{any reference to}} the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> were called bilavritti or kalnad. When such a grant was made {{for the maintenance of}} temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E
50|$|As per {{the above}} {{principle}} of succession, {{the sons of}} a Maharaja or <b>of</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> succession cannot succeed to the throne, nor, if those children bear sons, can those sons be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> succession. If <b>the</b> matriline fails, as happened in 1798 and 1924, daughters from another matriline can be adopted to continue the succession.|$|R

5|$|SR 37 is {{also known}} as Randy Bolt Memorial Highway from SR 29 to Skaggs Road (honoring a California Department of Justice agent who was killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> in an {{accident}} along SR 37), and Sears Point Toll Road, which was originally a toll road that ran from SR 121 to Vallejo. SR 37 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but {{is not part of the}} National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 37 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|The Memorial {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} some families of officers killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> regarding the high cost, {{and that the}} roll of honour lists only those officers killed during arrests or {{as a result of}} criminal acts, rather than all officers killed in the line of duty; also that, with the book being behind glass, friends and relatives of the deceased are not able to view the relevant page. Before construction, objections were also raised to the Memorial's construction by the London Historical Parks Group and the local residents' association. Concern was also raised by some Irish republicans that the Memorial includes the names of those RUC officers killed in The Troubles.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{served in}} the United States Marine Corps in the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit from 1977-1983. His final rank was Sergeant (E-5). While serving in the military, he became good friends with fellow Marine Knowle Rohrer. From 1982-1983, Doggett {{played a role in}} the Multi-National Peacekeeping Force for Lebanon development. Doggett retired from the U.S. Marine Corps with commendations after being wounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> After gaining a Juris Doctor and a Master's degree in Public Administration from Syracuse University, Doggett went on to work for the New York Police Department from 1987–1995, {{eventually}} becoming a detective in the Fugitive Division's Warrant section. While he was working for the NYPD, his son, Luke Doggett (played in flashbacks by Jake Fritz), was abducted and murdered. Doggett teamed up with Special Agent Monica Reyes, who was working out of the New York FBI field office at the time, to search for his son's killer. After his son's death, Doggett's marriage to Barbara Doggett (played by Patrick's real-life wife Barbara) ended in divorce.|$|E
