The purpose of this thesis is to describe {{the various forms of}} action of bodies of State Mining Administration (SBS) in terms of the tasks that are imposed on them. The thesis also studies whether each of the forms of SBS's activities is based on the legal basis and fulfils its purpose. In the introduction the thesis deals with the public administration in general. Subsequently addresses various forms of SBS's activities - SBS's regulations, public contracts, <b>internal</b> <b>rules,</b> <b>administrative</b> acts and other legally important forms of SBS's action (opinions, statements, certificates etc.). Perhaps the most problematic subject, which is discussed in the thesis, is the sphere of real interventions of mining inspectors. In conclusion the thesis describes the secondary institutes of administrative law. Administrative supervision and administrative punishment are so important SBS's activities that without them authorities of SBS could not effectually perform tasks fixed by law.

40|$|For years, {{administrative}} {{law has been}} identified as the external review of agency action, primarily by courts. Following in the footsteps of pioneering {{administrative law}} scholars, a growing body of recent scholarship has begun to attend to the role of internal norms and structures in controlling agency action. This Article offers a conceptual and historical account of these internal forces as <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law. <b>Internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law consists of the internal directives, guidance, and organizational forms through which agencies structure the discretion of their employees and presidents control the workings of the executive branch. It is the critical means for shaping the discretion of officials and ensuring accountability within agencies. <b>Internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law’s binding status in structuring agency decision marks it as a form of law. This Article’s project is one of recovery more than invention. The decade-long debate culminating in enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) reflected consistent recognition of internal controls’ contributions to agency accountability. Despite this history, judicial enforcement of the APA undermined <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law and constrained its content by treating the agency’s articulation of internal norms that bind agency actors as triggering external judicial enforcement. At the same time, expanded White House control has made <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law more centralized. Given the importance of <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law to agency accountability and administrative legitimacy, {{the time has come for}} more sustained engagement with the idea of <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law and measures to foster its development...|$|R
