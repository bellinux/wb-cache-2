Instead, the market value, at the <b>exercise</b> <b>date,</b> of the underlier is compared to the strike price, and the difference (if in a favourable direction) is paid by the option seller to {{the owner of the}} option.

40|$|We value American {{options on}} bonds using the Geske-Johnsan (1992).

The proposed computational procdure uses the maxmized value of these options, where the maximization is over all prossible <b>exercise</b> <b>dates.</b> The value of American option is then computed by Richardson extrapolation. The volatility of the underlying default-free bond is modelled using a two-factor model, with a short-term and a long-term interest rate factor, where the short-term interest rate is mean-reverting.

5000|$|Using the Black model, {{the spot}} {{price in the}} formula is not simply the market price of the {{underlying}} bond, rather it is the forward bond price. This forward price is calculated by first subtracting {{the present value of}} the coupons between the valuation date (i.e. today) and the <b>exercise</b> <b>date</b> from today's dirty price, and then forward valuing this amount to the <b>exercise</b> <b>date.</b> (These calculations are performed using today's yield curve, as opposed to the bond's YTM.) The reason that the Black Model may be applied in this way is that the numeraire is then $1 at the time of delivery (whereas under Black-Scholes, the numeraire is $1 today). This allows us to assume that (a) the bond price is a random variable at a future date, but also (b) that the risk-free rate between now and then is constant (since using the forward measure moves the discounting outside of the expectation term http://www.opentradingsystem.com/quantNotes/T_forward_measure_.html). Thus the valuation takes place in a risk-neutral [...] "forward world" [...] where the expected future spot rate is the forward rate, and its standard deviation is the same as in the [...] "physical world"; https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135831/http://finance.eller.arizona.edu/lam/fixi/creditmod/xl/BM1S09.xls see Girsanov's theorem.

50|$|The put buyer either {{believes}} that the underlying asset's price will fall by the <b>exercise</b> <b>date</b> or hopes to protect a long position in it. The advantage of buying a put over short selling the asset is that the option owner's risk of loss {{is limited to the}} premium paid for it, whereas the asset short seller's risk of loss is unlimited (its price can rise greatly, in fact, in theory it can rise infinitely, and such a rise is the short seller's loss). The put buyer's prospect (risk) of gain is limited to the option's strike price less the underlying's spot price and the premium/fee paid for it.|$|E
50|$|A Bermudan {{option is}} an option where the buyer {{has the right to}} {{exercise}} at a set (always discretely spaced) number of times. This is intermediate between a European option - which allows exercise at a single time, namely expiry - and an American option, which allows exercise at any time (the name is jocular: Bermuda, a British overseas territory, is somewhat American and somewhat European—in terms of both option style and physical location—but is nearer to American in terms of both). For example, a typical Bermudian swaption might confer the opportunity to enter into an interest rate swap. The option holder might decide to enter into the swap at the first <b>exercise</b> <b>date</b> (and so enter into, say, a ten-year swap) or defer and have the opportunity to enter in six months time (and so enter a nine-year and six-month swap); see Swaption: Valuation.

Option price {{is a reflection of the}} intrinsic value of the option and any additional amount over intrinsic value. One type of options that are traded is compound options. Compound option model is introduced by Robert Geske in 1979. Compound options are options on options. Compound option put on a put is put option where the underlying assets are another put option.

40|$|One of {{the most}} widely studied {{problems}} in financial mathematics is the pricing of derivative securities, also known as contingent claims. These are securities whose price depend on the value of another underlying security. Financial options are the most common examples of derivative securities. For example, a European call option on a particular underlying security gives the holder the right to purchase this underlying security for a prescribed amount (called the strike price) at a prescribed time in the future, known as the expiration or <b>exercise</b> <b>date.</b> The <b>exercise</b> <b>date</b> is also known as the maturity date of the derivative security. Recall the definitions of European put options as well as American call and put options from Section 1. 3. 2. Options are used mainly for two purposes: speculation and hedging. By speculating on the direction of the future price movements of the underlying security, investors can take (bare) positions in options on this security. Since options are often much cheaper than their underlying security, this gamble results in much larger earnings if the price movements happen in the expected direction compared to what one might earn by taking a similar position in the underlying. Of course, if one guesses the direction of the price movements incorrectly, th...|$|E
