Whether to call homosexuality a crime and treat it as one {{in this day and age}} is questionable" [...] which is interpreted as Sangh's support to decriminalisation of homosexuality.|$|E

'I don't know, sir,' Mark rejoined, {{much more}} sadly than his custom was, though {{from a very}} {{different}} cause than Martin supposed, 'what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> to <b>this,</b> {{in the way of}} thanking you.

5000|$|March 16, 2007 - White House {{spokesman}} Tony Snow {{denies that}} Harriet Miers originally proposed firing all 93 U.S. attorneys: [...] "The most certain thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> at <b>this</b> juncture is that Karl Rove has a recollection of Harriet having raised it with him, and his expressing {{to her that}} {{he thought it was a}} bad idea." ...|$|R

60|$|Never have I had {{so sweet}} a teacher as in Venice. Lucia {{was her first}} name, and her second--but a gentleman forgets second names. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> with all discretion, that she was {{of one of the}} senatorial {{families}} of Venice and that her grandfather had been Doge of the town.|$|E
60|$|Friday, Jan. 8.—A quiet evening. We {{were all}} rather piano {{at the end}} of an episode which had been {{thoroughly}} delightful. When Mr. G. bade me good-night, he said with real feeling, “More sorry than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> is our last evening together at Biarritz.” He is painfully grieved to lose the sound of the sea in his ears.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I hardly know. Though John has {{explained}} {{it again and}} again, I am so bad at such things that I am not sure. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do what <b>I</b> please with it. I am the mistress here. As {{you say that the}} Grange is your house, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> is mine. It is the abode appointed for me, and here I will abide.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{think about}} it, {{but in the}} {{meantime}} what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to <b>this</b> young woman? When I acknowledge that I kissed her, of course I encouraged hopes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here she paused. She too was overcome, and the welling tears {{ran down}} her cheeks. I was myself more moved than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say.</b> <b>This</b> was indeed my Margaret; {{and in the}} {{consciousness}} of her presence my heart leapt. Out of my happiness came boldness, and I dared to say now what I had feared would be impossible: something which would call the attention of Mr. Trelawny to what I imagined was the dual existence of his daughter. As I took Margaret's hand in mine and kissed it, I said to her father: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, don't talk ter me!' {{proceeded}} Mrs. Kemp. 'When I {{was a girl}} I {{give all}} my money ter my mother. She never 'ad ter ask me for nothin'.

That's wot a daughter ought ter do. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for myself, I be'aved by my mother like a gal should. None of your prodigal sons for me! She didn't 'ave ter ask me for three 'apence ter get a drop of beer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I will, if you'll {{make this}} silly child {{go to her}} tea. I s'pose she won't because I scolded her. She's an awful hand to lay {{anything}} up against you. You know you ah', Clementina! But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> doctor: a betta child don't breathe, and I just couldn't live without her. Come he'e, Clementina, I want to kiss you once, before I go to sleep, so's to make su'a you don't bea' malice." [...] She pulled Clementina down to kiss her, and babbled on affectionately and optimistically, till her talk became the voice of her dreams, and then ceased altogether.|$|E
5000|$|As one {{reviewer}} on Amazon.com stated.“All <b>i</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> about <b>this</b> book is WOW. It's absolutely {{amazing how}} the author collected so many poems {{and put them}} in a book and made them so incredibly wonderful to read through. This is for anyone who cares anything about poetry. Get this book and even if you dislike poetry, I'm sure you'll love it after reading this book.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You cannot {{expect that}} I {{should have thought}} it all out during the hearing of the story. There is much to be considered;--very much. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> as between man and man, that no man ever sympathized with another more warmly than I do with you. You had better let me have till Monday to think about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I have {{something}} particular {{to say to}} you--I have a tremendous lot to say to you!" [...] the young man exclaimed. [...] "Far more than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> in <b>this</b> stuck-up, confined room, which is public, too, so that any one may come in from one moment to another. Besides," [...] he added sophistically, [...] "it isn't proper for me to pay a visit of three hours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was my desire, is my desire, {{to share}} with you what I have that is best; and that, I take it, is not the least {{valuable}} of my possessions, such as they are! And why not? You have given to me all that makes life sweet; without which it would be unbearable. That child who came to my wife and me when I was old and she had passed her youth is all in all to us both. Had your strength and courage been for barter in the moments when my child was quivering between life and death, I would have cheerfully purchased them with not half but all! Sir, I should have given my soul! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> now, for gratitude is above all barter; and surely it is allowed to a father to show gratitude for the life of his child!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maude," [...] I said, [...] "I {{have not}} come to plead, to appeal to your pity as against your {{judgment}} and reason. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> much, that if I do not love you, as the word is generally understood, I have a new respect for you, and a new affection, and I think that these will grow. I {{have no doubt that}} there are some fortunate people who achieve the kind of mutual love for which it is human to yearn, whose passion is naturally transmuted into a feeling that may be even finer, but I am inclined to think, even in such a case, that some effort and unselfishness are necessary. At any rate, that has been denied to us, and we can never know it from our own experience. We can only hope {{that there is such a}} thing,--yes, and believe in it and work for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I do {{not offer}} the {{expressions}} of personal gratitude, it is because I feel that such expressions would do injustice {{to the character of}} a support which was given exclusively on the highest and most independent grounds of public principle. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> with perfect truth, as I am addressing one whose person even is unknown to me, and who during my tenure of power studiously avoided every species of intercourse which could throw a suspicion upon the motives by which he was actuated. I should, however, be doing injustice to my own feelings, if I were to retire from Office without one word of acknowledgment; without at least assuring you of the admiration with which I witnessed, during the arduous contest in which I was engaged, the daily exhibition of that extraordinary ability to which I was indebted for a support, the more valuable because it was an impartial and discriminating support.--I have the honor to be, Sir, ...|$|E

5000|$|Gottfried de Purucker was {{an author}} and theosophist who, when asked about {{intermarriage}} in 1930, said [...] "In answering your question very briefly, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> simply <b>this,</b> {{that the time has}} not come when I would willingly suggest intermarriage; but I am in honesty bound to qualify that by saying that the race of the future will be a composite, composed of the many different races on earth today.

40|$|On this study, I examinned {{the causes}} {{from the three}} views that the Mosolem {{rebellion}} (1855 - 1873) in Yunnan broke out as the quarrel between the Chinese and the Mosolem, and that the quarrel gradually developed to the anti-governmenal and revolutionary one at last. Through the study <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> rebellion was not of a special kind, but it possessed such natures as other rebellions have which sprang from the development of political, social and economical conflict after the middle of Chin'g Dynasty...|$|R

"You will please to {{overlook}} the fellow's manners sir," [...] said Fid, very coolly interposing his own hand, and just as deliberately pocketing the offering [...] "but I needn't tell as old a seaman as your Honour, that Guinea is no country to scrape down the seams of a man's behaviour in. Howsomever, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> much for him, which is, that he thanks your Honour just as heartily {{as if you had}} given him twice the sum. Make a bow to his Honour, boy, and do some credit to the company you have kept. And now, since this little difficulty about the money is gotten over, by my presence of mind, with your Honour's leave, I'll just step aloft, and cast loose the lashings of that bit of a tailor on the larboard fore-yard-arm. The chap was never made for a topman as you may see, sir, by the fashion in which he crosses his lower stanchions. That fellow will make a carrick bend with his legs as easily as I could do the same with a yarn of white line!" ...|$|E

I know well enough that I could tell you both of it without any fear of its going further, but {{he asked me to}} promise, and I did so without reservation; moreover, I think that for some reasons it is as well that even you should not know it. As it is, you are aware that I am going to try, and that is all. If I were to tell you how, you might be picturing all sorts of imaginary dangers and worrying yourself over it, so I think that it will be much the best that you should remain in ignorance, at any rate for a time. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> that I shall for the present remain principally in London, and I think that I am more likely to come upon a clew here than elsewhere." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was but a}} lad in them days, but I {{knew what}} was what, {{as well as my}} master; it's not gentlemen only that's up to snough. Law bless us! there was four of us on this stairkes, four as nice young men as you ever see: Mr. Bruffy's young man, Mr. Dawkinses, Mr. Blewitt's, and me--and we knew what our masters was about as well as thay did theirselfs. Frinstance, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for MYSELF, there wasn't a paper in Deuceace's desk or drawer, not a bill, a note, or mimerandum, which I hadn't read as well as he: with Blewitt's it was the same--me and his young man used to read 'em all. There wasn't a bottle of wine that we didn't get a glass out of, nor a pound of sugar that we didn't have some lumps of it. We had keys to all the cubbards--we pipped into all the letters that kem and went---we pored over all the bill-files--we'd the best pickens out of the dinners, the livvers of the fowls, the forcemit balls out of the soup, the egs from the sallit. As for the coals and candles, we left them to the landrisses. You may call this robry--nonsince--it's only our rights--a suvvant's purquizzits is as sacred as the laws of Hengland.|$|E
6000|$|... [At {{this point}} {{a series of}} {{undulations}} that have been apparent as a perplexing complication {{as far back as}} Cavor's description of the silence that fell before the first speaking of the Grand Lunar become confusingly predominant in the record. These undulations are evidently the result of radiations proceeding from a lunar source, and their persistent approximation to the alternating signals of Cavor is curiously suggestive of some operator deliberately seeking to mix them in with his message and render it illegible. At first they are small and regular, so that with a little care and the loss of very few words {{we have been able to}} disentangle Cavor's message; then they become broad and larger, then suddenly they are irregular, with an irregularity that gives the effect at last of some one scribbling through a line of writing. For a long time nothing can be made of this madly zigzagging trace; then quite abruptly the interruption ceases, leaves a few words clear, and then resumes and continues for the rest of the message, completely obliterating whatever Cavor was attempting to transmit. Why, if this is indeed a deliberate intervention, the Selenites should have preferred to let Cavor go on transmitting his message in happy ignorance of their obliteration of its record, when it was clearly quite in their power and much more easy and convenient for them to stop his proceedings at any time, is a problem to which I can contribute nothing. The thing seems to have happened so, and that is all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say.</b> <b>This</b> last rag of his description of the Grand Lunar begins in mid-sentence.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Cathy is a {{sufficiently}} good little scholar, for her nine years; her mother taught her Spanish herself, {{and kept it}} always fresh upon her ear and her tongue by hardly ever speaking with her in any other tongue; her father was her English teacher, and talked with her in that language almost exclusively; French has been her everyday speech {{for more than seven}} years among her playmates here; she has a good working use of governess--German and Italian. It is true that there is always a faint foreign fragrance about her speech, no matter what language she is talking, but it is only just noticeable, nothing more, and is rather a charm than a mar, I think. In the ordinary child-studies Cathy is neither before nor behind the average child of nine, I should say. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for her: in love for her friends and in high-mindedness and good- heartedness she has not many equals, and in my opinion no superiors. And I beg of you, let her have her way with the dumb animals--they are her worship. It is an inheritance from her mother. She knows but little of cruelties and oppressions--keep them from her sight if you can. She would flare up at them and make trouble, in her small but quite decided and resolute way; for she has a character of her own, and lacks neither promptness nor initiative. Sometimes her judgment is at fault, but I think her intentions are always right. Once {{when she was a little}} creature of three or four years she suddenly brought her tiny foot down upon the floor in an apparent outbreak of indignation, then fetched it a backward wipe, and stooped down to examine the result. Her mother said: ...|$|E

Then you came on the scene,--you know what you did,--and the sorrow for her bred an indignation against you, and--well, I worked myself into a nervous condition such as I had never experienced in my life. It was hysteria, I suppose. Anyway, I was not myself." ...|$|R
