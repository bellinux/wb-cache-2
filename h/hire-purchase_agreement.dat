[...] "S" [...] subsequently moved to Bloemfontein and leased a house from the municipality. When [...] "S" [...] fell in arrears of rent, the municipality attached the furniture. Jacksons applied for an order that the furniture was {{not subject to the}} lessor's tacit hypothec; in other words, that the furniture had been brought to the premises without Jacksons's consent.|$|E
50|$|The Advertisements (Hire-Purchase) Act 1957 (1957 c.41) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{regulated}} the way {{in which}} hire-purchase agreements could be advertised. One of the objectives of the Hire-Purchase Act 1938 had been {{to make sure that people}} entering into a <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreement</b> must be signed by the parties and must contain minimal financial information. This did not help, however, in situations where a party may have been misled by advertisements, and putting something in a document is not the same as ensuring somebody has read it before they signed it.|$|E
5000|$|... "Security" [...] {{is defined}} by the Act to mean any form of mortgage, bond, indemnity, {{guarantee}} or other right provided by the debtor as [...] "security" [...] to the consumer credit or <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreement</b> being conducted with the creditor. This covers both [...] "real" [...] securities such as mortgages and personal securities such as bonds. The only requirement is that the security must be given {{at the request of the}} debtor. Any security must be expressed in writing, and in some cases are part of the original hire agreement. This is distinct from previous law, which required a written note of the agreement but allowed the agreement to be conducted orally.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements</b> {{are also}} {{regulated}} by this Act. The provisions {{are very similar}} to those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements,</b> despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale agreements are now treated as sales.|$|R
40|$|The {{delivery}} means {{the transfer of}} possession of property from one person, seller, to another, buyer. The seller delivers goods to buyer if he delivers them physically, if he makes symbolic delivery by delivering document of title to them (e. g. a bill of landing) or other means of control over them (e. g. the keys of warehouse {{in which they are}} stored), or if a third party who is holding them acknowledges that he now holds them for the buyers. In constructive delivery, the seller agrees that he holds the goods on behalf of the buyer his possession of the goods under a <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreement</b> and becomes owner on making the final payment. Goods may be 'pledged' (or 'pawned'). In this case the pledge (pawnee) acquires possession of them. The delivery of possession in the case of pledge, may be physically and symbolic on the same way as transfer of property. The difference is the constitutum possessorium delivery...|$|E
50|$|In September 1973 the {{government}} issued {{a white paper}} titled Reform of the Law on Consumer Credit in which they indicated they were planning to implement {{almost all of the}} Crowther Committee's consumer credit recommendations. The only real differences were an increase in the limits for financial protection from £2,000 to £5,000 (due to the drop in value of money), and stronger protection for hirers under <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{restrictions}} on business caused by the Moneylenders Act 1927, the idea of hire-purchase developed. These were first regulated by the Hire-Purchase and Small Debt (Scotland) Act 1932, which only covered Scotland; England and Wales was first covered by the Hire-Purchase Act 1938, later amended by the Hire-Purchase Act 1954 and the Hire-Purchase Act 1964. The 1965 Act applied to all <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements</b> worth less than £2,000 and when the hirer and buyer was not a corporation.|$|R
50|$|Shipbuilding {{contract}} is a non-maritime contract and {{not within the}} Admiralty jurisdiction because it is insufficiently related to any rights and duties pertaining to sea commerce and/or navigation. The property passes to the buyer when the ship has been completed. To avoid difficulties, provision {{can be made for}} the property to pass in stage in the process of development and construction. It is different from most <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements</b> where the seller has ownership of the property until the payment of the final installment.|$|R
5000|$|Credit brokers {{are people}} {{involved}} in negotiating deals between potential debtors looking for credit and creditors, normally {{in exchange for a}} commission. Under the Act, [...] "credit broker" [...] includes not only mortgage brokers and loan brokers but also car dealers, shops that introduce customers to financial houses for <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements</b> and solicitors who negotiate advances for non-corporate clients. An exception to this is if introductions and negotiations are not made in the individual's capacity as an employee of a business.|$|R
5000|$|His son Stanley Kalms (later Lord Kalms of Edgware), {{who joined}} the {{business}} in 1948 {{at the age of}} 16, capitalised on post-war interest in photography. The company began advertising new and second-hand photographic equipment in the trade, local and national press. This laid the foundations for a mail order division which, coupled with [...] "make your own terms" [...] <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements,</b> eventually resulted in a rapid increase in retailing outlets and in Dixons Photographic Limited becoming the dominant photographic equipment retailer in the United Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1964 {{conventional}} manufacturers {{reduced their}} prices considerably to create another [...] "Washing Machine War". Bloom {{was forced to}} increase advertising costs just as sales began to fall. He was then hit by an 11-week postal strike which prevented coupon returns. Moreover, receipts from Rollss customers <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements</b> had been underwritten by banker Sir Isaac Wolfson, and by mid-1964 Wolfson was funding Bloom with a $28 million loan. Spotting trouble, Wolfson withdrew support. The companys shares were suspended at $0.15 in mid-July 1964 it was placed into voluntary liquidation.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the Consumer Credit Act, {{legislation}} covering {{consumer credit}} was slapdash {{and focused on}} particular areas rather than consumer credit as a whole, such as moneylenders and <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements.</b> Following {{the report of the}} Crowther Committee in 1971 it was decided that wide-ranging reform of consumer credit law was needed, and a bill to do this was introduced to Parliament. Despite its progress through Parliament being disrupted by a general election, the bill passed quickly through the legislative process thanks to support from both the government and the opposition, coming into law on 31 July 1974.|$|R
5000|$|The courts {{can also}} make [...] "time orders" [...] {{providing}} for either payment by the debtor of any sum owed to the creditor, remedying any breach of the agreement by the debtor other than non-payment of money or both. These orders are made {{at the discretion of}} the courts after an application for an enforcement order. The time orders can also cover statutory bailment in the case of hire-order or <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements.</b> If the court feels that the property in dispute or acting as security is at risk of damage or deprecation, they can give protection orders preventing the use of the property. This re-enacts Section 35 of the Hire-Purchase Act 1965, which was repealed by the Consumer Credit Act.|$|R
5000|$|The {{courts have}} long held {{equitable}} jurisdiction {{to set aside}} [...] "harsh and unconscionable bargains", but prior to the Consumer Credit Act this was mainly used in cases where uninformed tradespeople have been selling goods at a loss, and was rarely used in the 20th century. The Moneylenders Act 1900 allowed the court to re-open a moneylending transaction if there was evidence that interest rates were [...] "harsh and unconscionable or otherwise such that a court of equity would give relief", unless the moneylender could justify the rates. It was rarely used {{in the field of}} consumer credit because it was limited to those sorts of consumer transactions covered by the Moneylenders Act, and did not cover <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements</b> or instalment sale agreements or loan transactions from people who were not moneylenders, such as banks.|$|R
500|$|The Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 (...) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{provided}} implied terms in contracts for {{the supply of}} goods and for <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements,</b> and limited the use of exclusion clauses. The result of a joint report by the England and Wales Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, First Report on Exemption Clauses, the Act was granted the Royal Assent on 18 April 1973 and came into force a month later. It met with a mixed reaction from academics, who praised the additional protection it offered {{while at the same}} time questioning whether it was enough; several aspects of the Act's draftsmanship and implementation were also called into question. Much of the Act was repealed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which included many of the 1973 Act's provisions.|$|R
500|$|Christopher Carr, an {{academic}} and practising lawyer, called {{the implementation of}} Section 1 [...] "slightly awkward", suggesting {{that in some ways}} it was more limited than the provisions contained in the Sale of Goods Act 1893 from the seller's point of view. Unlike with the 1893 Act, a seller cannot exclude the provisions, and while the right to sell can be excluded {{it is not clear how}} this might be done. Turpin complimented the section on <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements,</b> although noting some flaws in draftsmanship; he also questioned whether or not the protection given to consumers would be sufficient. Prior to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 was one of the few limitations on clauses in consumer contracts. Most of it was eventually superseded by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which included many of the Act's provisions.|$|R
5000|$|In British law, credit brokers {{are covered}} by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the Consumer Credit Act 2006, which defines a credit broker {{not just as a}} {{mortgage}} or loan broker, but also as a vast range of other intermediary bodies such as car dealers, shops that introduce customers to financial houses for <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements</b> and solicitors who negotiate advances for non-corporate clients. Under the 1974 Act, such businesses require licenses from the Office of Fair Trading. If the business is unlicensed, any agreements made are considered [...] "tainted". In this situation, agreements are only enforceable with a direct order from the Director General of Fair Trading. In addition, the unlicensed trader also commits a criminal offence. This only comes into effect if enforcement is sought through the courts, however; it has been pointed out that agreements can still run their course regardless of the status of the broker. In certain situations under the 2006 Act, credit brokers become agents of the creditor.|$|R
5000|$|To {{partially}} remedy this, {{a private}} member's bill was put forward and {{sponsored by the}} Board of Trade {{with the aim of}} restricting the way <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements</b> could be advertised. The Act came into force on 1 January 1958. The Act was aimed at [...] "incomplete" [...] and misleading advertisements, and covered [...] "every form of visual advertising" [...] such as posters, cinema advertisements and newspapers. It excludes [...] "any form of advertising consisting only of spoken words, with or without other sounds", and thus radio broadcasts were not covered by the Act. If the advertisement fell within the definition given by the Act, certain information must be displayed [...] "in {{such a way as to}} not give undue prominence to any part of it in comparison with any other part". This information is the deposit (either a statement that there is no deposit or a deposit expressed as a sum of money or a percentage or fraction of the total price), the installments (the total number, the amount of each as expressed by a sum of money and the gap between each installment) and a sum that is the overall cash price of the goods.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the {{doctrines of}} the sham and the alter-ego and their {{application to the}} law of trusts in South Africa. Following an initial examination of the historical development of the law of trusts in English law and the principles of equity law, the study focuses on the current legal status of the trust inter vivos in South Africa and the similarities to its English forerunner. The work traces the sham doctrine back to its origins in English law, where the term “sham” was first used in the context of fraud and dishonesty in cases involving matters arising from <b>hire-purchase</b> <b>agreements,</b> and explains how it gradually began to find its place in the law of trusts. During the exploration, the work highlights the cornerstone of the sham doctrine’s development, the Snook test, which in effect became the internationally accepted guideline for any sham trust enquiry. In terms of the alter-ego doctrine, the work highlights the birth of the principle in Australian law and the doctrine’s immediate reception into other common law jurisdictions and its resultant development. The growth, maturity and popularity of the doctrines are key to the thesis and, {{in the course of the}} investigation, the study provides a legal-comparative analysis of the treatment of the doctrines in the context of trusts against that in other common law countries. The study then shifts its focus to South Africa’s interpretation and application of these doctrines in trust law, and reveals the erroneous judicial development in which the courts have in some instances mistakenly replaced the sham doctrine with the company law doctrine of piercing the corporate veil or, in other instances, have erroneously conflated the two trust doctrines. The results highlight a breach of a fundamental rule observed overseas – the “no half way house” rule, which specifically cautions against South Africa’s chosen direction when allowing the lifting of a trust’s veil. The study closes with suggestions as to how the country could reconcile the problems underlined in the thesis by means of law reform, as well as offering practical advice for settlors, trustees and beneficiaries, the core of which is given in the handbook that accompanies this thesis. ...|$|R
