6000|$|... "Then it was lucky, your having me?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>Again</b> {{my mother}} laughed, and again there {{followed}} that graver look upon her childish face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} what I said to you when we parted at Tadmor? I said, 'Be comforted, Amelius, the end is not yet.' And <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> 'You {{will come back to}} me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! {{will you}} also dare to shriek?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> in Noma's voice; [...] "then I must teach you silence." [...] And I tumbled him over {{on to the}} top of her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Surely you're not {{worrying}} yourself about that?' <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> laughed <b>again.</b> Very jovial and debonair I {{was that}} winter morning.|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it <b>again,</b> and he <b>said</b> his <b>again,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> mine <b>again,</b> {{and then}} he did, and then I did, {{and then he}} did, and we kept on doing it, and doing it, and I never had such a good time, {{and he said the}} same. In my opinion there isn't {{anything}} that is as killing as one of those dear old ripe pensioners {{if you know how to}} snatch it out in a kind of a fresh sort of original way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then let us both avoid it," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{reaching}} <b>again</b> for my paper. [...] "We shall stop at Ipswich in an hour. I {{will change}} carriages there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "I {{thought that}} rule {{applied only to}} the names of kings, but of course I am but an ignorant white man who may well be mistaken on such matters of your Zulu customs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good God!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "the {{old fool}} {{must have been}} drunk. When did you say the attack was to be--at dawn?" [...] and I glanced at the stars, adding, [...] "Why, that will be within less than an hour, and the Baas Marais is away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{think of}} it. There is no {{possible}} occasion for it," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "If {{there is anything}} to pay, I'll ask you for it when the journey is over. That forty shillings you must fork out. It's a law of the Medes and Persians." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, {{it is time}} to finish,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>again</b> <b>I</b> {{lifted my}} sword, only to let it fall, for {{suddenly}} his brain gave way and de Garcia went mad before my eyes! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{greatest}} wish is {{that there}} will be more writing from my people, and that our children will read it. <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>again</b> and again that our history would be different if it had been expressed by us." ...|$|R
60|$|But she {{had turned}} aside her sallow, long face, and did not hear what <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> Suddenly <b>again</b> she looked at me. She was searching. And {{at the same time}} she smiled at me, and her eyes looked softly, darkly, with {{infinite}} trustful humility into mine. I was being cajoled.|$|R
60|$|While gazing {{through the}} loophole, my mother {{remaining}} {{on her knees}} praying fervently, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> and again to myself that Simon Kenton could do nothing single-handed against that mob of murdering brutes. In fact, now he was outside the house all the chances were against my ever seeing him again. It was hardly {{within the range of}} probability he could save his own life if he made even the slightest effort to rescue the prisoners.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{gave her}} certain directions; and going outside, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> {{that he ought}} to be in bed upstairs. She wrung her hands. 'I couldn't. I couldn't. He keeps on saying something--I don't know what.' With the memory of all the talk against the man that had been dinned into her ears, I looked at her narrowly. I looked into her {{shortsighted}} eyes, at her dumb eyes that once in her life had seen an enticing shape, but seemed, staring at me, to see nothing at all now. But I saw she was uneasy.|$|E
6000|$|But after a {{few years}} (says Antony) it befell one day that he bowed himself in prayer, and {{remained}} so three days--that is, the Friday, the Sabbath, and the Lord's day. Then I was terrified, and went up to him, and stood before his face, and said to him, [...] "Master, arise: bless us; for the people have been waiting three days and three nights for a blessing from thee." [...] And he answered me not; and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> to him: [...] "Wherefore dost thou grieve me, lord? or in what have I offended? I beseech thee, put out thy hand to me; or, perchance, thou hast already departed from us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will {{certainly}} happen to you," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> yawning <b>again,</b> [...] "if you insist upon my taking a week's trek {{to visit the}} Black One, or interfere with me in any way now or afterwards," [...] and I lifted my hand towards the talisman, looking him steadily in the face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, gentlemen," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{sitting down}} <b>again,</b> [...] "I will go, and by your leave I {{will tell you}} why, and on what conditions. First for the terms which I ask.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, madam," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>again</b> {{addressing}} myself pointedly to Miss Flouncer, [...] "would {{you like}} to hear a few interesting facts {{in reference to the}} objects of this Society?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I put in at that word, {{and said}} it was a vast deal to give away. [...] "Why," [...] says I, [...] "it was a portion for a servant." [...] "O madam!" [...] says she, [...] "it was nothing to what she got afterwards; we that were {{servants}} hated her heartily for it; that is to say, we wished it had been our lot in her stead." [...] Then <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "Why, it was enough to get her a good husband, and settle her for the world, if she had sense to manage it." [...] "So it might, to be sure, madam," [...] says she, [...] "for we were told she laid up above Â£500; but, I suppose, Mrs. Amy was too sensible that her character would require a good portion to put her off." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, as {{we walked}} slowly and unmolested through the encampment, seeing on every hand signs and tokens of {{preparations}} for flight {{on the part of}} the enemy, was I yet further convinced that we need not fret ourselves regarding the future save so far as Silver Heels and Saul's mare were concerned. I yet had hope that it might be possible to regain possession of our pets. As a matter of course there was no idea in my mind that we would be able to do it before Cornwallis's army had begun to retreat; but <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>again</b> and again to myself that if we lads carried the news of the evacuation speedily to our people, then would they set off in such hot pursuit that there were many chances I might have Silver Heels with me but little the worse for her experience in the British army.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dorothy," [...] I cried; [...] "Dorothy, I stayed because I love you. There, <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> it <b>again,</b> {{what has}} not passed my lips {{since we were}} children. What has been in my heart ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you've {{whipped the}} wrong man, Bill," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Think <b>again!</b> Have {{you had any}} quarrel lately?--run against any {{newspaper}} man?" [...] The recollection had flashed upon me that Lacy Bassett had lately returned from a visit to Stockton.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{happened}} to you?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>again,</b> for I {{wanted to know}} what she thought about my sudden appearance. It took some little time for her to get ready to answer, and then she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Down, Pilot!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>again</b> <b>said.</b> He {{checked the}} water {{on its way to}} his lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down. [...] "This is you, Mary, is it not?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{to myself}} <b>again</b> {{and again that}} if the red-coated gentry held him in their power a prisoner, he would be treated with some fair consideration, for these {{soldiers}} of the king were not red Indians, and would not proceed to extremities at least until after the semblance of a military trial.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{to myself}} <b>again</b> and again, that if General Herkimer really needed such {{services}} {{as we could}} render, {{it would have been}} better had we remained with him, rather than spend so many days and be forced to such severe labor as was required for the march to Cherry Valley and back.|$|R
6000|$|A day or {{two later}} the man {{came back and said}} he had kept one of the best of the five for him--he had got rid of all the others. [...] "You can't do better," [...] he persisted. [...] "No," [...] said Caleb, [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> say <b>again.</b> I won't have 'n, I've no money to buy a dog." ...|$|R
6000|$|I gave up by going, decidedly, to the smoking-room, {{where several}} men had {{gathered}} and where Obert, a little apart from them, was in charmed communion with the bookshelves. They are wonderful, everywhere, at Newmarch, the bookshelves, but {{he put a}} volume back as he saw me come in, and a moment later, when we were seated, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to him <b>again,</b> as a recall of our previous passage, [...] "Then you could tell what I was talking about!" [...] And I added, to complete my reference, [...] "Since you thought Mrs. Server was the person whom, when I stopped you, I was sorry to learn from you I had missed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely all. The moment I {{saw your}} card, I thought to myself, in a breath: 'Ford, Cumberledge; what do I know {{of those two}} names? I have some link between them. Ah, yes; found Mrs. Cumberledge, wife of Colonel Thomas Cumberledge, of the 7th Bengals, was a Miss Ford, {{daughter}} of a Mr. Ford, of Bangor.' That came {{to me like a}} lightning-gleam. Then <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to myself <b>again,</b> 'Dr. Hubert Ford Cumberledge must be their son.' So there you have 'the train of reasoning.' Women CAN reason--sometimes. I had to think twice, though, before I could recall the exact words of the Times notice." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{things that}} Picasso and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{to one another}} during those years will never be <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> {{and even if they}} were, no one would {{understand}} them anymore. It was like being roped together on a mountain. Georges Braque ...|$|R
6000|$|... Â§ XXXV. Finally, {{as regards}} {{quantity}} of ornament <b>I</b> have already <b>said,</b> <b>again</b> and again, you cannot {{have too much}} if it be good; that is, if it be thoroughly united and harmonised by the laws hitherto insisted upon. But you may easily have too much {{if you have more}} than you have sense to manage. For with every added order of ornament increases the difficulty of discipline. It is exactly the same as in war: you cannot, as an abstract law, have too many soldiers, but you may easily have more than the country is able to sustain, or than your generalship is competent to command. And every regiment which you cannot manage will, on the day of battle, be in your way, and encumber the movements it is not in disposition to sustain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{stop your}} rubbish," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> and fell <b>again</b> {{into the depths}} of my uncomfortable reflections. After this I, too, went to sleep. When I woke it was past midday and the wind was falling. However, it held while we ate some food we had brought with us, after which it died away altogether, and the Pongo people took to their paddles. At my {{suggestion}} we offered to help them, for {{it occurred to me that}} we might just as well learn how to manage these paddles. So six were given to us, and Komba, who now I noted was beginning to speak in a somewhat imperious tone, instructed us in their use. At first we made but a poor hand at the business, but three or four hours' steady practice taught us a good deal. Indeed, before our journey's end, I felt that we should be quite capable of managing a canoe, if ever it became necessary for us to do so.|$|R
6000|$|Herbert <b>said</b> {{from behind}} (<b>again</b> poking me), [...] "Massive and concrete." [...] So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> boldly, as if I had {{originated}} it, and must beg to insist upon it, [...] "Massive and concrete." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have yet}} to trace the causes of this (which {{will be a long}} task, {{belonging}} to art questions, not to mythological ones); but it is, I believe, much connected with the brooding of the shadow of death over the Greeks without any clear hope of immortality. The restriction of the color on their vases to dim red (or yellow) with black and white, is greatly connected with their sepulchral use, and with all the melancholy of Greek tragic thought; and in this gloom the failure of color-perception is partly noble, partly base: noble, in its earnestness, which raises the design of Greek vases as far above the designing of mere colorist nations like the Chinese, as men's thoughts are above children's; and yet it is partly base and earthly, and inherently defective in one human faculty; and I believe it was one cause of the perishing of their art so swiftly, for indeed there is no decline so sudden, or down to such utter loss and ludicrous depravity, as the fall of Greek design on its vases from the fifth to the third century B.C. On the other hand, the pure colored-gift, when employed for pleasure only, degrades in another direction; so that among the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese, all intellectual progress in art has been for ages rendered impossible by the prevalence of that faculty; and yet it is, as <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>again</b> and again, the spiritual power of art; and its true brightness is the essential characteristic of all healthy schools. ** 'eremnen Aigida pasi'.--Il. iv. 166.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She recovered, rested {{there for}} an hour, and first sending off her {{companion}} peremptorily (which was another odd thing), {{she left the}} house, offering the landlord all the money {{she had to say}} nothing about the circumstance. He has never seen her since, according to his own account. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to him <b>again</b> and again, [...] "Did you find any more particulars afterwards?" [...] "Not a syllable," [...] he said. O, he should never hear any more of that! too many years had passed since it happened. [...] "At any rate, you found out her surname?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Well, well, that's my secret," [...] he went on. [...] "Perhaps I should never have been {{in this part of the}} world if it hadn't been for that. I failed as a publican, you know." [...] I imagine the situation of gateman was given him and his debts paid off as a bribe to silence; but I can't say. [...] "Ah, yes!" [...] he said, with a long breath. [...] "I have never heard that name mentioned since that time till to-night, and then there instantly rose to my eyes the vision of that young lady lying in a fainting fit." [...] He then stopped talking and fell asleep. Telling the story must have relieved him as it did the Ancient Mariner, for he did not move a muscle or make another sound for the remainder of the night. Now isn't that an odd story?' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{we shall}} meet <b>again,</b> <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> hastily, as I saw him hurrying towards the door.|$|R
