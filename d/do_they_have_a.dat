The test publishers {{do not have a}} uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into categories of the same size or with the same boundary scores.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} 19th-century {{method of}} identifying a composer's works was for publishers to assign {{some sort of}} consecutive Opus number to the works as they were published. [...] This method is not entirely satisfactory to anyone. [...] Musicians and the listening public have no reliable way to distinguish different works with similar characteristics. [...] Musicologists cannot reliably identify unpublished works, nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reliable indication from the opus number of the actual composition date(s). [...] For example, the Octet, written from 17921793 is Opus 103, while Opus 102 and Opus 104 were written in 1815 and 1817 respectively. Some opus numbers comprise multiple pieces; 172 works are divided among 138 opus numbers.|$|E

For example, in a 2001 case, doctors at a French public hospital who gave blood products to a patient with an acute renal insufficiency were found not to have committed a mistake of a nature to involve the responsibility of the State. The Council stated that [...] "there does not exist, for the doctor, an abstract and unalterable hierarchy between the obligation to treat the patient, and that to respect the will of the patient," [...] concluding that faced with a decision to treat patients against their will, doctors do not have a legally predefined obligation to treat the patient, nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> legally predefined obligation to abide by their wishes. One year later, after the adoption of the Kouchner Law on patients' rights and quality of the health system, the Council of State recalled that not respecting the patient's wishes violates his individual freedom, but the doctor did not commit a fault if under extreme conditions he performs an intervention “necessary and proportionate to its state” {{in order to try to}} save the patient's life.|$|E
