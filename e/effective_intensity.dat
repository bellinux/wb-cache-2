50|$|Today, certain modern xenon flash {{units have}} the ability to produce a longer-duration flash to permit flash {{synchronization}} at shorter shutter speeds, therefore called high-speed sync (HSS). Instead of delivering one burst of light, the units deliver several smaller bursts over a time interval as short as 1/125 of a second. This allows light to be delivered to the entire area of the film or image sensor even though the shutter is never fully open at any moment, similar to FP sync. The downside is that the flash is of less <b>effective</b> <b>intensity</b> since the individual bursts are lower powered than the normal capability of the flash unit. Only certain camera and flash combinations support this feature, and the camera-flash pairings are almost exclusively from the same manufacturer, the first being the Olympus OM-4 with the F280 flashgun.

40|$|A {{simple method}} of {{evaluating}} the crack propagation rate of a specimen with sharp notch {{by using an}} <b>effective</b> stress <b>intensity</b> factor range was proposed. This study also had a special purpose of evaluating the crack propagation after overload. A 6 mm long U-shaped notch was cut in the center section of the specimen. The notch root raidus ρ was chosen as 0. 1 mm and 1 mm. These were regarded as center notched specimens. The crack propagation behavior of these specimens was compared with a center cracked specimen. Push-pull fatigue tests were carried out under stress ratios R= 0, - 1, and - 1. 5. After overload, retardation of crack growth was observed under R= 0 and - 1, {{in the cases of}} the notched specimen and center cracked specimen. However, where R=- 1. 5, the acceleration of crack growth was observed after overload in both types of specimens. Even though crack growth was accelerated or decelerated, the rate was able to be evaluated by <b>effective</b> stress <b>intensity</b> factor range.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a computational procedure for modeling SCC (stress corrosion cracking) crack growth for three-dimensional cracks in structural components. A structural component without a crack is modeled by the {{finite element method}} (FEM) and a crack is simulated with the symmetric Galerkin boundary element method (SGBEM).

40|$|Abstract A {{method was}} {{proposed}} {{for measuring the}} <b>effective</b> stress <b>intensity</b> factor ranges of Mode II fatigue crack growth by using the hysteresis loop for a specimen's surface strain. Many cases of rolling contact fatigue failure, {{such as those that}} occur in railway rails, bearings and gears are due to repeated high shear loads. In order to prevent such fatigue failures, the resistance of a material to repeated high shear loads must be determined. The fatigue crack growth characteristics are dependent on the Mode II stress intensity factor range. However, conventionally measured Mode II fatigue crack growth characteristics vary according to the measurement methods. Therefore, the authors improved the experimental measurement method proposed by Murakami, and proposed a way to measure the Mode II <b>effective</b> stress <b>intensity</b> factor range. Improvements to the jigs and specimen were made based on the ideal mechanical model of the experimental method. Furthermore, to measure the Mode II fatigue crack growth behavior, strain gauges were applied to the specimen and the hysteresis loop of the strain was measured with high accuracy by using a newly developed subtraction circuit...|$|R

Photoreceptor response amplitude and termination (transition between full repolarization and prolonged depolarizing afterpotential, PDA) were related to visual pigment conversions and arrestin concentration. The data were implemented in a kinetic model of the rhodopsin-arrestin cycle, allowing us to estimate the active metarhodopsin concentration {{as a function of}} <b>effective</b> light <b>intensity</b> and arrestin concentration. Arrestin reduction in the mutant modestly increased the light sensitivity and decreased the photoreceptor dynamic range.

We developed a steady-state stochastic model to interpret the dependence of the PDA on <b>effective</b> light <b>intensity</b> and arrestin content and to help deduce the arrestin to rhodopsin ratio from the sensitivity and PDA data. The feasibility of different experimental methods for the estimation of arrestin content from ERG and PDA is discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe fretting-fatigue {{crack arrest}} {{condition}} is formalized as the condition {{for which a}} crack nucleates but stops propagating and so the sample never fails. Usually this domain is small as the fatigue loading greatly promotes the crack propagation. The aim of this research work is to investigate the crack arrest condition for severe plastic condition (maximal pressure is 2. 5 {{times greater than the}} yield stress) and high fatigue stress ratio (R= 0. 94) thus for not much propagating conditions. A low alloyed industrial steel flat specimen (IS) fretted against a 35 NCD 16 steel cylinder pad was studied in order to identify the crack arrest condition for various fretting loadings (shear amplitude). An original experimental monitoring has been implemented on a fretting-fatigue test device to observe online the crack arrest using the potential drop technic. To rationalize these results, a fretting-fatigue map concept which consists to plot the crack arrest boundary {{as a function of the}} applied maximum fatigue stress and the fretting tangential force amplitude is applied. A 2 D plain strain FEM modelling has been implemented to simulate the complex contact stressing including the contact plasticity. This plastic deformation promotes a significant extension of the contact and a proportional reduction of contact pressure and cyclic shear stresses. One consequence is that for a given contact and fatigue loading, this plastic accommodation of the interface tends to reduce the effective stress imposed to the material. The crack arrest boundary was formalized applying a pure mode I <b>effective</b> <b>intensity</b> stress range approximation. It is shown that combining elastic-plastic FEM modelling, weight function and an adequate estimation of the <b>effective</b> <b>intensity</b> stress range, it is possible to predictwith accuracy the fretting fatigue crack arrest boundary...|$|E

A {{very small number of}} cycles of overstress applied intermittently during {{a very large number of}} cycies of understress below threshold caused significant acceleration, of about one hundred times, in crack growth rate as compared to the case of steady cyclic stress in the cases of moist air, dry air and nitrogen. In the region of low understress, the acceleration in moist air was appreciably less than that in dry air and nitrogen due to oxide-induced crack closure. The acceleration in vacuum was smaller than that in other environments over all understress levels, possibly because of reweiding. There was no effect of an overstress sequence on the acceleration.
