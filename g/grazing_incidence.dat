5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at <b>grazing</b> <b>incidence.</b> The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E

50|$|Unlike visible light, X-rays {{cannot be}} focused at normal incidence, since the X-ray beams would be {{absorbed in the}} mirror. Instead, IXO's mirrors, like all prior X-ray telescopes, will use <b>grazing</b> <b>incidences,</b> {{scattering}} at a very shallow angle. As a result, X-ray telescopes consist of nested cylindrical shells, with their inner surface being the reflecting surface. However, as {{the goal is to}} collect as many photons as possible, IXO will have a bigger than 3m diameter mirror.|$|R
40|$|Stratified {{media and}} {{especially}} Langmuir-Blodgett films {{give rise to}} interesting features of the X-ray reflectivity curves at <b>grazing</b> <b>incidences.</b> We have studied the projection of the electronic density along the normal to the layers of differently sequenced L. B. Films of behenic acid, in order to correlate their structure with the particular interference patterns occurring around (00 l) Bragg peaks. Using both optical formalism and kinematical theory for X-rays, we have analysed these various interference phenomena. Moreover, we found a new untilted structure of these systems...|$|R
25|$|Atomic mirrors are devices which reflect matter waves. Usually, atomic mirrors work at <b>grazing</b> <b>incidence.</b> Such mirrors can be {{used for}} atomic {{interferometry}} and atomic holography.

25|$|The first X-ray {{telescope}} in astronomy {{was used to}} observe the Sun. The first X-ray picture (taken with a <b>grazing</b> <b>incidence</b> telescope) of the Sun was taken in 1963, by a rocket-borne telescope. On April 19, 1960 the very first X-ray image of the sun was taken using a pinhole camera on an Aerobee-Hi rocket.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that this}} {{principle}} only holds strictly for light reflected at normal incidence. For instance, right circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at <b>grazing</b> <b>incidence</b> (an angle beyond the Brewster angle) will still emerge as right handed, but elliptically, polarized. Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its ellipticity changed as well. Such situations may {{be solved by}} decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, commonly denoted p and s respectively. The reflected components in the p and s linear polarizations are found by applying the Fresnel coefficients of reflection, which are generally different for those two linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, {{where there is no}} distinction between p and s, are the Fresnel coefficients for the two components identical, leading to the above property.|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{discrete}} ordinates method for solving the radiative transfer equation in nonrotationally invariant scattering media {{has been applied}} to the lead-canopy problem, and results are presented on the cross sections and the reflection functions. The method is based on a unique implementation of the Galerkin integral law formulation of the transport equation. For both near-normal and <b>grazing</b> <b>incidences,</b> the transfer functions of leaf canopies are found to be strongly anisotropic, with relatively more scattered flux in the vertical directions. It is suggested that the assumption of isotropic scattering in leaf canopies is not valid...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that many {{peculiar}} nonlinear vibration problems in impacting systems are caused by <b>grazing</b> <b>incidences.</b> Such bifurcation phenomena are normally investigated through the Poincare map. The discrete-time map of a simple impact oscillator was derived by Nordmark, which showed {{that there should be}} a square-root singularity in the Jacobian matrix close to the grazing condition. In this paper we show that the square root singularity will be expressed only in the trace of the Jacobian matrix, while the determinant remains invariant across the grazing condition.

2500|$|For ABI the {{stability}} {{requirements of the}} crystals is less strict than for crystal interferometry but the setup still requires a perfect analyzer crystal {{that needs to be}} very precisely controlled in angle {{and the size of the}} analyzer crystal and the constraint that the beam needs to be parallel also limits the field of view. [...] Additionally as in crystal interferometry a general limitation for the spatial resolution of this method is given by the blurring in the analyzer crystal due to dynamic diffraction effects, but can be improved by using <b>grazing</b> <b>incidence</b> diffraction for the crystal.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the first}} place, {{it can be}} {{compared}} with the reality. Although a detailed examination of the question shows that the curvature of light rays required by the general theory of relativity is only exceedingly small for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its estimated magnitude for light rays passing the sun at <b>grazing</b> <b>incidence</b> is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to manifest itself in the following way. As seen from the earth, certain fixed stars appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus capable of observation during a total eclipse of the sun. At such times, these stars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the sun by an amount indicated above, as compared with their apparent position in the sky when the sun is situated at another part of the heavens. The examination of the correctness or otherwise of this deduction is a problem of the greatest importance, the early solution of which is to be expected of astronomers.[2]* ...|$|E

40|$|Ion {{collisions}} with beam-pipe {{walls are}} {{a significant source of}} secondary electron clouds and desorbed neutral gasses in particle accelerators. Ions may reflect from beam-pipe walls and undergo further collisions downstream. These effects can cause beam degradation and are expected to be problematic in the design of heavy ion accelerators. The well-known SRIM code provides physically based Monte Carlo simulations of ion-wall collisions. However, it is difficult to interface SRIM with high-performance simulation codes. We present details on the development of a package of Python modules that integrate the simulation of ion-wall interactions at <b>grazing</b> <b>incidences</b> with the high-performance particle-in-cell and electron cloud codes WARP and POSINST.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a {{theoretical}} study of the angular dependence of phase-conjugate emission via resonant degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) in Doppler-broadened gas media. The nonlinear optical polarization is calculated through {{an expansion of the}} atomic density matrix up to the third order in the incident fields. One finds that, when the incident frequency is resonant for a single-photon transition, both strength and lineshape of the phase-conjugate emission strongly depend on the angle 0 between standing pump wave and probe wave. The emission intensity, maximum at <b>grazing</b> <b>incidences,</b> decreases rapidly by several orders of magnitude when 0 increases. Simultaneously the emission linewidth increases from homogeneous to Doppler width. Similar effects are predicted for nearly-degenerate FWM (different pump and probe frequencies). In particular, one shows that the bandwidth of the equivalent optical reflection filter undergoes a Doppler-broadening linearly increasing with sin θ. On the opposite, none of the above effects is predicted in two-photon-resonant FWM which does not exhibit any angular dependence...|$|R

5000|$|When {{dealing with}} a beam that is nearly {{parallel}} to a surface, it is sometimes more useful {{to refer to the}} angle between the beam and the surface, rather than that between the beam and the surface normal, in other words 90° minus the angle of incidence.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a fast algorithm, applicable throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, for the numerical solution of problems of scattering by two-dimensional periodic surfaces. In particular, the proposed algorithm remains highly accurate and efficient for challenging configurations including randomly rough surfaces, deep corrugations, large periods, near <b>grazing</b> <b>incidences,</b> and, importantly, Wood-anomaly resonant frequencies. The proposed approach {{is based on}} use of certain "shifted equivalent sources" which enable FFT acceleration of a Wood-anomaly-capable quasi-periodic Green function introduced recently (Bruno and Delourme, Jour. Computat. Phys., 262 [...] 290, 2014). The Green-function strategy additionally incorporates an exponentially convergent shifted version of the classical spectral series for the Green function. Single-core runs in computing times ranging from {{a fraction of a}} second to a few seconds suffice for the proposed algorithm to produce highly-accurate solutions in some of the most challenging contexts arising in applications. The algorithm is additionally demonstrated for certain extreme geometries featuring hundreds of wavelengths in period and/or depth, for which accurate solutions are obtained in single-core runs of the order of a few minutes...|$|R
