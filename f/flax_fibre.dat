40|$|<b>Flax</b> <b>fibres</b> are an {{interesting}} alternative for the widely used glass fibres. The specific stiffness of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> is higher than for glass, which indicates a possible weight benefit[1]. <b>Flax</b> <b>fibres</b> are a natural renewable material (it takes only 100 days to reach his full height). During growth and the process from stem to fibre the total used energy is very limited (± 10 MJ/kg) compared to glass (55 MJ/kg) [2]. In extra {{the culture of the}} flax is a very environmental friendly culture, which needs no irrigation and almost no pesticides and nutrients. Although the high potential of the <b>flax</b> <b>fibres,</b> the use of them in composites is very limited. The main reason is the limited length of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres,</b> which makes it necessary to apply twist on the fibres in order to obtain a continuous yarn. The presence of the twist leads to a drastic decrease in mechanical properties, especially for the stiffness. In this work the influence of the twist on the mechanical properties of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> is investigated. Therefore flax from different stages in the fibre production process are taken, each with a different amount of twist. Attention is paid to the properties of the produced composites, but also to the dry strength, which is higher when more twist is applied. The main goal is to check if the use of flax which is not processed until a yarn is useful for composites. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of standard decorticated and hand isolated <b>flax</b> bast <b>fibres</b> were determined in tension {{as well as}} in compression. The tensile strength of technical fibre bundles was found to depend strongly on the clamping length. The tensile strength of elementary <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> was found to range between 1500 MPa and 1800 MPa, depending on the isolation procedure. The compressive strength of elementary <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> as measured with a loop test lies around 1200 MPa. However, the compressive strength can be lowered severely by the decortication process. The standard decortication process induces kink bands in the fibres. These kink bands are found to contain cracks bridged by microfibrils. The failure behaviour of elementary <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> under compression can be described as similar to the failure behaviour of a stranded wire...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} quantifies the {{environmental}} impacts of the production of hackled <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> destined for reinforcement of composite materials and compared with those for the production of glass fibres. The ecological advantages of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> production over glass fibres are shown. Most of the environmental indicators used (climate change, acidification, non-renewable energy consumption [...] .) are favourable to <b>flax</b> <b>fibres.</b> However the eutrophication indicator remains high, mainly due to the use and production of fertilizers. Possible optimisation is studied by means of reduction of mechanical extraction steps and chemical products use. A sensitivity analysis highlights that the calculation method used (CML 2000 modified) is robust. The hypothesis of carbon dioxide sequestration influences the climate change indicator.

40|$|The {{specific}} stiffness of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> {{is comparable to}} that of glass fibres. However, the application of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> in composites still poses two important problems. The orientation of the fibres in the composite is not impeccable and the fibre–matrix adhesion is too weak. This research focuses on the former. To produce a continuous yarn for the textile industry, technical <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> are spun. The twisting of the fibres increases the yarn strength but the orientation of the fibres with regard to the fibre axis decreases. Experiments show that the slightly twisted yarns and the spun yarns possess the best processability but have lower mechanical properties than untwisted ribbons. The values fit very well to certain models which predict stiffness with regard to the twist angle. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{cellulosic}} <b>fibres</b> such as <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> present interesting {{mechanical properties}} {{as well as}} biodegradability, and by-products, such as short <b>flax</b> <b>fibres,</b> {{could be used to}} produce geotextiles to stabilise soils. Today, geotextiles are often made of coir fibres, which have a high lignin percentage leading to their slow degradation in soil. Fibres with a high cellulosic content, such as those of flax, exhibit lower resistance to soil degradation. This study investigates solutions to improve this parameter with a view to increasing their service life and therefore their credibility compared to coir fibres for geotextile applications. For this purpose, a cellulose coating of yarns made of short <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> was performed and its stability under a water flow was assessed. The ability to form a cellulose sheath was estimated by chromaticity measurements of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> after applying a dye specific to lignin. Infrared spectrometry analysis to monitor the level of protection against degradation by cellulolytic enzymes was also carried out. It appears that the cellulose coating provides an efficient physical protection, preventing access of these enzymes to their fibrous substrate. Then, the possibility of conferring antibacterial properties on the cellulose coating by chelating phytoalexin molecules such as gramine on it was assayed and proven to be effective against soil cellulolytic bacteria such as Cellvibrio fulvus and Cellvibrio vulgaris. This study therefore establishes that coating flax yarns with cellulose associated with antibacterial molecules could contribute to obtaining a longer service life in soil for geotextiles manufactured from <b>flax</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at extracting {{cellulose}} and nanocelluloses (cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and cellulose nanofibres (CNFs)) from maize stalks and <b>flax</b> <b>fibres.</b> Both <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> and maize stalks are composed of cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose and extractives. The extraction of cellulose involves the removal of lignin, hemicellulose and extractives. The presence of these components in plant fibres hinders the extraction of cellulose and nanocelluloses. Prior to extraction of cellulose, the different concentrations (1 wt. %, 1. 5 wt. % and 2 wt. %) of NaOH were optimised. However, chemical compositions and XRD results revealed that the treatment of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> with 1. 5 wt. % sodium hydroxide (NaOH) gives optimum results and this concentration was further selected for the extraction of cellulose. Cellulose was extracted by chemical treatments (sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium chlorite (NaClO 2) and potassium hydroxide (KOH)) and a combination of chemical treatments and mechanical process (supermass colloider). The materials obtained after each treatment stage during the extraction process were characterised by different characterisation techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results from the aforementioned characterisation techniques confirmed that cellulose was successfully extracted from <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> and maize stalks. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were extracted by sulphuric acid hydrolysis accompanied with ultra-sonication from cellulose obtained from <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> and maize stalks. The extracted CNCs were rod-like material with diameters and lengths in nanoscale and microscale, respectively. On the other hand, cellulose nanofibres (CNFs) were extracted by mechanical process (supermass colloider). The extracted CNFs were web-like material with diameters and lengths in nanoscale and microscale, respectively. The dimensions of nanocelluloses were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Their dispersion was investigated by light polarised microscopy. The extracted nanocelluloses and cellulose were used to produce nanopapers and micropaper. Nanopapers mimic the traditional paper, the only difference of the nanopapers {{is that they are}} produced from high aspect ratio nanomaterials. Both nanopapers and micropapers were prepared by solvent evaporating method. Their thermal, optical and mechanical properties were investigated and compared. The mechanical and thermal properties of nanopapers produced from CNFs were better than those produced from CNCs and micropapers. On the other hand, nanopapers produced from CNCs were more transparent in comparison to nanopapers produced from CNFs and micropapers. Cellulosic fibres have attracted a considerable attention in composite materials due to their high tensile strength and tensile modulus.

Flax-fibre composites showed a Fickian absorption behaviour and a water uptake 15 times {{higher than that of}} glass-fibre composites.
