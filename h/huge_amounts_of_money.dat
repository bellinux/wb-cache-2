5|$|Norway is {{a country}} with {{abundance}} of hydroelectricity and NSB saw <b>huge</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> burning up with the imported coal. Plans for electrification of the line {{is as old as}} the railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track, having seen the Thamshavn Line open with electric traction in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 30s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built with electric traction, but not the main line. Countersuggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or coal dust. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the breakout of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 50s was it again possible to afford such investments. Vossebanen took electric traction into use on 2 July 1954.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the plague in the countryside, farmers could not take care of crops and the price of grain rose at Constantinople. Justinian had {{expended}} <b>huge</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> for wars against the Vandals in the region of Carthage and the Ostrogoths' kingdom in Italy. He had dedicated significant funds to the construction of great churches, such as Hagia Sophia. As the empire tried to fund the projects, the plague caused tax revenues to decline through the massive number of deaths and the disruption of agriculture and trade. Justinian swiftly enacted new legislation to deal more efficiently with the glut of inheritance suits being brought as {{a result of}} victims dying intestate.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{international}} {{awareness of the}} danger that Russian nuclear technology might {{fall into the hands}} of terrorists or rogue officers who it was feared might want to use nuclear weapons to threaten or attack other countries, the Federal government of the United States and many other countries provided considerable financial assistance to the Russian nuclear forces in the early 1990s. Many friendly countries gave <b>huge</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in lieu for Russian Arms purchase deals which kept Russian Agencies functioning. This money went in part to finance decommissioning of warheads under international agreements, such the Cooperative Threat Reduction programme, but also to improve security and personnel training in Russian nuclear facilities.|$|E

25|$|Rhosydd Quarry is a slate mine {{northeast}} of Porthmadog in North Wales. Small-scale working {{of the site}} began in the 1830s, but was hampered by the remote location, {{and the lack of}} a transport system to carry the slates to markets. The Rhosydd Slate Company was formed in 1853, and became a limited company in 1856. Transport was made more difficult by the attitude of the Cwmorthin Quarry, through whose land the most obvious route to the Ffestiniog Railway ran. A solution was found in 1864, {{with the opening of the}} Croesor Tramway, to which the quarry was connected by one of the longest single-pitch inclines in Wales. <b>Huge</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> were spent on development work, and the company, unable to make adequate returns, went into voluntary liquidation in 1873.|$|E

25|$|As {{the rivalry}} between the leagues intensified, both leagues {{entered into a}} massive bidding war over the top college prospects, paying <b>huge</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to {{unproven}} rookies in order to outbid {{each other for the}} best players coming out of college. The bidding wars escalated in the mid-1960s, with the respective drafts held on the same day in the late fall. Because of the intense competition, teams often drafted players that they thought had a good chance of signing, instead of selecting the best available players. For example, 1965 Heisman Trophy winner Mike Garrett, a running back from USC in Los Angeles, was expected to sign with an NFL team, so he was not taken in the 1966 AFL draft until the 20th (final) round. Selected by the Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Rams with the 18th overall selection of the 1966 NFL Draft, Garrett surprisingly shunned the NFL and signed with Kansas City; he helped lead them to the AFL title as a rookie. The previous year, the Chiefs used their first round pick on Gale Sayers, who signed with the NFL's Chicago Bears.|$|E

500|$|Hollywood {{had shown}} {{interest}} in Welles {{as early as}} 1936. He turned down three scripts sent to him by Warner Bros. In 1937, he declined offers from David O. Selznick, who asked him to head his film company's story department, and William Wyler, who wanted him for a supporting role in Wuthering Heights. [...] "Although the possibility of making <b>huge</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in Hollywood greatly attracted him," [...] wrote biographer Frank Brady, [...] "he was still totally, hopelessly, insanely {{in love with the}} theater, and it is there that he had every intention of remaining to make his mark." ...|$|E
500|$|New {{branches}} to Uxbridge, Watford and Stanmore were built, and from 1915 the extremely effective Metro-land advertising campaign began, promoting the lightly developed areas along the MR's routes as ideal for commuting to London. Watkin's expansionist schemes {{had led to}} the acquisition of huge tracts of near-worthless land in the Buckinghamshire countryside around the MR's routes, as the MR had tried {{to take control of}} as much land as possible along every possible route between London and Manchester. With the GCR complete it was no longer necessary for the MR to keep these lands clear for potential railway use, and Selbie began development on a massive scale. By 1939 over 4,600 houses had been built by the MR alone, and entire new towns had grown around the MR's stations between Harrow and Aylesbury. This development not only generated <b>huge</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> from property development, but vastly increased use of the railway for passenger and goods traffic. The MR's Baker Street terminus was also redeveloped and a block of 180 luxury apartments known as Chiltern Court was built above the station. With the profits generated, the line was further electrified to Rickmansworth. Again, the Chesham branch was not electrified and remained operated by steam locomotives; the electric locomotives would be uncoupled from their trains at Rickmansworth and a steam locomotive would haul the train to Chesham. By this time, the steam sections of the route were generally worked by the powerful Metropolitan Railway H Class engines, capable of speeds of up to [...]|$|E

2500|$|During {{the first}} half of 1992, a {{monetary}} union with 15 independent states all using the ruble existed. Since {{it was clear that the}} situation would not last, each of them was using its position as [...] "free-riders" [...] to issue <b>huge</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in the form of credit. As a result, some countries were issuing coupons in order to [...] "protect" [...] their markets from buyers from other states. The Russian central bank responded in July 1992 by setting up restrictions to the flow of credit between Russia and other states. The final collapse of the ruble zone began when Russia pulled out with the exchange of banknotes by the Central bank of Russia on Russian territory at the end of July 1993.|$|E

Alan Smith, a local boy and firm fan favourite at Leeds, shocked the Leeds fans after their relegation by transferring to Manchester United. The Leeds fans dubbed him [...] "Judas" [...] and his actions were made particularly hard for them to take as Smith had been noted for kissing the club badge on his Leeds shirt and he had said that he would stay with the club even if they went down. He had also previously stated years before on an interview with Soccer AM that he would never join Manchester United. He was welcomed by Manchester United fans and soon became a fan favourite, the fans respecting him and his decision to join a rival club.|$|E

2500|$|The year 1697 is an {{important}} year for Portuguese architecture. In that year gold, gems and later diamonds were found in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Mining exploration was strongly controlled by the Portuguese Crown, which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted (one fifth of all gold {{would go to the}} Crown). These enormous proceeds caused Portugal to prosper and become the richest country of Europe in the 18th century. King João V, who reigned between 1706 and 1750, tried to rival the French king Louis XIV, also called the Sun King, by engaging in a large number of expensive building activities. But the French king could rely on local experience for the [...] glorification and his name and of France. The Palace of Versailles was transformed for Louis XIV into a marvelous palace by architect Louis Le Vau, painter and designer Charles Le Brun and the landscape architect André Le Nôtre.
