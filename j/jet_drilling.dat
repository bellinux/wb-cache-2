40|$|AbstractComposite {{laminates}} {{are used}} in many applications in industries like aerospace and aircraft due to their extremely high strength to weight ratio and corrosion resistance properties. The composite laminates are difficult to machine materials, which results into low drilling efficiency and drilling-induced delamination, thus {{it is important to}} develop an innovative advanced drilling process to overcome the difficulties related in the machining of composite materials. This work is focused on comprehensive experimental characterization to understand the effect of cutting parameters on the delamination extent during abrasive water <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> of carbon fiber reinforced polymer. Processing parameters, such as standoff distance and water pressure plays dominant role in delamination than abrasive flow rate. It also describes the development of different techniques for controlling the delamination in abrasive water <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> process, such as backup plate, pre-drilled hole and water immersion (under water).

40|$|Tempress Small Mechanically-Assisted High-Pressure Waterjet Drilling Tool project {{centered}} {{on the development of}} a downhole intensifier (DHI) to boost the hydraulic pressure available from conventional coiled tubing to the level required for high-pressure jet erosion of rock. We reviewed two techniques for implementing this technology (1) pure high-pressure <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> and (2) mechanically-assisted <b>jet</b> <b>drilling.</b> Due to the difficulties associated with modifying a downhole motor for mechanically-assisted <b>jet</b> <b>drilling,</b> it was determined that the pure high-pressure <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> tool was the best candidate for development and commercialization. It was also determined that this tool needs to run on commingled nitrogen and water to provide adequate downhole differential pressure and to facilitate controlled pressure drilling and descaling applications in low pressure wells. The resulting Microhole <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> bottomhole assembly (BHA) drills a 3. 625 -inch diameter hole with 2 -inch coil tubing. The BHA consists of a self-rotating multi-nozzle drilling head, a high-pressure rotary seal/bearing section, an intensifier and a gas separator. Commingled nitrogen and water are separated into two streams in the gas separator. The water stream is pressurized to 3 times the inlet pressure by the downhole intensifier and discharged through nozzles in the drilling head. The energy in the gas-rich stream is used to power the intensifier. Gas-rich exhaust from the intensifier is conducted to the nozzle head where it is used to shroud the jets, increasing their effective range. The prototype BHA was tested at operational pressures and flows in a test chamber and on the end of conventional coiled tubing in a test well. During instrumented runs at downhole conditions, the BHA developed downhole differential pressures of 74 MPa (11, 000 psi, median) and 90 MPa (13, 000 psi, peaks). The median output differential pressure was nearly 3 times the input differential pressure available from the coiled tubing. In a chamber test, the BHA delivered up to 50 kW (67 hhp) hydraulic power. The tool drilled uncertified class-G cement samples cast into casing at a rate of 0. 04 to 0. 17 m/min (8 to 33 ft/hr), within the range projected for this tool but slower than a conventional PDM. While the tool met most of the performance goals, reliability requires further improvement. It will be difficult for this tool, as currently configured, to compete with conventional positive displacement downhole motors for most coil tubing drill applications. Mechanical cutters on the rotating nozzle head would improve cutting. This tool can be easily adapted for well descaling operations. A variant of the Microhole <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> gas separator was further developed for use with positive displacement downhole motors (PDM) operating on commingled nitrogen and water. A fit-for-purpose motor gas separator was designed and yard tested within the Microhole program. Four commercial units of that design are currently involved in a 10 -well field demonstration with Baker Oil Tools in Wyoming. Initial results indicate that the motor gas separators provide significant benefit...|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands, a {{significant}} number (25 +) of small tight natural gas fields are stranded. They are classified, according to the PRMS definition, as ‘contingent resources’. The combination of low GIIP and low permeability currently do not allow these fields to be developed economically without stimulation, which is usually required to produce tight gas reservoirs. The recent change in legislation on hydraulic fracturing increases {{the need for a}} more cost effective and politically accepted alternative. Since natural gas has played, and will continue {{to play an important role}} in the energy security of the Netherlands, alternative methods are considered to extract these stranded resources. Radial <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> could be such an alternative method to develop these reservoirs in a cost effective, environmental friendly and socially acceptable manner. In this report, a numerical reservoir simulator is used to compare the production performance of a synthetic low permeable homogeneous reservoir based on three development options: a conventional vertical well, a vertical well stimulation through radial <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> and one case where the vertical well is stimulated through hydraulic fracturing. The static and dynamic models are based on typical tight gas reservoir properties as found in the Netherlands. The objectives are: to determine the operational scope / boundary conditions for the application potential of radial <b>jet</b> <b>drilling,</b> to identify the reservoir- and well variables that control the effectiveness and production performance, and to evaluate the economics. The comparison of the development option includes a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the well and reservoir performance and the impact it has on the economic viability. The simulations demonstrate that the laterals appear to be most effective in low permeable (~ 0. 1 mD) reservoirs, reservoirs with near-well bore formation damage, with lower initial water saturation's, depleted reservoirs and thin reservoirs. The laterals appear less effective in more permeable reservoirs and reservoirs with high horizontal-to-vertical anisotropy. The application of small diameter laterals generally results in a recovery improvement factor of 2 - 3. 5 compared to a vertical well. The initial gas production improves with a factor 4 - 7. The small diameter laterals become effective for reservoirs with permeabilities lower than 10 mD. In reservoirs with a permeability lower than 0. 1 mD the application results in a recovery factor improvement of at least 2. The lateral length is the well design parameter that has the most profound impact on the recovery factor. The economics demonstrate that the onshore application of radial <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> as a stimulation method is economically feasible and robust whereas a vertical well is economically very marginal. The offshore application of radial <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> is only feasible for stranded volumes $>$ 1 BCM in combination with a re-entry scenario.

High cost, long drilling cycles, and low rate of penetration (ROP) represent critical challenges for offshore drilling operations. The hydraulic pulse generator was specifically designed, based on China offshore drilling technologies and parameters, to overcome problems encountered during offshore drilling. Both laboratory and field tests were conducted to collect {{the characteristics of the}} hydraulic pulse generator. The relationships between flow rate and pressure amplitude, pressure loss and pulse frequency were obtained, which can be used to optimize operation parameters for hydraulic pulse <b>jet</b> <b>drilling.</b> Meanwhile a bottom hole assembly (BHA) for pulse <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> has been designed, combining the hydraulic pulse generator with the conventional BHA, positive displacement motor, and rotary steerable system (RSS) etc. Furthermore, the hydraulic pulse jet technique has been successfully applied in more than 10 offshore wells in China. The depth of the applied wells ranged from 2, 000 m to 4, 100 m with drilling bit diameters of 311 mm and 216 mm.

40|$|Water <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> of rock {{is shown}} to be a {{feasible}} method for potential improvement in gaining access to the earth's resources. Drilling rates of up to 280 in. /min in sandstone and 40 in. /min in granite have been achieved. While the addition of polymers to the jet stream is found advantageous the low (15 %) level of improvement and the difficulty in maintaining concentrate negated further development. The application of confining pressure was found to reduce jet performance, but this was found to be a function more of the rock response than of the jet parameters. Field tests of water jets underground indicated the jet system could be modified to cope with this change. Water jets were found to be more effective, for drilling larger holes, where a combined water jet:roller bit system was developed and laboratory and field trials of this are described. As well as determining the controlling parameters affecting <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> performance, and proving that rock compressive strength is not one of them, the research examined other methods of improving jet cutting performance. At jet pressures below 10, 000 psi abrasive laden jets were found most advantageous while, for drilling granite, a cavitating flow proved more effective at pressures above 10, 000 psi. A reason for this is postulated. Experiments to develop a standardized cavitation resistance test for rock specimens have also been undertaken...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{patented}} {{and transferred}} to industry an abrasive-enhanced water-jet rock drill. This drill incorporates three novel components: a collimator, jet deflectors for cutting clearance, and an unpressurized swivel, which rotates at 1, 000 rpm while passing 20 gpm of an abrasive slurry flowing at 1, 000 ft/s. Drilling occurs through the action of a 10, 000 -psi, 2 O-gpm water jet into which is entrained 72 lb/min of abrasives. The pumps, hoses, and fittings are those commonly used in the water-jet-cleaning industry. Only inexpensive, common sandblasting abrasives are used.

40|$|In {{orthopaedic}} surgery, water <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> provides {{several advantages}} over classic drilling with rigid drilling bits, {{such as the}} always sharp cut, absence of thermal damage and increased manoeuvrability. Previous research showed that the heterogeneity of bone tissue can cause variation in drilling depth whilst water <b>jet</b> <b>drilling.</b> To improve control over the drilling depth, a new method is tested consisting of two water jets that collide directly below the bone surface. The expected working principle is that after collision the jets will disintegrate, with the result of eliminating the destructive power of the coherent jets and leaving the bone tissue underneath the focal point intact. To assess the working principle of colliding water jets (CWJ), the influence of inhomogeneity of the bone tissue on the variation of the drilling depth {{and the impact of}} jet time (t(wj)) on the drilling depth were compared to a single water jet (SWJ) with a similar power. 98 holes were drilled in 14 submerged porcine tali with two conditions CWJ (impact angle of 30 degrees and 90 degrees) and SWJ. The water pressure was 70 MPa for all conditions. The water jet diameter was 0. 3 mm for CWJ and 0. 4 mm for SWJ. t(wj) was set at 1, 3, 5 and 8 s. Drilling depth and hole diameter were measured using microCT scans. A non-parametric Levene's test was performed to assess a significant difference in variance between conditions SWJ and CWJ. A regression analysis was used to determine differences in influence of t(wj) on the drilling depth. Hole diameter differences were assessed using a one way Anova. A significance level of p < 0. 05 was set. Condition CWJ significantly decreases the drilling depth variance caused by the heterogeneity of the bone when compared to SWJ. The mean depth for CWJ was 0. 9 mm (SD 0. 3 mm) versus 4. 8 mm (SD 2. 0) for SWJ. t(wj) affects the drilling depth less for condition CWJ (p < 0. 01, R- 2 = 0. 30) than for SWJ (p < 0. 01, R- 2 = 0. 46). The impact angle (30 degrees or 90 degrees) of the CWJ does not influence the drilling depth nor the variation in depth. The diameters of the resulting holes {{in the direction of the}} jets is significantly larger for CWJ at 90 degrees than for 30 degrees or a single jet. This study shows that CWJ provides accurate depth control when water <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> in an inhomogeneous material such as bone. The maximum variance measured by using the 95 % confidence interval is 0. 6 mm opposed to 5. 4 mm for SWJ. This variance is smaller than the accuracy required for bone debridement treatments (2 - 4 mm deep) or drilling pilot holes. This confirms that the use of CWJ is an inherently safe method that can be used to accurately drill in bone...|$|E

Wireless sensors are usually designed to run on batteries. However, as the number of sensors increases and the devices decrease in size, there is clearly a need to explore alternatives to battery power for wireless sensors. Reliable, efficient and environmentally friendly energy harvesting methods could be adopted to design and build a new electronic device {{that could be used to}} replace or supplement batteries in wireless sensors. This thesis focuses on potential ambient sources of power that can be harvested to run low power wireless sensors in mining environments. It discusses several techniques for converting energy from such sources into useful electrical power. In particular, piezoelectric power conversion technique is described in detail. Drilling is a crucial component in both underground and surface mining. Water <b>jet</b> assisted <b>drilling</b> is an example of a new drilling technology employing wireless sensors. There are various forms of energy that could potentially be used to power wireless electronic sensors provided the waste energy can be tapped in an intrinsically safe way. In this particular project, the required power to run sensors could be generated by converting mechanical vibration produced from water <b>jet</b> assisted <b>drilling</b> into electrical energy with an intrinsically safe circuit. Various power scavenging methods were researched, but vibration-to-electricity conversion using piezo-ceramic material was selected as the most promising method for this project.

In order to verify the technology, a 3 D extended finite element numerical model of {{hydraulic fracturing}} promoted by the single radial borehole was established, and the influences of nine factors on propagation of hydraulic fracture guided by the single radial borehole were comprehensively analyzed. Moreover, the term ‘Guidance factor (Gf) ’ was introduced {{for the first time to}} effectively quantify the radial borehole guidance. The guidance of nine factors was evaluated through gray correlation analysis. The experimental results were consistent with the numerical simulation results to a certain extent. The study provides theoretical evidence for the artificial control technology of directional propagation of hydraulic fracture promoted by the single radial borehole, and it predicts the guidance effect of a single radial borehole on hydraulic fracture to a certain extent, which is helpful for planning well-completion and fracturing operation parameters in radial borehole-promoted hydraulic fracturing technology...|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{measurements}} {{have been}} made in shallow, small-diameter boreholes in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering seas off the Alaskan coasts since 1975. Methods for making access holes with light-weight equipment are described. These included augering, water <b>jet</b> <b>drilling,</b> rotary water jet drill-ing, and driving. Pipe or tubing was placed in the access holes and logged at discrete, closely-spaced depth intervals, usually one metre, t o obtain the temperature profiles. Temperature profiles in the Norton Sound area of the Bering Sea show that permafrost is absent except possibly very near shore in areas of rapid shore-line retreat. Subzero temperatures were found in all holes drilled in Kotzebue Sound, and in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Holes drilled in the Chukchi Sea near Barrow suggest that the shore-line is stable, or nearly so, and that ice-bearing per-mafrost is probably thin or absent a kilometre or more off-shore. In the Beaufort Sea (Elson Lagoon) near Barrow, the shore-line is retreating rapidly (i. e., a few metres per year) whereas. temperature pro-files near Prudhoe Bay suggest a retreat rate of a metre per year or less. The depth to ice-bonded per-mafrost, as determined by temperature measurements, increases with distance off-shore when the soil conditions are constant. However, ice-bonded permafrost may be found near the sea bed in areas of very fine-grained compact soils even when these occur far off-shore. The thermal data has been use...|$|E
30|$|Radial {{drilling}} {{is already}} {{not a new}} technique in the petroleum engineering area. According {{to the state of}} art (Marbun et al. 2011), radial drilling is implemented through a special high pressure tube to form the water jet to penetrate and drill several lateral boreholes in one or several layers, which is an effective way to increase the drainage area and improve the oil recovery. Dickinson et al. (1989) first introduced the radial drilling system and predicted the promising expectation of this drilling system. Dickinson et al. (1992) presented two methods of combining water <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> and coiled tubing, and discussed their advantages and weaknesses in the practice. Yang et al. (2006) introduced the technique status in China and its application situation in Liaohe oilfield. Bruni et al. (2007) exhibited the Radial drilling technique in Argentina. Ursegov et al. (2008) presented the first results of cyclic steam stimulations of vertical wells with radial horizontal bores in heavy oil carbonates, and the results validated the wide usability of radial drilling technique. And Abdel-Ghany et al. (2011) stated the first radial drilling well conditions in Egypt. As for all of the researches above, most of them are just focused on the application status or the techniques of the radial drilling system, but almost no research was carried out to probe how to optimize the radial drilling branch length and branch number in terms of reservoir engineering respect, which is quite important for the multi-layer water drive reservoirs.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{deals with}} the prediction of the theoretical net drilling time for a conductor pipe (CP) of offshore platforms when it plugs. The CP is driven to prevent the looser surface layer from caving in and obstructing the wellbore, because the shallow section of most wells on- and offshore is drilled in unconsolidated sediment. Due to the small CP diameter, the CP plugs very often. Normally the material is drilled out by using <b>jetting,</b> normal <b>drill</b> rigs and sometimes jack-up rigs. As offshore operations time is very important, this paper tries to assess the theoretical net time needed to excavate within the CP as a relief drilling operation, by means of Nishimatsu and Evans cutting theories. The results are compared with publicly available TBM excavation rates and then theoretical drilling rates for different unconfined compressive strength values for CP diameters of 700, 900 and 1000 mm are suggested. The results are considered for drag bits, however, they are only theoretical assumptions and cannot be applied for commercial projects with the same geotechnical properties...|$|R
30|$|The {{bottom hole}} {{conditions}} under which a mudcake forms are very complex. The development of the mudcake depends {{on a number of}} factors such as drilling mud constituents, wellbore pressure and temperature, pore pressure, formation permeability and porosity, annulus flow regime, and time (Hashemzadeh and Hajidavalloo 2016; Salehi and Kiran 2016). During dynamic <b>drilling,</b> the <b>jets</b> of the <b>drilling</b> bit may generate very turbulent flow and the rate of mudcake formation is controlled by two opposite actions—deposition and erosion (Cook et al. 2016; Mostafavi et al. 2010). Mudcake buildup stops when the deposition and erosion rates become equal. However, {{the point at which the}} two rates equilibrate is difficult to determine. In this paper, it is assumed that the mudcake forms before the creation of any fracture.|$|R
