50|$|Wet or <b>dry</b> <b>cutting.</b> Though {{diamond saw}} blades for {{concrete}} are usually laser welded, they are normally designed for wet cutting because the concrete {{to be cut}} is often very hard or abrasive. If the blades are used without adequate water, the diamond segment itself may break or the steel core below the segment may wear and break, and then the segment may fly out and may hurt the operator or people nearby. If you have to perform <b>dry</b> <b>cutting</b> for some reason (e.g. there is no water source near your work area), you can choose sharper diamond blades, and the <b>dry</b> <b>cutting</b> should be intermittent and shallow (you can do several passes of shallow cuttings to gain a deep cut) to keep the diamond blade cool.|$|E
50|$|Many blades are {{designed}} to operate either wet or dry. However, diamond tools and blades work better when wet, and <b>dry</b> <b>cutting</b> {{should be limited to}} situations in which water cannot or should not be used. Water will prevent the blade from overheating, greatly reduce the amount of harmful dust created by cutting, remove the slurry from the cut, and extend the life of the blade, since diamond is unable to withstand the forces involved at the elevated temperatures involved in <b>dry</b> <b>cutting</b> ceramic and abrasive materials, and will be subject to rapid tool wear and possible failure.|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} plant {{material}} of Rhodiola rosea L. (Crassulaceae) for medicinal use has increased recently, amid concerns about its quality and sustainability. We have analysed {{the content of}} phenylpropanoids (total rosavins) and salidroside in liquid extracts from 3 -year old cultivated plants of European origin, and mapped the influence of plant part (rhizome versus root), genotype, <b>drying,</b> <b>cutting,</b> and extraction solvent to chemical composition. Rhizomes contained 1. 5 - 4 times more salidroside (0. 3 - 0. 4 % dry wt) and total rosavins (1. 2 - 3. 0 %) than roots. The qualitative decisive phenylpropanoid content in the extracts was most influenced by plant part, solvent, and genotype, while <b>drying</b> temperature and <b>cutting</b> conditions were of less importance. We have shown that R. rosea from different boreal European provenances can be grown under temperate conditions and identified factors to obtain consistent high quality extracts provided that authentic germplasm is used and distinguished between rhizome, roots and their mixtures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Magnesium (Mg) {{components}} {{can significantly}} reduce energy use {{due to their}} low densities compared to the majority alloys. Mg alloys are often machined to fit individual cases. However, process mechanics by high-speed <b>dry</b> <b>cutting</b> of Mg alloys are poorly understood. This study focuses on machining ability of biomedical magnesium-calcium (Mg-Ca) alloys. First, it presents a modeling approach of mechanical behavior of Mg-Ca 0. 8 (wt %) alloy under cutting regimes using the internal state variable (ISV) plasticity model. Then, the ISV plasticity model is implemented to simulate high speed <b>dry</b> <b>cutting</b> of Mg-Ca 0. 8 alloy by finite element method. Last, machining performance {{in the context of}} sustainability is discussed. Excellent surface finish can be achieved in the range of high cutting speeds. Continuous chip formation predicted by the finite element simulation is verified by high speed <b>dry</b> <b>cutting</b> of Mg-Ca 0. 8 using polycrystalline diamond (PCD) inserts. Chip ignition as the most hazardous aspect in machining Mg alloys does not occur for in high-speed <b>dry</b> <b>cutting</b> with sharp PCD tools. The predicted temperature distribution well explains the reason for the absence of chip ignition in high speed <b>dry</b> <b>cutting</b> of Mg-Ca 0. 8 alloy.

50|$|Silver brazed diamond blades' diamond {{segments}} are brazed to {{the steel}} core using a silver solder. These blades {{can only be}} used in wet cuttings. If they are used in <b>dry</b> <b>cuttings,</b> the silver solder may melt and the segments can break from the steel core and become a serious safety hazard. A laser melts and combines the metal of the diamond segment and the steel core creating a stronger weld, which can hold the segments even in high temperatures, meaning that laser welded diamond blades {{can be used to}} cut many types of stone without water cooling. However, when cutting very hard or abrasive materials, e.g., concrete containing reinforcing rebar, laser welded diamond blades should also be used with adequate water. Otherwise, it is possible for the diamond segment itself to break or the steel core below the segment to wear and break, creating serious safety hazards.|$|R

This index provides information about the amount of swelling clays that the rock contains, as the types of clays are known from XRD analyses. CEC analyses were performed on selected cutting samples from the GRT- 2 well to quantify the amount of swelling clays (Fig.  2). The measurement was performed on crushed cuttings with the standard cobaltihexamine chloride method NF X 31 – 130 (1999). Calcimetry was performed on samples from both wells during the drilling and provided information about the relative amount of calcite, dolomite, or total carbonates in the cutting samples (Fig.  3). More precisely, the use of a calcimeter on the crushed and <b>dried</b> <b>cuttings</b> measures the quantity of CO 2 released by the reaction of the carbonates with HCl. The quantity of CO 2 released after 1  min gives the percentage of calcite, and the quantity of CO 2 released after 15  min gives the percentage of total carbonates. The difference between the total carbonate quantity and the calcite quantity is the amount of dolomite.
