The algorithm is demonstrated in a synthetic study {{based on data from}} the WIPP site in New Mexico. Seven alternative scenarios are investigated, generating 100 realizations for each of them. The di€erences among the scenarios range from the number of conditioning data, to their spatial con®guration, to the pumping strategies at the pumping wells.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} the transient streaming potential response due to pumping from a confined aquifer through a fully penetrating line sink. Confined aquifer flow {{is assumed to}} occur without fluid leakage from the confining units. However, since confining units are typically clayey, and hence more electrically conductive than the aquifer, they are treated as non-insulating in our three-layer conceptual model. We develop a semi-analytical solution for the transient streaming potentials response of the aquifer and the confining units to pumping of the aquifer. The solution is fitted to field measurements of streaming potentials associated with an aquifer test performed at a site located near Montalto Uffugo, {{in the region of}} Calabria in Southern Italy. This yields an average hydraulic conductivity that compares well to the estimate obtained using only hydraulic <b>head</b> <b>data.</b> Specific storage is estimated with greater estimation uncertainty than hydraulic conductivity and is significantly smaller than that estimated from hydraulic <b>head</b> <b>data.</b> This indicates that specific storage may be a more difficult parameter to estimate from streaming potential data. The mismatch may also be {{due to the fact that}} only recovery streaming potential data were used here whereas <b>head</b> <b>data</b> for both production and recovery were used. The estimate from <b>head</b> <b>data</b> may also constitute an upper bound since <b>head</b> <b>data</b> were not corrected for pumping and observation wellbore storage. Estimated values of the electrical conductivities of the confining units compare well to those estimated using electrical resistivity tomography.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to calibrate transfer function-noise (TFN) models, operating at the same frequency as the input (auxiliary) variables, to sparsely or irregularly observed time series of the output (target) variable. Once calibrated, the TFN models {{can be used to}} predict or simulate the output variable at the same frequency as the input variable. Consequently, the method provides a useful tool for filling in gaps of irregularly or sparsely observed hydrological time series. Although generic and suitable for any type of time series, the method is described through the modeling of a time series of groundwater <b>head</b> <b>data</b> with precipitation surplus (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration) as input variable. First, the TFN model is written in vector notation, yielding the state equation of a linear discrete stochastic system. Subsequently, the state equation is embedded in a Kalman filter algorithm. The Kalman filter is then combined with a maximum likelihood criterion to obtain estimates of the parameters of the TFN model for small time steps (e. g., 1 day) while using sparsely (e. g., two times a month) or even irregularly observed time series of groundwater <b>head</b> <b>data.</b> The method is illustrated using (subsets of) time series of groundwater <b>head</b> <b>data</b> with varying regular and irregular observation intervals...|$|R

The ship used is a 1 / 85. 19 scale KRISO Container Ship, KCS, model with a length of 2. 70 m. Tests were performed at the IIHR wave basin. The 20 x 40 x 4. 5 m wave basin is equipped with 6 inline plunger type wave makers and a 3 degrees of freedom carriage. A 4 degrees of freedom, surge, heave, roll, and pitch free mount with a mass spring damper system was used to tow the model. Calm water tests were performed for 13 Froude numbers between 0. 0867 and 0. 2817. The resistance coefficients, sinkage, and trim were found for each test. The calm water results were obtained and compared to results from towing tank facilities, with traditional mounts, to estimate facility biases at the IIHR wave basin. The results show that the size difference of the IIHR model and surge free motion create magnitude differences between facilities. Head and oblique wave tests were performed at Froude number 0. 26 and wave height to wavelength ratio, H/λ, of 0. 0167. For all wave tests, time histories of wave amplitude, resistance, and 4 DOF were measured.
