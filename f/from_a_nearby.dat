5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the vicinity of Apple River Fort, probably miners, likely arrived more than a decade before the fort's construction.

5|$|After {{four years}} in Washington, he spent four years as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), the number two position, at Embassy Moscow. These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 3:30am 20 SEALs {{and about}} 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired {{on from the}} compound and <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> position by Taliban armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US {{troops on the ground}} with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Americans arrived at Île-aux-Noix, Fort St. Jean was defended by about 750 men {{under the command of}} Major Charles Preston. The {{majority}} of these were regular troops from the 7th and 26th Regiments of Foot and the Royal Artillery. There were 90 locally raised militia, and 20 members of Colonel Allen Maclean's Royal Highland Emigrants, men who were veterans of the French and Indian War. A detachment of Indians (probably Caughnawaga <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> village) patrolled outside the fort under the direction of Claude de Lorimier and Gilbert Tice. The Richelieu River was patrolled by an armed schooner, , under the command of Lieutenant William Hunter, with other boats under construction.|$|E

5|$|On April 21, a {{low-pressure}} area {{separated from}} the prevailing westerlies about 600miles (1,100km) southeast of Bermuda, and developed into a subtropical depression at 1200UTC. The system maintained a large comma-shaped cloud pattern around the low-level circulation. Operationally, it was not classified until 27hours later. Isolated from strong steering currents, the depression tracked northwestward at 12mph (19km/h), and intensified into a subtropical storm early on April 22; {{this was the first}} such storm on record in the month. It gradually became better organized, with a large convective band in the eastern semicircle. Reports <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> ship indicated peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), with swells of 64.4feet (19.7m).|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 1997, the NEAR Shoemaker {{spacecraft}} passed within 1,212km of Mathilde while {{moving at}} a velocity of 9.93km/s. This close approach allowed the spacecraft to capture over 500 images of the surface, and provided data for more accurate determinations of the asteroid's dimensions and mass (based on gravitational perturbation of the spacecraft). However, only one hemisphere of Mathilde was imaged during the fly-by. This was only the third asteroid to be imaged <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> distance, following 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida.|$|E
5|$|The basic plot of Bruce Lee Way of the Dragon (1972) {{was adapted}} by Varma for Siva. In Way of the Dragon, Lee comes from Hong Kong {{to work in}} a Chinese {{restaurant}} in Rome and fights local gangsters who try to intimidate the owners; this leads to a rivalry with a crime boss (played by Chuck Norris). In Siva, Nagarjuna comes <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> town to Vijayawada to further his education, fights gangsters and develops a rivalry with Raghuvaran. While Lee and Norris fight at the Colosseum at the climax of Way of the Dragon, Nagarjuna and Raghuvaran duel on a building terrace in Siva.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{was formed}} around a court, later called the inner court, {{enclosed}} by a curtain {{wall with a}} circular tower on each corner and a gatehouse at the front; the north-east tower was larger than the others, perhaps to provide additional defences. Over time the towers acquired their own names: the north-west tower was called the Hazelwell Tower; the north-east the Redcap Tower and the south-west the Lady Tower. The ground fell away sharply on most sides of the castle, but its south and west sides were protected with a wet moat, using a dam fed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> spring using a pipe. The gatehouse had twin towers and a drawbridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{fan base}} went wild, and a riotous celebration {{gathered}} at Ebisu Bridge in Dōtonbori, Osaka. There, {{an assemblage of}} supporters yelled the players' names, and with every name, a fan resembling {{a member of the}} victorious team leaped from the bridge into the waiting canal. However, lacking a Caucasian person to imitate MVP Randy Bass, the rabid crowd seized a plastic statue of Colonel Sanders (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese) <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> KFC and tossed it off the bridge as an effigy.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low {{to account for the}} {{formation of}} such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation. One is that the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> massive OB star.|$|E
