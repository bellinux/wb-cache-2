5|$|The {{milk fat}} <b>globule</b> is {{surrounded}} by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting mammary epithelial cell (lactocyte). This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM. While MFGM only makes up an estimated 2% to 6% of the total milk fat <b>globule,</b> it is an especially rich phospholipid source, accounting for the majority of total milk phospholipids. In contrast, the inner core of the milk fat <b>globule</b> is composed predominantly of triacylglycerols.|$|E
5|$|For example, infant {{formulas}} traditionally were {{lacking the}} MFGM because this fraction is lost during regular dairy processing. However, more {{recent advances in}} technology have facilitated the separation of MFGM from the fat <b>globule,</b> allowing bovine MFGM to be added in concentrated form. The MFGM fraction is now commercially available and {{can be added to}} infant formula or other nutritional products.|$|E
5|$|The colour of the {{spore print}} is brownish, with pink, reddish, or rosy tints. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped, smooth, and measure 11–17 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 18–25.6 by 7.0–10.2µm. Cystidia {{on the walls}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and have granular contents. They possess sharp to tapered tips, and have overall dimensions of 36–44 by 8.0–11.0µm. On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8–44.0 by 7.3–11.0µm. The hymenium of Smith and Thiers's variety uliginosus, when mounted in Melzer's reagent, shows reddish globules of pigment measuring 2–8µm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the hymenium, and a large (8–12µm) <b>globule</b> in the pleurocystidia.|$|E
25|$|Unprocessed milk {{consists}} of <b>globules</b> of milk fat suspended in a watery base containing dissolved proteins, sugars, vitamins, and minerals. If the <b>globules</b> are large enough, as with unprocessed milk from cows, the fat <b>globules</b> float upwards until {{they form a}} distinct cream layer at the top. Some animals, such as goats, produce smaller fat <b>globules</b> that remain mixed unless mechanically separated by centrifugation.|$|R
40|$|From {{existing}} broad-band images {{obtained with}} the Hubble Space Telescope, we located 92 <b>globules,</b> {{for which we}} derived positions, dimensions, orientations, extinctions, masses, proper motions, and their distributions. The <b>globules</b> have mean radii ranging from 400 to 2000 AU and are not resolved in current infrared images of the nebula. The extinction law for dust grains in these <b>globules</b> matches a normal interstellar extinction law. Derived masses of dust range from 1 to 60 x 10 ^(- 6) solar masses, and the total mass contained in <b>globules</b> constitute a fraction of approximately 2 % or less of the total dust content of the nebula. The <b>globules</b> are spread over the outer part of the nebula, and a fraction of them coincide in position with emission filaments, where we find elongated <b>globules</b> that are aligned with these filaments. Only 10 % of the <b>globules</b> are coincident in position with the numerous H 2 -emitting knots found in previous studies. All <b>globules</b> move outwards from the centre with transversal velocities of 60 to 1600 km/s, along with the general expansion of the remnant.

5|$|The {{process takes}} place in {{multiple}} stages. First, fat synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in droplets between {{the inner and outer}} phospholipid monolayers of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually pinch off. This leads to the surrounding of the droplet in a phospholipid monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the droplet and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat droplet in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The milk fat <b>globule</b> thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 μm in average diameter, is surrounded by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM.|$|E
25|$|Freezing of {{milk can}} cause fat <b>globule</b> {{aggregation}} upon thawing, resulting in milky layers and butterfat lumps. These can be dispersed again by warming and stirring the milk. It {{can change the}} taste by destruction of milk-fat <b>globule</b> membranes, releasing oxidized flavors.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{milk fat}} is {{secreted}} {{in the form}} of a fat <b>globule</b> surrounded by a membrane. Each fat <b>globule</b> is composed almost entirely of triacylglycerols and is surrounded by a membrane consisting of complex lipids such as phospholipids, along with proteins. These act as emulsifiers which keep the individual globules from coalescing and protect the contents of these globules from various enzymes in the fluid portion of the milk. Although 97–98% of lipids are triacylglycrols, small amounts of di- and monoacylglycerols, free cholesterol and cholesterol esters, free fatty acids, and phospholipids are also present. Unlike protein and carbohydrates, fat composition in milk varies widely in the composition due to genetic, lactational, and nutritional factor difference between different species.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} results of a 1. 3 mm {{continuum}} study of 59 Bok <b>globules</b> located north of − 30 ◦ declination. The catalogue of Clemens & Barvainis (1988) served as a search list for the target objects investigated here. Based on the analysis of the IRAS point source colour-colour diagram, four distinct groups of <b>globules</b> are distinguished. It is shown that indeed each of these groups has distinctive properties and represents a different stage of star formation. For our observations, we selected a number of candidate pre-protostellar cores, all candidates for <b>globules</b> with protostellar cores, {{as well as a number}} of strong 12 µm IRAS point sources which are candidates for T Tauri stars associated with <b>globules.</b> Individual distances of the <b>globules</b> are derived with a method which associates the <b>globules</b> with larger molecular cloud complexes.

40|$|Some meteorites and IDPs contain micron-size {{carbonaceous}} <b>globules</b> {{that are}} associated with significant H and/or N isotopic anomalies. This has been interpreted as indicating that such <b>globules</b> may contain at least partial preserved organic species formed in the outer reaches of the proto-solar disk or the presolar cold molecular cloud. Owing to their small sizes, relatively little is known about their chemical compositions. Here we present in situ measurements of aromatic molecular species in organic <b>globules</b> from the Bells (CM 2) chondrite by microprobe two-step laser mass spectrometry. This meteorite was chosen for study because we have previously found this meteorite to contain high abundances of <b>globules</b> that often occur in clusters.

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{residual}} liquids of many tholeiitic basalts and andesites, on cooling, split nto iron-rich and silica-rich fractions, {{which may}} quench to brown glassy <b>globules</b> and clear glass respectively. More commonly, however, cooling is sufficiently slow for the iron-rich liquid to crystallize to globular single crystals of pyroxene. Depending on the cooling rate, these crystallized <b>globules</b> range in shape from spheres to elongated <b>globules</b> bounded by crystal faces. The fine grain {{size of the}} mesostasis of most tholeiites {{is partly due to}} these small crystallized <b>globules.</b> The silica-rich fraction, on the other hand, is more commonly quenched to a glass, and when preserved as <b>globules</b> in the crystal-lized iron-rich fraction, it may be bounded by negative crystal faces of the surrounding pyroxene. <b>Globules</b> o...|$|R

25|$|Spiderlings {{and adult}} males hunt without a bolas. This might {{be because the}} small <b>globule</b> these spiders could produce would dry out rapidly. Rather, they {{position}} themselves at edges of leaves and grab prey with their frontal pair of legs. Moth flies of the genus Psychoda are prominent prey in juvenile and adult male Mastophora. Adult spiders consume the bolas after at most half an hour if the hunt was fruitless.|$|E
25|$|Transmembrane α-helical {{proteins}} are unusually stable {{judging from}} thermal denaturation studies, {{because they do}} not unfold completely within the membranes (the complete unfolding would require breaking down too many α-helical H-bonds in the nonpolar media). On the other hand, these proteins easily misfold, due to non-native aggregation in membranes, transition to the molten <b>globule</b> states, formation of non-native disulfide bonds, or unfolding of peripheral regions and nonregular loops that are locally less stable.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the results of a dedicated millimetre continuum and molecular line (CO and CS) search for cold and dense (protostellar) cores and molecular outflows in 35 southern Bok <b>globules</b> (Dec. ≤− 30 ◦). Only <b>globules</b> which are associated with cold IRAS point sources (FIR colour temperatures below 35 K) were selected for this study. We could demonstrate that <b>globules</b> are often loosely associated with molecular cloud complexes from which they probably formed. Based on such associations, we determined reliable distances for most of the <b>globules</b> of our sample. It turned out that half of the selected <b>globules</b> are located in the local spiral arm at distances between 170 and 400 pc. The most prominent features in the spatial distribution of these <b>globules</b> are the Lindblad ring and the Vela-Gum complex. A group of 14 <b>globules</b> is located at larger distances (0. 7 – 4 kpc) in the Carina arm. The objects i...|$|R

40|$|Eosinophilic <b>globules</b> were {{observed}} in 7 out of 11 cases of pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla.

These findings were very similar to the eosinophilic <b>globules</b> of yolk sac tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and alpha-l-antitrypsin deficiency in light microscopy and histochemistry. They were not stained with Grimelius's method for argyrophil reaction, and Fontana-Masson's method for argentaffin reaction.

25|$|The {{manner in}} which the bolas is swung differ between the three genera. Mastophora holds the bolas {{stationary}} with a front leg until a moth approaches, and then cocks the leg and swings the bolas towards the prey with a rapid pendulum-like stroke. Ordgarius begins to whirl the bolas rapidly when detecting an incoming moth. Cladomelea akermani whirls the bolas immediately after it is prepared for about 15 minutes, even when there is no moth present. Ordgarius sometimes has smaller droplets above the terminal one, whereas the other genera produce only one terminal <b>globule.</b>|$|E
25|$|Superior {{and much}} more {{expensive}} {{is the use of}} interference contrast. Differences in optical density will show up as differences in relief. A nucleus within a cell will actually show up as a <b>globule</b> in the most often used differential interference contrast system according to Georges Nomarski. However, it has to be kept in mind that this is an optical effect, and the relief does not necessarily resemble the true shape. Contrast is very good and the condenser aperture can be used fully open, thereby reducing the depth of field and maximizing resolution.|$|E
25|$|An {{embolism}} is the lodging of an embolus, a blockage-causing {{piece of}} material, inside a blood vessel. The embolus {{may be a}} blood clot (thrombus), a fat <b>globule</b> (fat embolism), a bubble of air or other gas (gas embolism), or foreign material. An embolism can cause partial or total blockage of blood flow in the affected vessel. Such a blockage (a vascular occlusion) may affect {{a part of the}} body distant from where the embolus originated. An embolism in which the embolus is a piece of thrombus is called a thromboembolism. Thrombosis, the process of thrombus formation, often leads to thromboembolism.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and chemistry}} of immiscible silicate glasses in a tholeiite mesostasis from the Umtanum formation, Washington, were investigated with {{transmission electron microscopy}} and analytical electron microscopy (TEM/AEM). TEM observation reveals isolated, dark <b>globules</b> (2. 1 micron or less in diameter) randomly distributed in a transparent matrix glass interstitial to plagioclase laths. The <b>globules</b> less than 0. 3 micron and larger than 0. 8 micron fall beyond the linear relationship defined by the 0. 3 – 0. 8 micron <b>globules</b> in a plot of the logarithm of number versus size.

25|$|The African pompano is a {{schooling}} {{predatory fish}} which takes predominantly {{a variety of}} crustaceans, including decapods, carids and copepods, as well as cephalopods and small fish. They are preyed upon by larger fish, including mackerel and tunas, as well as sharks. The small pelagic juveniles' filamentous dorsal and anal fins resemble jellyfish medusae, and this mimicry may gain them some protection from predators. Little is known of their reproductive habits and maturation lengths, although a study in India determined a peak in the abundance of A. ciliaris larvae in April. The eggs were also found to be spherical, pelagic with a yolk and oil <b>globule</b> present, with the larvae also extensively described in the report. It is thought that in Mexico spawning occurs over sandy substrates in spring.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{often is}} homogenized, a {{treatment}} that prevents a cream layer from separating {{out of the}} milk. The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation. A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than {{a smaller number of}} larger ones, and the original fat <b>globule</b> membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces. Nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new membrane structure. The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the repeatability of morphometric characteristics of counted milk fat <b>globules</b> number of globules/milliliter, average diameter, frequency distribution of <b>globules</b> according to different size analyzed in 3 different phases of lactation (10, 30 and 90 days from parity). Milk samples were taken from 25 Massese ewes homogeneous for age and diet; all the animals came from a single herd located in the province of Pisa (Tuscany). All individual samples were taken from the morning milking and were refrigerated until use, placed in a Burker chamber and observed by fluorescent microscope and image analyzer system. The repeatability of morphometric characteristics of milk fat <b>globules</b> tested in the three phases of lactation was estimated by Pearson's correlations (r) while the average repeatability has been tested across the method of intra-correlation-cl ass. Fat <b>globules</b> tend to change over the course of lactation, and as production progresses, favours an increase in the percentages of small and medium <b>globules</b> and a decreased percentage of the large <b>globules.</b> Only fat <b>globules</b> of 5 - 6 mu m (class 5, 15 % of the total <b>globules)</b> and medium diameter show good repeatability during lactation (0. 41 and 0. 31 respectively) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{crevalle jack}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} at different lengths in males and females, with estimates suggesting males reach maturity at 55cm and {{four to five}} years of age, and females at 66cm and five to six years of age. Reproduction is thought to occur year round in most areas, although there are peaks in activity. South of Florida, this period is between March and September, in Cuba it is April and May, while in Jamaica no definitive peak has yet been identified. The species also has a protracted spawning in Ghana, although a peak in activity occurs between October and January. Juveniles are also present in lagoons year round in this location, indicating year round spawning and recruitment. The place of spawning also appears to be variable, with the act occurring offshore south of Florida, while in Colombia and Belize, they have been observed spawning over inshore reefs and bays. Large aggregations of crevalle jack form prior to spawning, with these schools containing upward of 1000 individuals. Pairs break off from the school to spawn, with one individual turning a much darker color during this exchange. Once spawning has occurred, the pair rejoins the main school. Fecundity in the species has been estimated as up to one million eggs, with these being pelagic, and spherical in shape. They have a diameter of 0.7 to 0.9mm, and contain a pigmented yolk and one yellow oil <b>globule</b> with dark pigments. The larvae have been extensively described in the scientific literature, although the sequence of fin formation is still not well known. Defining features of the larval crevalle jack include a relatively deep body, heavily pigmented head and body, and more detailed meristic characteristics, with flexion occurring at 4 to 5mm in length.|$|E
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is an {{important}} species to commercial fisheries in parts of Asia, and as such has had significant research published on its biology and ecology. All of this information is published in relatively obscure Indian journals and is unavailable to most institutions. The torpedo scad is a predatory fish which both consumes larger prey and filter feeds to consume planktonic organisms. Larger prey items include a variety of fish and cephalopods including squid and cuttlefish. Smaller foods are mostly crustaceans such as shrimps, prawns, stomatopods, cladocerans and crabs. Molluscs and gastropods are also reported to be minor constituents of the diet of the species. The species also appears to have dietary shifts as it grows, however in all size classes fish are the dominant prey. Species recorded as being predators of torpedo scad include species of drums and requiem shark. Each sex of the torpedo scad reach sexual maturity at different lengths; females are mature by 22cm and males by 26.4cm. Other studies have suggested similar lengths, including 17cm in males and 27cm in females, {{as well as an}} average of 25cm in both sexes. Spawning has not been directly observed, however peaks in larval abundance are known from March to July, with a peak in June in India. the eggs are pelagic, and are spherical and transparent with a yolk and single oil <b>globule.</b> The larval stage is extensively described, with the species having 24 myomeres. The growth of the species is not reported, however numerous morphometric (length vs weight) studies have been carried out on the species. The population structure in Indian waters has also been well studied, with the most recent of these suggesting a major recruitment event occurs between May and August. These studies also guide fisheries regulations, with a theoretical maximum yield achieved when fish are only taken once they reach 18cm.|$|E
