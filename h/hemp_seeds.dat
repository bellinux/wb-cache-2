40|$|<b>Hemp</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>hemp</b> <b>seed</b> oil {{can supply}} us with many {{important}} substances. Their {{essential fatty acid}} compositions are favourable, but they may contain non-psychotropic cannabinoids. Emerging data show that these components can influence the health status of the population beneficially. Some data also showed trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol in seed oils, the main psychotropic cannabinoid that is contraindicated. Our aim was to examine cannabinoids and fatty acid composition as well as metal and non-metal element compositions in products, like <b>hemp</b> <b>seed</b> oil and chopped <b>hemp</b> <b>seed</b> capsule. The cannabinoids were separated by thin layer chromatography. Fatty acid composition was determined with gas chromatography, and elements (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Si, Sn, Sr, V, and Zn) were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometric method. Selenium was determined with polarographic analyser. Cannabinoids were not detectable by thin layer chromatography, so <b>hemp</b> <b>seed</b> oil, {{as well as the}} capsule, have no psychotropic adverse effect.

In 1996, we were able to analyze tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in <b>hemp</b> <b>seed</b> oils that are available on the German market. In some cases, we found considerable amounts of THC, and our results were published (3). As part of these studies, 13 people consumed between 40 and 90 mL <b>hemp</b> <b>seed</b> oil in one day. We were still able to detect THC carbonic acid, the main product of THC metabolism, in urine samples from test subjects up to 80 h later.

The inner two fibers of the plant are more woody and typically have industrial applications, such as mulch, animal bedding and litter.

Using raw or heated hemp protein in the diets, the effects of canning (heating) the hemp protein could also be reviewed. Based on results of indirect ELISA robust IgG antibodies were found against all the antigens in both group of cats.
