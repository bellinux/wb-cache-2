50|$|Laser {{coagulation}} {{has been}} used in people with retinopathy caused by sickle cell disease. A 2015 Cochrane review found two clinical trials conducted in the 1980s using three approaches - one single-center trial employed sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation using an argon laser; and in the second, two-center trial focused on <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> coagulation, one center used an argon laser and the other used a xenon arc laser. Based on weak evidence, it appears that laser coagulation may be effective in preventing visual loss and vitreous haemorrhage in this condition but that it does not have an effect on regression of proliferative sickle retinopathy or preventing the development of new vessel growth.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of a chorioretinal anastomosis {{in the setting of}} age-related macular degeneration is known as a sign of poor prognosis. No treatment has proven to be effective. We describe a 71 -year-old female patient presenting with exudative age-related macular degeneration, a chorioretinal anastomosis with two retinal <b>feeder</b> <b>vessels</b> (arteriole and veinule), a serous retinal pigment epithelium detachment, and a suspected early subretinal neovascular membrane. She was treated with ICG-guided laser photocoagulation directed to the hot spot, with treatment-zone enlargement directed to the retinal <b>feeder</b> <b>vessels</b> and followed up for 6 months. Although a second laser treatment for the reperfused subretinal neovascular membrane was needed, the clinical and angiographic end result was beneficial. Visual acuity improved by two lines, the chorioretinal anastomosis was occluded, and the pigment epithelium reattached. Taking into account the low therapeutic success rate described in the literature, we suggest that the specific treatment of the retinal <b>feeder</b> <b>vessels,</b> which to our knowledge has not been described before, may be a valuable treatment option...|$|R

50|$|In January 2016, {{a weekly}} service {{connecting}} Port of Kollam with International Container Transshipment Terminal in Kochi has been started {{in order to}} boost the cashew trade and other businesses in Kollam city and neighbouring places. The first feeder ship from Tanzania with 30 container loads of raw cashew had been docked at Kollam on 6 January 2016. The containers were loaded on the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> from a ship that arrived at Vallarpadam with the consignment from Tanzania. This service is expected to benefit customers as cargo landing in Kollam will ensure better visibility and control over inventory, besides saving cost. Since Kollam Port is the only modern port with all needed facilities in South Kerala, the feeder service will also benefit the traders and businessmen in Trivandrum, Pathanamthitta, Nagercoil, Marthandam and Kanyakumari with low-cost goods transportation and export-import facilities from Kollam Port. The introduction of the shipping facility from Kollam will enable processors to cut costs to some extent. It will also serve to ease congestion on roads.|$|E
40|$|Laser {{photocoagulation}} of the feeder {{vessels of}} age-related macula degeneration (AMD) -related choroidal neovascularization (CNV) membranes {{is a compelling}} treatment modality, one important reason being that the treatment site {{is removed from the}} sensitive fovea in cases of sub- or juxta-foveal CNV. To enhance the energy absorption in a target <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel,</b> an indocyanine green (ICG) dye bolus is injected intravenously, and the 805 nm wavelength diode laser beam is applied when the dye bolus transits the feeder vessel; this tends to reduce concomitant damage to adjacent tissue. Two- and three-dimensional theoretical models using the Pennes bioheat equation were developed to study the temperature distribution in the choroidal <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> and its vicinity during laser photocoagulation. The results indicate that temperature elevation in the target <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> increased by 25 % in dye-enhanced photocoagulation, compared to just photocoagulation alone. The dye bolus also shifts the epicenter of the maximum temperature away from the sensitive sensory retina and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layers and toward the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel.</b> Two dominant factors in temperature elevation of the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> are location of the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> and blood flow velocity through it. <b>Feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> temperature elevation becomes smaller as the distance from the choriocapillaris layer increases. The cooling effect of blood flow through the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> can reduce the temperature elevation by up to 23 % of the maximum. Three-dimensional results have shown the effect of blood flow velocity in the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> on temperature elevation. However, results were limited by computational capacity...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has {{demonstrated}} to significantly modify the natural course of age-related macular degeneration complicated by {{some types of}} choroidal newvessels (CNV), even though multiple treatments are generally required. It has been also observed that the feeder vessels of the CNV become more visible after PDT. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify if PDT followed by <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> treatment (FVT) can reduce the need of repeated PDT sessions. Method: Sixty eyes of 60 patients with predominantly classic CNV were treated with PDT. By means of dynamic scanning laser indocyanine green angiography, a <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> could be detected in 30 eyes (before PDT in 12 eyes, 7 days after PDT in 5 eyes, 30 days after PDT in 13 eyes).

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) is {{major cause of}} blindness in Americans aged 50 years and up. In 2010, {{there were more than}} 2 million cases of AMD in the United States and the National Eye Institute projects that there will be nearly 5. 5 million cases per year by 2050. The more detrimental form of AMD, the “wet” form, is caused by the development of new blood vessels within the macular region of the eye, a condition known as choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Several treatment modalities are available for AMD, however the most common is laser photocoagulation in which the abnormal blood vessels are coagulated using a high intensity laser as a heating source. While this treatment modality is effective, high temperatures within the deep eye tissue can cause unwanted collateral damage. Optimizing this thermal treatment thus amounts to minimizing the duration of treatment such that the abnormal blood vessels are destroyed but damage to other tissues is minimized. One possible extension was also explored in this study which is the injection of highly absorbent dye into the abnormal <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> to improve the laser absorbance. The model used in this study employs a 3 D Cartesian geometry over which Pennes bioheat equation is solved for the temperature profile over a time scale of 1 second. The thermal damage is then analyzed by observing the temperature history in abnormal and healthy tissue with the goal of achieving a cumulative effective number of minutes at 43 oC greater than 80 minutes within the target tissue, the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel,</b> while minimizing the thermal damage elsewhere. Results from the model suggest that after 1 second of laser application, temperatures in the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> rapidly rise to a maximum of 67 oC and temperatures in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) rise to 86 oC. In the hottest section of the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel,</b> that section which is directly exposed {{to the center of the}} laser spot, the desired thermal damage is achieved within 0. 55 s. The model was assessed for sensitivity to thermal properties as well as the absorbance coefficient, μa, in the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> and RPE sections. Results from this analysis suggested a change in temperature of less than 0. 5 % when these parameters were varied within the reasonable limits found in the literature. This suggests good applicability of the results to individual patients. The use of dye to target and improve heat transfer is a novel improvement to the existing photocoagulation process. To assess the efficacy of such a modification, the absorbance coefficient was increased from 4610 m- 1 to 9000 m- 1 to simulate the effect of the dye. The results show very little variation in <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> temperatures suggesting that dye assisted photocoagulation is not a large improvement from the current process. The effect of blood flow velocity was also assessed in this study. As expected, it was found that increasing blood flow velocity shifted the maximum temperature in the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> along the direction of flow and resulted in slightly lower maximum <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> temperatures as the blood cools the <b>feeder</b> <b>vessel</b> by convection. The results of this study suggest that shorter treatment times may be useful in reducing collateral tissue damage, however a treatment time of 1 second is justified as a margin of safety to ensure complete destruction of the desired tissue...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{endogenous}} {{nitric oxide}} (NO) {{in the growth}} and vascularization of a rat carcinosarcoma (P 22) has been investigated. Tumor-bearing animals were treated with (i) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, administered via the drinking water, including NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nonisoform-selective inhibitor, and 2 others that target the inducible (NOS II) enzyme preferenti-ally, namely 1 -amino- 2 -hydroxyguanidine or N-[3 -(aminomethyl) benzyl]acetamidine hydrochloride; or (ii) daily injections (intraperitoneally) of 2 Ru(III) polyaminocarboxylates, AMD 6221 and AMD 6245, {{both of which are}} effective NO scavengers. L-NAME, AMD 6221, and AMD 6245 reduced tumor growth by approximately 60 % to 75 % of control rates. Tumor sections stained with abs to CD- 31 /platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 or NOS III showed that this was associated with a marked reduction (60 %– 77 %) of tumor microvascular densitiy (MVD). Tumors resumed growing promptly when treatment was discontinued, accompanied by partial or complete restoration of MVDs. In contrast, NOS-II selective inhibitors had no effect on tumor growth or vascularization, indicating that both responses require complete blockade of NO production. The results corroborate the view that endogenous NO facilitates tumor development. We suggest that NO deprivation causes tumor <b>feeder</b> <b>vessels</b> to constrict, reducing tumor blood flow. The delivery of oxygen and essential nutrients to the developing tumor is impaired as a consequence, hampering further growth. Normalizing NO levels by withholding treatment causes tumor <b>feeder</b> <b>vessels</b> to dilate, increasing tumor perfusion and reestablishing conditions that allow tumors to begin growing again.

40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com The article by Gwon et al. [1] describes 17 carotid body tumor (CBT) resections, resulting in four patients (23. 5 %) having a postoperative stroke and one case of permanent cranial nerve damage. The article once again shows that CBT surgery {{can be challenging}} because of neurovascular structures that are adjacent to or involved in the tumor. This is particularly true for larger CBTs that encompass the carotid arteries, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that three of four strokes were encountered after resection of a Shamblin III [2] tumor. When considering the very high percentage of postoperative stroke in the reported series, it should be stressed that CBTs are benign and slow-growing tumors in which conservative management should always be considered. Furthermore, the authors state that preoperative embolization of CBT <b>feeder</b> <b>vessels</b> was performed to minimize intraoperative blood loss. Unfortunately, blood loss was not reported and it is therefore unclear whether embolization had indeed contributed to a decrease thereof in comparison to recent literature. Next, the authors conclude that embolization did not reduce the risk of stroke. Whether this statement is justified, considering the careful preoperative planning and subsequent selection bias, is questionable. However, the current data and the series we previously published [3] suggest that a decrease in blood loss might reduce perioperative morbidity.
